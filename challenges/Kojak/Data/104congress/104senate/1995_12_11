Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that is \nimportant to the security of this Nation and certainly to the world \ncommunity, and that is the proliferation of chemical weapons.\n  The widespread use of chemical weapons in world war provided the \nworld with its first glimpse of these agents' destructive powers. I am \ncertain many of us here in the Senate have known someone who served in \nthe First World War who returned to the United States bearing permanent \nscars of his exposure to terrible chemicals such as phosgene and \nmustard gas. If we do not know someone, we have heard of people who \nwere debilitated as a result of these agents.\n  I was with Vice President Gore recently when he talked about his \nuncle, his father's brother, who returned from the First World War \ninjured as a result of chemical weapons. The Vice President indicated \nhow his uncle coughed and suffered from this condition until he died.\n  Thousands of American veterans suffered for years from illnesses, \nlike the Vice President's uncle, because they were exposed to gas. \nThousands more never came home, having died as a result of this. Mr. \nPresident, 80 percent of the gas fatalities in World War I were caused \nby phosgene. This substance damages the lungs, causing a deadly \naccumulation of fluid quickly and it leads to death. Those who do not \ndie from this gas may cough and cough for the rest of their lives.\n  There were stories in the First World War of people who suffered, but \none of the most famous poems of that conflict was written about \npoisonous gas, entitled ``Dulce Et Decorum Est.'' I will not read it \nall, but I will read enough to get the point across.\n  This poem starts by describing marches and worried soldiers. The poet \nbegins the second paragraph by saying:\n\n     Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!--An ecstasy of fumbling,\n     Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\n     But someone still was yelling out and stumbling\n     And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . .\n     Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\n     As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\n     In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\n     He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\n     If in some smothering dreams you too could pace\n     Behind the wagon that we flung him in,\n     And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\n     His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;\n     If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\n     Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\n     Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\n     Of vile, incurable sores on innocent\n           tongues, . . .\n\n  Mr. President, that describes quite well what poisonous gas does to a \nhuman being. But it did not end in World War I. Iran and Iraq have \npoisonous gas. In the 1980's, Iraq used poisonous gas weapons against \nits enemy Iran in the Iran-Iraq war, and launched a campaign of terror \nwith chemical weapons against its own population, the Kurds, in their \nown country.\n  In the words of a Kurdish refugee who survived the bombing of his \nvillage by an Iraqi aircraft, he said:\n\n\n[[Page S18306]]\n\n       The planes dropped bombs. They did not produce a big noise. \n     A yellowish cloud was created and there was a smell of rotten \n     parsley or onions. There were no wounds. People would breathe \n     the smoke, then fall down, and blood would come from their \n     mouths.\n\n  According to a 1988 Foreign Relations Committee report on the Iraqi \nchemical weapons attacks:\n\n       Those who were very close to the bombs died instantly. \n     Those who did not die instantly found it difficult to breathe \n     and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin, and lungs \n     of the villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary \n     blindness. After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and \n     submerged themselves in nearby streams to escape the \n     spreading gas. Many of those who made it to the streams \n     survived. Those who could not run from the growing smell, \n     mostly the very old and the very young, died.\n\n  Since the end of the Persian Gulf war, international inspectors have \ndestroyed over 100,000 gallons of chemical weapons, and over 500,000 \ngallons of precursor chemicals used to produce chemical weapons from \nIraqi stockpiles. That is 10,000 50-gallon drums.\n  While the use of chemical weapons during wartime is both horrifying \nand tragic, even more terrible is the prospect of these weapons being \nused by terrorists to further their aims.\n  The deadly gas attacks that occurred in the Tokyo subways in March \nare a chilling indicator of the potential terrorist threat chemical \nweapons represent. The nerve gas, sarin, was used by the terrorists in \nthe Tokyo incident and it was a relatively low-grade composition of the \ngas. If the terrorists had access to a more concentrated form of the \ngas, their attack could have killed thousands of innocent commuters. We \ncan only imagine the terrible consequences of an attack such as that \noccurring in a U.S. city.\n\n  The potential security threat to the United States and its citizens \nfrom the use of chemical weapons has been a serious concern to both the \ncurrent administration and its predecessors. Negotiations on the terms \nof a chemical weapons treaty began during the Reagan administration, \nand President Bush signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, also called \nthe CWC, in 1993.\n  The Clinton administration continued American support for the treaty, \nand on November 23, 1993, President Clinton submitted the convention to \nthe Senate for ratification. Nevertheless, although the United States \nwas a primary architect of the convention and has signed it along with \n159 other nations, the United States is not yet a member of the \nconvention because the Senate has failed to act to ratify it. The \nconvention must be ratified by 65 nations to come into force. To date, \nonly 42 nations have ratified it.\n  An overwhelming majority of the Senate supports ratification of this \nimportant treaty, but the Senate has been prevented from debating and \nvoting on ratification by the Foreign Relations Committee's failure to \nact on it.\n  I believe the Foreign Relations Committee's failure to act on this \nimportant arms control measure this year is a serious mistake.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is unique among weapons treaties in \nthat it will, when ratified, eliminate an entire class of weapons.\n  The convention bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use \nof chemical weapons by its signatories. It requires the destruction of \nall chemical weapons and production facilities.\n  Under the terms of the convention, the Russians would be required to \ndestroy an estimated 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, including \n32,000 metric tons of nerve agents.\n  The convention also provides the most extensive and intrusive \nverification regime of any arms control treaty, for it permits the \ninspection of both military and commercial chemical facilities. This is \nan important safeguard against commercial facilities being used for \nmilitary production of chemical agents, as was the case in Iraq.\n  To help prevent incidents such as the Tokyo nerve gas attack, the \nconvention requires its members to enact laws criminalizing civilian \nviolations of its terms. Under the convention, member countries would \nhave to pass national level legislation criminalizing the manufacture \nand possession of chemicals by private groups such as the religious \nsect that initiated the subway attack in Japan.\n  I understand the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has \nserious concerns about the verifiability and enforceability of the \nconvention's terms. But I believe the proper way to address these \nconcerns would be to allow the treaty to be fully debated in committee \nand on the Senate floor.\n  If there are concerns about other nations' compliance with the \ntreaty, the answer is not for the United States to abandon it. As a \nmember of the convention, the United States will be better able to \nmonitor compliance.\n  In 1990, the United States and the Soviet Union signed a bilateral \ndestruction agreement calling for each side to destroy its chemical \nstockpiles to a maximum level of 5,000 tons. The United States has been \ndestroying its chemicals in accordance with the agreement, but Russia \nhas not.\n  If the convention comes into force, with both the United States and \nRussia as members, Russia would be legally bound to destroy its \nstockpile completely and accept challenge inspections of both private \nand military chemical facilities.\n  If the United States suspected Russia of violating the terms of the \ntreaty, it could demand a challenge inspection. Within days, \ninternational inspectors could be at the door of suspected facilities \nto check for violations because all signatories of the convention are \nrequired to permit inspections of both known and undeclared chemical \nproduction facilities with little or no warning.\n  Of course, nations must become members of the convention to become \nsubject to its requirements. The CWC is the first treaty that penalizes \ncountries that do not join and rewards those that do.\n  Once the convention comes into force, member countries will \nbe prohibited from exporting certain treaty-controlled chemicals to \nnonmember states. Because businesses that produce goods such as \npharmaceuticals and fertilizers need these chemicals for production, \nthere would be enormous pressure on nonmember governments to join to \ngive their industries access to these chemicals.\n\n  Unfortunately, the convention is not likely to ever come into force \nwithout American leadership. The U.S. commitment to chemical weapons \ndisarmament, as evidenced by our Nation's prominent role in drafting \nthe convention, was fundamental to creating the spirit of cooperation \nthat led to the treaty being signed by so many countries.\n  The U.S. failure to ratify the treaty calls into question our \ncommitment to its goals and threatens to fracture international support \nfor the treaty. If the United States, which holds some of the world's \nlargest stockpiles of chemical weapons, does not ratify the treaty, \nother nations will find little motivation to do so.\n  The United States can no longer afford to delay giving its support to \nimplementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The United States is already bound by law to destroy its chemical \nweapons stockpile by 2004. The Convention would require all other \nmember nations to do the same.\n  Any state that refuses to join the treaty will be isolated and its \naccess to precursor chemicals will be limited. And we have explained \nwhy that is important to the pharmaceutical development of, and the \nsimple construction of, fertilizers.\n  Universal compliance cannot be achieved immediately, but there is no \ndoubt that the convention will slow and reverse the current pace of \nchemical weapons proliferation.\n  And while the CWC cannot prevent every potential threat of terrorist \nchemical attack, it can greatly reduce the threat by halting and \nreversing the proliferation of chemical weapons. If we eliminate \nchemical stockpiles, we eliminate potential terrorist Weapons.\n\n  In addition, we greatly diminish the threat of chemical weapons to \nU.S. troops in future military operations.\n  The Senate must not shy away from taking this important step toward \nthe elimination of all chemical weapons. We should act now to create a \nmore secure present for the country and a more secure future for \ngenerations to come.\n  This is not a partisan issue. In July, 1994, former President Bush \nwrote to Senator Lugar to express his support for the convention. He \nstated.\n\n       This convention clearly serves the best interests of the \n     United States in a world in \n\n[[Page S18307]]\n     which the proliferation and use of chemical weapons is a real and \n     growing threat. United States leadership played a critical \n     role in the successful conclusion of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. United States leadership is required once again \n     to bring this historic agreement into force. I urge the \n     Senate to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to abolishing \n     chemical weapons by promptly giving its advice and consent to \n     ratification.\n\n  And, in a bipartisan show of support for the treaty, the Senate \npassed by voice vote a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for rapid \naction on the convention earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, When I started my statement today, I recalled the \nhorrors and widespread use of chemical weapons in World War I. They \nwere real. They affected people. They killed people. They injured, and \nthey damaged people. In response to those horrors the world community \ndeveloped the Geneva Protocol, which banned the use of chemical \nweapons.\n  However, although the Geneva Protocol was passed in 1925, the U.S. \nSenate did not recommend its ratification until 1975. We must not let \n50 years pass before we act on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to Senator Bingaman for \nbringing to the attention of the Senate last week the matters that were \nheld up in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I also extend my appreciation to the majority leader for working to \nbring these matters to the Senate floor.\n  One of the things that was part of that agreement was that this \ntreaty would be reported to the Senate floor no later than April 22. \nThat is good.\n  I urge the chairman of the committee, however, to schedule action on \nthis convention as soon as possible so that the Senate can vote on this \nquickly and do it without regard to partisanship. It is important that \nwe bring this matter to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Chemical weapons \nare a scourge, and they should be eliminated.\n  I appreciate the patience of the Chair and other Members of the \nSenate for extending me an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask to speak in morning business for \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and \ncertainly not on this issue--but I come to the floor to speak. I would \nprefer if you could allow this Senator 10, and then go back to the \nissue, if you would not mind. Is their objection to that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18305-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18307-S18310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BAN ON MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it would appear that the leadership of \nthe other House is threatening to repeal the ban on military-style \nassault weapons. They promised to hold a vote before the end of the \nyear.\n  According to information from the Speaker's staff, he is apparently \nhoping to sneak the repeal through the House of Representatives in the \nrush to finish business before the Christmas holiday. Although this may \nwork in the House, it will not work in the Senate.\n\n  I wrote this legislation. It was incorporated into the 1994 crime \nbill. It was passed by both the House and the Senate after substantive \nand prolonged debate. It has been in place for just 14 months. It \npassed with bipartisan support. It is my commitment, if this comes to \nthe floor of the Senate, to wage the mother of all filibusters, to keep \nthe Senate in session throughout the holiday break, if necessary, if \nthe attempts to repeal this legislation move forward.\n  This legislation specifically protects legitimate weapons used for \nhunting and recreational purposes. Congress can either side with the \ncitizens of this country who are overwhelming in number who want \nassault weapons off their streets or they can side with the National \nRifle Association whose selfish ``I want it my way'' persists no matter \nwhat. The choice should be clear to all of us.\n  For the purpose of those who are new to the Congress and for those \nwho may have forgotten some of the facts brought out in the debate in \nthe last session, allow me to summarize why this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  First, removing military-style semiautomatic assault weapons has the \nwidespread support of our citizens. A Los Angeles Times national poll \nconducted between October 27 and October 30 of this year showed that 72 \npercent of the American people support maintaining the ban on assault \nweapons. There is bipartisan support for this legislation. Presidents \nReagan, Carter, Ford, and Clinton endorsed this legislation during its \ndebate in 1993. Republican and Democratic elected officials from around \nthe country endorsed it, including Republican mayors Rudolph Giuliani \nof New York and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles. Every major law \nenforcement group in this Nation, groups of both rank and file and law \nenforcement management, oppose the repeal. And groups representing 90 \nmillion Americans have endorsed the ban on assault weapons. These \ninclude physicians who have seen what assault weapons do to human \nflesh, educators who live daily with the militarization of our schools, \nclergy who counsel the victims, victims who have seen their loved ones \ntorn apart, trauma physicians whose emergency rooms look like military \nhospitals, and a strong majority of the American people who say \n``enough is enough'' in this gun-happy country.\n  My home State of California knows all too well the tragedy of assault \nweapons. There are incidents that really led to my resolve to make this \nthe main priority of my legislative agenda in 1993, and I want to go \nthrough them.\n  In 1984, in California, a man by the name of James Huberty walked \ninto a McDonald's in San Ysidro with an Uzi. He killed 21 people \nincluding 5 children; 19 were wounded.\n  In 1989, an unstable drifter, with a weapon modeled after an AK 47, \nwalked into a Stockton schoolyard and, for no reason, fired 106 rounds. \nFive children were killed, 29 were injured.\n  Then on July 1, 1993--and this did it for me--a lone gunman carrying \ntwo Intratec TEC DC-9 semiautomatic weapons, a pistol and 500 rounds of \n9 millimeter ammunition walked into the Pettit & Martin law firm on the \n33d floor of 101 California Street, a Heinz-designed high rise in the \nmiddle of downtown San Francisco. He opened fire. Eight people died, \nsix were wounded.\n  This is the specific action which galvanized it for me. I think the \nAmerican people need to know a little bit more about it and how this \nhappens.\n  These were the weapons he carried. These are the 50-round clips, the \n30-round clips he carried, and so on.\n  This is the gentleman--this is Gian Luigi Ferri. He did not buy these \nweapons in California because California had a law. He went across the \nborder to Nevada and bought them. He died on the stairwell of this \nbuilding. He was only stopped when he was trapped in the stairwell \nbetween floors after an employee pulled the fire alarm and that locked \nall the doors so he could not escape.\n  This is what Pettit & Martin looked like. These are the shattered \nwindows of the office, the bullet holes through the windows--\nindiscriminate shooting. And then we get to the victims. These are a \nfew of the people who died that day. Specifically, Jody Jones-Sposado, \n30 years old. She was the first victim killed by Ferri. She worked part \ntime at a Lafayette, CA, company which organizes corporate conferences. \nShe was just visiting 101 California Street on July 1 to file a \ndeposition. She was shot five times. She left a husband, Steve Sposado \nand a 9-month-old child at the time by the name of Meghan. Both Steve \nand Meghan came back numerous times to testify on behalf of this \nlegislation.\n  This is a young attorney, Jack Berman, 35 years old. He was \nrepresenting Judy Sposado, who lies next to him in the photo, when he \nwas killed by Ferri. He was a young labor lawyer. He was preparing for \nhis first trial. He was about to celebrate his third wedding \nanniversary with his wife Carol just 1 month later. The two have a baby \nboy.\n  This below is Mike Merrill, whose wife and children I have had the \npleasure of meeting. Mike was a vice president of the Trust Co. of the \nWest. He was shot through the glass of his window as he sat at his \ndesk. You can see \n\n[[Page S18308]]\nhis cup of coffee. You can see his computer is still on. Ferri, though, \nshot him. Mike crawled under his desk, and Ferri returned, shot through \nthe desk and killed him.\n  Mike's wife Marilyn and two children, Kristin, 5, and Michael, 3, now \nreside in Alamo, CA, in the dream house that Mike helped to design.\n  Now you know why I feel so strongly about this legislation. There is \na reason why so many, from so many walks of life, have stepped forward \nto lend their support for this legislation. Our police officers, our \nchildren, our family members, are being gunned down by revenge killers, \ndrug dealers, gang members, carrying military-style assault weapons.\n  No question about it. The AK 47 is the gun of choice among gang \nmembers. They are killed on street corners, in high rise office \nbuildings, in front of shopping malls, in fast food restaurants. In the \nlast 15 years, in Los Angeles, 9,000 people have died as a result of \ngangs--9,000 people.\n  Here are a few facts. According to a search of newspapers throughout \nthe country conducted by my office, in the last 7 months, since it was \nrumored that the House would try to repeal the assault weapons ban, \nthere have been 76 incidents involving assault weapons in 25 States in \nwhich 37 adults were killed, 40 were wounded, 7 children were killed, \nand 6 were wounded; 9 police officers were killed including 1 FBI \nagent, and another 3 were wounded.\n  The assault weapon is also the gun of choice if you are going to go \nup against a police officer. If he is carrying a six-shot .38, he does \nnot have a chance.\n\n  In both California and throughout the Nation we are seeing police \nofficers outgunned. Here the assault weapon again gives the edge to the \nperpetrator. No incident better conveys the danger of being a police \nofficer than what happened on November 13, 1994, in San Francisco.\n  This is James Guelff, a 38-year-old San Francisco police officer, an \noutstanding police officer, often the first to the scene of a crime. I \nattended his funeral.\n  He had received a call that there was a man with a gun at an \nintersection. He raced in this squad car to the intersection. He was \narmed with a six-shot service revolver. The gunman that he faced at the \nintersection had more ammunition than the entire compliment of 104 \npolice officers that eventually came to the scene to try to stop him.\n  The only way he was stopped--because he was clad in a Kevlar vest and \na Kevlar hat--was because of the angle of the bullet that was able to \npenetrate him and eventually kill him.\n  I want to read a statement written about this by the commander, \nRichard Cairns, the captain of police, regarding this incident:\n\n       I implore you to do all in your power to stop this attack \n     on the legislation that will save police officers' lives in \n     our country. I am not a person that can be described as an \n     ``antigun'' fanatic. To the contrary, I am a person who \n     believes in the right to bear arms but we do not need assault \n     weapons that are strictly people killers.\n       I have seen firsthand the damage these weapons can inflict, \n     as a 20-year-old soldier in Vietnam . . ., to seeing too many \n     shooting victims on our streets as a San Francisco police \n     officer for 25 years . . ., myself being a shooting victim of \n     a barricaded suspect . . ., and witnessing firsthand the \n     carnage at 101 California and finally, holding Officer James \n     Guelff in my arms trying to keep him alive after he was shot \n     at Pine and Franklin Streets.\n       I must say that I am an outdoorsman, a hunter, I enjoy my \n     trips to the mountains to carry on the great heritage of \n     hunting and camping. But you will find no Uzi's, TEC-9's, AK-\n     47's, or other such weapons of war in my house.\n\n  In February 1995, a rookie police officer by the name of Christy \nLynne Hamilton, a 45-year-old mother of two, just 4 days on the job--\nshe had been voted the rookie of her class--was gunned down by a 17-\nyear-old boy armed with an AR-15 assault weapon.\n  On March 28, 1995, Capt. James Lutz, a 30-year veteran of the \nWaukesha, WI, Police Department died in a hail of bullets from a \nSpringfield M1-A assault rifle when he intercepted two fleeing bank \nrobbers.\n  In November of that same year in Washington, DC, an angry young man \narmed with the same TEC-9 assault pistol took the elevator to the third \nfloor of the Metropolitan Police Department where he shot and killed \nthree police officers.\n  On March 8, 1995, in Chicago, a rookie police officer, Daniel Doffyn, \nwas killed by a known gang member armed with a TEC-9 assault pistol.\n  On April 26, 1995, in Prince Georges County, MD, officer John \nNovabilski was working at a local convenience store as an off-duty \nuniformed security guard when an assailant armed with a MAC-11 assault \npistol shot him 10 times.\n  These and other senseless deaths are chronicled in a report entitled \n``Cops Under Fire,'' prepared by Handgun Control, Inc. This chart, \nfirst of all, shows the number of law enforcement officers killed with \nassault weapons or guns sold with high-capacity magazines from January \n1, 1994, to September 30, 1995. If you look at this, you will see, of \nall the weapons traced, 36 percent were with assault weapons or \nfirearms with high-capacity magazines. Mr. President, 36 percent of the \nofficers killed since January 1, 1994 have been with assault weapons. \nYou cannot tell me this legislation will not make a difference.\n  The report also makes it clear, and this is very interesting, that \nthe bad guys know how to find these weapons. A 1991 survey of 835 \ninmates in 4 States--these are inmates now--found that 35 percent of \nthem reported owning a military-style or semiautomatic rifle, and 53 \npercent of them who were affiliated with gangs reported owning a \nmilitary-style weapon. That is 53 percent of gang-oriented inmates in \nprisons in four States. That should tell us a lot about how these \nweapons are used on the streets.\n  Let me for a moment describe what this legislation actually did and \ndid not do.\n  The law stopped the future manufacture of 19 specific kinds of \nmilitary-style semiautomatic assault weapons. They looked like this. \nAlso, the copycat versions of those weapons.\n  The law specifically protected 670 guns that have legitimate hunting \nand recreational purposes. Each one is listed. It stopped the future \nmanufacture of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices that hold more \nthan 10 rounds. In my view, that is the most important thing.\n  If you have a five-shot revolver, when the individual reloads, you \nhave a chance to get to him and disarm him. If you are carrying 50 \nrounds in a semiautomatic military-style assault weapon, you have no \nchance. Someone could enter this Chamber and wipe out 50 people and you \ncould not get to him to disarm him.\n  In addition, the legislation grandfathered assault weapons \nmanufactured prior to the law's enactment. It exempted sales for law \nenforcement purposes, it required a study by the Attorney General and \nit sunsets after 10 years.\n  So, as you can see, it is moderate, it is reasonably drawn and it is \na fair effort. If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault \nweapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not \ngoing to be the votes for that. This is a moderate law.\n  There is also evidence that the ban is working. Similar State laws, \nwhich have been in place longer, are showing signs of success. In \nMaryland, the ban on assault pistols and high-capacity magazines of \nmore than 20 rounds led to a 55-percent drop in assault pistols \nrecovered by the Baltimore Police Department.\n  In Connecticut, the chief of police of Bridgeport has credited the \nState assault weapons law with reducing assaults with firearms by 30 \npercent.\n  Nationally now, this legislation has only been in effect for 14 \nmonths, but we are beginning to see a decrease in the use of assault \nweapons.\n  In 1993, the year before the ban went into effect, just 19 \nspecifically named assault weapons accounted for 8.2 percent of all \ntraces. In 1994, the year in which the ban became effective, these \ntraces for these 19 weapons fell to 6.3 percent. And since the ban \nbecame effective on September 13, 1994, through the end of last month, \nthe share of traces represented by all assault weapons fell to 4.3 \npercent.\n  Thus, we have seen a decrease in the likelihood that criminals will \nobtain one of these weapons, and one of the very real reasons for that \nis that the price is going up because of the shortage of the weapons. \nSo they are not as easy for a criminal to obtain.\n  The use of these guns to kill police officers has also been \ndecreasing. In \n\n[[Page S18309]]\n1994, when the law was not in effect for most of the year, the Handgun \nControl study found that assault weapons accounted for 41 percent of \npolice gun deaths where the make and model of the weapon were known.\n  In 1995, this proportion has fallen to 28.6 percent, a 30-percent \ndecrease.\n  So cop killings with these weapons are down. Criminals have not \nswitched from killing police with assault weapons to killing them with \nother guns. Police deaths from guns in 1995 are running 16.5 percent \nbelow the 1994 pace.\n  Yet, despite the hard facts, despite the sound reasoning, despite 72 \npercent of the American people wanting to sustain this ban, here we are \nonce again waging the same battle. I am really amazed, and I have to \nask people: What hunter needs an assault weapon to kill a duck when \nmost States limit the number of bullets in a clip to three?\n  What hunter needs an assault weapon to kill a deer when most States \nlimit the number of bullets in a clip to seven, and I think only one \ndoes 10?\n  What target shooter needs a weapon of war to enjoy the sport?\n  Indeed, who besides drug dealers and hit men, revenge seekers and \nlustkillers find any utility in weapons intended to kill as many people \nas possible as quickly as possible? And how on Earth can we turn our \nbacks on law enforcement's leadership and rank and file throughout this \ncountry?\n  So I urge every American to join this crusade. We must prevail. If \nthe issue is raised in the Senate, I promise that the reasons to \npreserve this legislation will be exhaustively detailed for the Record \ntime and time again. I promise that the stories of every victim of an \nassault weapon shooting that we can find will be told on this floor and \nthat the horror that these weapons are bringing to our streets are made \nknown.\n\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that some personal statements \nfrom family members who have lost loved ones to assault weapons gunfire \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Lindsay Hempel, who, as a 15-year-old school sophomore, saw \n     friend, Mark Goodin, murdered:\n       ``I was talking to my mother when a cop walked over to make \n     sure I was ok. As he walked over I heard one of the boys say \n     Mark had died. I asked the man and he said, `Yes, your friend \n     has died. I'm sorry.'\n       ``When I heard that, my stomach dropped. I looked over to \n     Mark and all I saw was a bright yellow bag that they covered \n     him with. The first thing that came to my mind was that I \n     prayed and Mark still died. But then I realized that since I \n     was so sure that he was going to be alright, he is. He's in a \n     place where nothing this terrible can happen.\n       ``Later, I found out that the bullet that killed Mark went \n     through the trunk, through an ice chest and into his back. He \n     died instantly. The gun used was a Yugoslavian assault rifle. \n     The cops told us that we are very lucky that the bullet \n     didn't go through Mark and into Kevin who was sitting in the \n     passenger seat. They were also surprised that all of us are \n     still here today.\n       ``I think that it is really sad that there's a chance that \n     when your kids go out at night, or any time at all, they may \n     never come back. You shouldn't have to even think that that \n     is even possible, but it is.''\n       Margaret A. Ensley, founder of Mothers Against Violence In \n     Schools (MAVIS):\n       ``My son was murdered while he was trying to get an \n     education. Something is wrong when we can no longer view \n     schools as a sanctuary for our children. Maybe your attitudes \n     about gun control would be different if one of your children \n     were hurt or killed by a gun.\n       ``Our children are afraid to go to school, movies, \n     libraries and parks. We must give them back their childhood. \n     We can't if everyone is armed.\n       ``To Senator Dole and others in support of overturning this \n     weapons ban, I say the only thing that makes me a victim of \n     violent crime and not you, is not economics, religion, \n     culture or beliefs. The thing that separates us is \n     circumstance. Don't walk in my shoes before you decide to do \n     the right thing.''\n       Carole Montgomery, on the death of her husband's brother, \n     Theron:\n       ``I am writing this letter to you to show my family's \n     support for the Assault Weapons Ban. My husband's brother was \n     murdered by a crazed gunman who went out and legally bought \n     an assault weapon for the sole purpose of killing. My \n     brother-in-law worked at NBC in New York City.\n       ``He was trying to point this madman out to the police when \n     he made eye contact with his murderer and was shot once in \n     the back. He died four hours later on the operating table. \n     Everyone in New York City has called him a hero, but it is of \n     no solace for the people he left behind.\n       ``We are appalled that Congress is trying to overturn this \n     ban. Theron was murdered a few weeks before the ban went into \n     effect. Had it been in effect, maybe my brother-in-law would \n     still be alive.''\n       Carole Ann Taylor, on the death of her 17 year old son, \n     Willie Browning Brooks IV:\n       ``One bullet fired from that AK-47 struck my son's back, as \n     he opened the screen door to his friend house. Willie dialed \n     911 for help. That call was the last living act he finished, \n     before collapsing from the gunfire.\n       ``Five months short of his eighteenth birthday, one bullet, \n     fired from an AK-47, shattered my whole being. An assault \n     weapon of mass destruction and someone with access to it \n     ended Willie's dream of becoming an adult and a productive \n     citizen in this America we call civilized.\n       ``My last memory of my child, that slips within my dreams, \n     is my son laying on a gurney, eyes half opened and lifeless.\n       ``Why? I ask, as any mother would.\n       ``I ask this 104th Congress, as well as Senator Bob Dole, \n     `Was I in error to raise my son to live in a civilized \n     society or would military training for war have been more \n     appropriate in sustaining his life?' If in fact this is a \n     civilized society, the assault weapon must remain on the ban \n     list.\n       ``I cannot bring the son I loved so much back no matter how \n     long I cry or pray, but I can, in his precious memory, work \n     to save others from gunfire.\n       ``My son Will Browning Brooks looked to me for parental \n     protection and guidance, and as his parent as well as a \n     citizen of the United States, I am looking to you, the 104th \n     Congress, for protection and guidance.\n       ``Willie's death by gunfire is not acceptable to me. Not \n     even one death by gunfire should be acceptable to any of us. \n     These assault weapons have no place in any town, city or \n     state in America.''\n       Kenneth Brondell, Jr. letter to Senator Dole on the death \n     of his sister, Christy Brondell Hamilton, a Los Angeles \n     Police Officer:\n       ``On February 22, 1994, my sister, Los Angeles Police \n     Officer Christy Brondell Hamilton, only four days out of the \n     Police Academy, was shot and killed. She was slain by a 17 \n     year old boy who had first killed his father. The boy called \n     the police to summon them to the scene with the intention of \n     `killing some cops.' He then used his father's Tec-9 Assault \n     Rifle to take his own life.''\n       ``I served in Vietnam. I am a Firefighter and the son of a \n     retired Los Angeles Police Sergeant. I have pictures of \n     direct ancestors who were veterans of the Civil War and World \n     Wars I and II. My family knows what weapons are for and we \n     have used them.\n       ``The notion, however, that anyone who wants to own a war \n     rifle can purchase one and thereby have the ability and even \n     the right to determine who among us should live and who \n     should die is incredible to me.\n       ``Sadly we cannot stop all violence, but the assault \n     weapons ban has made a step toward limiting the access of \n     these tools of war from those who would threaten the safety \n     of us all. The world will be a better place if one more \n     police officer completes his or her watch, if one more \n     commuter has an uneventful ride, and if one more office \n     worker returns home at the end of the day.\n       ``Will the Congress of the United States repeal the assault \n     weapons ban and help turn our cities into the likes of \n     Belfast or Beruit? Our Democratic Government works. Civilians \n     have no need to hold the power of violent insurrection \n     against the United States. From the Civil War to Waco, Texas, \n     our democracy has rebuffed violent overthrow and anarchy. The \n     tools of war only serve to harm those who the government is \n     charged to protect.\n       ``Please save innocent lives. Please spare others the grief \n     that my family has known. Support the ban on assault weapons. \n     One of the lives you save may be someone you love.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, for just a few moments I would like to \nspeak about the budget and the happenings of this weekend on all the \ntalk shows and the Presidential and Vice Presidential messages that \nwere delivered to the American people.\n  I guess I can tell you, Mr. President, while I remain not surprised \nby the message of our President and Vice President, I can tell you that \nI am highly disappointed, for it is they who over the weekend \nthreatened a Government shutdown if they could not get their way with \nthe Federal budget. They would like to argue that it would be the fault \nof the Congress, but it was Congress that sent to the President this \nlast week a budget, and it was the President who vetoed that budget, \nand then sent to the Hill a budget that was not even within the \nagreement that he had struck less than 2 weeks ago. As a result of \nthat, he now proposes for the Congress to reconvene a budget conference \nwith nearly a half a trillion dollars of difference between the White \nHouse and the Congress of the United States.\n  The Washington Post, which is not known for its conservatism, I \nthought made an important observation in an editorial on the 12th when \nthey said the President's latest budget proposal, his third this year--\nin other words, twice he has not been able to get it right--is a \ndisappointment. Even the Washington Post says it ``* * * is a \ndisappointment. It retains the basic weaknesses of the one that he put \nforward in June that it pretends to supplant. Mr. Clinton continues to \nback away from the serious part of driving down the deficit. He tries \nto balance the budget wearing a Santa [Claus] suit, and the simple fact \nis that you can't.''\n  Mr. President, I will tell you that the revelation over the weekend \nthat there might be another $100 billion worth of spending, while the \nAmerican people watch what you say and listen to what Congress says, \nthey happen to fear that kind of Santa Clausism right on the eve of \nChristmas, because they are very fearful that the party that now clings \nto its past underpinnings of being spendaholics can simply not get away \nfrom it.\n  The budget you have sent to us, Mr. President, clearly is reflective \nof the fact that the Democrat Party of America today cannot get away \nfrom the old habits that it had in the past, and that was, the solution \nto every problem was a new Government program and a huge chunk more \nspending of the Federal budget or, more importantly, the money of the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  So, Mr. President, the American people on the eve of Christmas are \nwatching and saying, ``What will the Congress do? What will the \nPresident do? Can they strike a budget agreement this week? Will they \ndevelop a continuing resolution that goes on after Christmas? Will they \nbe able to break with the past and truly begin to reduce the debt and \nthe deficit bringing the Government's budget into balance? Will they \nreally remember that the taxpayers of this country are being taxed more \nthan ever in the history of our country?''\n  And yet, when we work the numbers a little bit, and we find an extra \n$100 billion between now and the year 2002, there appears to be no \nconsideration to apply it to deficit, only to apply it to a Government \nprogram, largely because we have heard nothing but whining and crying \nout of the White House over the last month that we are destroying all \nthese marvelous Federal programs, when in fact none of them is being \ncut; only the rate of increase is being reduced to try to bring the \nbudget into balance.\n  Mr. President, I challenge you to go dry, to take an Alcoholic's \nAnonymous approach to this--in other words, cold turkey it. That is \nwhat the American people are asking for, that you do not keep asking \nfor more and more money, more and more spending, more and more of their \nhard-earned money, but leave it where it is. Come to the table, balance \nthe budget, and start thinking on the positive side of a balanced \nbudget instead of the negative side that somehow some Government \nprogram might be cut.\n  What is the positive side? Well, as you know, Mr. President, there \nare many, many positives. A lot of us have talked about it in the last \nfew days here about the ability of families to have more money to spend \nor to save, about the ability of the economy to grow and have a greater \nlevel of jobs, to see our unemployment rate continue to go down. Mr. \nPresident, I really believe that is what the American people would like \nto hear as a message from Santa Claus on Christmas, is that the budget \nis going to be balanced, that we are going to stay within our spending \nlimits and that what new moneys might be found could be applied to the \ndeficit.\n  So, ho, ho, ho, Mr. President. It is not time to fool the American \npeople with your Santa Claus tactics that somehow you can just keep on \nspending and keep on giving and the world will get a lot better. It \nwill not work unless you make the tough choices, and the tough choices \nare to balance the budget and give the American taxpayers some \nconsideration by a reduction in their overall tax rate.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S18311]]\n\n\n                      KEEPING RECORDS ON CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am interested in the discussion that the \nSenator from California just had on the subject of crime. It reminds me \nagain of the urge to ask all Members of the Senate to consider \ncosponsoring a piece of legislation I introduced last week on this \nissue. The issue of crime is one that concerns every American, and I \nintroduced some legislation dealing with the issue of trying to \nestablish a computer record of all people in this country who commit \nfelonies.\n  It is incredible that we have a circumstance in our country where we \nkeep track of a couple hundred million credit cards, and if you take \none of those credit cards and go to a department store and try to buy a \nshirt, they will run it through a magnetic imager, and in 20 seconds \nthey discover whether the card is good or whether it has reached its \nlimit. If they are able to do that in the private sector on credit with \na couple hundred million credit cards, we ought to be able to, for a \nwhole series of reasons, keep an updated, accurate computer list of \neverybody who has committed felonies in this country. That way, when \njudges sentence somebody, they know who they are sentencing. Did this \nperson commit a crime in Idaho 5 years ago, Montana 2 years ago, North \nDakota last year, and Kansas this year? That is the kind of criminal \nrecord history we ought to have in this country. Regrettably, we do \nnot. We have the NCIC and the III, but 80 percent of the records needed \nto be in up-to-date criminal records files of everybody who committed \nfelonies are not there. It does not take Dick Tracy to figure out who \nis going to commit the next violent crime in our country. In almost \nevery instance, it will be somebody who has previously committed \ncrimes, somebody who has been in the system, and somebody who has been \nin prison--maybe not to prison, but maybe in prison and is now out of \nprison and back on the streets.\n  That is why we need, it seems to me, for law enforcement purposes, \nfor judges, for a whole series of reasons, an updated computer listing \nof everybody in this country who has committed felonies. That ought to \nbe updated every day across the country in order that we might \neffectively combat crime in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18310-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18311-S18312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk just for \na moment about the budget negotiations, not so much to talk about what \nmight or might not happen in the negotiations, but to suggest that this \nis going to be a very important week with respect to the question of \nwhether we are able to make progress in trying to reach two goals--\nfirst, balancing the Federal budget. That is an important goal and it \nis one we ought to reach in the interest of our country. Second, \nbalancing the Federal budget while we meet some of the priorities in \ndoing so. Balancing the Federal budget without injuring the Medicaid or \nMedicare Program, so that someone who is elderly in this country and \nwho is sick will not understand that they have to pay more for Medicare \nand get less as a result of our balancing the budget. We can balance \nthe budget and do it the right way, retaining the priorities in \nMedicare and Medicaid and education and agriculture and the \nenvironment. It does not mean you cannot cut spending in all of those \nareas. It just means you cannot cut spending sufficiently so that you \ninjure these programs at the same time that you have decided in the \nbudget bill to provide a very significant tax cut. That represents the \nquestion of priorities.\n  I want to back up just for a moment and refer to something I read \nyesterday in a newspaper that I thought was an interesting piece. It \nwas written by Jim Hoagland in the Washington Post. I commend Members \nof the Senate to read it; it is called ``Surrender to the Money Men.''\n  He starts out discussing something I have discussed previously on the \nfloor of the Senate--that the stock market in America is at a record \nhigh, corporate profits are at near records in this country, \nproductivity of the American work force is up. We are told the American \neconomy is the most competitive in the world, but while all of these \nthings are happening, wages in America continue to go down, and job \nsecurity in our country continues to be diminished.\n  We hear about downsizing and layoffs, surplusing workers, being more \ncompetitive; we hear about all of those things and then understand that \nit causes an enormous amount of anxiety among American workers because \nthey feel somehow they are now surplus and they are the lost part of \nthis economic equation called ``globalization'' in which in our \neconomic enterprises' interest in being more competitive, they decide \nto produce elsewhere and ship back here. A corporation, international \ncorporation, can become more competitive, they think, by deciding to \nproduce shoes and shirts and belts, or trousers and cars and television \nsets, in foreign countries where labor is very inexpensive and then \nship those back to our country for sale.\n  I understand why big corporations think it is in their interest to do \nso. It is something called profits. If you can get someone to work for \n50 cents an hour and not be bothered by the issue of polluting water \nand polluting air and by the difficulties of the prohibition against \nhiring child labor, if you can get rid of those kinds of meddlesome \ndifficulties by moving and producing offshore, you can make more \nprofits if you can produce offshore and sell here.\n  Well, the result of that kind of strategy has created another kind of \ndeficit in this country that no one is talking about. We are talking \nabout the budget deficit every single day. Already today, I have been \nto two meetings dealing with the budget deficit. I will spend much of \nthis week, I assume, in negotiating sessions with other negotiators \ntalking about the budget deficit.\n  There is not even a whisper in this Chamber or in this Congress about \nthe other deficit, the trade deficit. We will, this year, have a \nmerchandise trade deficit that is larger than our budget deficit. What \ndoes the merchandise trade deficit mean? It means that jobs have left \nour country. It means that our country has an economy that has weakened \nbecause we measure economic progress in this country by what we consume \nrather than what we produce.\n  It seems to me that we ought to start worrying about the twin \ndeficits in our country--the budget deficit and the trade deficit. The \nbudget deficit, one can make the economic argument, is the deficit we \nowe to ourselves but for the fact that it is unequally distributed; it \ncauses problems in that regard. One can make the argument that it does \nnot require a reduced standard of living to pay the budget deficit in \nthis country. You cannot make the similar argument about the trade \ndeficit. Inevitably, repaying the trade deficit will mean a lower \nstandard of living in our country, and that is why this year, we will \nhave the largest merchandise trade deficit in our history, and it is a \nvery serious problem for our country.\n  I hope that at some point soon we start talking here in the Senate \nabout the twin deficits, the budget deficit and the trade deficit. The \ntrade deficit, as I indicated, relates to the budget deficit because \nthere are things in the reconciliation bill here in the Congress that \nwould make it even easier for those who want to move jobs offshore and \nto produce elsewhere and, therefore, it meets our trade deficit or \nmakes it easier to do so.\n  I have shared with my colleagues on another occasion a provision in \nthe so-called Balanced Budget Act in the reconciliation bill. I want to \ndo that again today. It is a small provision that deals with tax law \nand the product called ``deferral,'' deferring income tax obligations \non foreign subsidiaries owned by domestic corporations that earn money \noverseas in their foreign subsidiary and do not have to pay taxes on it \nuntil it is repatriated to our country. Well, in 1993, we passed a law \nthat tightened up on that and said that does not make sense. This is an \nincentive that says let us move the factories overseas and take \nAmerican jobs and move them abroad.\n  What we have now is a provision by the majority party that says, ``By \nthe way, we will take this little provision that is an insidious \nincentive to move jobs overseas by multinational corporations and tell \nthe multinational corporations we like this tax incentive so much, we \nwant to increase it for \n\n[[Page S18312]]\nyou. We want to boost this tax incentive. We want to make it more \ngenerous if you will take your jobs and move them overseas.''\n  I am thinking I ought to have a scavenger hunt to find out who in the \nU.S. Senate decided it was a good idea to propose that multinational \ncorporations ought to have more of a tax incentive for moving their \njobs overseas.\n  I ask any of my colleagues in the next couple of days, as we are \nworking through this reconciliation bill, who authored this? Who \nthought it was a good idea? Who believes we ought to change our Tax \nCode to make it more attractive to move American jobs overseas? Who \nthinks we ought to increase the tax incentive to shut down the American \nplant, move it offshore?\n  It makes no sense to me. This will increase our trade deficit. This \nwill not solve our fiscal policy deficit. This will weaken our country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend from North Dakota would yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was moved by the reference to the increase in trade \ndeficit, and I ask my colleague if he would not agree that nearly half \nof that trade deficit is the cost of imported oil?\n  Obviously, as a Senator from the State producing the most oil from \nthe standpoint of domestic production, would it not be in our national \nenergy security interest to try to relieve our dependence on imported \noil, hence reduce the deficit balance of payment by developing some of \nour resources, if we can do it in a way that is compatible with the \nenvironment and ecology?\n  I am particularly speaking of potential relief that we might find if, \nindeed, there are substantial reserves of oil in the Arctic oil reserve \nas part of ANWR.\n  It would seem to me this would alleviate a concern both the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and I have inasmuch as oil does make up just about \nhalf of our trade deficit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My own view about our oil import situation is that we \nought to have an oil import fee. I have always felt that. I think an \noil import fee solves a series of problems for us. It would stimulate \nmore domestic production, first; reduce the trade deficit, second; and \nprovide revenue by which you eliminate or reduce the fiscal policy \ndeficit as well.\n  The Senator from Alaska has been an articulate and forceful supporter \nof opening ANWR. He and I share one goal, and that is I think we ought \nto reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I would like to start with a \nfirst step of an oil import fee which I have advocated for some long \nwhile. I have authored them, and I have offered them in the House Ways \nand Means committee when I served there. I think that would be a \nproductive first step.\n  In any event, we must, it seems to me, begin addressing this trade \ndeficit. The failure to do so--even if we solve the budget deficit \nproblem--the failure to address the trade deficit problem is going to \nbe a crippling problem for this country.\n  The point I made with this tax provision is--and I am thinking of \nsuggesting we have a rule in the Senate similar to the one they have in \nthe House--that if you propose a provision like this in the budget \nsystem, you have to disclose who it is that is offering this, who \nthinks it makes sense to provide a more generous circumstance in our \nTax Code to say to somebody, ``Move your jobs overseas. Move your plant \nout of here. Hire your workers in a foreign country.'' Who thinks that \nmake sense, to increase a tax subsidy to do that?\n  There ought to be, first of all, no subsidy. We ought to completely \neliminate the insidious tax incentive that exists now to say, ``By the \nway, you have a factory. Close it here. Move the jobs overseas to a tax \nhaven and make the same product. Ship it back here and we will give you \na tax break.''\n  It ought to be completely eliminated. This provision, stuck in the \nreconciliation bill, opens it wider and says, ``By the way, this is a \ngood idea, we should do more of it.''\n  This week, if I can find the Member of the Senate who thinks this is \na good idea, I would like that person to identify himself or herself, \nand I would like to spend a while on the floor debating that. So I \ninvite whoever it is, give me a call, come to the floor and talk about \nthis kind of tax policy and whether it makes sense for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18311-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

He considered what he called the Senate \nfamily--from the most senior cook to the least junior Senator--his \nflock. His approachable manner and generous ways endeared him to us \nall. ``I try never to be in a hurry,'' he said in an interview with the \nHill last year. Everyone responded to this gentle, important courtesy \nin a place where schedules are demanding and often implacable.\n  Kipling wrote of those who ``can talk with kings and keep the common \ntouch.'' Dr. Halverson, in the course of his ministry here, \ndemonstrated that he was capable of this skill, and each of us \nappreciated that when he talked with us, as well as with kings, we were \nelevated by his special attention.\n  He will be in our thoughts and prayers for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18312-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18312-S18313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF GEN. ROBERT L. DeZARN\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, when you've been in public life as long as I \nhave, you see a lot of hard working, dedicated people in public \nservice. But, every once in a while you come into contact with someone \nwhose leadership qualities make them stand out from the rest. The head \nof Kentucky's National Guard, Adj. Gen. Robert L. DeZarn is that kind \nof leader. Over the years, he's been able to instill a sense of common \npurpose, and in doing so, bring out the best possible performance in \neveryone around him. And while we know that he will continue to \ncontribute his talents in other ways, General DeZarn's retirement today \nwill be a tremendous loss to those under his command and to the State \nas a whole.\n  It's been said that ``a general is as good or as bad as the troops \nunder his command make him.'' There is no doubt that Kentucky's \nNational Guard will continue to make Kentucky and the Nation proud long \nafter General DeZarn steps down. But, anyone who knows the Adjutant \nGeneral also knows that he brought to his command an uncommon blend of \ncourage, intelligence and compassion that will be sorely missed.\n  Over the past 4 years, as the Kentucky Guard was called upon to \nrespond to natural disasters or as our Nation sought them out to help \nease discord around the world, I always knew that General DeZarn was \nworking behind the scenes to assure order, to assure total commitment, \nand in the end, to assure victory over adversity.\n\n[[Page S18313]]\n\n  He was equally hard at work when the media's eye was not on the \nGuard, building upon Kentucky's resources to assure we would play an \nintegral role in national security well into the next century. I owe \nhim much for his assistance in making sure the C-130H's, what I often \ncall the thoroughbreds of military aviation, stayed in Kentucky. Our \nAir Guard's performance at the controls of those C-130H's in Somalia, \nBosnia, and Rwanda have brought them national recognition, and saved \ncountless lives.\n  In addition, his development of the western Kentucky training site \nwill make it a model of high-tech and all-terrain training for both \nGuard and active duty soldiers for years to come. Last year, 16,000 \nsoldiers trained here. But, those numbers represent just the beginning \nin a long line of soldiers who will receive the best training this \ncountry has to offer. The skills they learn right in Kentucky will \nenable them to join the ranks of the best-trained military force in the \nworld.\n  General DeZarn has also had a tremendous impact on the national \nlevel. The Department of Defense has been working to restructure the \nNation's entire defense forces to better respond to the needs of the \npost-cold war era. General DeZarn has worked closely with his \ncolleagues from other States to assure that the National Guard \ncontinues to play an integral and undiminished role in that new \nstructure.\n  Mr. President, let me close by reiterating my thanks to General \nDeZarn for a job well done, and my appreciation for having had the \nhonor to serve with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18312-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last month the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Stevens, led a delegation of our colleagues--\nSenators Inouye, Glenn, Bingaman, Hutchison, Snowe, and Thomas--to \nEurope to carefully evaluate the plans for a possible NATO mission to \nthe former Yugoslavia. The result of their travels to Brussels, \nSarajevo, and Zagreb are contained in a report, for which I ask \nunanimous consent to be printed in the Record.\n  This report addresses the four central questions of the Bosnian NATO \nmission--how soon, how many, how long, and how much. As for cost, \nofficials admitted that it will mount to $2.0 billion--not including \nthe costs of the no-fly zone or enforcing the naval embargo in the \nAdriatic. With respect to how long, that remains a question that this \nChamber will have to address as no one presented the codel with an \neffective exit strategy for NATO forces.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank the Members and \nstaff of codel Stevens. Their fine work on a timely and important \nreport will help further illuminate our upcoming debate on Bosnia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: Last month, you authorized myself and Senators \n     Hutchison, Snowe and Thomas to travel to NATO, Bosnia and \n     Croatia to evaluate plans for a possible NATO mission to the \n     former Yugoslavia.\n       The seven Senators who participated in this mission have \n     prepared the attached report, which addresses the four \n     central questions that you directed we study: how soon, how \n     many, how long and how much.\n       We did not seek to reach any conclusions or specific \n     recommendations to you or the Senate--our personal views \n     reflected the wide range of positions held by our colleagues. \n     We did seek to identify the many differing expectations and \n     understandings that are held by the parties that will be \n     involved in the peace settlement in Bosnia.\n       It is my request that the attached report be printed and \n     made available to all Senators, to assist in their \n     understanding and our upcoming debate and consideration of \n     any resolution concerning U.S. participation in a Peace \n     Implementation Force.\n           Cordially,\n                                                      Ted Stevens.\n\n                              Codel Report\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The Delegation was authorized by the Majority Leader and \n     the Democratic Leader to travel to Europe, particularly \n     Bosnia, to evaluate the current situation in the former \n     Yugoslavia, the status of the peace negotiations, and \n     potential plans by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) and the United States European Command (EUCOM) to \n     engage in a military mission to implement a peace settlement. \n     The Delegation was to assess these conditions, and report \n     their findings to the Senate.\n       This report does not attempt to reach any conclusion about \n     the outcome of the on-going peace negotiations, which resumed \n     this month at Wright-Patterson AFB. The Delegation did not \n     seek to reach a consensus or make specific recommendations on \n     the military plans under consideration at EUCOM and NATO \n     Headquarters in Belgium. The Delegation hopes their mission \n     will contribute to planned Senate hearings and subsequent \n     consideration of any proposals for United States \n     participation in any peace settlement in Bosnia.\n       The Delegation report consists of the following sections:\n       (1) Listing of the Delegation\n       (2) Listing of Delegation activities\n       (3) Assessment of the situation in Bosnia\n       (4) Expectations for a potential peace agreement\n       (5) Plans/expectations for NATO peace implementation \n     activities\n       (6) Closing observations\n\n\n                       listing of the delegation\n\n       Senator Ted Stevens--Committee on Appropriations \n     (Chairman).\n       Senator Dan Inouye--Committee on Appropriations (Co-\n     Chairman).\n       Senator John Glenn--Committee on Armed Services.\n       Senator Jeff Bingaman--Committee on Armed Services.\n       Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison--Committee on Armed Services.\n       Senator Olympia Snowe--Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       Senator Craig Thomas--Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                    listing of delegation activities\n\n                   U.S. European Command Headquarters\n\n       The Delegation met with the following senior U.S. military \n     officials:\n       General George Joulwan; Supreme Allied Commander, Europe\n       Admiral Leighton Smith; Commander, Allied Forces South\n       General James Jamerson; Deputy Commander, U.S. European \n     Command\n       General William Crouch; Commander, U.S. Army Europe\n       General Richard Hawley; Commander, U.S. Air Force Europe\n       Major General Edward Metz\n\n                         Government of Croatia\n\n       The Delegation met with the Minister of Defense for \n     Croatia, Gojko Susak.\n\n                        United Nations officials\n\n       In Zagreb, Croatia, the Delegation met with the Senior \n     Representative of the Secretary General of the United \n     Nations, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, and the Deputy Commander of U.N. \n     forces in the former Yugoslavia, Canadian Major General Barry \n     Ashton.\n       In Sarajevo, Bosnia, the Delegation met with the Commander \n     of U.N. forces in Bosnia, United Kingdom Major General Rupert \n     Smith.\n\n                          Government of Bosnia\n\n       The Delegation met with the President of Bosnia, Alija \n     Izetbegovic, the Vice President, Ejup Ganic and Prime \n     Minister, Haris Sladjzic.\n\n            North Atlantic Treaty Organization Headquarters\n\n       The Delegation met with the following senior NATO leaders: \n     Field Marshal Faye Vincent, Chairman of the Military \n     Committee, Mr. Willy Claes, Secretary General of NATO, The \n     North Atlantic Council--Ambassadors to NATO from: Spain, \n     Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Luxembourg, Portugal, \n     Italy, Turkey, Iceland, Denmark, Greece, France, Belgium, \n     Netherlands, Canada and the United States.\n       The Delegation also wishes to express its appreciation for \n     the support and assistance of the United States Embassy to \n     Croatia, the United States Embassy to Bosnia and the United \n     States Mission to NATO. Ambassadors Galbraith, Menzies and \n     Hunter all contributed significantly to the success of the \n     mission, and their individual actions and leadership are no \n     small part of the progress made so far towards a peace \n     settlement in Bosnia.\n\n\n             assessment of the current situation in bosnia\n\n       At each venue, the strong statement to the Delegation was \n     that the anticipated peace \n\n[[Page S18314]]\n     negotiations in the United States offered the best likelihood of a \n     serious cessation of hostilities. Without exception, leaders \n     at NATO, in Croatia, in Boania and U.N. officials all cited \n     the involvement of the United States as a catalyst for peace.\n       At the time of the Delegation's mission, the current cease \n     fire agreement was only a few days old. While conditions in \n     and around Sarajevo were significantly improved, according to \n     Bosnian and U.N. officials, fighting continued elsewhere in \n     Bosnia. While all parties hoped that the cease fire would \n     take hold throughout the country, fighting in northwest \n     Bosnia was especially active.\n       For nearly six months preceding the Delegation's visit, \n     Sarajevo had been completely strangled. The airport had been \n     closed to all traffic, and the only road access route crossed \n     Mt. Igman. With the ceasefire, humanitarian conditions \n     appeared to be improving. Local officials reported that \n     utility services were being restored, and that food stocks in \n     the city were higher. The Delegation observed large numbers \n     of commercial trucks assembling in a convoy to exit the city. \n     Despite these factors, the airlift of food supplies \n     continued, to provide for the needs of local residents, and \n     to maintain air access into the city.\n       Perhaps the most striking feature of Sarajevo, amid the \n     destruction and devastation of incessant shelling and rocket \n     attacks, was the utilization of the Olympic facilities as \n     gravesites for thousands of Bosnians who have died during the \n     fighting. Their graves serve as a poignant reminder that \n     peace will be difficult to achieve, and that the personal \n     loss of people on all sides of the conflict is severe.\n\n\n              expectations for a potential peace agreement\n\n       The Delegation explored the expectations of two of the \n     potential participants in a Balkan peace agreement during the \n     mission. Key factors included the probable timetable for an \n     agreement; the timetable for any implementation or peace \n     enforcement mission; the objectives of any peace enforcement \n     mission; the rules of engagement for any peace enforcement \n     mission; and the criteria for the duration or conclusion of a \n     peace enforcement mission. The following description \n     summarize the views encountered by the delegation during the \n     mission.\n       Bosnian Government: Officials of the government of Bosnia \n     made clear that any price agreement required the \n     participation of the United States in the negotiation and \n     implementation phases. From their point of view, the United \n     States brought credibility to an agreement beyond the \n     involvement of the United Nations or the European members of \n     the Contact Group (the United Kingdom, France, Germany and \n     Russia).\n       Very clearly, the Bosnian government anticipated that U.S. \n     and NATO military units will serve to enforce the peace, and \n     to protect both the internal and external borders determined \n     in the peace settlement. Further, officials also cited the \n     tremendous refugee and displaced persons dilemma facing \n     Bosnia. One official also suggested the possible use of \n     United States forces to reconcile the property claims of \n     Bosnians displaced during the war.\n       The Bosnian government understood that U.S. and NATO forces \n     engaged in a potential peace enforcement mission would be \n     heavily armed, and would operate under robust rules of \n     engagement. Bosnian government leaders anticipated a presence \n     for such a force of at least 12 months, and from that point \n     of view, up to 18 to 24 months.\n       Croatian Government: Officials of the government of Croatia \n     made clear that the enforcement of a peace agreement would \n     have to rest outside of the U.N. framework currently in \n     place. Their concept was for the potential U.S.-NATO mission \n     to operate to separate the warring factions, acting as a \n     buffer to achieve a stable military environment.\n       The Croatian government officials did not believe that the \n     peace enforcement mission could be completed in twelve \n     months. A key factor in the duration and success of the peace \n     enforcement mission would be the extent to which the Bosnian \n     government achieves an enhanced military capability. The \n     Croatian defense Minister indicated that a peace settlement \n     was likely to bring an end to the U.N. arms embargo, but that \n     there was no need to arm the Bosnians after a peace plan is \n     adopted. Croatia may not permit future weapons transfers \n     through Croatia to Bosnia government forces following a \n     negotiated peace settlement.\n       The Croatian government officials commented that Croatian \n     national interests may or may not be fully addressed in the \n     anticipated peace agreement. The status of the region of \n     Eastern Slavonia will be a contention issue at the peace \n     talks, and could precipitate further military action by \n     Croatian forces.\n       United Nations: The Secretary General's Senior \n     Representative made clear that a peace agreement will be \n     difficult to maintain and enforce, based on the track record \n     of all parties. Much credit was given to the renewed \n     negotiations for achieving the present tentative cease fire, \n     and the necessity of continued United States involvement in \n     any future negotiations was emphasized.\n       U.N. officials stated that the current peace plans will \n     require long-term peacekeeping activities to bring a period \n     of stability to the region. They envision an on-going United \n     Nations role, following the potential NATO-U.S. peace \n     enforcement mission. The experience of the United Nations in \n     the peacekeeping and reconstruction of Cambodia was cited as \n     a possible model for participation in Bosnia.\n       NATO: Officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     headquarters in Brussels reflected primarily the \n     understanding of United States officials about the \n     prospective peace agreement. As NATO is not a direct \n     participant in these talks, they indicated they would await \n     insight from the U.S.-European Contact Group before \n     finalizing any NATO position.\n       NATO representatives made clear their expectation that any \n     peace agreement would hinge on an enforcement mechanism \n     involving NATO and the United States. In the discussion with \n     the North Atlantic Council, several Ambassadors made explicit \n     their view that the United States must participate in the \n     peace process, and that NATO involvement would be contingent \n     on U.S. participation. The consensus of the NATO Ambassadors \n     was that the United States was already involved and committed \n     to the potential deployment of a NATO peace enforcement \n     mission to Bosnia.\n\n\n           expectations for a nato peace implementation force\n\n       Senior officers of the United States European Command, and \n     component units, discussed in depth the planning underway for \n     the training, organization and potential deployment of United \n     States military forces as the largest single component of a \n     NATO force. Many of the specific details were presented to \n     the Delegation at the Secret or Top Secret classification \n     level. The summary provided in this report does not reflect \n     any classified information, but explains the approach and \n     concerns presented to the delegation by these officials.\n       Significance of the Peace Agreement Details: All military \n     officials made clear that exact planning for any operation \n     will hinge on the specific determinations of the anticipated \n     peace agreement. Those factors include the location of U.S. \n     forces deployed to Bosnia, the composition of any U.S. \n     military force, the interaction of U.S. military forces with \n     the United Nations or non-governmental reconstruction \n     organizations, the conditions under which U.S. military \n     forces deploy to Bosnia and the conditions and timing under \n     which U.S. military forces would withdraw from Bosnia.\n       These uncertainties made difficult specific estimates on \n     force size, mission cost and mission duration.\n       United Nations forces now deployed to the former Yugoslavia \n     will constitute some portion of the NATO led peace \n     implementation force. The attached chart details current \n     deployments.\n       Once the peace enforcement mission begins, forces provided \n     to UNPROFOR by NATO member nations will revert to NATO \n     command and control, pursuant to NATO procedures. Military \n     forces from other nations may remain as part of a \n     complementary United Nations effort elsewhere in the former \n     Yugoslavia, or may be incorporated into the NATO force, \n     accepting NATO command and operational management. This \n     approach may come to resemble relationships established \n     during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.\n       All parties had differing specific expectations about the \n     mission for the NATO peace implementation force. Those \n     differing views highlighted the significant challenge facing \n     the negotiations at upcoming peace talks in the United \n     States.\n       Mission expectations fall in the following categories:\n       Implementation of Peace Agreement: NATO and U.S. officials \n     anticipate that an agreement will detail the role for the \n     peace implementation force. This could include geographic \n     zones of responsibility and whatever functions are ultimately \n     determined by the parties and the Contact Group.\n       Separation of Forces: In discussions with the Delegation, \n     NATO officials indicated that the NATO force will provide a \n     buffer between the armed forces of the Combatants. This \n     concept would entail an occupation of specific areas, and a \n     responsibility to police the military activities of the \n     combatants.\n       Secure Borders. Some parties indicated that the NATO force \n     would serve as a protection force, to maintain the \n     territorial integrity of parties to the settlement reached in \n     the peace negotiations.\n       Displaced Persons/Property: On a more complex level, there \n     were suggestions to the delegation that the implementation \n     force would play a role in assisting the return of displaced \n     persons to areas determined by the peace settlement, and \n     potentially enforce the return of property belonging to \n     displaced persons.\n       U. S. EUCOM officials expressed concern about taking on any \n     functions or responsibilities beyond their direct role as a \n     peace implementation force--such as election monitoring, \n     refugee resettlement or other initiatives related to nation-\n     building.\n\n\n       composition and size of a nato peace implementation force\n\n       The ultimate composition of the NATO peace implementation \n     force will reflect the ``proportionate contribution'' of NATO \n     members, according to officials in Brussels. Those nations \n     with troops currently deployed will most likely sustain that \n     presence. Other nations will nominate forces based on the \n     plans developed by the Supreme Allied Command, reflecting the \n     capabilities available in those national military forces. The \n     attached chart reflects anticipated force levels.\n     \n[[Page S18315]]\n\n       The United States, France and the United Kingdom each \n     anticipate providing roughly a division sized combat force. \n     Each nation will tailor that force to reflect the specific \n     geographic and ethnic characteristics of the region in which \n     they will operate. Other nation's will contribute units \n     ranging from company to battalion size, based on mission \n     requirements.\n       For the United States, the call-up of approximately 1,500 \n     to 2,000 reserve component personnel is likely. These units \n     will participate primarily in combat support, service \n     support, medical, civil affairs and military police \n     functions. The reserve components have been heavily taxed \n     over the past three years supporting U.N. and humanitarian \n     relief missions in Rwanda, Somalia, Haiti and now Bosnia. Air \n     Force Reserve and Air National Guard units are an essential \n     element of the on-going airlift to support the Bosnian \n     people.\n\n\n                             COST ESTIMATES\n\n       Officials at the U.S. European Command were unable to \n     provide any specific estimate on the cost of U.S. operations. \n     Discussions with senior officials at the Department of \n     Defense indicate that the likely incremental cost for fiscal \n     year 1996 of the ground force component of a NATO peace \n     implementation force will total approximately $1.5 to $2.0 \n     billion. This amount does not address the costs of the on-\n     going ``no fly'' enforcement mission or the naval embargo in \n     the Adriatic Sea.\n       More detailed estimates are expected upon completion of the \n     peace agreement, and the finalization of NATO operational \n     plans.\n\n\n                   TIMETABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEPLOYMENT\n\n       Officials at the U.S. European Command estimated that NATO \n     force would be tasked to deploy to Bosnia and Croatia within \n     96 hours of the formal adoption of a peace settlement. What \n     will constitute the ``formal adoption'' of an agreement is \n     not yet known. NATO leaders concurred with this estimate.\n       NATO leaders had not yet defined what mechanism would \n     trigger the Alliance's participation in the mission, and the \n     timetable for consideration by the North Atlantic Council of \n     a request for NATO involvement. NATO officials anticipated \n     that the military mission would be predicated on a United \n     Nations Security Council resolution, authorizing such a \n     mission pursuant to Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter.\n       NATO officials did not articulate the mechanism by which \n     individual nations would determine and affirm their \n     participation in the mission.\n\n\n                COMMAND AND CONTROL/RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\n       Central to the role of U.S. military forces in a deployment \n     to Bosnia will be the command relationships and the rules of \n     engagement that would govern their participation. In every \n     discussion, the Delegation found that all parties believed \n     the utilization of NATO would obviate the problems \n     encountered by the United Nations command structure. The \n     flawed ``dual-key'' control by the United Nations of military \n     force limited the usefulness of that force, and caused all \n     the combattant parties to doubt and mistrust the commitment \n     of the United Nations to securing peace in Bosnia.\n       U.S. military officials stated categorically that U.S. \n     forces would serve under the command of U.S. military \n     officers through the NATO chain of command. They affirmed \n     that the rules of engagement will provide wide latitude to \n     respond with disproportionate force to any attack or threat \n     to U.S. or NATO personnel.\n       Less clear is how those rules of engagement will deal with \n     threats to local populations, whether Bosnian Muslim, Croat \n     or Serb, by any military, guerilla or terrorist force. Again, \n     the peace agreement is expected to provide guidance on the \n     role of the military peace implementation force, and how they \n     might respond to such situations.\n\n\n                    PARTICIPATION OF NON-NATO FORCES\n\n       A point of sensitivity and uncertainty in discussions with \n     U.S. military, NATO, Bosnian and Croat leaders was the \n     participation of non-NATO military units in a peace \n     implementation force. This applied both to the potential role \n     for Islamic nations and Russia.\n       NATO leaders believed that the inclusion of Russian \n     military forces would contribute to the stability and likely \n     success of the mission. Officials in Croatia and Bosnia \n     believe that the Serb parties will insist on a Russian \n     presence. U.S. military officials stated that on-going \n     discussions with the Russian military were addressing \n     command, control and funding issues associated with any \n     Russian participation. U.S. officials anticipated that each \n     participant in the NATO-led peace enforcement mission would \n     pay their own costs. Again, this issue is expected to be \n     addressed in the anticipated peace settlement.\n\n\n                          CLOSING OBSERVATIONS\n\n       While reaching no conclusion about what action the Senate \n     might take regarding the potential deployment of U.S. \n     military forces to Bosnia as part of a NATO peace \n     implementation force, the Delegation believes that several \n     critical and vital issues must be resolved before a full and \n     complete understanding of the mission can be reached.\n       From the perspective of the use of U.S. military units, the \n     following issues must be addressed:\n       (1) The end state or ``exit strategy'' for U.S. forces.\n       (2) Funding for U.S. operational costs.\n       (3) Funding for non-NATO participants.\n       (4) Demarcation of U.S. and allied zones of deployment.\n       (5) Composition of U.S. and allied military forces.\n       (6) Logistics support for U.S. and allied military forces.\n       (7) Transit/air access in Bosnia.\n       (8) Air defense responsibilities.\n       (9) Transition for current U.N. mission to NATO control.\n       (10) Rules of engagement.\n       (11) Transition to civilian aid/recovery program.\n       (12) Specific tasks U.S. forces will perform.\n       These outstanding issues are not intended to negatively \n     reflect the discussions and meeting by the Delegation--they \n     simply represent the unknown factors surrounding this \n     mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18313-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. I will share with my colleagues a \nlittle known fact concerning the effect of the Clinton administration's \nnew proposed 7-year balanced budget and the effect it will have for \nthousands of working men and women in Western States, those men and \nwomen working specifically in the mining industry.\n  This is a $1 billion budget bombshell that will cost thousands of \ndomestic jobs, and it will increase our domestic balance of payments, \nbecause buried in the details of the Clinton budget alternative is a \nprovision that would hike taxes on many mining operations on Federal \nland.\n  The administration is proposing an elimination of the percentage \ndepletion allowance for nonfuel minerals mined on public lands where \nmining rights were obtained by the patent process. ``Patent process'' \ncan be construed to mean patents, as well as the process of applying \nfor a patent.\n  This is extraordinarily far reaching, Mr. President. According to the \nadministration, this would save--they use the word ``save''--$954 \nmillion over 10 years, placing a $1 billion burden on our Nation's \nminers.\n  You can imagine the significance of trying to be competitive in a \nworld market, suddenly faced with a reality of losing the depletion \nallowance, which in many cases allows our mining industry to be \ncompetitive internationally.\n  Why the White House has singled out the mining industry for \npunishment is anyone's guess. It appears to be the latest assault by \nSecretary Babbitt, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Clinton \nadministration on the West.\n  The administration seems to want to paint the miners as some kind of \ncorporate guru, the exception rather than the rule as far as the \nreality is concerned, because many of the operations are small mom-and-\npop operations that are clearly in jeopardy by this proposal.\n  It would provide a war on hard-working people and their jobs. Why \nthey are singled out as the only industry for termination, one can only \nspeculate.\n  Oil, gas and coal jobs are not put in jeopardy by this move by the \nadministration to lose the depletion allowance. However, one should \nreflect on the fact that this may be the camel's nose under the tent. \nIt is only a matter of time until this administration will again use \nthe Tax Code to go after oil and gas and the coal industry.\n  Having heard my friend from North Dakota express his concern over the \ndeficit balance of payments, I again remind the President and my \ncolleagues, this Nation grew strong on the development of our natural \nresources, our oil, our coal, our gas, our timbering industry, our \nmining industry, our grazing industry. All these appear to be put in \njeopardy. In fact, the development of resources from all public lands \nappears to be on the administration's blacklist. \n\n[[Page S18316]]\n\n  The rationale of how they could see the tremendous decline in these \nhigh-paying blue collar jobs and the reality that they seem to think it \nis better to import is beyond me. That is specifically exporting our \ndollars and our jobs overseas.\n  I remind our colleagues, the hard rock mining industry provides \napproximately 120,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. This \nproposal of the administration could eliminate 60,000 to 70,000 jobs. \nIt is shortsighted and, once again, the White House seems to be proving \nit really does not care about the men and women working in America's \nresource industries. When we import more minerals, again, we are \nexporting jobs and exporting dollars. Unfortunately, the administration \nseems to be putting politics before policy. It may look good in the \npress but it would simply destroy America's mining industry by putting \na billion-dollar burden on their backs and still expect them to be \ncompetitive internationally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18315-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE FOREST SERVICE GRINCH STEALING CHRISTMAS IN ALASKA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have one more short statement \nrelative to another policy of the administration. I want to speak \nbriefly on an issue that affects my home State of Alaska. It is coming \nto a head during this holiday season, but unfortunately, unless there \nis a legislative solution the problem will not end with Christmas but \nit will be a gift that will keep on giving throughout the year 1996.\n  The gift is the policies that promote unemployment. The bearer of \nthis unwelcome present seems to be the U.S. Forest Service. In fact, it \nis not too strong to say that in the small community of Wrangell, AK, a \ntown I once lived in, the U.S. Forest Service is truly becoming the \nGrinch that stole Christmas and is stealing the hopes and dreams of \nmany of the people in that community.\n  The Forest Service, under the Clinton administration, has canceled \nthe contract that provided timber to the town's only year-round \nindustry, a small sawmill. The Service has also been unresponsive in \nputting up independent sales to permit the sawmill to operate. For that \nreason, the timber industry in southeastern Alaska, an industry \ndependent upon wood from the Nation's largest national forest, the 17-\nmillion-acre Tongass National Forest, is being destroyed.\n  People live in the forest. Unlike in many areas where you have State \nand private timber, in our part of the country, towns such as \nKetchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, and so forth, are all in the \nforest.\n  We have the situation, since the Clinton administration came to power \nmore than 3 years ago, that more than 1,100 direct logging jobs have \nbeen lost, cutting timber employment by 42 percent. Environmental \ngroups earlier this year claimed loudly that the economy in \nsoutheastern Alaska did not need a timber industry, that everything was \ndoing fine. They should tell the folks back in Wrangell, that 2,500 \npopulation town. The local newspaper a week ago filed for bankruptcy. \nThis would end a continuous publication, for 93 years, of the Wrangell \nSentinel, the longest continually published newspaper in our State. The \npaper is only the latest victim of the revenue loss caused for all \nbusinesses when the sawmill closed, costing more than 200 jobs in the \ncommunity.\n  Besides the newspaper, there have been jobs lost in the machine shop, \nthe transportation company, the markets, even the fixture of the \ncommunity bar, the Stikine Bar. The unthinkable has happened. The bar \nis shut down, putting 12 people out of work.\n  This is the real result of the shortsighted Forest Service policies. \nThese are not policies that will help the environment. According to the \nForest Service draft of a revised Tongass Land Management Plan in 1993, \nenough timber could have been cut in southeast to keep all these people \nworking with little effect, if any, on the environment. We are only \nseeking to harvest just 10 percent of the Tongass over a 100-year \nregrowth cycle, while nearly half the forest old growth is fully \nprotected. Alaskans are seeking just to log 1.7 million acres of that \nforest--while nearly 7 million acres are fully protected in wilderness \nor other restricted areas.\n  We are currently working on a temporary fix that may help Wrangell \nand other southeast towns that depend on timber to have a hope of a \nbrighter future. Hopefully, Congress will approve the fix and I pray \nthat the President will sign it in the Interior appropriations bill \nlater this week.\n  It will present a hope during the holidays for the thousands whose \nfuture depends on some level of logging in southeastern Alaska in the \nTongass.\n  But the real solution, if residents of southeastern Alaska are to \ndream of brighter days ahead, is for the Clinton administration to \nbegin to think about the real pain they are causing real people in my \nState and to permit a rational, environmentally sound logging policy to \nresume in the Tongass National Forest. Logging is a renewable resource \nif properly managed. I remind the Forest Service that they said this \nset of circumstances would never happen; they would be able to maintain \na modest supply of timber to allow the industry to sustain itself. That \nhas not happened.\n  If the Forest Service insists on stealing the Christmas of the people \nin Wrangell, and other towns in 1995, then in 1996 a bill that I have \nbeen working on all year with Senator Stevens and Representative Young \nto honor the terms of the 1990 compromise over logging in the Tongass \nis going to be back before this body. It is a present I intend to \ndeliver to Alaskans before another Christmas passes.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the time allotted me. I wish the \nPresident a good day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18316-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18316-S18333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold we are returning \nto Senate Joint Resolution 31.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is what I wish to speak to, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we have had some discussion this morning, we will have \nsome more discussions this afternoon, and some discussion tomorrow as \nwell, on a constitutional amendment to protect the flag.\n  Nothing symbolizes what we might call our national spirit like the \nflag. In times of crisis it inspires us to do more. In times of \ntranquility it moves us to do better. And, at all times it unifies us \nin the face of our diversity and of our difference.\n  There are those who believe that we should not, under any \ncircumstances, and no matter how it is worded, write an amendment into \nthe Constitution to protect the flag because they believe there is no \nway to do that without damaging an even more cherished right, our right \nto say whatever we wish to say when we wish to say it without the \nGovernment acting as a censor, without the Government choosing among \nour words, which are appropriate and which are not.\n  I understand their view and I respect it. I believe, as strongly as I \nbelieve anything about this debate, that those against the amendment in \nquestion are no less patriotic, no more un-American, no less American, \nno better, no worse than those who share the view that the amendment in \nquestion is an appropriate way to protect the flag, which really means \nto speak to our national spirit and consensus that exists in America \nabout what we stand for. The so-called culture norms people often speak \nto.\n  I respect their motives and I respect their views. But they are not \nmine. Although it is arguably not necessary to enshrine in the \nConstitution a way of protecting the flag, I believe that written \nproperly, I believe stated properly, it can in fact legitimately be \nplaced in the Constitution without doing damage to any of the other \nelements of our Constitution. But I should say up front that the \namendment in question, in my view, does not do that. I say this as one \nwho has made it his business here on the floor, along with my friend \nfrom Vermont, whom I see on the floor, and others, of sometimes being \nout of step in the minds of many people in terms of protecting the \ncivil liberties of persons in this country to say what they wish to \nsay, to publish what we do not wish them to publish, and to take \nactions we find reprehensible. But the Senator from Vermont, myself, \nand \n\n[[Page S18317]]\nothers believe they are guaranteed under the first amendment.\n  The first amendment does not say that you can only say things which \nreflect insight. The first amendment does not say you have to be \nbright. The first amendment does not say you have to be right. All the \nfirst amendment says is that you can say what you wish to say in \nrelation to speech, and the Government cannot censor what you say no \nmatter how, with notable exceptions, how much we do not like what is \nbeing said.\n  But I believe that the flag stands alone, and that is a legitimate \nway to protect our flag as the singular and unifying symbol of a \ndiverse people in need--I would add in urgent need sometimes--of common \nground. America is the most extraordinary nation on Earth.\n  I realize those who are here in the galleries who may be from other \ncountries, or those who listen to this on CNN, or C-SPAN--if it is \ncarried--will say, ``Isn't that a typical American assertion, a \nchauvinistic assertion?'' ``We are the most extraordinary nation on \nEarth.'' We are extraordinary in the sense not that we are better as \nindividuals, not that we are smarter, not that we are wiser, more \ngenerous, or less venal than other people, but the genius of America is \nthe American system, a system that takes into account our significant \ndiversity which in other countries--that diversity I am referring to--\nand in other systems creates great strife.\n  We take that diversity, which in other countries creates strife, and \nwe have turned it into strength. That is not very easy to do. People \noften fear diversity. The fact that we are black and white does not \nautomatically generate fellowship and harmony. The fact that we are \nChristian, Jew, and Moslem does not send us running into one another's \nembrace to herald our differences. The fact of the matter is that \npeople fear that which is different. It is a human condition.\n  Our diversity naturally pushes us apart, not together. But what holds \nus together as a nation, Mr. President, is not a common language, \nalthough I think that is necessary; not a common world view, which I do \nnot think is necessary. What holds us together is a common commitment \nto a system of government, a covenant of goodwill, of tolerance, of \nequality, and freedom, that is enshrined in the Constitution. And the \nflag stands as the single most important symbol of that covenant. It is \nthe story of all we have been and the symbol of what we wish to become.\n  To me, the flag is much more than the sum of the stars and the \nstripes. It sounds corny to say, and to listen to it sometimes, but it \nis also idealistic. I believe that it is important even more now than \nthen for all Americans to feel like a family. Like all families we have \nour problems. We squabble with each other. We misunderstood each other. \nAnd we hurt each other in countless ways. But at the end of the day we \nstill need to feel like a family under one roof bound together by \nshaped and shared values, and a shared sense of respect and tolerance.\n  It is the flag that symbolizes those shared values and which reminds \nus of how the shared covenant of respect and tolerance has to be \nmaintained. It is the flag under which we as a diverse and sometimes \ndivisive community can come together as one. And it is the flag that \nflies high and proud over our Nation's home.\n  But to say that the flag is worth protecting does not end our \nconversation. It is only, in my view, where we start, for we must ask \nhow the flag should be protected. As we look to protect the flag, we \nmust not lose sight of the first amendment and its guiding principles \nfor, although the flag may stand alone, it should not and it cannot \nstand above our most cherished freedom of speech.\n  Here is what I mean. At heart of the first amendment lies a very \nbasic notion; that is, the Government cannot muzzle a speaker because \nit dislikes what he or she says, or discriminate between your speech \nand mine because it agrees with me but disagrees with you. That sort of \nviewpoint discrimination is most importantly what the first amendment \nforbids.\n  As the Supreme Court has said, and I quote:\n\n       Above all else, the first amendment means that government \n     has no tolerance to restrict expression because of its \n     message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. The \n     essence of forbidden censorship is content control.\n\n  Just last term, the Supreme Court forcefully reiterated its \nintolerance for viewpoint discrimination in the majority opinion of \nRosenberger versus the University of Virginia. Justices Rehnquist, \nScalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and O'Connor--Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas \nnot accused of being a liberal triumvirate--said:\n\n       In the realm of private speech or expression, government \n     regulation may not favor one speaker over another. When the \n     government targets particular views taken by speakers on a \n     subject, the violation of the first amendment is all the more \n     blatant.\n\n  The Government can tell us we may not blast our opinions over a \nloudspeaker at 3 a.m. in the morning. It can tell us that we cannot \ndistribute obscenity and that we cannot spread libelous statements \nabout one another. But it cannot apply different rules based upon the \nviewpoint of the broadcast, the obscenity, or the libel. It cannot say \nyou cannot engage in that obscenity because of the viewpoint of the \nexpression, you cannot broadcast something because of the viewpoint you \nare expressing, or you cannot say that about another person because of \nthe viewpoint that you are expressing. It cannot apply different rules \nto Democrats and Republican, hippies and yuppies, rich and poor, black \nand white, or any other division in this country.\n  It was on this point to protect the flag, while not doing violence to \nthe core first amendment principle of viewpoint neutrality, that I \nwrote the Flag Protection Act of 1988. That act aimed to safeguard the \nphysical integrity of the flag across the board by making it a Federal \ncrime to mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn, maintain on the \nfloor, or ground, or trample upon the American flag. It passed the \nSenate, was signed by the President, and it became law.\n  The statute focused solely on the exclusivity of the conduct of the \nactor, regardless of any idea the actor might have been trying to \nconvey, regardless of whether he meant to cast contempt on the flag, \nregardless of whether anyone was offended by his actions.\n  The statute was written that way because, in my view and in the view \nof other of constitutional scholars, the Government's interest in \npreserving the flag is the same regardless of the particular idea that \nmay have motivated any particular person to burn or mutilate the flag. \nOur interest in the flag is in the flag itself as the symbol of what we \nknow in our hearts to be precious and rare and which flies high and \nproud over this place we call home, a precious and rare symbol of this \nNation.\n  The flag's unique place in our national life means that we should \npreserve it against all manner of destruction. It does not matter \nwhether the flag burner means to protest a war, or praise a war, or \nstart a barbecue. It is the flag that is the treasured symbol--not the \nobnoxious speech nor the positive speech that accompanies the burning \nof the flag--that must be protected.\n  We are here today deciding whether to add the 28th amendment to the \nConstitution, with a thought, I believe, that the flag is worthy of \nconstitutional protection. Although I believe it is worthy of \nconstitutional protection, I nevertheless must oppose the \nconstitutional amendment that is before us now. I oppose it because, in \nmy view, it puts the flag on a collision course with the Bill of \nRights.\n  Again, the purpose of these amendments is to protect the flag as if \nwe are going to protect a tombstone, as if we are going to protect the \nnational eagle, as if we are going to protect it as the most precious \nof those symbols. It does not matter to me whether someone comes with a \nsledgehammer and defiles a tombstone of a war hero by saying, ``I do \nthis because I do not think this slate of granite warrants being on top \nof your sacred body.'' I do not care whether they do it when they smash \nit because they say, ``I do this because I protest you and the war that \nyou fought in,'' and so on. The end result is the tombstone is \ndestroyed.\n  That is the story I want to get across about the flag. If it is the \nflag we wish to protect and not amend the first amendment, not make \nchoices among the types of speech we can engage in, then let us protect \nthe flag--nothing \n\n[[Page S18318]]\nelse. As I said, I do not care whether someone takes that flag and \nlights the flag and burns it in this Chamber offering it up as a sacred \nsymbol for all who died in the name of this country or grabbed it and \nburned it because they are protesting the grotesque policy of the \nUnited States on such and such. The end result is the national symbol \nis burned. And when we go beyond protecting merely the symbol, we go to \nchoosing, making choices among the types of speech we will allow \nAmericans to engage in.\n  I oppose the amendment because it puts the flag on a collision course \nwith the Bill of Rights. Let me expand on that. The proposed amendment \ngives the Congress and the 50 States the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag. And that word ``desecration'' is loaded. It is \nloaded with ambiguity. It is laden with value. And it will inevitably \nlead to trouble. To desecrate, like beauty, is in the eye of the \nbeholder.\n  Here is what the dictionary says desecrate means:\n\n       To divert from a sacred to a profane use or purpose; to \n     treat with sacrilege; to put to unworthy use.\n\n  So to determine whether an action desecrates, we must first make a \nvalue judgment about what the message the actor is trying to convey is. \nWe usually talk about desecration in terms of our religious values--to \ndesecrate a cross or a crucifix, to desecrate a menorah, to desecrate a \ntemple, to desecrate a church, to desecrate a sacristy, to desecrate a \nhost. Although I revere the flag, I do not put the flag on the same \nlevel as the sacred symbols of our varying religions. It is a different \nthing. We have never decided that any of our civil actions should rise \nto the level of spiritual undertaking. And so when you talk about \ndesecration, you have to understand that you are applying and allowing \nthe application of value judgments that we will attach to the actions \nof the actor who is desecrating the flag.\n  Does he mean to profane the flag? What does that mean? Obviously, we \nhave to determine that subjectively, whether it profanes the flag. Does \nher action treat the flag irreverently or contemptuously? Is the flag \nbeing put to an unworthy use?\n  When we make those kinds of value judgments, we are not making the \nact of burning the flag a crime. We are making the message behind the \nact the crime. I will refer to this later. But is it in fact putting \nthe flag to an unworthy use to put it on the side of a hot dog vendor's \nstand? Maybe that is all right. In one community, they may say that is \na good idea.\n  How about the guy who runs the pornographic theater, and on one side \nof the marquee he puts some lewd and obscene or profane or pornographic \ntitle of a film being shown inside and on the other side he drapes the \nAmerican flag. Is that putting it to an unworthy use?\n  How about the woman who buys the revealing thong bikini that is made \nin a flag. Is that profaning the flag? Is she to be arrested?\n  How about the woman who buys the $5,000 sequin dress that has a flag \non it? Is that profaning the flag? Does it matter what her figure is \nlike to determine what use the flag is being put to?\n  I rode in a parade recently in my home State, and it was a parade \nthat was honoring the war dead. It was Memorial Day. We went by on \nUnion Street in Wilmington, DE, the home of a black veteran, and he \nproudly had his flag flying on his front porch on a row house, and on \nthe other side of the flag sewn perfectly so it was the exact same size \nwas the African national symbol, black, red, and green. Is that \nprofaning the flag? He meant it out of respect. He was a war veteran. \nIf I am not mistaken, he had been president of one of our veterans \norganizations. Is that profaning the flag? Well, in Maine, maybe it \nwould not be profaning the flag. In southern Delaware or Alabama it \nmaybe would be viewed as profaning the flag.\n  Who makes those choices--the local constable, the local cop, the \nlocal censor? That is the crux of my objection to this amendment. It \nmakes not the act but the message the crime. And in doing so it gives \nthe Congress and the States license to discriminate between types of \nspeech they like and types of speech they do not like. But you do not \nhave to take my word for it.\n  Back in the bad old days, when I was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and subsequently as the ranking member, we held extensive \nhearings about the exact same amendment 5 and 6 years ago, and we heard \nfrom its authors, then members of the Bush administration, noble and \nhonorable men, and they pulled no punches to this question. They \nadmitted right out that the goal was to allow the Government to \ndiscriminate between bad flag burners and good flag burners.\n  More specifically, then Assistant Attorney General William Barr, who \nbecame Attorney General of the United States, and a fine one, in my \nview, in 1989 said that the message, ``Would permit the legislature to \nfocus on the kind of conduct that is really offensive.'' He said that \nthere is ``an infinite number of forms of desecration and that States \nwould have substantial discretion in fashioning flag laws.''\n  One year later, Acting Assistant Attorney General Michael Luttig \ntestified that the goal of the amendment was to ``punish only actors \nthat were intending to convey contempt.''\n  Now, when I heard him say that, I wanted to make sure I did not \nmisunderstand, so I asked Mr. Luttig point blank, would it be \npermissible under this amendment to pass laws discriminating between \ntypes of expression--not types of burning; you use the same match, same \nflag--but the type of expression that went along when you were burning \nthe flag. Was that the purpose? And he said, ``That is correct. You \ncould punish that desecration which you thought was intended to be \ndisrespectful toward the flag and not that which in your judgment was \nnot.''\n  If I am not mistaken, I remember the example I gave. I said, how \nabout if there are two veterans at the war memorial, the Vietnam War \nMemorial, and they each go down and they have their own flag, and he \nkneels down before the wall, one of them, and one happens to be a \nwoman. And she takes out the flag, very respectfully, puts it in an \nurn, puts a little lighter fluid on it and lights it, and says, ``I'm \noffering this flag up to purify the soul of my deceased husband whose \nname is on the wall and fought valiantly for his country in a noble \neffort.''\n\n  And another Vietnam veteran comes down and kneels down, takes out an \nurn, puts a flag in it, and puts lighter fluid on it and lights it, and \nsays, ``I'm offering this flag up in anger for the wasted lives of my \nfriends and brothers who are on this wall''--in anger--``for what my \ncountry did to them.''\n  If there is a park cop, a D.C. cop standing there, what does he do? \nAnd he says, ``Arrest the veteran who said he is burning this flag out \nof anger, but do not arrest the widow who is burning this flag to \nhonor.''\n  That will be the first time in the history of the United States of \nAmerica we passed a law that was constitutional--because, by \ndefinition, a constitutional amendment will be constitutional--that \nsaid, ``Government, you can choose to punish those who say things you \ndon't like, and let those who say things you do like go for the same \nexact physical act that they engage in.''\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen, how does that stop? Where does that stop? \nDo we really want the Federal Government, let alone the 50 States, to \nbe able to make those judgments that we have never allowed before? Lest \nanyone say to me that things have somehow changed this year, I point to \nthe committee report that was just published by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The majority views make it clear that viewpoint, \nneutrality--that issue I talked about earlier--is neither a goal nor an \nattribute of the proposed legislation.\n  Here is what the attending committee report to this constitutional \namendment says: ``The committee,'' meaning the Judiciary Committee, \n``does wish to empower Congress and the States to prohibit contemptuous \nor disrespectful physical treatment of the flag. The committee does not \nwish to compel the Congress and the States to penalize respectful \ntreatment of the flag.''\n  You all think I am kidding about this? Any of the people in this \nChamber who listened, you get 1,000 catalogs in the mail, everyone from \nL.L. Bean to, I do not know, all these catalogs. Look at the catalogs \nyou get for swimsuits. Look at them--not even ones you asked to have \nsent to you--and you will see the swimsuits, men and women's are \nflags--a flag. \n\n[[Page S18319]]\n\n  In some parts of my community, someone wearing a one-piece swimsuit \nwith a flag on it would not be viewed as disrespectful, someone wearing \na two-piece swimsuit would maybe not be, someone wearing a bikini may \nvery well be. And you think--I know this is funny, but it is real. It \nis real. These are real things. You are going to empower some local \ncop, some local community, to make a judgment. If I show up in boxer \nshorts, a kind of swimsuit with a flag on it, no problem. If some \nyoung, 19-year-old, muscle-bound guy shows up in a bikini with it on, \nwell, they may say that is kind of offensive, that is too revealing.\n  Is that the business we want to get into? And, by the way, what is a \nflag? Is the flag a decal? You stick a decal on the side of a hot-dog \nvendor stand. Well, what is that? What happens if they take these \nlittle flags, these little decal things they hand out and put pins on--\nsome are stickers--and burn one of those? Is that desecrating the flag? \nIs that the business we want to get into as a nation?\n\n  Also, this year the proponents of this amendment highlighted the \ntestimony of former Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper. Here is \nwhat former Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper had to say a few \nmonths ago.\n\n       [P]ublic sentiment is not neutral.\n\n  Parenthetically, I would note that is a profound observation.\n\n       [P]ublic sentiment is not ``neutral''; it is not \n     indifferent to the circumstances surrounding conduct relating \n     to the flag. If such conduct is dignified and respectful, I \n     daresay that the American people and their elected \n     representatives do not want to prohibit it; if such conduct \n     is disrespectful and contemptuous of the flag, I believe that \n     they do.\n\n  I believe that, too. It makes my blood boil when I read the testimony \nof that young guy standing on the floor on the steps of the capitol in \nTexas saying, ``Red, white, and blue, I spit on you,'' and burning a \nflag. They are the kind of things that--fortunately, most of us were \nnot around--they are the kind of things that literally start fights \nwith people who do not have a lot of self-control in circumstances like \nthat. And I probably would fit in that category.\n  But what is the difference? We are going to allow--obviously, public \nsentiment is not neutral on anything. It is not neutral on what we say \nabout--I happen to be a Roman Catholic. It is not neutral on how some \nof the far-right folks talk about my church. I do not like the way they \ntalk about the Pope. I do not like the kind of comments they make. I \nfind it offensive. I happen to be a member of the largest single \ndenomination in the United States of America because 33 percent of us \nare Catholic. There are more Catholics in here than any other single \ndenomination in the Congress, if I am not mistaken.\n  Should we pass a law saying, ``It offends me. It offends me. You \ncan't say those things about my church''? Is that a good idea? That is \ncontent. That is content.\n  So when we talk about the public is not neutral, they are not neutral \non anything. Should people have a right to stand up and offend us as \nsome do and make pro-Communist speeches or what about these defiling \nNazi types around this country? What about these militia guys, some of \nwhom wear swastikas? I am not labeling all militia people, but some \nare. The white supremacists--it makes my blood boil when I hear what \nthey say about our country, about Jews, about blacks. But, guess what, \nfolks? They are entitled to say it. It offends all of us, 95 percent of \nus.\n  So if I decide, as Mr. Cooper says, public sentiment is not neutral, \nit is not neutral on that, it is not neutral on the Ku Klux Klan, it is \nnot neutral on white supremacist organizations, it is overwhelmingly \nopposed, so because it is not neutral, we go with a majority sentiment? \nAre we prepared to say that? Are we prepared to outlaw their speech? \nWell, it would make me feel good. I would like to do it. But if we go \nfor them today, who do we go for next?\n  How about the time when people stood up 40 years ago and made \nspeeches about black equality, made speeches about the rights of blacks \nto participate in our society? The majority of folks in certain parts \nof the country, including my State, were not for that. Would they be \nable to pass a law in the State of Delaware saying you cannot say that? \n``You're a rabble-rouser, talking about that 19 percent of my \npopulation that is black having equal rights.''\n  Probably a significant portion of the American public is offended by \nsome of the more militant aspects of the gay and lesbian movement who \nstand up and make speeches about what their rights are. The fact that \nit is not neutral, that we are not neutral on that subject as a nation, \nthen we have a right to outlaw it?\n  I believe that this whole argument misses--the argument made by those \nwho talk about whether we are neutral on it or not, that we should be \nable to act on what we are not neutral about--misses the greatest \nconstitutional point.\n  It misses, indeed, the genius of the first amendment. Here in America \nthe majority, by and large, does not get to choose what can and cannot \nbe said by the minority, or by anyone else for that matter. And the \nGovernment, more importantly, is constitutionally restrained from \ndeciding what speech is good and what speech is bad. But that is \nprecisely what the proponents of this amendment say it would do and \nshould do. Let me be precise.\n  That is what the senatorial and congressional proponents of this \namendment mean for it to do. I really do not believe the vast majority \nof the members of the American Legion and the vast majority of veterans \ngroups and the vast majority of Americans know that it will do this. I \ndo not think they thought that one through. But that is precisely what \nthe proponents of the amendment say it would do and should do. They \nwould have the flag emblazoned with the slogan ``Government is great'' \ntreated differently than one that says, ``Government is rotten.''\n  Get that flag, put on it, ``The U.S. Government is great.'' Does that \ndeface the flag? Put on the same flag, ``The U.S. Government is \nrotten,'' and what is that? Is that OK? Well, as a U.S. Senator who has \noccasionally had some scurrilous things said about him because I am \npart of the Government and because I am who I am, I sure would like to \nhave the power to pass a law saying, ``You can't say bad things about \nme, I'm part of the Government, only good things about me. If they are \nbad things, you can't say them.''\n  I would like all the newspaper editors in America to understand that \nfrom now on, we may have an amendment that you cannot say anything bad \nabout a U.S. Senator, notwithstanding the fact we deserve it and I \ndeserve it.\n  Under this amendment, the State could send to jail the fringe artist \ndisplaying the flag on the floor of an art museum while giving its \nblessing to a veteran who displays the flag on the ground at a war \nmemorial. That, I believe, is not content neutral.\n  The State could, as I said, arrest the widow who burns the flag to \nprotest the war that took her husband's life while smiling on the widow \nwho burns the flag in memory of her fallen husband. I believe this type \nof viewpoint discrimination exacts too high a constitutional price to \nprotect the flag. As Justice Jackson so memorably put it in the flag \nstatute case of 1943:\n\n       The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials. . . If there is any fixed star in our \n     constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or \n     petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, \n     nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion or force \n     citizens to confess by word or act or faith therein.\n\n  What it boils down to is this: This amendment, as presently drafted, \nallows the Government to pick and choose, to make flag burning illegal \nonly in certain situations involving only certain circumstances and \nonly if carried out by certain people and only for the time in \nquestion, because 2 years later, 5 years later, 20 years later, 40 \nyears later, it can change.\n  This discrimination is precisely and most profoundly what the first \namendment forbids, and the amendment that works this kind of \ndiscrimination does not protect the flag, it censors speech.\n  Another problem with the amendment is that it fails to define the \nword ``flag.'' This would add yet another layer of difficulty in \ninterpretation and application and open the door further to \ninconsistencies among the States. Again, each State would have \nconsiderable discretion to craft its own definition, and, again, the \npossibilities are nearly endless. \n\n[[Page S18320]]\n\n  As Assistant Attorney General Barr testified, the legislation would \nbe able to criminalize conduct dealing not only with the flag as we \nknow it but with, and I quote, ``descriptions of the flag, such as \nposters, murals, pictures, buttons or other representations of the \nflag.''\n  Indeed, Mr. Barr, in speaking in favor of such a sweeping definition, \nsaid that it would, and I quote again, be: ``consistent with the \nGovernment's interest in preserving the flag's symbolic value because \nit recognizes that the desecration of representations of the flag \ndamage that interest as much as the desecration of the flag itself.''\n  So in Maine, it might be a crime to draw a flag being fed into a \nshredding machine. In California, it might be a crime to wear a \nsequined dress in the pattern of a flag or a flag bikini or T-shirt. In \nMississippi, the legislature might make it a crime to put a flag decal \non the side of a hot dog vending machine.\n  This sort of disparity among State laws, whether it is over the \nmeaning of ``desecration'' or the definition of ``flag,'' is especially \ninappropriate here where we are talking about the Nation's symbol. This \nis not the symbol of Mississippi or Delaware, Alabama, South Carolina, \nCalifornia, Maine, or Montana. It is the national symbol. The reason it \nis worth preserving is because it unifies this diverse Nation, and the \nnotion that a single State can determine what that should be is, on its \nface, preposterous.\n  I understand that there is a possibility that the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, and others, may have an amendment \nto amend this amendment to take out the right of the States to do this. \nI am not sure of that, but that is what I understand. That would be a \npositive step, because it is, on its face ludicrous--ludicrous--to \nallow each State to determine how much they are going to protect the \nnational symbol.\n  Some States in the past, and I do not say this disrespectfully, \ndecided it should not be our national symbol and decided to have \nanother flag. I do not want any State telling me what that symbol \nshould be and how it should be treated. It is a national symbol.\n  It is a symbol of the Nation, not of the States, and an amendment \nwhich will foster a crazy quilt of laws all across the map misses the \npoint and an important one: It will be more divisive than unifying.\n  Why is it any less reprehensible to burn a flag in Louisiana than it \nis in Montana? Why should we be able to wear a flag T-shirt in a wet T-\nshirt contest in Arkansas or Delaware and not in Florida or California?\n  Moreover, constitutional rights and principles should know no \ngeographic boundaries. A Delawarean should not be accorded greater \nfreedom of speech than his neighbor across the way in Pennsylvania. A \nCalifornian should not have more due process rights than her cousin up \nnorth in the State of Washington.\n  If we want to protect the flag, we should have one national \nviewpoint-neutral standard. The Constitution, after all, stands for \nproud and broad principles, not a patchwork of 50 different and \nidiosyncratic ideas. I agree that we should honor the flag. We should \nhold it high in our hearts and in our law, but we should not dishonor \nthe Constitution in the process.\n  With all due respect for my good friends, Orrin Hatch and Howell \nHeflin, I think this amendment does violence to the core of the first \namendment principle of viewpoint neutrality. This is the price that I \nam unwilling to pay. But more to the point, it is a price we do not \nhave to pay to protect the flag. We can do both: Preserve the first \namendment in viewpoint neutrality, and we can protect the flag and \npreserve the first amendment at the same time. And that is what the \namendment I now propose seeks to do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3093\n\n   (Purpose: Proposing an amendment to the Constitution authorizing \n Congress to protect the physical integrity of the flag of the United \n                                States)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3093.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following: That the following article is proposed as an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which \n     shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the \n     Constitution if ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths \n     of the several States within seven years after its submission \n     to the States for ratification:\n\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. The Congress shall have power to enact the \n     following law:\n       ```It shall be unlawful to burn, mutilate, or trample upon \n     any flag of the United States.\n       ```This does not prohibit any conduct consisting of the \n     disposal of the flag when it has become worn or soiled.'.\n       ``Section 2. As used in this article, the term `flag of the \n     United States' means any flag of the United States adopted by \n     Congress by law, or any part thereof, made of any substance, \n     of any size, in a form that is commonly displayed.\n       ``Section 3. The Congress shall have the power to prescribe \n     appropriate penalties for the violation of a statute adopted \n     pursuant to section 1.''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I shall not seek to have a vote on the \namendment at this time, under the order.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward. It leaves no room for \nguesswork about what it will mean. It gives the Congress the power to \nenact--it is a constitutional amendment--it gives Congress the power to \nenact a specific viewpoint-neutral statute, a statute making it \nunlawful to burn, mutilate or trample upon any flag of the United \nStates, period. It does not matter who burns, mutilates, or tramples \nthe flag, and it does not matter why. Under my proposal, it would be \nunlawful to do the flag harm, no ifs, ands, or buts. It makes a single \nexception for disposing of the flag when it has become worn or soiled, \nand it says a flag is what we all know a flag to be, that which is \ncommonly displayed and is defined by the Congress. It rules out things \nlike pictures of flags, napkins with flags on them, and other \nrepresentations of the flag.\n  My proposal also gives the Congress the power to write appropriate \npenalties for violating the statute. Let me say at the outset that I am \nthe first to acknowledge that the restriction on flag burning is a \nrestriction on expressive conduct. There are no two ways about it. When \nGregory Johnson burned the flag at the Republican convention in 1984 \nand chanted the words ``America, red, white, and blue, I spit on you,'' \nhe was trying to say something. It may have been no more than an \n``inarticulate grunt or roar,'' as Chief Justice Rehnquist puts it, but \nit was communicative nonetheless.\n  So let us be honest, any attempt to limit flag burning does limit \nsymbolic conduct, but that was just as true back in 1989 when 91 \nSenators voted for my Flag Protection Act, which made it a Federal \ncrime to burn, mutilate, or trample on the flag. Let us be honest about \nanother thing. This first amendment does not give symbolic conduct, or \nany other kind of speech, for that matter, limitless protection. You \ncannot burn a draft card to protest the war, and you cannot sleep in \nLafayette Park to protest the homelessness of America; you cannot spray \npaint your views on the Washington Monument; you cannot blast them from \na sound truck in a residential neighborhood at 3 a.m. in the morning.\n  When we prohibit flag burning, we are not interfering with a person's \nfreedom to express his or her ideas in any number of other ways. As \nfour Justices noted in the Eichmann case--that is the one that declared \nmy statute unconstitutional--it may well be true that other means of \nexpression may be less effective in drawing attention to those ideas, \nbut that is not itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning. \nPresumably, a gigantic fireworks display or a parade of nude models in \na public park might draw even more attention to a controversial \nmessage, but such methods of expression are nonetheless subject to \nregulation.\n  We limit the manner in which folks can express themselves all the \ntime, as long as we limit everyone the same way. We cannot say that I \ncan have a fireworks display and you cannot. We cannot say that one \nnude person could go through a park and another one cannot. We must \ntreat all people the \n\n[[Page S18321]]\nsame--as long as we do it the same way. But we do limit the ways in \nwhich we can express ourselves. And that, Mr. President, is precisely \nthe point.\n  We cannot let someone make a speech on top of the Capitol in favor of \nAmerican involvement in Bosnia but tell the person with a contrary view \nthat he cannot go up there and make the same speech. But we can tell \nthem both, and everyone else, that no speeches can be made from the top \nof the Capitol dome. We just cannot choose among the speakers. We can, \nthus, restrict the time, place, and manner by which people express \nthemselves. The thing we cannot do is regulate the content of their \nexpression and discriminate between the various viewpoints being \nexpressed.\n  I think that we can and that we should tell everyone they cannot burn \nthe flag. I agree with Justices Warren, Fortas, and Black that the \nright to burn the flag does not sit at the heart of the first \namendment. But I also agree with Justice Scalia when he said, ``The \nGovernment may not regulate speech based on hostility or favoritism \ntoward the underlying message expressed.'' The point of the first \namendment is that the majority preferences must be expressed in some \nfashion other than silencing speech on the basis of content. Yes, I \nagree with Justices Scalia, Rehnquist, Thomas, Kennedy, and O'Connor in \ntheir strong and unequivocal condemnation of viewpoint discrimination \njust last term in the Rosenberg case. I remind my colleagues, nobody \nhas ever accused Justice Rehnquist of being a radical or a liberal, or \nJustice Scalia of being a radical or a liberal, or Justice Thomas of \nbeing a liberal, and the list goes on. Flag burning may not sit at the \nheart of the first amendment, but the principle against viewpoint \ndiscrimination does sit at the heart of the first amendment.\n  This is one of those defining constitutional principles that sets \nAmerica apart and, in so many ways, above other nations. Here, the \nGovernment cannot regulate speech based on the viewpoint of the \nspeaker. Here, the Government cannot pick and choose between speech it \nlikes and speech it does not like, and criminalize what it rejects but \nnot what it respects.\n  That is the bedrock first amendment principle upon which my proposed \namendment is based, and it is the principle--the core principle, in my \nview--that separates my proposal, my constitutional amendment, from the \none proposed by Senators Hatch and Heflin.\n  Their amendment allows and, in fact, encourages viewpoint \ndiscrimination. Mine, flatly stated, prohibits it. Their amendment \nwould send to jail a guy who burns the flag to protest the war, but not \nthe guy who burns the flag to praise the war. My amendment would throw \nthem both in jail, if that is what the Congress decides to legislate. \nTheir amendment would make it a crime to walk on the flag at a college \ncampus sit-in, but not at the war memorial. My amendment would \ncriminalize both, if that is what the Congress legislated.\n  In my view, it does not matter why you burn or mutilate or trample on \nthe flag; you should not do it, period. I do not care whether you mean \nto protest the war or praise the war or start a war. You should not do \nit. Our interest in the flag is in the flag itself as a unifying \nsymbol. I might add, the person riding down Constitution Avenue \nwatching the veteran burn the flag to memorialize his colleagues has no \nnotion why he is doing it. All he knows is that the national symbol is \nbeing burned. Under their amendment, you would have to get close enough \nto hear what was being said in order to determine whether or not it \nshould be allowed or not allowed. I find it no less demeaning that \nsomeone would, in order to pay respect to my deceased family, trample \nacross our grave plots than I would if someone tramples across them to \nshow disrespect. I do not want anybody trampling where my family is \nburied. I do not want anybody burning the flag, whether they are doing \nit to praise me or condemn me. They should not do it.\n  Our interest is in the flag--in the flag itself--not in advancing or \nsilencing any particular idea that the flag destroyer might have in \nmind. But do not take my view for it, ask a Boy Scout. If a Scout sees \na flag dip to the ground, he runs to pick it up, does he not? That is \nhow I trained my boys and my daughter. That is how I was trained as a \nScout from the time I was a little kid. It does not matter why it fell; \ndo not let it touch the ground. He does not care why the flag is on the \nground, he does not care who let it fall, he does not care what \nsomebody might have been trying to say when they let the flag fall; all \nhe knows is that the flag is something special and it should not be on \nthe ground. And so it should be with all of us.\n  If the only justification for protecting this flag, Mr. President, \nand if it, in fact, is the unifying symbol of a diverse nation and it \nserves a greater Government purpose of holding us together or reminding \nus how we are the same and not different, if that is not the purpose, \nthen this exercise is profane, the exercise we are undertaking is \nprofane.\n\n  For what else is the reason? Interested in a cloth maker, we do not \nwant them burned? Or we have a greater interest in cloth makers, so \nthey can buy and sell more flags? What is the purpose?\n  It either unifies or does not; it either should be soiled or not \nsoiled. We cannot have any other rationale that I can come up with. The \nflag is a cherished symbol, not as a vehicle for speech; it is a \ncherished symbol, period. That is why it should be protected.\n  That is what my amendment does. The amendment authorizes Congress, \nand Congress alone--not the States--for, as I said earlier, I do not \nwant any other State defining to me what my national symbol means. This \nis a national symbol. This is the National Government, and the National \nGovernment should have unifying rules about the national symbol. That \nis what my amendment does. Only the National Government, speaking for \nthe Nation as a whole, can speak to how we should treat that unifying \nsymbol.\n  This means my amendment would not let some violate the physical \nintegrity of the flag but not others. Under this amendment, no one will \nbe able to do the flag harm. With viewpoint neutrality as its signpost, \nthe amendment preserves the first amendment's cardinal value.\n  The amendment also ensures that the implementing legislation will be \nviewpoint neutral, and it makes sure that there will not be a patchwork \nof conflicting local flag protection laws. What will be a crime in \nDelaware will also be a crime in Utah. There will not be a place in the \nNation you can go and legally burn my flag, our flag. We do not have a \nflag T-shirt contraband in Minnesota but it is all the rage down in \nFlorida.\n  Under this amendment, unlike the Hatch-Heflin provision, we know what \nwe are getting. We are getting legislation that protects the flag while \nat the same time preserves our speech; at the same time, presenting \nprosecutions and convictions based upon viewpoint discrimination.\n  To be sure, my amendment impacts first amendment values, but I \nbelieve, on balance, that it stands in the proud tradition of many \nlegal scholars from Justices Harlan to Fortas, from Black to Stevens, \nfrom Chief Justice Warren to Justice Burger, who believe that flag \nprotection and free expression are not incompatible.\n  I join them in believing that the singular symbol of our Nation ought \nto be protected. They recognize, as Justice Holmes once said, ``We live \nby symbols.'' We live by symbols. I share that view. We must protect \nboth the flag and the first amendment. One is a symbol, the other is \nthe heart of the Nation and who we are as a people.\n  We must protect the flag because it is a unique and unifying symbol \nof our Nation, and we must protect the first amendment because it is \nour single greatest guarantee of freedom in this country.\n  The amendment that I propose today does nothing more than authorize a \nsingle law protecting the flag. It does nothing less than respect the \ncore first amendment values of neutrality and equality. We can protect \nboth the flag and the liberties for which it stands, but, in my humble \nopinion, the Heflin-Hatch amendment sacrifices one for the other. I \nwill at the appropriate time strongly urge my colleagues to reject \ntheir amendment and hopefully vote for mine, instead.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I also respect those who believe my \namendment should not become part of the \n\n[[Page S18322]]\nConstitution. I respect them very much. What I do not think anyone can \ndisagree with is that there is a fundamental distinction between the \namendment in terms of its impact on the first amendment.\n  My objective here, as much as protecting the flag, is in fact to \nprotect and guarantee the first amendment. As I say, there is no one on \nthis floor since I have been here who has been more deeply involved in \nattempting to protect the flag than I have.\n  I authored the first statute that passed. I authored this amendment 5 \nyears ago, but I do not take kindly to the notion that we are going to \nconsider an amendment that may very well pass, that will, in fact, \nallow the Federal Government and State Governments for the first time \nto choose among the types of speech they wish us to be able to engage \nin: criminalize one, and not the other. If it is a national symbol, \nprotect it, period.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the American people overwhelmingly \nsupport this proposed constitutional amendment Senate Joint Resolution \n31. Poll after poll has shown that nearly 80 percent of all Americans \nfavor legally protecting the American flag against acts of physical \ndesecration. Forty-nine State legislatures have called upon Congress to \npass and send to the States for ratification a flag-protection \namendment. Three hundred and twelve Members of the other body have \nalready voted for this amendment.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Ninety three Democratic \nRepresentatives, nearly half of the Democratic Members of the House, \nvoted in favor of this amendment. The Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt \nvoted ``yes,'' as did 2 Democratic whips, 2 cochairs of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign \nCommittee, and 36 ranking committee and subcommittee members. It is \ntruly nonpartisan. Here in the Senate, amendment cosponsors include \nboth Republican and Democrats. Old Glory is not a Republican banner or \na Democratic banner. The American flag is a symbol of our unity as a \nNation--it represents all Americans, regardless of party or philosophy.\n  Last Thursday, December 7, was one of those days which holds a \nspecial place in our history; the anniversary of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. It is a day when we are particularly mindful of the unique \nsymbolism of the American flag.\n  The flag, which flies today and everyday over the remains of the \nU.S.S. Arizona, one of the ships sunk during the Japanese attack, and \nwhich has been preserved as a monument to those who perished in that \nattack, represents our Nation and all that it stands for; the freedoms \nand ideals that have inspired generations of brave Americans to fight, \nand in some cases, to give their lives, in its defense. More than 2,300 \nbrave Americans made the ultimate sacrifice for that flag and the \nNation it represents on that fateful day 54 years ago.\n  The flag is the one symbol that unites our very diverse people in a \nway nothing else can, in war or in peace. Whatever our differences of \nrace, ethnic background, religion, social or economic status, \ngeographic region, politics, or philosophy, the American flag forms a \nunique, common bond among us.\n  The American flag is more than a symbol of unity to the people of \nthis Nation. For generations, it has served as a symbol of hope and of \nfreedom to people around the world.\n  For over 200 years, the American people enjoyed the right to protect \none unique national symbol, their flag, from acts of physical \ndesecration. This right was exercised by the Congress and the 48 States \nwhich adopted flag protection statutes, until two wrongly decided, 5 to \n4 Supreme Court decisions took away that right.\n  It is up to the Senate to decide whether to acquiesce in Supreme \nCourt decisions which misconstrue the first amendment and leave our \nnational symbol with no greater protection than an ordinary rag.\n  I believe that protecting our flag against acts of physical \ndesecration does not infringe on constitutionally protected freedom of \nspeech. I believe that Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo Black, \nand Justice Abe Fortas were correct when they wrote that the first \namendment, which those distinguished jurists so passionately defended, \ndoes not bar Congress from prohibiting physical desecration of the \nAmerican flag.\n  Amending our Constitution is not an easy task, nor should it be \nundertaken lightly. With respect to enacting legal protection for the \nAmerican flag, however, the decisions of the Supreme Court in the \nJohnson and Eichman cases make it absolutely clear that a \nconstitutional amendment is the best approach. We have tried the \nstatutory approach. In 1989, after the Johnson decision, Congress \npromptly enacted a flag protection statute; and the Supreme Court just \nas promptly struck it down in the Eichman case. I have great respect \nfor my colleague, Senator McConnell, who proposes to substitute for \nthis amendment a flag protection statute. We share the goal of \nprotecting our flag from physical desecration. But I respectfully \nsuggest to my colleague that his approach, however sincere and well \nintentioned, will not accomplish that goal. In light of the decisions \nof the Supreme Court, I believe that a constitutional amendment is the \nbest method available to the Senate and the American people for \nrestoring legal protection to our flag.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters dated \nOctober 23, 1995, from two distinguished scholars, Richard Parker of \nthe Harvard Law School and Stephen Presser of Northwestern University \nSchool of Law, on this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, October 23, 1995.\n     Daniel S. Wheeler,\n     Citizens Flag Alliance,\n     Indianapolis, IN.\n       Dear Dan, Thank you for sending the portion of the \n     Congressional Record for October 19 including the ``Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995'' proposed by Senator \n     McConnell on behalf of himself and Senators Bennett and \n     Dorgan.\n       The proposed statute would be struck down by the Supreme \n     Court. The statute, therefore, does not offer a viable \n     alternative to an amendment of the Constitution allowing the \n     representatives of the people--if they so choose--to protect \n     the U.S. flag against ``physical desecration''. The truth is \n     that the only way to enact the statute they propose would be \n     to enact the constitutional amendment first.\n       The Congress tried once before to find an alternative to \n     constitutional amendment. In 1989, after the Supreme Court \n     struck down a Texas prohibition of flag desecration in the \n     Johnson case, Congress was persuaded to try to write a \n     ``neutral'' statute protecting the flag that, it hoped, would \n     satisfy the Court's 5-4 majority. Congress enacted such a \n     statute in October 1989. In June 1990, the Court's majority \n     struck it down in the Eichman case. The Court made its view \n     perfectly clear: No statute will pass muster if it singles \n     out the flag of the United States for protection against \n     contemptuous abuse. Such a statute, in the opinion of the \n     five Justices, involves taking sides in favor of what is \n     uniquely symbolized by the flag--our ``aspiration to national \n     unity.'' This singling out of the flag for protection, they \n     believe, violates the Constitution as it now stands.\n       Of course, Senator McConnell, speaking for Senator Bennett \n     and Senator Dorgan, says they hope to satisfy the Court by \n     confining punishment of ``[a]ny person who destroys or \n     damages a flag'' (a) to those who do so with intent to \n     ``incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the \n     peace'' and (b) to those who steal the flag they go on to \n     ``destroy or damage'' from the United States or on certain \n     federal lands. Because the First Amendment permits \n     prohibition of ``fighting words'' and of theft generally, the \n     Senators seem to believe that it also will be held to permit \n     singling out flag abuse, within those two contexts, for \n     particular prohibition.\n       This ploy won't work. By singling out the flag for \n     protection against physical abuse, the proposed statute still \n     ``takes sides'' in favor of what is symbolized by the flag. \n     Senator McConnell, in his remarks on the floor of the Senate, \n     made clear that this is indeed the intent behind the statute. \n     He said he is ``disgusted by those who desecrate our symbol \n     of freedom.'' ``[W]e should have zero tolerance for those who \n     deface the flag,'' he proclaimed. Although he also said he \n     hopes to satisfy the 5-4 majority of the Court that decided \n     Eichman, that majority would look at his remarks and at the \n     face of the proposed statute--and it definitely would not be \n     satisfied.\n       In fact, there is a Court decision even more recent than \n     Eichman that would doom the \n\n[[Page S18323]]\n     proposed statute, in the absence of a new constitutional amendment \n     authorizing prohibition of physical desecration of the flag. \n     It is R.A.V. v. St. Paul, handed down in 1992. In that case, \n     a 5-4 majority of the Justices struck down an ordinance that \n     singled out particular offensive sorts of expression, within \n     the general category of ``fighting words,'' for prohibition. \n     This, the Court held, involved a taking of sides among sorts \n     of messages and, so, was invalid. The fact that ``fighting \n     words'' in general may be prohibited, the Court said, does \n     not allow government to write and enforce laws that prohibit \n     particular ideological sub-categories of ``fighting words.'' \n     The statute proposed by the three Senators thus would be held \n     to violate the Constitution as it is now written--not just \n     arguably, but patently.\n       Senator McConnell spoke last Friday of respect for the \n     Constitution. The question I would ask the three Senators, \n     then, is this: Does proposing to enact a statute that is in \n     patent violation of the Court's interpretation of that \n     document show respect for it?\n       Isn't the path that is most respectful of the Constitution \n     the one originally specified by the founding fathers in \n     Article V--the path of constitutional amendment?\n       The deepest question, however, is this: Do the three \n     Senators believe the flag is no different from any other \n     symbol--that it is not unique, not uniquely valuable? Or do \n     they want to single out the flag and take sides in favor of \n     what is uniquely symbolized by it? If that is their view, \n     then they have only one real choice now: to support a \n     narrowly-focused constitutional amendment that would permit \n     us to do the thing that they tell us they believe we should \n     do.\n       It is that simple.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard D. Parker,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Raoul Berger, Professor of Legal History, Northwestern \n           University School of Law,\n                                    Chicago, IL, October 23, 1995.\n     Dan Wheeler,\n     President, Citizens Flag Alliance, Indianapolis, IN.\n       Dear Dan: You have asked me for my thoughts regarding the \n     constitutionality and the wisdom of the statute to deal with \n     flag desecration recently proposed by Senators McConnell, \n     Bennett, and Dorgan, S. 1335, which appears in the \n     Congressional Record for October 19, 1995. I must admit that \n     I was surprised that three distinguished Senators could take \n     the position that legislation on flag desecration could \n     survive constitutional challenge, in light of the Supreme \n     Court's decisive rejection of the statutory route in U.S. v. \n     Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). You will remember that when a \n     similar statutory approach was proposed by Senator Biden and \n     others after the Johnson case, Judge Bork, Charles Cooper, \n     and I testified before the Senate that no statute could pass \n     Constitutional muster, and though Lawrence Tribe and others \n     told the Senate that a flag protection statute would not be \n     found unconstitutional, they were wrong, and we were proved \n     right. It could not be clearer that the same thing would \n     happen to the proposed statute once it were challenged in \n     court.\n       The new proposed statute is grounded in Constitutional \n     error in two ways. First, and most obvious, is the \n     implication made in Section (2) of the ``Findings'' clause \n     which suggests that the proposed Flag Protection Amendment is \n     an alteration of the Bill of Rights. It is no such thing, as \n     I and others testified before the House and Senate \n     Subcommittees this summer. The proposed Amendment does \n     nothing to alter the guarantee of the freedom of speech in \n     the First Amendment. Once the Flag Protection Amendment \n     becomes law, no one will find themselves unable to express \n     any ideas; only one particularly odious act will have been \n     barred, an act that is, after all, as Chief Justice Rehnquist \n     suggested, more like ``an inarticulate grunt,'' than the \n     expression of a political view. The Proposed Flag Protection \n     Amendment merely returns Constitutional law to where it was \n     in 1989, where it was before Johnson, and where it had been \n     for over a hundred years. The Flag Protection Amendment, in \n     other words, merely corrects the erroneous constitutional \n     interpretation of the majority in the Johnson case. It \n     returns us to the view that the Bill of Rights has nothing to \n     say which bars flag protection legislation, a view that was \n     not only held by Justice Rehnquist, but also by such well \n     known defenders of the Bill of Rights as Hugo Black and Earl \n     Warren, as I and others made clear in our Congressional \n     testimony on the Amendment.\n       The second clear constitutional error made by the proposed \n     statute is the assumption, also expressed in the ``Findings'' \n     section, that the proposed statute can be successfully \n     grounded in the ``fighting words'' doctrine, in the notion \n     that the statute could (without a supporting Constitutional \n     Amendment) be justified because flag desecration presents ``a \n     direct threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals,'' or in the notion that flag desecration might \n     be intended to ``incite a violent response.'' These \n     justifications have already been clearly rejected by the \n     Supreme Court. In the Johnson case itself, the court stated:\n       ``The State's position, therefore, amounts to a claim that \n     an audience that takes serious offense at particular \n     expression is necessarily likely to disturb the peace and \n     that the expression may be prohibited on this basis. . . Our \n     precedents do not countenance such a presumption. On the \n     contrary, they recognize that a principal ``function of free \n     speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. \n     It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a \n     condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions \n     as they are, or even stirs people to anger.'' . . . It would \n     be odd indeed to conclude both that ``if it is the speaker's \n     opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a reason for \n     according it constitutional protection,''. . . and that the \n     government may ban the expression of certain disagreeable \n     ideas on the unsupported presumption that their very \n     disagreeableness will provoke violence.''\n       Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at 408-409 (1989) (citations \n     and footnotes omitted). In other words, the very \n     justification now offered by the three Senators for their \n     legislation was the very position of Texas rejected in \n     Johnson. In Johnson the court expressly rejected the \n     application of the ``fighting words'' or imminent breach of \n     the peace rationales offered by Texas (and offered by the \n     three senators), and then went on to declare, ``No reasonable \n     onlooker would have regarded Johnson's generalized expression \n     of dissatisfaction with the policies of the Federal \n     Government [his act of flag-burning] as a direct personal \n     insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs.'' 491 U.S., \n     at 409. The court would be bound to reach the same conclusion \n     in any test of S. 1335.\n       Taken together U.S. v. Eichman and Texas v. Johnson, in my \n     opinion, make as clear as can be that the Supreme Court would \n     find S. 1335 to be an impermissible attempt to engage in the \n     kind of content discrimination in expression that the Court \n     has declared constitutionally invalid. I think that the \n     Court's reasoning is faulty when what we are speaking of is \n     preventing flag desecration, since I do not regard that as \n     the kind of speech the Framers of the First Amendment sought \n     to protect. Nevertheless, since the Court has been obdurate \n     on this point, it is now clear that only a Constitutional \n     Amendment can protect the flag in the manner Senators \n     McConnell, Bennett, and Dorgan indicate that they clearly \n     desire. My feeling is that rather than fearing such a \n     Constitutional Amendment they should embrace it. It is a \n     profound demonstration of the feeling of the American people, \n     and is the people's time-honored way of correcting erroneous \n     constitutional interpretations of the Supreme Court. The \n     proposed Flag Protection Amendment is no infringement of the \n     Bill of Rights, it is, instead, a wonderful exercise in the \n     popular sovereignty the Bill of Rights was designed to \n     protect.\n       Please forgive me for going on at such length. As you can \n     tell, I feel strongly on this issue, and believe the Flag \n     Protection Amendment is sorely needed. Please let me know if \n     I can provide any further assistance.\n           With very best wishes,\n                                               Stephen B. Presser.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I hope Senators read this list of the \nCitizens Flag Alliance member organizations, like the AMVETS, the \nAmerican Legion--not only the veterans organizations, but law \nenforcement organizations, religious organizations, and fraternal \norganizations all over this Nation, 105 of them. That is what I am \nputting in the Record. I hope the Senate will take occasion to read \nthis list and that the Congress will pass this amendment without \nfurther debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah desires the floor, \nI will yield to him.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? I ask unanimous consent the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois be granted 5 minutes, and I ask \nfurther unanimous consent I be then recognized to call up an amendment \nor modification and to speak to that for a few minutes. Then I ask \nunanimous consent the distinguished Senator from South Carolina be next \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am proud of the flag. I remember one of \nthe times when I was in the Armed Forces before I went overseas. When \nyou were at a football game and they played the ``Star Spangled \nBanner'' and you could salute that flag in that uniform, you had to be \ncold hearted if you did not get a thrill out of it.\n  At my home in rural southern Illinois, you will see a flag flying. We \nare proud of that flag. But I strongly oppose a constitutional \namendment.\n  What is the big problem? The Congressional Reference Bureau says, in \n1994, three flags around the Nation were burned. In 1993, how many \nflags were burned around the Nation? Zero. If we adopt an amendment to \nthe Constitution, there will be more flags burned in protest, not \nfewer. There will always be somebody who is so extreme that he or she \nis going to do it. And, if we ban the burning of the flag, what about \nthe Constitution? You know, prior to the Civil War, in Massachusetts, \nbecause the Constitution permitted slavery, you had over 3,000 people \ngathered in the home State of my colleague from Massachusetts who \ngathered and burned the Constitution. Are we going to have another \namendment to ban burning the Constitution?\n  What about the Bible? That is certainly sacred to millions of \nAmericans. Are we going to make a constitutional amendment on that?\n  Take a look at the New York Times, June 22, 1989. ``Supreme Court, 5 \nto 4.'' I happened to disagree with that decision. Incidentally, \nJustice Hugo Black earlier disagreed with that idea. But by a 5 to 4 \nmajority, including Justice Scalia in the majority, the Supreme Court \nsaid you can, as part of freedom of expression, burn the flag.\n  Right next to it on the front page of the New York Times it says, \n``Chinese Execute Three in Public Display for Protest Role.'' That is \nwhat America is all about, that we can protest in freedom. I do not \nhappen to like protests with burning the flag. But we can stand up and \ndo that.\n  Mr. President, prior to your coming here, one of the most \nconservative men I ever served with in the U.S. Congress was Senator \nGordon Humphrey of New Hampshire. He was more conservative than Senator \nThurmond who just spoke and usually was listed as more conservative \nthan Senator Helms. He got up in opposition to this amendment on the \nfloor. Listen to what Gordon Humphrey had to say.\n\n       I understand the revulsion and the disgust and the popular \n     cry for remedy that arose out of the Johnson decision. I \n     understand that very well. But it seems to me there are times \n     when this body at least ought to be able to rise above \n     popular passion and Gallup polls and political leverage for \n     the next elections and do what is right for posterity. Lord \n     knows, we do not do it with respect to the budget process or \n     any fiscal matters. Let us at least do it with respect to our \n     precious natural rights and the preservation of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Gordon Humphrey, one of the most conservative Members that Senator \nHatch or Senator Kennedy or Senator Heflin or Senator Hollings or I \nserved with.\n  You do not get patriotism by passing laws. We get patriotism by \nhaving the kind of government our Americans can be proud of. And, for \nall its flaws, I am proud of this Government and I am proud of the flag \nthat represents that Government. But, to start, because three people \nlast year burned a flag, and say we are going to rush in to having a \nconstitutional amendment, that is ridiculous. That is not honoring the \nConstitution as we should.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Utah for \nhis courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I do not agree with \nhim, but I thank him. He is ever so gracious.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3094\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the authorization with respect to the States)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I send an amendment to the desk in the \nnature of a substitute for and on behalf of myself, Senator Heflin, and \nSenator Feinstein.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S18325]]\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself, Mr. Heflin, \n     and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3094.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within seven years after the date of its submission \n     for ratification:\n\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all this amendment does is delete the \nStates from the original amendment. It will become the underlying \namendment that others will try to amend.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  I withhold that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Senator Heflin\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this, Mr. President. I would like to spend \na minute or two talking about my friend, Senator Heflin. Let me just \nask my colleagues for their indulgence for a few moments.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Howell Heflin. This is the Hatch-Heflin amendment and Senator \nHeflin and his staff have worked very hard in its favor.\n  Many of us know Howell Heflin as a fine lawyer, judge, and Senator. I \nam not sure my colleagues are aware of another side of the man. I know \nthat others in the Senate served in the military. I know Senator \nThurmond, for example, took part in the Normandy invasion and fought in \nboth the European and Pacific theaters. He parachuted behind the lines \nin those days, and he is a hero to all of us.\n  Howell Heflin won the Silver Star as a Marine officer in World War II \nand later, in the same conflict, was wounded in the hand and leg.\n  The Birmingham News of October 10, 1944, has quite a story on our \ncolleague, noting that ``he is home again in Alabama to modestly and \nreluctantly tell the stories of a Marine first lieutenant's not-to-be-\nenvied life in the Pacific.'' Nearly 50 years later, in a 1994 D-day \nstory in the Washington Times, the reporter remarked, ``When discussing \nthese battles, the senator never uses the personal pronoun. It's always \n`we,' referring to the Marines who fought beside him. He is clearly \nmade uncomfortable when asked to comment on his personal valor.''\n  You can blame our two staffs, Senator Heflin, and I believe our \ncolleagues and the listening audience should know this about our \ncolleague: This is signed by James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy, \nfrom the citation in presenting the Silver Star to him:\n\n       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding \n     Officer of an Assault Platoon attached to a company of the \n     First Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division, during \n     the Battle of Piva Forks, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, on \n     November 25, 1943. When his men were subjected to intense \n     fire from hostile mortars and automatic weapons while \n     advancing on a strongly organized and defended Japanese \n     position, First Lieutenant Heflin promptly and skillfully \n     deployed his platoon and courageously led it through \n     difficult jungle terrain under a barrage of grenades and \n     gunfire to the edge of the enemy's position. Directing his \n     troops in a vigorous, prolonged battle, he frequently exposed \n     himself to devastating fire at close range in order to \n     control the attack more effectively and, by his unflinching \n     determination and aggressive fighting spirit, contributed \n     materially to the defeat of the enemy and the attainment of \n     his company's objective. First Lieutenant Heflin's expert \n     leadership and fearless conduct under extremely hazardous \n     conditions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the \n     United States Naval Service.\n\n  One of his fellow marines from Alabama in the same division, Conrad \nFowler, tells a story in the February 12, 1995, Birmingham News. The \nyoung Heflin was among the first wave to storm Guam, the year following \nBougainville. There, he was wounded as I mentioned earlier, and Mr. \nFowler helped evacuate him.\n\n       Howell was a big guy and we found four of the biggest \n     Marines we could find to carry his stretcher, said Mr. \n     Fowler. The last I saw of them they were going over a hill \n     toward the beach, and Howell was limping along with a stick, \n     and the four Marines were following him, carrying the empty \n     stretcher.\n\n  Here is the bottom line. We can say, nearly 52 years later, as he \napproaches the close of his public service next year, that the words \nused to describe Howell Heflin at the outset of his service to his \ncountry have marked the man throughout his life: ``unflinching \ndetermination''; ``aggressive fighting spirit''; ``expert leadership''; \nand, ``fearless conduct.''\n  I want him to know how much I appreciate working with him in the \nSenate and on the Judiciary Committee. and, in particular, on this very \nimportant amendment that I think would set the tone in this country and \nwould establish a debate on values all over this country that is long \noverdue.\n\n\n                               Compromise\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Having said that, Mr. President, on behalf of Senator \nHeflin, Senator Feinstein, and myself, what we have offered here is a \ncompromise. It deletes the States from the amendment. Only Congress \nwill be given power to protect the flag, if this amendment is adopted.\n  If the amendment I have offered is adopted, the revised amendment \nwould read as follows:\n  ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration \nof the flag of the United States.''\n  This means that only Congress will define the flag of the United \nStates. Only Congress will determine what conduct is illegal. There \nwill not be 50 or 51 different laws protecting the flag, just one. So \nthose who are concerned about a multiplicity of flag protection laws, \nthose who are unwilling to let State legislators handle this issue--the \namendment just offered will meet those concerns. We have, frankly, gone \na long way with this amendment. Frankly, I did not want to make this \nconcession. Restoring the state of the law prior to the Supreme Court's \nerrors in Johnson and Eichman seems perfectly appropriate to this \nSenator, and quite a few of my colleagues. But I am faced with the task \nof trying to assemble 66 votes, and I could not count on those votes \nwith Senate Joint Resolution 31 as introduced. We have a better chance \nif we limit power to protect the flag to Congress. This would, if \nratified, still authorize meaningful protection for the flag.\n  With some reluctance, the American Legion and the Citizens Flag \nAlliance support the amendment. Sometimes compromise is necessary in \norder to try to get the votes needed to pass a particular measure. We \nare trying to gain the necessary support for a flag protection \namendment by seeking to delete the States from the amendment. I believe \nthe flag protection amendment supporters in the other body would accept \nsuch a compromise.\n  I urge all of the cosponsors and other supporters of Senate Joint \nResolution 31 as introduced, to support this amendment. I ask the \nopponents of Senate Joint Resolution 31 as introduced to bend a little, \nas well. Let us send a revised amendment to the other body and to the \nStates and offer the flag protection at the Federal level.\n  I also hope that President Clinton will reconsider his opposition to \na constitutional amendment protecting. We have gone more than halfway \non this.\n\n\n                             compromise ii\n\n  Mr. President, under the substitute I have offered, along with \nSenators Heflin and Feinstein, only Congress can write a statute \nprotecting the American flag. With reluctance, the American Legion and \nthe Citizens Flag Alliance have endorsed this substitute.\n  For those of my colleagues who have been worried about letting the \nAmerican people have the power to protect the flag through their State \nlegislatures, they need worry no longer. For those of my colleagues who \ndo not trust State legislators to protect the American flag in a \nreasonable way, their concerns are over with this amendment.\n  My question to those colleagues is this: Do you trust yourselves to \nwrite a reasonable statute protecting the American flag? If the \namendment is ratified, there are ample safeguards. Here in the Senate, \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle are going \nto be vigilant in writing the statute sent to the floor. The cloture \nrule provides ample protection to \n\n[[Page S18326]]\na minority of Senators who disapprove of any such statute pending on \nthe Senate floor. The President can veto a measure he does not like, \nrequiring a two-thirds vote. We already know how difficult it is to try \nto get such a vote on this issue.\n  Some of my colleagues are concerned about flag bathing suits. This \nwas, in my view, an exaggerated concern at best, but I have not heard \nany of the congressional supporters of the amendment express a desire \nto cover bathing suits. Senators Kennedy, Leahy, Simon, and Feingold \nraised the question in the committee views: ``Would desecration include \nflying the flag over a brothel?'' That is on page 77 of their views. \nSince the amendment talks about physical desecration of the flag, this \nconcern was, frankly, totally misplaced to begin with. But since they \nwill have a say in writing the only statute authorized by the \nsubstitute amendment, I hope their concerns have been substantially \nreduced.\n  This is not the time and place to consider what a Federal statute \nwill look like and I have not given it much consideration because it is \npremature to do so. But I do pledge that we will have fair \nconsideration concerning a proposed statute, if Congress and the States \nratify the amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, we have made a major concession. With the deletion of \nthe States from the amendment, continued opposition to the amendment \nmeans just one thing: It is simply not important enough to protect the \nAmerican flag by amendment, even with one uniform Federal standard \nthroughout the Nation. I hope that some of my colleagues who have \nopposed this amendment in the past will seriously reconsider their \nopposition. I think this is a compromise everyone can defend.\n  The notion that physical desecration of the American flag is a \nfundamental right is an invention of five Supreme Court Justices who \nmade a mistake. If just one Justice had come out the other way, we \nwould not even be on the floor of the Senate debating this issue today.\n  And something else would also be true: The liberties of the American \npeople, including freedom of speech, would be intact. Our liberties \nseemed to survive the 1 Federal statute and 48 State statutes \nprotecting the flag remarkably well. But to listen to the overwrought, \noverblown, and misplaced concerns of the critics of the amendment, one \nwould think we were living in the Dark Ages prior to 1989, when the \nSupreme Court effectively struck them all down. What nonsense. Indeed, \nthe irony is, as I pointed out last Wednesday, during the time these \nflag protection statutes were put on the books, the parameters of \nfreedom of speech actually expanded in this country.\n  We can protect the flag, preserve our liberties, and give voice to a \nfundamental value Americans hold dear, protection of the flag that \nrepresents them, their ideals, their principles, their history, and \ntheir future.\n  One final note, Mr. President. And that is, what is wrong with \nletting the American people make the determination here? Should three-\nquarters of the States ratify this amendment, what is wrong with \ntrusting Congress to write a reasonable statute that would determine \nonce and for all what physical desecration is all about? We can do it, \nand we can do it right without infringing upon scarves or swimming \nsuits or sweaters or ties or any number of other items which can be \nworn with great pride and belief in the flag of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I understand this has \nbeen agreed to by both sides--I ask unanimous consent that our \namendment, the Hatch-Heflin-Feinstein amendment be agreed to and that \nit be considered as original text for purposes of further amendment so \nthese other amendments can be considered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object----\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, under my reservation, it is my understanding \nthat Mr. Hollings has gotten unanimous consent to speak immediately \nfollowing the conclusion of Mr. Hatch's remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks by Mr. \nHollings, I may be recognized for not to exceed 45 minutes to speak out \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to the previous request. I have been \nasked by Mr. Kennedy to request that at the conclusion of my remarks \nhe, Mr. Kennedy, be recognized for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask that my unanimous-consent request be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3094) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. I urge the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been agreed to by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. HATCH. It has been agreed to. All right. Then I move to \nreconsider.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the remarks of Senator Kennedy, who will follow Senator \nHollings and Senator Byrd, Senator Feinstein be given an opportunity to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have before us this afternoon two \nopportunities that could be looked upon by my distinguished colleague \nfrom West Virginia as not an opportunity at all.\n  We have debated the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nalready for a month this year. And on Friday, when we were formulating \na unanimous-consent agreement, I was asked by our distinguished staff \nif I had amendments. I said I had two amendments. They cautioned that I \nwould perhaps have to be prepared to debate them on Monday. I said I \nwould be delighted. They said it could be under a time limitation. I \nsaid that would be very much agreeable to this particular Senator.\n  A point of order could be raised perhaps about the relevancy of my \namendment, and if it were and I was ruled not to be in order, I would \nhave to appeal that in order to get a vote.\n  This particular Senator has waited all year long. I have carried \naround in my pocket the amendment itself. I know the distinguished \nSpeaker of the House has his contract. The distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia has the Constitution that he carries around in his \npocket. There he is. And I have dutifully--in order to bring the truth \nto the American public--carried around an amendment to the Constitution \nfor a balanced budget that did not repeal the formal statutory law \nsigned by President Bush, section 13301 of the code of laws of the \nUnited States.\n  Under the Budget Act, it would not repeal that law but provide, of \ncourse, for a balanced budget. Specifically, Mr. President, if you \nlooked at Section 7, under Senate Joint Resolution 1, that we debated \nfor a month, you can see that all outlays and all revenues be included \nof the U.S. Government. And that repeals, if you please, that section \nof the code, which I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is \n\n[[Page S18327]]\n     amended by adding at the end the following: ``The concurrent resolution \n     shall not include the outlays and revenue totals of the old \n     age, survivors, and disability insurance program established \n     under title II of the Social Security Act or the related \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the \n     surplus or deficit totals required by this subsection or in \n     any other surplus or deficit totals required by this \n     title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, Mr. President, I am reading, of course, from my \nproposed constitutional amendment--and it is important that this \nreading be made formal here--that ``outlays of the Federal Old Age and \nSurvivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust \nFund, as and if modified to preserve the solvency of the funds used to \nprovide Old Age, Survivors and Disability benefits, shall not be \ncounted as receipts or outlays for the purpose of this article.''\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that the intent of the Congress \nis in that particular regard. Very recently, on November 13, I believe \nit was, we voted just exactly that particular instruction. On November \n13, by a vote of 97 to 2, we voted to instruct the conferees on the \nbudget that Social Security trust funds not be used.\n  So the Senators themselves have affirmed that less than a month ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that rollcall vote be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the vote was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       Vote of November 13, 1995\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 572 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Gramm\n     Lugar\n       \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

The reason I do that is so that you shall know how \nMembers vote--not just how they speak but how they cast their formal \nvotes.\n  There has been raised, at the particular time back in February, the \nidea, of course, that the trust funds need not be protected further, \nthat we could always do it by statute.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this particular point that the letter from \nthe American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service dated \nFebruary 6, 1995, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      the Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     To: Senator Dianne Feinstein\n     Attention: Mark Kadesh\n     From: American Law Division\n     Subject: Whether the Social Security Trust Funds Can Be \n       Excluded From the Calculations Required by the Proposed \n       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       This is to respond to your request to evaluate whether \n     Congress could by statute or resolution provide that certain \n     outlays or receipts would not be included within the term \n     ``total outlays and receipts'' as used in the proposed \n     Balance Budget Amendment. Specifically, you requested an \n     analysis as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund could be exempted from the calculation necessary \n     to determine compliance with the constitutional amendment \n     proposed in H.J. Res. 1, which provides that total \n     expenditures will not exceed total outlays.\\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Section 1 of H.J. Res. 1, as placed on the Senate Calendar, \n     provides that total outlays for any fiscal year will not \n     exceed total receipts for fiscal year, unless authorized by \n     three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress. \n     The resolution also states that total receipts shall include \n     all receipts of the United States Government except those \n     derived from borrowing, and that total outlays shall include \n     all outlays of the United States Government except for those \n     used for repayment of debt principal. These requirements can \n     be waived during periods of war or serious threats to \n     national security.\n       Under the proposed language, it would appear that the \n     receipts received by the United States which go to the \n     Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be included in \n     the calculations of total receipts, and that payments from \n     those funds would similarly be considered in the calculation \n     of total outlays. This is confirmed by the House Report \n     issued with H.J. Res. 1.\\2\\ Thus, if the proposed amendment \n     was ratified, then Congress would appear to be without the \n     authority to exclude the Social Security Trust Funds from the \n     calculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of \n     the amendment.\\3\\\n\n                                            Kenneth R.

Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed \n     total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a \n     rollcall vote.\n     Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held by \n     the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n     Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays \n     do not exceed total receipts.\n     Section 4.

Although Social \n     Security accounts are running a surplus at this time, the \n     situation is expected to change in the future with a Social \n     Security related deficit developing. If we exclude Social \n     Security from balanced budget computations, Congress will not \n     have to make adjustments elsewhere in the budget to \n     compensate for this projected deficit. . . .'' Id. at 11.\n     It should also be noted that an amendment by Representative \n     Frank to exempt the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     from total receipts and total outlays was defeated in \n     committee by a 16-19 rollcall vote. Id. at 14. A similar \n     amendment by Representative Conyers was defeated in the \n     House, 141 Cong. Rec. H741 (daily ed. January 23, 1995), as \n     was an amendment by Representative Wise. Id. at H731.\n     \\3\\Although the Congress is given the authority to implement \n     this article by appropriate legislation, there is no \n     indication that the Congress would have the authority to pass \n     legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the \n     amendment.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There are two sentences I will read again, trying to \nsave time. ``If the proposed amendment was ratified''--that is, Senate \nJoint Resolution 1--``then Congress would appear to be without \nauthority to exclude the Social Security trust funds from the \ncalculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of the \namendment.''\n  Then down at the bottom a footnote: ``Although the Congress is given \nthe authority to implement this article by appropriate legislation, \nthere is no indication that Congress would have the authority to pass \nlegislation which conflicts with the provision of this amendment.''\n  So that is why it is very, very important to several on this side of \nthe aisle--because we were in a very, very heated exchange relative, of \ncourse, to the particular balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. And thereby on March 1, five of us on the Democratic side \nof the aisle sent a letter to the majority leader, Robert Dole, the \nprincipal author of Senate Joint Resolution 1, stating that we were \nready, willing, and prepared to vote to pass the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget where that Social Security protection \nnot be repealed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter dated March 1 be \nprinted in the Record at this particular point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert J. Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader, we have received from Senator Domenici's \n     office a proposal to address our concerns about using the \n     Social Security trust funds to balance the Federal budget. We \n     have reviewed this proposal, and after consultations with \n     legal counsel, believe that this statutory approach does not \n     adequately protect Social Security. Specifically, \n     Constitutional experts from the Congressional Research \n     Service advise us that the Constitutional language of the \n     amendment will supersede any statutory constraint.\n       We want you to know that all of us have voted for, and are \n     prepared to vote again for a balanced budget amendment. In \n     that spirit, we have attached a version of the balanced \n     budget amendment that we believe can resolve the impasse over \n     the Social Security issue.\n       To us, the fundamental question is, whether the Federal \n     Government will be able to raid the Social Security trust \n     funds. Our proposal modifies those put forth by Senators Reid \n     and Feinstein to address objections raised by some Members of \n     the Majority. Specifically, our proposal closes a perceived \n     loophole in the Reid and Feinstein language regarding future \n     uses of the Social Security trust funds for purposes other \n     than those for which the system was designed.\n       If the Majority Party can support this solution, then we \n     are confident that the Senate can pass the balanced budget \n     amendment with more than 70 votes. If not, then we see no \n     reason to delay further the vote on final passage of the \n     amendent.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n     Ernest F. Hollings.\n     Wendell H. Ford.\n     Harry M. Reid.\n     Dianne Feinstein.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So, Mr. President, it is quite obvious if the true \nintent is to really pass an amendment to the Constitution requiring a \nbalanced budget, it can be done here in the next 24 hours. There is no \nproblem. It is a wonderful opportunity, because we have the amendment \ndrawn in the proper fashion with two particular changes to Senate Joint \nResolution 1. The one change, of course, was the Nunn amendment about \nthe judicial power not to put balanced budget questions before the \njudiciary but to retain them within the congressional branches; and, \nsecond, of course, to reiterate the statutory law protecting the \nFederal old age and survivors insurance trust fund and federal \ndisability insurance trust fund.\n  Why do I read those words out so specifically? With an intent, Mr. \nPresident. Again, referring to the balanced budget constitutional \namendment report by the Committee on the Judiciary over on the House \nside, you will find in that report this sentence:\n\n       Since Congress possesses the legislative authority to \n     change the Social Security program, specifically referring to \n     ``Social Security'' in the Constitution could create a giant \n     loophole allowing Congress to call anything Social Security \n     and thus evade balanced budget requirements.\n\n  This particular amendment presented for the vote of my colleagues \nhere does not use ``Social Security'' expressed. On the contrary, it is \nthe technical formative law of the United States of America that passed \nin 1935 and up until 1969 was a trust fund and off budget.\n  That was our point that we were making in 1990. We were obscuring the \nsize of the deficit. In fact, Mr. President, it would be well at this \nparticular point, I believe, to include, if you please, a table of the \nvarious deficits.\n  I have before me a table of the deficits for the years beginning in \n1945 going all the way down, the U.S. budget in outlays and trust \nfunds, the real deficit, the gross Federal debt and the gross interest \ncost under the various Presidents.\n  From 1945 until 1996, we have gone from outlays of $92,700,000,000 to \nnow outlays for this fiscal year 1996 of $1,602,000,000,000. You can \nsee how it has grown like Topsy. I remember the last balanced budget. \nTo bring it into the perspective of the distinguished Chair, when \nJohnson balanced the budget back in 1968-69, the entire outlay in 1968-\n69 at that particular time was $178,100,000,000. Can you imagine, \n$178,100,000,000 for guns and butter, for the war in Vietnam and for \nthe Great Society. And paid for with what? With a surplus at that \nparticular time of $300 million. That is--no. That $300 million was \nused from the trust fund. I am looking at the statute in error here. \nLet me look at it accurately. So $300 million was used from the trust \nfunds. That still left a balance of $2.9 trillion. If trust funds were \nnot used really to balance that budget, we had a surplus of $3.2 \nbillion.\n  Here was an entire budget for the Social Security, Medicare, guns and \nbutter, war in Vietnam, defense, and all, welfare and all the other \nprograms. We are expending, instead of the $178 billion, we are \nexpending $348 billion this year just on interest costs for nothing. \nThere is the real problem. And that problem is obscured in large \nmeasure by the use of Social Security trust funds, exactly the opposite \nas contended by my colleagues in that particular House report.\n  For example, Mr. President, look at the Judiciary Committee report of \na balanced budget constitutional amendment as submitted at that \nparticular time over on the House side in January--on January 18 of \nthis particular year. And here is the sentence that will blow your \nmind. ``If we exclude Social Security from balanced budget \ncomputations, Congress will not have to make adjustments elsewhere in \nthe budget to compensate for the projected deficit.''\n  If you have got that kind of logic and thought, we need custodial \ncare for the Members around here. ``If we exclude Social Security from \nthe balanced budget computations, Congress will not have to make \nadjustments elsewhere in the budget.'' Come on. If we exclude Social \nSecurity, that is where we will have to make adjustments elsewhere in \nthe budget to compensate. And that is exactly the point that we have \nbeen trying to make time and time again that we seem to try to hide \nbehind. The truth of the matter is, we are hiding this minute behind \n$481 billion owed Social Security.\n  If the particular budget now in conference and now in negotiation \nbetween the White House and the Congress is enacted in the next 10 \nminutes, by the year 2002, we will owe Social Security \n$1,117,000,000,000. In other words, in the year 2002, they could well \nturn and say, ``Whoopee, we have now preserved and protected \nMedicare.'' And then when we look around at Social Security, we say, \n``Heavens above, we have run it into the hole with over \n$1,117,000,000,000.''\n  Who is going to raise taxes $1 trillion? Who is going to cut benefits \n$1 \n\n[[Page S18329]]\ntrillion? That is why I have been trying to get attention of my \ncolleagues that we have truth in budgeting. And that is why we have the \namendment drawn at this particular time where people on both sides of \nthe aisle--I voted for a constitutional amendment, cosponsored it with \nmy senior colleague back in the 1980's, voted for it several times.\n  But when I realized the import of section 7 under the Dole Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 that it was going to repeal the statutory law that I \nhelped cosponsor, along with Senator Moynihan and Senator Heinz, I \ncould not go in two different directions at the same time.\n  As a person somewhat experienced in budgets, I was able, as Governor \nback in 1959, to get the first AAA credit rating for our State. I \nparticipated in the balanced budget work of 1968-69. I chaired on \nbehalf of the Congress, both Houses, the first reconciliation budget \nconference, the first reconciliation bill signed into law where we cut \nback already appropriated funds in December 1980 under President \nCarter. And I put in the budget freeze. I have cosponsored, with \nSenators Gramm and Rudman, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings initiative. And I \nhave been very alert, as possibly as I can be, to make certain that we \nhave truth in budgeting.\n  And so it is that we have now proposed this particular amendment. I \ncould go on at length as to the debate itself before I present the \namendment.\n  I have this one particular phrase of our majority whip, the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. In February, on national TV, \nSenator Trent Lott stated, and I quote:\n\n       Nobody--Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, \n     moderate--is even thinking about using Social Security to \n     balance the budget.\n\n  Let us hope that is the truth. I think a vote on this particular \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget would give truth to that \nparticular statement. We will see exactly how they vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3095\n\n (Purpose: To propose a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have another amendment. Let me send \nthis one up under the unanimous-consent agreement and ask the clerk to \nreport. I think I have explained it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3095.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After the first article add the following:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law \n     for such an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       ``Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts. The judicial power of the \n     United States shall not extend to any case or controversy \n     arising under this article except as may be specifically \n     authorized by legislation adopted pursuant to this section.\n       ``Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of \n     the United States government except those derived from \n     borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \n     United States government except those for repayment of debt \n     principal. The receipts (including attributable interest) and \n     outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust \n     Fund and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (as and if \n     modified to preserve the solvency of the funds) used to \n     provide old age, survivors, and disabilities benefits shall \n     not be counted as receipts or outlays for the purpose of this \n     article.\n       ``Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with \n     fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning \n     after its ratification, whichever is later.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again, by way of emphasis, it is \nword for word Senator Dole's House Joint Resolution 1, with the \nexception of the Nunn amendment which is included therein with respect \nto the limitation on judicial power on balanced budgets and, second, \nthe Dole section 7, the language that would encompass a repeal of \nsection 13301 of the Budget Act. Specifically, I repeal the repeal. I \nhave provided and continue the protection of 13301.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3096\n\n (Purpose: To propose a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is another wonderful subject we \nhave debated ad nauseam, except with respect abortion. This is one you \ncan really do something about if you really want to limit spending in \ncampaigns as one cancer to public service. Ask the 12 Senators now \nretiring. They would agree in a sentence, Mr. President, that the one \ncancer to public service is money, and if you want to control the \nmoney, then let us get back to the 1974 act as intended.\n  There never was any dispute at that particular time. I remember the \nhistory well. It so happened in the 1968 race of President Nixon that \nhe had thereafter a Secretary of Commerce, Maurice Stans, who went \naround and allocated almost like the United Fund: Your fair share.\n  He came to South Carolina to the textile industry and said, ``Your \nfair share for the Nixon campaign is $350,000,'' and so textile \nentities gathered up $35,000 apiece and sent it to Washington to \nqualify. Other individuals gave a half million dollars. A gentleman \nfrom Chicago gave $2 million.\n  It was thereafter that Secretary of Treasury Connally came to \nPresident Nixon and said,\n\n       Mr. President, there have been substantial contributions \n     made in your behalf and you have not had a chance to even \n     meet some of them, much less thank them personally. I would \n     like to give a barbecue on the ranch down in Texas where you \n     can meet and thank them.\n\n  President Nixon thought that was a wonderful idea, and on that \nparticular weekend, as they turned into the Connally ranch, there was a \nBrinks truck with that prankster Dick Tuck from the Kennedy campaign. \nThey had that all embellished in the news and newspapers and otherwise, \nand everybody in Washington said, ``Heavens above, the Government is up \nfor sale. We have to do something about it.''\n  So in good spirit, both Republicans and Democrats joined hands into \nthe Federal Elections Campaign Practices Act of 1974. At that \nparticular time, we said, ``Look, every dollar in and every dollar out \nis recorded. You cannot give more than $1,000. You cannot, as a PAC, \ngive more than $5,000. You cannot take cash.'' And, for voters in a \nparticular State like Tennessee and South Carolina, we were limited per \nregistered voters. In South Carolina, I remember we were limited to \naround $600,000. The last race I ran for reelection, in 1992, was $3.5 \nmillion. It goes up, up, and away.\n  Right now, every Senator every week has to collect at least $13,000. \nIf you have not collected your $13,000 for your campaign 6 years out, \nyou are behind the curve. You are behind the curve. That statement \nought to embarrass all in America.\n  We have had for 20 years, like a dog chasing its tail around this \nplace, every kind of fanciful idea about how to give public moneys, \nmost of it coming from Common Cause who will not listen. They have a \nPAC. Most PAC's give money. Common Cause gives you a fit. They have no \nidea of giving up their particular power, and so they will not go along \nwith limiting the actual expenditures. Oh, we had the opportunity back \nin 1988. A majority of Senators voted for that one-line constitutional \namendment: ``Congress is hereby empowered to regulate or control \nexpenditures in Federal elections.''\n  With that one line, we can get back to the original intent of 1974 \nand actually limit spending. That was passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote, and \n\n[[Page S18330]]\neveryone realizes the then distinguished Senator from New York, Senator \nJim Buckley, thought otherwise. He sued the Senate and Secretary Valeo.\n  Under the Buckley versus Valeo decision, anyone of good mind and \nspirit would say this is the most flawed decision ever raised. Why do I \nsay that? The Buckley versus Valeo decision of the U.S. Supreme Court \nequated money with speech.\n  If you thought you had the freedom of speech, you would certainly \nhave the freedom of money. And you are exactly right, if you are rich, \nyou have that freedom. But if you are poor, you do not have it, because \nthey immediately went on with the limitations.\n  More particularly, Mr. President, you can take away your opponent's \nspeech if you are affluent and the opponent is not. Specifically, if \nyour opponent has $50,000 and you have $1 million, you wait until \nOctober 10 when people finally get their minds and attention on \ncampaigns, getting ready for the election, then you fill up the \nairwaves, both radio and TV, the billboards, the yard signs, the \nnewspaper advertising. And by November 1, a week ahead of the election, \nyour family will ask, ``What is the matter, aren't you interested? You \nare not even answering.''\n  You do not have the money to answer. You can take away the speech. It \nis the worst decision that you can possibly think of, particularly in \nlight of the Constitution itself.\n  If you read article I, section 4 of the Constitution--and I will read \njust exactly this:\n\n       The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for \n     Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each \n     State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any \n     time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the \n     Places of choosing Senators.\n\n  So, if we have the power at any time by law to alter the manner, it \nappears to this particular Senator we certainly can take the most \ngrievous practice we have in this land of money in politics and put a \ncontrol on it. We control the time, the place, the components of a \ncandidacy and otherwise, and you can go on down the list.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem with which we are \nall too familiar--the ever increasing cost of campaign spending. The \nneed for limits on campaign expenditures is more urgent than ever, with \nthe total cost of congressional campaigns skyrocketing from $446 \nmillion in 1990 to well over $590 million in 1994. For nearly a quarter \nof a century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway campaign spending; \nagain and again, Congress has failed.\n  Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance \nreform efforts, which have bogged down in partisanship as Democrats and \nRepublicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. During the 103d \nCongress there was a sign that we could move beyond this partisan \nbickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion expressed its \nsupport for a limit on campaign expenditures. In May 1993, a nonbinding \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution was agreed to which advocated the \nadoption of a constitutional amendment empowering Congress and the \nStates to limit campaign expenditures. During the 104th Congress, let's \ntake the next step and adopt such a constitutional amendment--a simple, \nstraightforward, nonpartisan solution.\n  As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, \namending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign \nexpenditures is ``the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-\nto-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in \nBuckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance \natmosphere.'' Adds Professor Ashdown: ``If Congress could \nconstitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, \ncandidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the \ntroubles * * * would be eliminated.''\n  Right to the point, in its landmark 1976 ruling in Buckley versus \nValeo, the Supreme Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to \nspend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the \nface of spirited dissents, the Court drew a bizarre distinction between \ncampaign contributions on the grounds that ``* * * the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption \noutweighs considerations of free speech.''\n  I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--\ndoes not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. However, \nit seems to me that the Court committed a far graver error by striking \ndown spending limits as a threat to free speech. The fact is, spending \nlimits in Federal campaigns would act to restore the free speech that \nhas been eroded by the Buckley decision.\n  After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you \nhave personal wealth, then you have access to television, you have \nfreedom of speech. But if you do not have personal wealth, then you are \ndenied access to television. Instead of freedom of speech, you have \nonly the freedom to shut up.\n  So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are \nsomehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points \nout, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution limits and \nspending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not \nmotivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech in \ngeneral.\n  Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is \nthe name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you \ncontrol the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you \ncontrol the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign.\n  Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the \nmedium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear \nprice. In South Carolina, you're talking between $1,000 and $2,000 for \n30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it's anywhere \nfrom $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds.\n  The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on TV, \nyou're not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as incumbents \nflushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those without personal \nwealth are sidetracked to the time-consuming pursuit of cash.\n  The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on \ncampaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much \ncandidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical \nreality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I \nhave $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of his speech. By \nfailing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear \nunwilling to speak up in his own defense.\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent \nto Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, \nJustice Marshall said, ``It would appear to follow that the candidate \nwith a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \nsignificant head start.''\n  Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding \nthe limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall \nspending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal \nwealth.\n  Justice Marshall was dead right. Our urgent task is to right the \ninjustice of Buckley versus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps \non Federal campaign spending. We are all painfully aware of the \nuncontrolled escalation of campaign spending. The average cost of a \nwinning Senate race was $1.2 million in 1980, rising to $2.1 million in \n1984, and skyrocketing to $3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, \nand up to $4.1 million this past year. To raise that kind of money, the \naverage Senator must raise over $13,200 a week, every week of his or \nher 6-year term. Overall spending in congressional races increased from \n$403 million in 1990 to more than $590 million in 1994--almost a 50-\npercent increase in 4 short years.\n  This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. At \nworst, it corrupts and degrades the entire political process. \nFundraisers used to be arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate \nschedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to \naccommodate fundraisers.\n  I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You \nestablish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill \nshift in Greer, visiting a big country store outside of Belton, and so \non. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come \n\n[[Page S18331]]\naround. But in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the \ncountry store have become a casualty of the system. There is very \nlittle time for them. We're out chasing dollars.\n  During my 1986 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to \nget on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It's \na vicious cycle.\n  After the election, I held a series of town meetings across the \nState. Friends asked, ``Why are you doing these town meetings: You just \ngot elected. You've got 6 years.'' To which I answered, ``I'm doing it \nbecause it's my first chance to really get out and meet with the people \nwho elected me. I didn't get much of a chance during the campaign. I \nwas too busy chasing bucks.'' I had a similar experience in 1992.\n  I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: ``They give you a 6-year \nterm in this U.S. Senate: 2 years to be a statesman, the next 2 years \nto be a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagog.'' \nRegrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We \nproceed straight to politics and demagoguery right after the election \nbecause of the imperatives of raising money.\n  My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. It would \nempower Congress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal \ncampaigns. For instance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per \nSenate candidate in a small State like South Carolina--a far cry from \nthe millions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that \ndirect expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For \ninstance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent \norganizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you \ntotal up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly \nthe same amount in 1992.\n  And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that \nspending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already \nhave name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin \nwith a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to \nremind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper \nChamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents \nin the House, I would simply note that more than 50 percent of the \nHouse membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections.\n  I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are \nmore than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, \nspecifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial \nvotes in Congress.\n  I also agree with University of Virginia political scientist Larry \nSabato, who has suggested a doctrine of sufficiency with regard to \ncampaign spending. Professor Sabato puts it this way: ``While \nchallengers tend to be underfunded, they can compete effectively if \nthey are capable and have sufficient money to present themselves and \ntheir messages.''\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending \nlimits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from \nindustry groups, or from PAC's, or from individuals. It is still a \nreasonable--``sufficient,'' to use Professor Sabato's term--amount any \nway you cut it. Spending will be under control, and we will be able to \naccount for every dollar going out.\n  On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never \nbelieved that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the \ncontrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's \nhave brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, \nsmall business people, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They \npermit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band \ntogether with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and \nknown.\n  For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to \nparticipate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and \nsay, ``Oh, no, your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted.'' \nThis is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of \nparticipation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway \ncampaign spending.\n  To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the \npolitical marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections \nare supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate \ninto megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of \ncorporations and special interests.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under \ncontrol. The constitutional amendment I have proposed would permit \nCongress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal \ncampaign expenditures.\n  Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it would end \nthe mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it \nwould free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and \nallow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, \nwe wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep \nour seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And \nfourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal \ncampaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not \ngive candidates an insurmountable advantage.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-\nConstitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates \nthe practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, \nit is not coincidence that all five of the most recent amendments to \nthe Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In elections, \nthe process drives and shapes the end result. Election laws can skew \nelection results, whether you're talking about a poll tax depriving \nminorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign spending \nlimits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These are \nprofound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is \nentirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional \namendment.\n  And let's not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-\nConstitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been \ndithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we \nhaven't advanced the ball a single yard. It has been a quarter of a \ncentury, and no legislative solution has done the job.\n  The last five constitutional amendments took an average of 17 months \nto be adopted. There is no reason why we cannot pass this joint \nresolution, submit it to the States for a vote, and ratify the \namendment in time for it to govern the 1996 election. Indeed, the \namend-the-Constitution approach could prove more expeditious than the \nalternative legislative approach. Bear in mind that the various public \nfinancing bills that have been proposed would all be vulnerable to a \nPresidential veto. In contrast, this joint resolution, once passed by \nthe Congress, goes directly to the States for ratification. Once \nratified, it becomes the law of the land, and it is not subject to veto \nor Supreme Court challenge.\n  And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and \nratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to \nhammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure \nlimits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that \nin 1974, and we can certainly do it again.\n  Mr. President, this joint resolution will address the campaign \nfinance mess directly, decisively, and with finality. The Supreme Court \nhas chosen to ignore the overwhelming importance of media advertising \nin today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it prescribed a bogus \nif-you-have-the-money-you-can-talk version of free speech. In its \nplace, I urge passage of this joint resolution, the freedom of speech \nin political campaigns amendment. Let us ensure equal freedom of \nexpression for all who seek Federal office.\n  Mr. President, we have the Committee on the Constitutional System. I \nwill read the first sentence by the distinguished chairman at the time, \nLloyd N. Cutler:\n\n       Along with Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. \n     Douglas Dillon, I am a cochairman of the Committee on the \n     Constitutional System, a group of several hundred present and \n     former legislators, executive branch officials, political \n     party officials, professors, and civic leaders, who are \n     interested \n\n[[Page S18332]]\n     in analyzing and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed \n     in our political system.\n\n  I will skip over some just to read the conclusion on the third page.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire testimony of Lloyd Cutler be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Statement of Lloyd N. Cutler\n\n       My name is Lloyd N. Cutler. Along with Senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. Douglas Dillon, I am a Co-\n     Chairman of the Committee on the Constitutional System, a \n     group of several hundred present and former legislators, \n     executive branch officials, political party officials, \n     professors and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing \n     and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed in \n     our political system.\n       On of the most glaring weaknesses, of course, is the \n     rapidly escalating cost of political campaigns, and the \n     growing dependence of incumbents and candidates on money from \n     interest groups who except the receipent to vote in favor of \n     their particular interests. Incumbents and candidates must \n     devote large portions of their time to begging for money; \n     they are often tempted to vote the conflicting interests of \n     their contributors and to create a hodgepodge of conflicting \n     and indefensible policies; and in turn public frustration \n     with these policies creates cynicism and contempt for the \n     entire political process.\n       A serious attempt to deal with the campaign financing \n     problem was made in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 \n     and the 1976 amendments, which set maximum limits on the \n     amounts of individual contributions and on the aggregate \n     expenditures of candidates and so-called independent \n     committees supporting such candidates. The constitutionally \n     of these provisions was challenged in the famous case of \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, in which I had the honor of \n     sharing the argument in support of the statute with Professor \n     Archibald Cox. While the Supreme Court sustained the \n     constitutionality of the limits on contributions, it struck \n     down the provision limiting expenditures for candidates and \n     independent committees supporting such candidates. It found \n     an inseparable connection between an expenditure limit and \n     the extent of a candidate's or committee's political speech, \n     which did not exist in the case of a limit on the size of \n     each contribution by a non-speaker unaccompanied by any limit \n     on the aggregate amount a candidate could raise. It also \n     found little if any proven connection between corruption and \n     the size of a candidate's aggregate expenditures, as \n     distinguished from the size of individual contributions to a \n     candidate.\n       The Court did, however, approve the Presidential Campaign \n     Financing Fund created by the 1976 amendments, including the \n     condition it imposed barring any presidential nominee who \n     accepted the public funds from spending more than a specified \n     limit.\n       However, it remains unconstitutional for Congress to place \n     any limits on expenditures by independent committees on \n     behalf of a candidate.\n       In recent presidential elections these independent \n     expenditures on behalf of one candidate exceeded the amount \n     of federal funding he accepted.\n       Moreover, so long as the Congress remains deadlocked on \n     proposed legislation for the public financing of \n     Congressional campaigns, it is not possible to use the public \n     financing device as a means of limiting Congressional \n     campaign expenditures.\n       Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has \n     come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit \n     the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment. The amendment would be a very \n     simple one consisting of only 46 words. It would state merely \n     that ``Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on \n     campaign expenditures by or in support of any candidate in a \n     primary or general election for federal office. The States \n     shall have the same power with respect to campaign \n     expenditures in elections for state and local offices''.\n       Our proposed amendment would enable Congress to set limits \n     not only on direct expenditures by candidates and their own \n     committees, but also on expenditures by so-called independent \n     committees in support of such a candidate. The details of the \n     actual limits would be contained in future legislation and \n     could be changed from time to time as Congress in its \n     judgment sees fit.\n       It may of course be argued that the proposed amendment, by \n     authorizing reasonable limits on expenditures, would \n     necessarily set limits on the quantity of speech on behalf of \n     a candidate and that any limits, no matter how ample, is \n     undesirable. But in our view the evidence is overwhelming by \n     now that unlimited campaign expenditures will eventually grow \n     to the point where they consume so much of our political \n     energies and so fracture our political consensus that they \n     will make the political process incapable of governing \n     effectively. Even the Congress has found that unlimited \n     speech can destroy the power to govern; that is why the House \n     of Representatives has imposed time limits on Members' \n     speeches for decades and why the Senate has adopted a rule \n     permitting 60 senators to end a filibuster. One might fairly \n     paraphrase Lord Acton's famous aphorism about power by \n     saying, ``All political money corrupts; unlimited political \n     money corrupts absolutely.''\n       Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would not be discouraged from \n     taking the amendment route by any feeling that constitutional \n     amendments take too long to get ratified. The fact is that \n     the great majority of amendments submitted by Congress to the \n     states during the last 50 years have been ratified within \n     twenty months after they were submitted. All polls show that \n     the public strongly supports limits on campaign expenditures. \n     The principal delay will be in getting the amendment through \n     Congress. Since that is going to be a difficult task, we \n     ought to start immediately. Unlimited campaign expenditures \n     and the political diseases they cause are going to increase \n     at least as rapidly as new cases of AIDS, and it is high time \n     to start getting serious about the problem.\n       Mr. Chairman, on three past occasions we the people have \n     amended the Constitution to correct weaknesses in that \n     rightly revered document as interpreted by the Supreme Court. \n     On at least two of those occasions--the Dred Scott decision \n     and the decision striking down federal income taxes, history \n     has subsequently confirmed that the amendments were essential \n     to our development as a healthy, just and powerful society. A \n     third such challenge is now before us. The time has come to \n     meet it.\n       For a fuller discussion of the case for a constitutional \n     amendment, I am attaching an article written shortly before \n     his death by Congressman Jonathan Bingham, my college and law \n     school classmate and, in my view, one of the finest public \n     servants of our times.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read this sentence on the third page:\n\n       Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has \n     come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit \n     the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a \n     constitutional amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I take the position--for those who are interested in \nthe Bill of Rights and the first amendment and the freedom of speech--\nthat the Supreme Court erroneously amended the Constitution, or \ndeteriorated the value and worth of the freedom of speech under the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  So what we are trying to do is not treat lightly, by any manner or \nmeans, the Constitution or amendments. Others will get up and say we \nhave had 3,564 amendments offered and here comes another. Not at all. \nWe have tried in Congress after Congress after Congress, for over 20-\nsome years now, to correct this particular flawed decision of Buckley \nversus Valeo, and get back to controlling spending in politics. The one \nway to do it is take the amendment that I have, which I will send to \nthe desk. This amendment would provide the authority for both the \nUnited States and the several States within their particular \njurisdiction, because it was asked to be amended accordingly at the \ntime we debated it last, on how the States also ought to have this \nparticular authority.\n  The last 10 amendments to the Constitution--their time for \nratification has been 20 months. There is no doubt in this particular \nSenator's mind that this could easily be ratified next November 1996. \nThen the Congress could come back and they could get to this bundling \nproblem, this third party problem, and they can get to all the little \ntricks in politics, national committees, individual committees, and \neverything else of that kind, and we can legislate the honest intent of \na majority of Democrats and Republicans in a former session, getting \nback to what we intended in 1974. We said on the floor of this body \nthat you cannot buy this election anymore. Instead, under Buckley \nversus Valeo, that is the only way.\n  We have a candidate right now for President who has never run for \nanything, and he has one idea about the flat tax that will give himself \na tax cut, and he is buying up $25 million of airwaves in the \nRepublican primaries. That would ordinarily be an embarrassment. The \nfact that it is accepted has embarrassed this particular Senator.\n  We have to get away from that kind of nonsense. Just because you are \nrich and you can buy up time and you have never even been in a \ncampaign, and others have been in there 2, 3 years, you can get up \nthere in 2 months and run No. 2--just by money? A flat tax is no unique \nidea. Come on. So that is what is occurring. We ought to all be \nembarrassed, and we ought to jump at the chance of correcting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report. \n  \n[[Page S18333]]\n\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3096.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After the first article add the following:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.

Mr. President, I have been recognized to speak out of \norder.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has made a difficult and courageous \ndecision to accept a role in leading a NATO deployment of forces to \nimplement the peace treaty that the parties to the Bosnia conflict have \ninitialed and that they will soon sign. It was only through strong, \npersistent, and courageous leadership that these parties reached an \nagreement to end their atrocious, murderous, ethnic savagery at all.\n  What is crystal clear is that our European allies, half a century \nafter the end of World War II, are dependent on the United States for \nleadership on the European Continent. This is a result of the \ncontinuous commitment of America to defend Europe against possible \naggression by the Soviet empire for many, many years, and of the United \nStates, being willing to provide the glue of military and economic \nleadership on the European Continent. This reliance on the United \nStates is testimony, one might surmise, to a job that the United States \ndid almost too well, too unselfishly, and under administrations of both \npolitical parties.\n  The argument can be made and will be made that this conflict in \nBosnia is a European conflict, and that Europeans should police it \nwithout asking the United States to take the lead. That is a logical \nargument. I agree with it. But what is logical, unfortunately, is not \nreality in that sense.\n  The probable effect on the future of NATO--indeed, of Europe itself--\nof a decision by America not to lead this force can be gleaned from the \nhistory of the first half of this century, when the United States \nrefused to take a leadership role, but then was later pushed into \nentering a European conflict and suffered heavy casualties in the \nprocess. I have lived through that. History is clear.\n  So to those who would say that this conflict is Europe's business and \nthat America need not be involved, they certainly have a point, but \nthere is the history that I have been talking about, and there is in \nthe history of this century a warning about the possible, even \nprobable, results of that view in this situation that we are facing.\n  This vital military relationship with Europe also affects U.S. vital \ninterests in other areas of the world, as well as in Europe. How will \nother nations depend on the United States, on our word, if we walk away \nfrom NATO by not participating in this unique NATO mission? Our \nsecurity relationships with NATO, with Asian nations, and elsewhere, \nare intimately tied through our trading, banking, and diplomatic \nrelationships. U.S. military leadership and security agreements create \na strong base upon which to build fertile economic and diplomatic \nrelationships. It is a mistake to view this current situation as some \nsort of stand-alone problem.\n  The outcome of U.S. failure to support NATO in this operation could \naffect U.S. interests in other parts of the world and at other times in \nhistory. The risks of not attempting to stabilize the conflict in the \nBalkans, resulting in the war's spreading outside the immediate theater \nof conflict that would be a likely consequence, are substantial and \ntroubling. Left unchecked, the Bosnian conflict could spread to \nMacedonia and Albania, dragging NATO allies Greece and Turkey into an \nescalating ethnic conflict. That would be disastrous for the future \nwith respect to the interests of NATO and certainly with respect to our \nown overall security interests.\n  I do not think I need to point out the damage to the NATO alliance \nthat would result from such an eventuality. U.S. troops are still on \nwatch over Iraq, which remains a threat to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. \nShould Iraq move against Kuwait once again, would we be able to count \non our allies to stand with us against Iraq a second time?\n  Whether we like it or not, as we are fond of saying, the United \nStates is the world's sole remaining superpower. I find it ironic that \nsome Senators who promote robust defense budgets, even at the expense \nof not funding needed domestic infrastructure, educational, and other \nneeds, still shrink from endorsing a role for the United States which \nhas been requested by the NATO alliance. Given our power, given the \nunbroken leading role we have played in Europe throughout the entire \nsecond half of this century, indeed, given the size of our military \nbudget--I am not altogether supportive of that particular size inasmuch \nit is representative of the $7 billion increase over and above the \nPresident's budget, which I think is too much at this particular time--\nit cannot be much of a surprise that European powers are heavily \ndependent on the United States to lead NATO in implementing a peace \ntreaty in Bosnia. It is, in fact, the case that NATO is now vigorous, \nand, as Secretary of Defense Perry testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on Wednesday, December 5 of this year, more united \nthan ever before. Indeed, it is a major development that the French \nhave now agreed to participate in the NATO Military Committee, \nreversing a standoffish position that has so often characterized \nFrance's relationship with NATO since the day of General Charles de \nGaulle. It is both notable and telling that while there has been a lot \nof fiery rhetoric in Congress about not placing U.S. troops under the \ncommand of foreign military officers, none of our NATO allies, and none \nof the other nations sending troops to Bosnia, has expressed any \nreservation about putting their soldiers under U.S. command. Even the \nRussian troops who will serve under the U.S. lst Armored Division \naround Tuzla have had great difficulty, as a matter of fact had greater \ndifficulty in putting themselves under NATO command than under U.S. \ncommand. This is another testament, it seems to me, to U.S. leadership.\n  President Clinton and the United States accepted a leadership role in \nBosnia only reluctantly. We all can recall the cries of outrage from \nacross the United States a year or two ago, as media coverage of \nwartime atrocities in Bosnia were beamed into our living rooms. \nPictures of refugees fleeing burned-out homes, pictures of skeletal \nprisoners of war recounting tales of torture and suffering, of sobbing \nwomen admitting to the rapes they endured, pictures of stoic faces of \nUnited Nations observers chained to ammunition bunkers--all of these \nimages led to cries for action by the United States, cries for \nimmediate military reprisals from across the United States.\n  This was the reaction driven by the media, driven by the electronic \neye, and perhaps it is too bad in a sense that we are to be driven and \nare to let ourselves be driven by that electronic eye, by that \ntelevision tube.\n  But the President did not commit U.S. troops to such an effort, and \nin my opinion he would have been on dubious constitutional grounds had \nhe done so. I know there are those who would say he is the Commander in \nChief and that he has that authority. I am not going into that argument \nat this point but I am prepared to, and may do so before many days have \npassed--that is a very dubious ground of constitutionality. He \n\n[[Page S18334]]\npromised troops for our NATO mission on the ground in Bosnia only to \nhelp implement a peace agreement, and there was no peace agreement in \nsight at that time. Now, there is a peace agreement in sight, brought \nabout in large part by the efforts of this administration, and we are \nfaced with the decision of whether or not to support that agreement. We \ncan be sure that those calls for U.S. military action would be heard \nagain, should those tragic images be resurrected as a result of our \nunwillingness to follow through on this opportunity; that is what it \nis, an opportunity. That is all it is at the moment, an opportunity. We \nhope that it will eventually lead to peace, but it is an opportunity \nfor peace.\n  In many ways, Bosnia represents the future of conflict in the world--\nan ugly, convoluted, and murderous small war with the ability to spread \nacross borders and to convocate and to draw in neighboring nations and \nreligio-ethnic groups. There is no clear superpower prism to focus and \nsharpen the lines between warring factions, as there was in the cold \nwar. We cannot intervene in all of these conflicts, of course, nor can \nwe hope to solve all of them. But some can be averted, or shortened, or \nperhaps settled, as Iraq, and now, hopefully, Bosnia has been, or soon \nwill be, by the combined efforts of the United States and other powers. \nNo single nation can wade in and settle these conflicts as they are too \ndeep-seated, too complex. This places a premium on coalition building \nand on cooperative efforts by interested parties. It is an approach \nthat worked in Iraq, and hopefully will work in Bosnia. United States \nleadership and participation have been critical, but we cannot do it \nalone, anymore than the other nations concerned about Bosnia can do \nit--or will do it--without us.\n\n  The Dayton accords, to be signed in Paris on December 14, are \nimpressive. They comprise the basis for a new start for all the people \nof Bosnia, covering territorial, military, civil, governmental, and \nelectoral matters. Not every issue is finally resolved, not every issue \nwill be finally resolved, but additional negotiations are called for to \nresolve the outstanding issues. All three parties to the conflict have \ninitialed these accords, and all three parties have pledged to abide by \nthem. All the parties have sought this peace, and have made the many \ndifficult decisions necessary to reach agreement on these accords. \nAfter almost 4 years of bitter conflict, this is truly an impressive \nachievement, and one that should not be underestimated.\n  The administration has done a good job in testifying before \ncongressional committees, in laying out in detail the military plan and \ntasks that we would undertake to fulfill the NATO implementation plan.\n  I have participated in hearings by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, of which I am a member. I have likewise participated in \nhearings by the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member.\n  So the administration has presented its case. It has responded to \nquestions and, in my judgment, candidly.\n  We are all very cognizant of the risks of casualties, and the \nadministration is very clear on that point, that there are risks of \ncasualties. And we are rightly concerned about the prospects of mission \ncreep and the resulting quagmire that could develop when unforeseen \nevents attempt to push us into an undefined, interminable and \nescalating involvement which none of us wants and which none of us--\nthis Senator in particular--is willing to support. I believe that the \nadministration is also concerned about these possibilities, and that we \nmust reject any attempt to expand the limited military role in Bosnia \nbeyond that which has been projected and assured as being the limit by \nthe administration. We must guard against mission creep. We saw that in \nSomalia. When that happened, then I insisted on an amendment. It was my \namendment which drew the line in the sand and said, ``This far, no \nfarther. If there is a request, if there is justification for staying \nlonger, then come back, come back to Congress, seek authorization and \nappropriations.'' So the power of the purse was the magic ointment that \nassured that such a line could be drawn and that it could be enforced.\n  The United States can be proud of its professional, volunteer \nmilitary. These men and women are well trained, well armed, willing and \nready to meet any challenge.\n  I have heard it said that they are the best America has ever \nproduced. I am not one who would say that, having lived through two \nworld wars, the war in Vietnam and the war in Korea. The United States \nhas produced great armies, great navies, military forces manned by \npatriotic individuals who were well trained in past wars. So, some who \nfought in World War II may question the saying that today's military is \nthe best that America has ever produced. We can say that no better has \nbeen produced. And we can be proud of our military men and women.\n  These men and women are well trained, they are well armed, and they \nare willing and ready to meet any challenge, and they understand the \nrisks that they face better than I can ever hope to do. They are \nprepared to operate effectively and decisively in Bosnia.\n  So, I again commend the President in arranging the Dayton meetings \nand putting together this opportunity to bring peace to the Balkans. \nThis was quite an achievement in reaching the Dayton accords, quite an \nachievement in bringing the parties together, quite an achievement in \ngetting them to initial an agreement. It is a noble effort, worthy of \nAmerica, and it holds promise for a more enlightened 21st century than \nwas the reality of the 20th century. American leadership, we have \nlearned, makes a difference, and the world recognizes that American \nleadership makes a difference. Nevertheless, Mr. President, the \nAmerican people are not anxious to risk their children to tame the \nexcesses of other nations and ethnic groups. We do so very reluctantly, \nand that is as it should be. But when we contemplate an action such as \nthe President has proposed in the Balkans, the chances of success are \ngreatly enhanced if the execution of the operation is bipartisan and if \nthe President has the support of the Congress in this endeavor.\n  I wrote to the President on October 13, urging him to seek the \nsupport of Congress before beginning this mission, and I commend him \nfor replying in the affirmative on October 19. He promised to provide \nsuch a request ``promptly after a peace agreement is reached.'' And in \nthe next 2 minutes, such a letter will be faxed, as I have just been \nadvised.\n  It is a truism that when the President succeeds, America succeeds. \nAnd if he does not succeed, the Nation as a whole loses. The majority \nleader, Mr. Dole, has the experience and wisdom to understand this \nfundamental axiom of American power and influence, and I commend our \nmajority leader for throwing his support behind the President in the \nexecution of this national commitment. He has done the right thing for \nour country, and I believe the Congress as a whole should step up to \nthe plate and accept its share of the responsibility.\n  The Constitution places upon the Congress the authority to declare \nwar. Is one to suppose that anything less than a declaration of war \nshifts the responsibility elsewhere? I will have more to say on this \nlater.\n  We in the Senate should come down on this one way or the other. It is \nthe responsibility of the Congress. That is where the responsibility \nrests. That is where it is vested by the Constitution, and we should be \nwilling to step up to the plate and vote one way or the other.\n  We have a constitutional duty to do so. We have an obligation to the \npeople who voted to put us here to stand up for what we believe. One \nmay wish to vote no; one may wish to vote aye. It seems to me that we \nhave a responsibility to vote one way or the other. Ducking around the \nissue, hedging our bets and avoiding responsibility are not what the \nvoters sent us here for. Our constituents deserve our considered \njudgment and expect us to take a stand on actions which will put their \nchildren at risk in foreign lands.\n  Our foreign military men and women will not have the opportunity to \nhedge their bets. They are being sent to battle, and they will stand at \nthe plate. And we have a responsibility to do the same. The \nConstitution places that responsibility right here.\n  I believe that any resolution that we pass on this matter should \nclearly state that the Congress is approving \n\n[[Page S18335]]\nthe operation. I would prefer to use the word ``authorizing'' the \noperation. That is what we did in the case of the war in the Persian \nGulf. Congress authorized the President of the United States, the words \nbeing these, and I quote from the Joint Resolution, Senate Joint \nResolution 2, as voted on January 12, 1991: ``The President is \nauthorized,'' et cetera.\n  So we should take a clear stand. It should have the effect of giving \nthe President the clear aegis of congressional authority that there is \nno doubt in the minds of friend or foe.\n  I can understand those who may wish to vote against such a measure, \nbut vote we should. It should have the effect, as I say, of giving the \nPresident a clear aegis of congressional authority, which will help our \nmilitary forces to succeed, and thus help America to succeed.\n  Some have compared this upcoming vote to the vote authorizing \nPresident Bush to lead U.S. troops into combat in Operation Desert \nStorm against Iraq, and I just referred to that resolution. Unlike the \nPersian Gulf war, when an economic embargo that was only just beginning \nto bite into the Iraqi economy provided an alternative to war, an \nalternative that I favored--an alternative that I believe most of the \nChiefs of Staff favored, an alternative that I seem to remember General \nPowell favored--that I favored at that time over risking U.S. service \nmen and women to combat, there is no comparable current alternative in \nthe case of Bosnia. All of the alternatives have been tried over the \nlast 3 or 4 years and have played out whatever impact they had.\n  The economic embargo on Serbia did have an important influence on the \nbehavior of President Milosevic in seeking a peaceful settlement. In \nthe end, however, only resolute U.S. and NATO military power have \ncreated conditions in which all of the warring factions have sought \npeace and have sought to protect this fragile commitment with the \nsecurity of a NATO presence.\n  This is unique. It is unique. In Bosnia, our mission is to deter \nfurther war, to ensure stability by our very presence, and to give all \nthree parties a chance to back away from conflict and begin anew in \npeace. This is an important difference. America has long valued peace \nand valued compromise over conflict.\n  We should think long and we should think hard before we consider \nrejecting this compromise, this chance for peace instead of more war. \nIn the end, we do not know how this effort will turn out. It is a \nserious undertaking, as can be said of many decisions that have been \nmade by our forbears in the past and in many actions that have been \ntaken by our forefathers in the past. The outcome was not assured in \ntheir day. The outcome is not assured here, but we must make the best \npossible choice and decide what is best for America's security \ninterests.\n  Furthermore, there has been concern over the so-called exit strategy; \nthat is, the standards of success and benchmarks of military action by \nthe international force which will result in a departure of our forces. \nThe Secretary of Defense, Mr. Perry, and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, testified on Wednesday, \nDecember 5, 1995, that they will have no trouble in completing the \nmilitary mission and removing our forces from the ground operation in \nBosnia in ``approximately'' a year.\n  That is the exit strategy! Let us vote on language putting their \nassurances into print, into law, into the action of the Senate. That is \nthe exit strategy, ``approximately 1 year.'' Indeed, they have \nemphatically argued that the military missions are structured so as to \nbe able to be accomplished well within that time period.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes and 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The Dayton agreement itself, in Article I, General Obligations, \nstates that the parties ``welcome the willingness of the international \ncommunity to send to the region, for a period of approximately one \nyear, a force to assist in implementation of the territorial and other \nmilitarily related provisions of the agreement.'' Therefore, the \nexpectation of the parties themselves in language that they have \ninitialed is that approximately 1 year is what they get in terms of the \nNATO operation. This is the clear understanding of the duration of the \nmilitary mission, and so I think that there should be no ambiguity \nabout this, no invitation to mission creep, no cloud of uncertainty \nthat we are being drawn into a quagmire. The administration and the \nparties themselves, therefore, have made it indubitably clear that the \nmission is for approximately 1 year, and the American people have a \nright to expect it to last no longer than that.\n  The military operation should not be dependent upon the success of \nreconstruction attempts by civilian agencies, should not be dependent \non the pace of civilian reconstruction, should not be dependent on \nelections, or other nonmilitary tasks. Therefore, I think it is \nappropriate to write into whatever resolution we pass a clear date \ncertain--if not that, then the words ``approximately 1 year''--so that \nit would be clear as to when U.S. forces will be expected to have \nfulfilled their mission and departed. I suggest that it be the language \nbecause that is the language the administration witnesses, that is the \nlanguage that the President, and that is the language that the parties \nto the agreement themselves have proposed.\n  The language then should say--should, indeed, let the President \nknow--that we expect that word to be kept. If for some unforeseen \nreason the circumstances are such that there may appear to be \njustification for seeking an extension, then I think that the President \ncan come back to the Congress at that time and seek an extension, and \nseek the appropriations that are necessary, and Congress may at that \ntime then address such a request promptly and appropriately, based on \ncircumstances at such time.\n  I am not saying that Congress would favorably respond or that it \nwould not favorably respond. But, again, Congress would speak. The \ndeadline itself then is the ultimate exit strategy, and the \nadministration can clearly plan its activities and withdrawal in an \norderly fashion with that deadline understood from the outset. There \nwill be no ambiguity about timeframes, then, regarding American \nmilitary involvement and exposure of our forces to extended risk in \nBosnia.\n  I should say that such language in no way would prevent the troops \nfrom being withdrawn earlier than ``approximately 1 year,'' if all goes \nas well as expected. And if the mission does not go well, I remind my \ncolleagues that Congress has the ability to end U.S. participation \nearlier, if necessary. Congress retains the power of the purse. I hope \nthat Congress will think long and many times before it ever shifts that \npower of the purse to the Chief Executive.\n  Congress retains the power of the purse and can at any time draw a \ndateline for cutting off the funds for the mission and bringing the \ntroops home. This is the ultimate authority, the ultimate authority of \nCongress and the ultimate authority of the American people through \ntheir elected representatives in Congress. And the power of the purse \nis the ultimate oversight tool of the Congress.\n  While I accept the assurances of our military leadership that the \nmission is achievable and that U.S. forces are well prepared to deal \nwith the expected problems that may arise, if the situation changes and \nthe parties resume their conflict despite our efforts and despite their \npledges, then I would support action to bring our troops home, as I \nhave done in the past.\n  There may well be needed a follow-on security force, manned by \nEuropean troops on the ground, when the U.S. mission is over. I \nstrongly encourage the administration to begin planning for such a \nturnover now. While U.S. leadership is needed now to stabilize the \nsituation, after it is stabilized an insurance policy in the way of a \nresidual European force should be contemplated.\n  I say all of this, Mr. President, after long consideration and with \ndeep personal reflection and concern. This is a sober, somber thing \nthat we are contemplating. I feel deeply my obligations to the \nConstitution and to the people of West Virginia and to the people of \nthe United States and to our men and women in uniform. West Virginians \nwill play a role in this mission as they have done so well and so \nvaliantly in so many U.S. military missions throughout the Nation's \nhistory. \n\n[[Page S18336]]\n\n  West Virginians were playing a role even before West Virginia itself \nbecame a State. Even before it became the 35th star in the universe of \nstars, the people of West Virginia, the people beyond the mountains, \nbeyond the Alleghenies played a role. The 152nd POW Information Center, \nan Army National Guard unit in Moundsville, WV, is among the units that \nhave been ordered to deploy to Bosnia. I wish them well, and I will \nremember their patriotism daily.\n  West Virginia is a great and patriotic State with a history of \nmilitary service. As a percentage of her eligible population, West \nVirginia stands at the top--not at the bottom, but at the top--in \ncombat casualties in U.S. military operations during the more than 200-\nyear history of our Nation. West Virginia also has citizens whose \nheritage is Croat, Serb, and Bosnian Moslem--not many, but some. So the \npeople of West Virginia, while most concerned about the fates of the \nU.S. soldiers, sailors, and airmen serving their country around the \nworld, are not unmindful of the people of Bosnia.\n  In mid-November, the capital city of Charleston, WV, voted to become \nthe sister city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. Charleston \nchurches, other religious institutions, and the University of \nCharleston have generously and selflessly volunteered to support \nBosnian refugees, and I am moved by these acts of kindness. We in West \nVirginia may be physically isolated in our mountains. We do not bemoan \nthat fact. As a matter of fact, we look upon those mountains with \nimmense pride. We may be isolated, but we are not unmindful of the \nplight of the common people of Sarajevo and the whole of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina.\n  This NATO operation in Bosnia in support of the Dayton peace \nagreement can be a turning point in the history of the Balkans. There \nare no other viable alternatives to ending this conflict. There is no \nother alternative to the exercise of American leadership and resolve \nthat has led to this last true attempt at peace.\n  The President is exercising leadership, and he is rightly seeking the \nsupport of the people and he is rightly seeking the support of the \nCongress of the United States for this mission. It is our \nconstitutional obligation here in the Congress to consider this mission \nand the consequences of this mission for American interests. It is our \nobligation to vote, and it is our obligation to watch over the \nexecution of the mission.\n  I have been glad to see the Senate conducting the hearings and the \ndebate that have led up to this upcoming vote. These have been lengthy \nhearings. They have been probing, and they have been thoughtful. There \nhave been thoughtful questions and there have been thoughtful answers, \nand this could be a proud moment in the history of the Senate.\n  I hope that we can give the troops and the President the guidance and \nsupport that I believe are necessary to see this mission through \nsuccessfully.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, I read from a letter that has been sent to our \nDemocratic leader, Mr. Daschle, and I understand that the Democratic \nleader has no objection to my reading from this letter and that he \nauthorizes my doing so.\n  The letter says in part--it is addressed to the leader:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I consider the Dayton peace agreement to \n     be a serious commitment by the parties to settle this \n     conflict. In light of that agreement and my approval of the \n     final NATO plan, I would welcome a congressional expression \n     of support for U.S. participation in a NATO-led \n     implementation force in Bosnia. I believe congressional \n     support for U.S. participation is immensely important--\n\n  Let me say that again.\n\n       I believe congressional support for U.S. participation is \n     immensely important to the unity of our purpose and the \n     morale of our troops.\n\n  Mr. President, I add my own feeling that congressional support is not \nonly immensely important, but it is also vital, in my judgment, it is \nvital to the success of the effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on behalf of Mr. Daschle that \nthe entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Just four weeks ago, the leaders of \n     Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia came to Dayton, Ohio, in America's \n     heartland, to negotiate and initial a peace agreement to end \n     the war in Bosnia. There, they made a commitment to peace. \n     They agreed to put down their guns; to preserve Bosnia as a \n     single state; to cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal and \n     to try to build a peaceful, democratic future for all the \n     people of Bosnia. They asked for NATO and America's help to \n     implement this peace agreement.\n       On Friday, December 1, the North Atlantic Council approved \n     NATO's operational plan, OPLAN 10405, the Implementation of a \n     Peace Agreement in the Former Yugoslavia. On Saturday, \n     General George Joulwan, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, who \n     will be commanding the NATO operation, briefed me in Germany \n     on the final OPLAN.\n       Having reviewed the OPLAN, I find the mission is clearly \n     defined with realistic goals that can be achieved in a \n     definite period of time. The risks to our troops have been \n     minimized to the maximum extent possible. American troops \n     will take their orders from the American general who commands \n     NATO. They will be heavily armed and thoroughly trained. In \n     making an overwhelming show of force, they will lessen the \n     need to use force. They will have the authority, as well as \n     the training and the equipment, to respond with decisive \n     force to any threat to their own safety or any violations of \n     the military provisions of the peace agreement. U.S. and NATO \n     commanders believe the military mission can be accomplished \n     in about a year.\n       A summary of the OPLAN is attached. Of course, members of \n     my staff and the Administration are available to answer your \n     questions and further brief you on the OPLAN as you require.\n       I consider the Dayton peace agreement to be a serious \n     commitment by the parties to settle this conflict. In light \n     of that agreement and my approval of the final NATO OPLAN, I \n     would welcome a Congressional expression of support for U.S. \n     participation in a NATO-led Implementation Force in Bosnia. I \n     believe Congressional support for U.S. participation is \n     immensely important to the unity of our purpose and the \n     morale of our troops.\n       I believe there has been a timely opportunity for the \n     Congress to consider and act upon my request for support \n     since the initialing in Dayton on November 21. As you know, \n     the formal signing of the Peace Agreement will take place in \n     Paris on December 14.\n       As I informed you earlier, I have authorized the \n     participation of a small number of American troops in a NATO \n     advance mission that will lay the groundwork for IFOR, \n     starting this week. They will establish headquarters and set \n     up the sophisticated communication systems that must be in \n     place before NATO can send in its troops, tanks and trucks to \n     Bosnia.\n       America has a responsibility to help to turn this moment of \n     hope into an enduring reality. As the leader of NATO--the \n     only institution capable of implementing this peace \n     agreement--the United States has a profound interest in \n     participating in this mission, which will give the people of \n     Bosnia the confidence and support they need to preserve the \n     peace and prevent this dangerous war in the heart of Europe \n     from resuming and spreading. Since taking office, I have \n     refused to send American troops to fight a war in Bosnia, but \n     I believe we must help now to secure this Bosnian peace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senate. I thank Senators. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts if recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the constitutional \namendment we are debating this afternoon and will be voting on \ntomorrow. The first amendment is one of the great pillars of our \nfreedom. It has never been amended in over 200 years of our history and \nnow is no time to start.\n  Flag burning is a vile and contemptuous act, but it is also a form of \nexpression protected by the first amendment. Surely we are not so \ninsecure in our commitment to freedom of speech and the first amendment \nthat we are willing to start carving loopholes now in that majestic \nlanguage.\n  And for what reason? What is the menace? Flag burning is exceedingly \nrare. Published reports indicate that fewer than 10 flag burning \nincidents have occurred a year since the Supreme Court's decision in \nTexas versus Johnson in 1989. According to the Congressional Research \nService, there were 7 reported incidents in 1990; 13 in 1991; 10 in \n1992; 0 in 1993; and 3 in 1994.\n  Mr. President, this is hardly the kind of serious and widespread \nproblem in \n\n[[Page S18337]]\nAmerican life that warrants a loophole in the first amendment. Surely \nthere is no clear and present danger that warrants such a change.\n  Mr. President, we just heard the excellent statement of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. His statement emphasized that issues of security \nand interests of peace in the Balkans are a matter of great importance \nto the American people. It is right that we will debate issues relating \nto national security and the well-being of our men and women under \narms.\n  Similarly, it is essential that we discuss our Nation's domestic \npriorities as we address the budget and the deficit. Hopefully debate \nwill lead to progress in an area of great importance.\n  We also would agree, I daresay, that the issues facing the children \nof this country--the strength of our educational system, the violence \nengulfing our society, the exposure to substance abuse and other health \nrisks--are a matter of importance and deserve extensive debate.\n  But, when you look at the incidents of flag desecration during the \nlast 5 years--three in 1994, none in 1993--it is difficult to believe \nthat we are going to take time to amend the first amendment to the \nConstitution. I think such an action fails the reality test.\n  I can remember listening to a speech given by Justice Bill Douglas, \none of the great Supreme Court Justices. Students asked him what was \nthe most important export of the United States. He said, without \nhesitation, ``The first amendment.'' That is the defining amendment for \nthe preservation of speech and religion, so basic and fundamental in \nshaping our Nation. Now, in the next 2 days, are we going to make the \nfirst alteration to the first amendment? I believe it is not wise to do \nso.\n  The first amendment breathes life into the very concept of our \ndemocracy. It protects the freedoms of all Americans, including the \nfundamental freedom of citizens to criticize their Government and the \ncountry itself, including the flag. As the Supreme Court explained in \nTexas versus Johnson, it is a ``bedrock principle underlying the first \namendment * * * that the Government may not prohibit the expression of \nan idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive and \ndisagreeable.''\n  Of course we condemn the act of flag burning. The flag is a grand \nsymbol that embodies all that is great and good about America. It \nsymbolizes our patriotism, our achievements, and reverence our \nreverence for freedom and democracy.\n  But how do we honor the flag by dishonoring the first amendment? \nConsider the words of James Warner, a former marine aviator, who was a \nprisoner in North Vietnam from 1967 to 1973:\n\n       It hurts to see the flag burned, but I part company with \n     those who want to punish the flag burners. . .. I remember \n     one interrogation [in North Vietnam] where I was shown a \n     photograph of Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves you are wrong.'' ``No,'' I \n     said. ``That proves that I am right. In my country we are not \n     afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with \n     us.'' The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face \n     purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto the table and \n     screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting, I was \n     astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I \n     have never forgotten that look nor have I forgotten the \n     satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n\n  Mr. President: this is James Warner, former marine, prisoner of war \nfor over 7 years.\n\n       It hurts to see the flag burned, but I part company with \n     those who want to punish the flag burners. . . I remember one \n     interrogation [in North Vietnam] where I was shown a \n     photograph of Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. \n     ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest \n     against your cause. That proves you are wrong.'' ``No,'' I \n     said. ``That proves that I am right. In my country we are not \n     afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with \n     us.'' The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face \n     purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto the table and \n     screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting, I was \n     astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I \n     have never forgotten that look nor have I forgotten the \n     satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n\n  Mr. President, that says it all. We respect the flag the most, we \nprotect it the best, and the flag itself flies the highest when we \nhonor the freedom for which it stands.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment, granting Congress power to \nprohibit physical desecration of the flag, does not amend the first \namendment. The flag amendment overturns two Supreme Court decisions \nwhich have misconstrued the first amendment.\n  The first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech has never been \ndeemed absolute. Libel is not protected under the first amendment. \nObscenity is not protected under the first amendment. A person cannot \nblare out his or her political views at 2 o'clock in the morning in a \nresidential neighborhood and claim first amendment protection. Fighting \nwords which provide violence or breaches of the peace are not protected \nunder the first amendment.\n  The view that the first amendment does not disable Congress from \nprohibiting physical desecration of the flag has been shared by ardent \nsupporters of the first amendment and freedom of expression.\n  In Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576 (1969), the defendant burned a \nflag while uttering a political protest. The Court overturned his \nconviction since the defendant might have been convicted solely because \nof his words. The Court reserved judgment on whether a conviction for \nflag burning itself could withstand constitutional scrutiny. [Id. at \n581.] Chief Justice Warren dissented, and in so doing, asserted:\n\n       I believe that the States and the Federal Government do \n     have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \n     and disgrace . . . Id. at 605 (Warren, C.J., dissenting).\n\n  Justice Black--generally regarded as a first amendment \n``absolutist''--also dissented and stated:\n\n       It passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American Flag an offense. Id. at 610 (Black, J., \n     dissenting).\n\n  Justice Fortas agreed with Chief Justice Warren and Justice Black:\n\n       [T]he states and the Federal Government have the power to \n     protect the flag from acts of desecration committed in \n     public. . . . [T]he flag is a special kind of personality. \n     Its use is traditionally and universally subject to special \n     rules and regulation. . . . A person may ``own'' a flag, but \n     ownership is subject to special burdens and responsibilities. \n     A flag may be property, in a sense; but it is property \n     burdened with peculiar obligations and restrictions. \n     Certainly . . . these special conditions are not per se \n     arbitrary or beyond governmental power under our \n     Constitution. Id. at 615-617 (Fortas, J., dissenting).\n\n  Prof. Stephen B. Presser of Northwestern Law School testified before \nthe Subcommittee on the Constitution on June 6:\n\n       The Flag Amendment would not in any way infringe the First \n     Amendment. . . . The Flag Protection Amendment does not \n     forbid the expression of ideas, nor does it foreclose \n     dissent. [Written Testimony of Professor Stephen B. Presser, \n     June 6, 1995 at p. 11]\n\n  ]Richard Parker, professor of law at Harvard Law School, testified:\n\n       The proposal would not ``amend the First Amendment.'' \n     Rather, each amendment would be interpreted in light of the \n     other--much as in the case with the guaranties of Freedom of \n     Speech and Equal Protection of the Laws. When the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was proposed, the argument could have been made \n     that congressional power to enforce the Equal Protection \n     Clause might be used to undermine the First Amendment. The \n     courts have seemed able, however, to harmonize the two. The \n     same would be true here. Courts would interpret \n     ``desecration'' and ``flag of the United States'' in light of \n     general values of free speech. They would simply restore one \n     narrow democratic authority. Experience justifies this much \n     confidence in our judicial system.\n       But, we're asked, is `harmonization' possible? If the \n     Johnson and Eichman decisions protecting flag desecration \n     were rooted in established strains of free speech law--as \n     they were--how could an amendment countering those decisions \n     coexist with the First Amendment?\n       First, it's important to keep in mind that free speech law \n     has within it multiple, often competing strains. The \n     dissenting opinions Johnson and Eichman were also rooted in \n     established arguments about the meaning of freedom of speech. \n     Second, even if the general principles invoked by the five \n     Justices in the majority are admirable in general--as I \n     believe they are--that doesn't mean that the proposed \n     amendment would tend to undermine them, so long as it is \n     confined, as it is intended, to mandating a unique exception \n     for a unique symbol of nationhood. Indeed, carving out the \n     exception in a new amendment--rather than through \n     interpretation of \n\n[[Page S18338]]\n     the First Amendment itself--best ensures that it will be so confined. \n     Even opponents of the new amendment agree on this point. \n     Third, it's vital to recognize that the proposed amendment is \n     not in general tension with the free speech principle \n     forbidding discrimination against specific `messages' in \n     regulation of speech content. Those who desecrate the flag \n     may be doing so to communicate any number of messages. They \n     may be saying that government is doing too much--or too \n     little--about a particular problem. In fact, they may be \n     burning the flag to protest the behavior of non-governmental, \n     `patriotic' groups and to support efforts of the government \n     to squash those groups. Laws enacted under the proposed \n     amendment would have to apply to all such activity, whatever \n     the specific `point of view.' One, and only one, generalized \n     message could be regulated: `desecration' of the flag itself. \n     And regulation could extend no farther than a ban on one, and \n     only one, mode of doing it: `physical' desecration. Finally, \n     and perhaps most importantly, we mustn't lose sight of the \n     fundamental purpose of the proposed amendment. That purpose \n     is to restore democratic authority to protect the unique \n     symbol of our aspiration to national unity, an aspiration \n     that, I've said, nurtures--rather than undermines--freedom of \n     speech that is ``robust and wide-open. [Written Testimony, \n     Professor Richard D. Parker, June 6, 1995, pages 6-8, \n     footnotes omitted].\n\n  In short, Mr. President, there is no conflict between the flag \nprotection amendment and the first amendment--we are only overturning \ntwo mistaken Supreme Court decisions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Stevens, be permitted to speak after our friend, \nthe Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think you have heard some very eloquent words from \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts. I respect him greatly. I respect \nthe words he said. I think what this proves is that there is no lack of \npatriotism on either side of this debate. Patriotism and love of \ncountry are equally as strong for those of us on each side of this \ndebate.\n  I support a constitutional amendment to restore protection to our \nnational flag. I do so not in deference to political expediency, but \nbecause I believe it is the right thing to do. And I have believed this \nfor a long time. Today I have an opportunity to say why.\n  Our national flag has come to hold a unique position in our society \nas the most important and universally recognized symbol that unites us \nas a nation. No other symbol crosses the political, cultural, and \nideological patchwork that makes up this great Nation and binds us as a \nwhole. The evolution of the American flag as the preeminent symbol of \nour national consciousness is as old and as rich as the evolution of \nour country itself.\n  I will never forget the emotion I felt as a child when I saw that \nfamous photograph by photographer Joe Rosenthal--a photograph of the \nsoldiers raising the American flag at Iwo Jima--capturing in one moment \nin time, the strength and the determination of this entire Nation.\n  The unique status of the national flag has been supported by \nconstitutional scholars as diverse as Chief Justices William Rehnquist \nand Earl Warren, and Justices John Paul Stevens and Hugo Black.\n  The flag flies proudly over official buildings, and many Americans \nfly them at their homes. I happen to be one of them.\n  Our history books are replete with the stories of soldiers, beginning \nwith the Civil War, who were charged with the responsibility of leading \ntheir units into battle by carrying the flag. To them it was more than \na task--it was an honor worth dying for, and many did. When one soldier \nwould fall, another would take his place, raise the flag, and press \nforward. They would not fail. Their mission was too important; the \nhonor too great; flag and country too respected to give anything short \nof their lives to succeed.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, our flag is recognized as unique, not \nonly in the hearts and minds of Americans, but in our laws and customs \nas well. No other emblem or symbol in our Nation carries with it such a \nspecific code of conduct and protocol in its display and handling.\n  Here are just a few sections of the Federal law:\n\n       The United States flag should never be displayed with the \n     Union down, except as a signal of dire distress or in \n     instances of extreme danger to life or property.\n       The United States flag should never touch anything beneath \n     it--ground, floor, water or merchandise.\n       The United States flag should never be dipped to any person \n     or thing.\n       The United States flag should never be carried \n     horizontally, but it should always be carried aloft and free.\n\n  Why then, should it be permissible conduct to urinate on, to defecate \non, or to burn the flag? That is not my definition of free speech.\n  Until the Supreme Court's decision in Texas versus Johnson in 1990, \n48 of 50 States had laws preventing the burning or defacing of our \nNation's flag.\n  I do not take amending the Constitution lightly. However, when the \nSupreme Court issued the Johnson decision and then the Eichman \ndecision, those who wanted to protect the flag were forced to find an \nalternative path.\n  The Nation's flag is a revered object as well as a symbol. I believe \nthat it should be viewed as such--as a revered national object, not \nsimply as one of many vehicles for free speech.\n  Everything about the flag in its tangible form, in its very fabric, \nhas significance. The shape, the colors, the dimensions, and the \narrangement of the patterns help make the flag what it is.\n  The colors of the flag were chosen by the Continental Congress in the \n18th century. In 1782, the Congress of the Confederation chose the same \ncolors for the Great Seal of the United States: Red for hardiness and \ncourage; white for purity and innocence; blue for vigilance, \nperseverance, and justice.\n  If one were to change the colors, the orientation of the stripes, or \nthe location of the field of stars, it would no longer be the American \nflag. What I am saying is that I believe that the physical integrity of \nthe flag is crucial.\n  Despite this fact, because the flag also has symbolic value, the \nSupreme Court has determined that physically burning or mutilating the \nflag does not destroy the symbol. Therefore, a prohibition on burning \nor mutilating the flag would not serve a ``compelling'' governmental \ninterest and could not be justified under the first amendment.\n  I do not agree. I believe that burning, tearing, and trampling on the \nobject undermines the symbol. The process may be incremental, but over \ntime the symbol erodes. The Supreme Court arguably has placed the flag \nin a kind of catch-22 situation. Because the flag is so important, \nbecause the flag is unique, because the flag has such powerful symbolic \nvalue, it, ironically, goes unprotected.\n  I support Senate Joint Resolution 31 because it will return the \nNation's flag to the protected status I believe it deserves. The \nauthority for the Nation to protect its central symbol of unity was \nconsidered constitutional until 5 years ago.\n  In the Senate Judiciary Committee's markup of Senate Joint Resolution \n31, I proposed alternative legislation with more specific, narrowly \ntailored language. Although this was not voted on in committee, \nChairman Hatch offered to work with me to see if we could develop \nlanguage we could agree upon.\n  He has now proposed the substitute amendment that I believe \nrepresents a vast improvement over the original language of Senate \nJoint Resolution 31.\n  The original language would have allowed Congress, as well as each of \nthe 50 States, to develop legislation prohibiting the desecration of \nthe flag. In other words, each State would have been authorized to \ndefine ``flag,'' and each State would have been authorized to define \n``desecration.''\n  The proposed substitute amendment offered earlier this afternoon \nwould give Congress, and Congress alone, the authority to draft a \nstatute to protect the flag. This will give Congress the opportunity to \ndraft, carefully and deliberatively, precise statutory language that \nclearly defines the contours of prohibited conduct, something along the \nlines of the language I offered in committee. It would allow Congress \nto establish a uniform definition for ``flag of the United States,'' \nrather than allowing for 50 separate State definitions. \n\n[[Page S18339]]\n\n  Because we are protecting our national symbol, it makes sense to me \nthat Members of Congress, representing the Nation as a whole, should \ncraft the statute protecting our flag.\n  Let me add that, from a first amendment perspective, a specific \nconstitutional amendment prohibiting flag burning may be preferable to \na statute. Harvard Law Prof. Frank Michelman made this point in a 1990 \narticle, ``Saving Old Glory: On Constitutional Iconography.''\n  Although not himself an advocate of flag protective prohibitions, \nProfessor Michelman argued that a specifically worded constitutional \namendment related to flag burning could be preferable to a statute, \nposing fewer potential conflicts with the first amendment. An amendment \npertaining exclusively to the flag would have little risk of affecting \nother kinds of expressive conduct. The premise of his argument is that, \nwhen the Constitution is amended, Supreme Court review is not required.\n  By contrast, a statute, if challenged, could only survive if the \nSupreme Court ultimately determined it to be constitutional. In other \nwords, the Court would need to justify that the statute conformed to \nexisting freedom-of-expression doctrine. In so doing, the Court \narguably would need to develop a rationale that could ultimately serve \nto justify prohibitions on other kinds of symbolic expression.\n  So, I believe that those who say we are making a choice between \ntrampling on the flag and trampling on the first amendment are creating \nan unfair dichotomy. Protecting the flag will not prevent people from \nexpressing their ideas through other means, in the strongest possible \nterms.\n  Furthermore, the right to free speech is not unrestricted. For \nexample, the Government can prohibit speech that threatens to cause \nimminent tangible harm, including face-to-face ``fighting words,'' \nincitement to violation of law, or shouting ``fire'' in a crowded \ntheater. Obscenity and false advertising are not protected under the \nfirst amendment, and indecency over the broadcast media can be limited \nto certain times of day. Ever since Justice Brennan's 1964 decision in \nNew York Times versus Sullivan, statements criticizing official conduct \nof a public official may be sanctioned if they are known to be false \nand if they damage the reputation of the official. There is much that \nis open to debate about the proper parameters of free speech.\n  In voting for this legislation, however, I extend a cautionary note. \nThis amendment should not be viewed as a precedent for a host of new \nconstitutional amendments on a limitless variety of subjects. The \nConstitution was designed to endure throughout the ages, and for that \nreason it should not be amended to accommodate the myriad of issues of \nthe day. My support of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag \nreflects the gravity of my belief in the purpose.\n  I recognize that by supporting a constitutional amendment to protect \nthe flag, I am choosing a different course from many Democrats in \nCongress and, quite frankly, from many of my close friends for whom I \nhave the greatest respect.\n  But my support for this amendment reflects my broader belief that the \ntime has come for the Nation to begin a major debate on values. I \nbelieve that this country must look at itself in the mirror and come to \nterms with those values. I do not wish to imply that one set of values \nis necessarily superior to another. But we cannot keep pressing the \nenvelope and still remain a functional society.\n  We need to ask ourselves what we hold dear--Is there anything we will \nnot cast contempt upon? We need to ask ourselves: How can we foster \nrespect for tradition as well as for ideological and cultural \ndiversity? How can we foster community as well as individuality, \nnationhood as well as internationalism? These are all important values, \nand we have to learn to reconcile them. We must not jettison one at the \nexpense of another.\n  The Framers of the Constitution recognized two important elements of \nour constitutional tradition: a liberty element and a responsibility \nelement. Without responsibility, without a rule of law, there could be \nno protection of life, limb, or property--there could be no lasting \nliberty. I believe there is a danger of moving too far in either \ndirection--toward too restrictive order, or toward unlimited individual \nliberty.\n  In this instance, I believe we cannot tilt the scales entirely in \nfavor of individual rights, when there exists a vast community of \npeople in this country who have gone to war for our flag. And there are \nmothers and fathers and wives and children who have received a knock at \ntheir front door and have been told that their son, or husband, or \nfather had died alone, in a trench. They were given a flag on this \noccasion, a flag which helps preserve the memory of their loved one, \nand which speaks to his or her courage.\n  Last June, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Rose \nLee of the Gold Star Wives of America, an organization representing \n10,000 widows of American servicemen. This is what she said:\n\n       The flag, my flag, our flag . . . means something different \n     to each and every American. But to the Gold Star Wives, it \n     has the most personal of meanings. Twenty-three years ago \n     this American flag covered the casket of my husband, Chew-Mon \n     Lee, United States Army. . . Every Gold Star Wife has a flag \n     like this one, folded neatly in a triangle and kept in a \n     special place . . . My husband defended this flag during his \n     life . . . [b]urning the flag is . . . a slap in the face of \n     every widow who has a flag just like mine.\n\n  Requiring certain individuals to refrain from defacing or burning the \nflag, I believe, is a small price to pay on behalf of the millions of \nAmericans for whom the flag has deep personal significance. Just 5 \nyears ago, when 48 States had laws against flag burning, the first \namendment continued to thrive.\n  I believe that this legislation will protect the integrity of the \nflag while keeping our first amendment jurisprudence intact. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is a unanimous-consent \nrequest for the senior Senator from Alaska to proceed at this time, is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator, my good \nfriend, is not on the floor at the moment. I ask unanimous consent that \nI might be able to proceed, and I assure my friends that if he arrives, \nI will yield to him at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair and my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I find flag burning a reprehensible form of protest. \nWe have, in this the greatest democracy on Earth, freedom of speech, \nand we have so many ways that we can have political debate and well-\nunderstood protests, that it seems like a slap at so many people in \nthis country, certainly those of us who serve our country and are sworn \nto uphold its laws, and a particularly vile form of protest. It demeans \nan important symbol of our country and shows disrespect for the \nsacrifice so many have made to preserve our freedoms. I know that the \nveterans, the Gold Star Wives, whom the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia just referred to, and others who are pressing for this \namendment are doing so out of sincerity and out of a strong sense of \npatriotism.\n  I feel fortunate that we live in a country where the vast majority--I \nwould say 99.9 percent--of our citizens share a deep respect for the \nflag and all that it symbolizes. It was one of the first things that my \ngrandparents saw when they came to this country--not speaking a word of \nEnglish but knowing it was a symbol of freedom.\n  Indeed, most of us do not need a law or the Constitution to require \nus to honor America. We do so willingly and spontaneously, as I do when \nI fly the flag at my home in Vermont.\n  We salute the flag and we stand for ``The Star Spangled Banner'' not \nbecause the law compels it, but out of respect. These are ways of \nexpressing our thanks to those who have left us such a rich heritage. \nIt is that respect that comes voluntarily, that comes from a sense of \nour history and our debt to prior generations that inspires us to \nsalute, not the command of law or outside imposition of any legal \nrequirement. \n\n[[Page S18340]]\n\n  I believe that we are being asked to take steps down a road that \nleads to a weakening of the Bill of Rights and our fundamental \nguarantees of freedom. No right is more precious than that of freedom, \nand no freedom is more important than the first amendment's guarantee \nof freedom of speech. Even though, for a good cause, this proposed \nconstitutional amendment would restrict others' free speech rights, it \nwould set a dangerous precedent.\n  I believe--and I have said it many times on the floor--that the first \namendment is the most valuable bedrock in our Constitution and in our \ndemocracy. The first amendment guarantees us the right to practice any \nreligion we want, or no religion if we want. It gives us the right of \nfree speech. That right is unprecedented in any other significant \ncountry on this Earth. It guarantees diversity of religion, diversity \nof belief, diversity of speech, and if you have protected diversity, \nyou have a democracy.\n  I cannot believe that there is a Member of this Senate--certainly not \nmyself--who was not offended, in 1989 and 1990, by the publicity-hungry \nflag burners. I am offended to see the American flag burned or trampled \noverseas. I am offended when our President and Commander in Chief and \nhis family are subjected to mean-spirited and defamatory \ncharacterizations, and when nationally syndicated radio personalities \ntalk about how to shoot to kill Federal law enforcement officers.\n  I am offended when anyone makes such a suggestion.\n  I am offended by militant extremists who called our Senate colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania a representative of ``corruption and tyranny'' when \nhe chaired a hearing exposing their ideas. I am offended by those who \nspew racial and ethnic hatred. I am offended that the Supreme Court of \nthe United States required Columbus, OH, to allow the Ku Klux Klan to \nerect in a public square the KKK's ``symbol of white supremacy and a \ntool for the intimidation and harassment of racial minorities, \nCatholics, Jews, Communists and other groups hated by the Klan.'' There \nis certainly much that offends in our contemporary society.\n  But we must resist the temptation to make an exception here to limit \none form of obnoxious speech. The guts of the first amendment is its \nextraordinary protection of antigovernment, political speech. Nowhere \nelse in the world or through history has there been such a profound \ncommitment to allow unrestricted criticism of those in power. The \nshouts of protest disturb, provoke, challenge, and offend. We must \ntolerate them because they also demonstrate the strength of America.\n  Polls and resolutions of State legislatures are being cited as \nreasons to support this proposed constitutional amendment. I have \nthought hard about the argument that this is a populist amendment and \nthat the States should be given the opportunity to decide whether to \namend our Constitution. In many settings, this would be a strong \nargument. But here, we are confronted with a proposed amendment to the \nBill of Rights, and to that part of the first amendment intended to \nprotect the minority from an orthodoxy of the majority.\n  We are this year commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the \nSecond World War. While that profound conflict raged, in June, 1943, \nthe Supreme Court decided West Virginia State Board of Education versus \nBarnette, a case that raised the question whether children attending \npublic schools could be compelled to salute the flag and pledge \nallegiance. The Court held, over the vigorous dissent of Justice \nFrankfurter, that the State could not employ such compulsion to achieve \nnational unity, even in that time of world war.\n  The Supreme Court's opinion was written by Justice Robert Jackson, a \nformer Attorney General of the United States who later served as the \nchief prosecutor at the Nurenberg trials. Let me quote from Justice \nJackson's opinion:\n\n       The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials and to establish them as legal principles to be \n     applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and \n     property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship \n     and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be \n     submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no \n     elections. . . .\n       The case is made difficult not because the principles of \n     its decision are obscure but because the flag involved is our \n     own.\n       Nevertheless, we apply the limitations of the Constitution \n     with no fear that freedom to be intellectually and \n     spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the \n     social organization. To believe that patriotism will not \n     flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and \n     spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an \n     unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to \n     free minds. We can have intellectual individualism and the \n     rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds \n     only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal \n     attitudes. Where they are so harmless to others or to the \n     State as those we deal with here, the price is not too great. \n     But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not \n     matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test \n     of its substance is the right to differ as to things that \n     touch the heart of the existing order.\n       If there is any fixed star in our constitutional \n     constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can \n     prescribe what shall be orthodox politics, nationalism, \n     religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to \n     confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any \n     circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now \n     occur to us.\n\n  If World War II itself was not a circumstance that permitted an \nexception to the first amendment to foster patriotism and national \nunity, I do not believe that the potential for disrespectful political \nprotest of today's Government policy provides the justification \nrequired by article V of the Constitution for its amendment. There \nexists no compelling reason for limiting the Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud that earlier this year the Vermont Legislature chose the \nfirst amendment over the temptation to take popular action. The Vermont \nHouse passed a resolution urging respect for the flag and also \nrecognizing the value of protecting free speech ``both benign and \novertly offensive.'' Our Vermont attorney general has urged that we \ntrust the Constitution and not the passions of the times.\n  Vermont's action this year is consistent with its strong tradition of \nindependence and commitment to the Bill of Rights. Indeed, Vermont's \nown Constitution is based on our commitment to freedom and our belief \nthat it is best protected by open debate. Vermont did not join the \nUnion until the Bill of Rights was ratified and part of the country's \nfundamental charter.\n  Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to Congress and he cast the decisive vote \nof Vermont for the election of Thomas Jefferson. He was the same House \nMember who was the target of a shameful prosecution under the Sedition \nAct in 1789 for comments made in a private letter. Vermont served the \nNation again in the dark days of McCarthyism when Senator Ralph \nFlanders stood up for democracy and in opposition to the repressive \ntactics of Joseph McCarthy. Vermont's is a great tradition that we \ncherish and that I intend to uphold.\n  I have deep respect for the position of William Detweiler, the \nnational commander of the American Legion. When he testified this year \nbefore the Judiciary Committee he shared with us his concern that we, \nas a country, ``slide down that slippery slope * * * every time we deny \nour heritage.'' But the slippery slope that most concerns me is the \nproposed restriction of the Bill of Rights and the precedent such an \namendment would establish.\n  Never in our history as a Nation have we narrowed the Bill of Rights \nthrough constitutional amendment. Our history has been one of expanding \nindividual rights and protections.\n  Some of our colleagues contend that because the flag is such a unique \nnational symbol, this will be the only time that we will be called upon \nto limit first amendment rights. Unfortunately, no one can give that \nassurance or make such a guarantee. Just this session, in the wake of \nthe bombing in Oklahoma City, the Senate passed a terrorism bill that \nincludes new limits on associational rights and, in the heat of the \nmoment, 84 Members of this body voted to censor the Internet and \ncriminalize private, constitutionally protected speech that might be \nconsidered indecent during consideration of the telecommunications \nbill. We cannot be so sure that without the bulwark of the first \namendment our rights will be protected.\n  Barely 5 years ago a similar proposed constitutional amendment was \nconsidered and rejected by this Senate after \n\n[[Page S18341]]\nthe U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the conviction in the Eichman case \nresulted from an unconstitutional application of the Flag Protection \nAct of 1989. Little has changed. Indeed, in the intervening years, \nfollowing the protests sparked by Desert Storm, there have been only a \nhandful of flag burnings. None was reported in 1993 and three were \nreported in 1994, as the drive to amend the Constitution built \nmomentum.\n  In 1990, 42 Senators stood up for the Bill of Rights and voted \nagainst the constitutional amendment we are voting on again today. I \nurge my colleagues to join with me to preserve the Constitution and \nprotect the very principles of freedom that the flag symbolizes. \nFundamental constitutional principles are too important for partisan \npolitics or short-term expediency. Let us not allow this matter to \ndevolve into the bumper sticker politics of emotion that has so \ndominated this Congress.\n  One of the best statements that I have ever seen in all the years \nthat we have been debating this issue is that by James H. Warner, a \nformer Marine flyer who had been a prisoner of the North Vietnamese for \n5\\1/2\\ years. I ask that his full statement from July 1989 be printed \nin the Record and urge my colleagues to consider it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 1995]\n\n     When They Burned the Flag Back Home--Thoughts of a Former POW\n\n                          (By James H. Warner)\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force \n     base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I \n     looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as \n     tears filled my eyes. I saluted it. I never loved my country \n     more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver \n     Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared \n     with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to \n     serve the cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time after 5\\1/2\\ years, it hurts me \n     to see other Americans willfully descreate it. But I have \n     been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of \n     hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the \n     flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish \n     the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were \n     wrong if we would only apologize, we could be released early. \n     If we did not, we would be punished. A handful accepted, most \n     did not. In our minds, early release under those conditions \n     would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades of our country \n     and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the \n     summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutriton. I had \n     long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal \n     parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our \n     cause worth all of this? Yes, it was worth all this and more.\n       Rose Wilder Lane in her magnificent book ``The Discovery of \n     Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men \n     must know in order to be free. They must know that all men \n     are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free. \n     Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept \n     bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal \n     to teach slaves to read.\n       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp. \n     Maoists believe that ideas are merely the product of material \n     conditions; change those material conditions, and one will \n     change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``reeducate'' \n     us. If we could show them that we would not abandon our \n     belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the \n     falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by \n     teaching them about freedom through our example. We could \n     show them the power of ideas.\n       I do not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country \n     protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No.'' I said, ``That proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an \n     instant his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction. I felt at using his tool, the picture of \n     the burning flag, against him.\n       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party, \n     was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British \n     definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view, Bevan \n     responded forcefully that if Khrushchev really wanted to know \n     the difference, he should read the funeral oration of \n     Pericles.\n       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides' \n     ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted \n     democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the \n     Spartans, he said the Athenians did not fear freedom. Rather \n     they viewed freedom as the very source of their strength. As \n     it was for Athens, so it is for America--our freedom is not \n     to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. The flag in Dallas was burned to protest the \n     nomination of Ronald Reagan, and he told us how to spread the \n     idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America into \n     ``a city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't \n     be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. While a prisoner of war, he was shown a photo of Americans \nprotesting the Vietnam war by burning a flag. His reaction was that of \na true American hero: He turned the use of the photo against his \ncaptors by proclaiming that the photo proved the rightness of the cause \nof freedom. He was proud that we in this great country ``are not afraid \nof freedom, even if it means that people disagree with us.'' Let us \nheed his words and ``not be afraid of freedom.''\n  Mr. President, we are each custodians of the Constitution as well as \ncontemporary representatives during our brief terms in office. We were \ngiven a Bill of Rights that has served to protect our rights and speech \nfor over 200 years. We should provide no less to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  My family and I fly the flag at our home. I display it in my office. \nNo law tells me to do that. Love of my country and its symbols tells me \nto. That love is far more compelling than any law.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this resolution proposes a constitutional \namendment to empower Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of \nthe flag. I have come to commend my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, \nfor his leadership on this issue; and I am pleased to join with him as \na sponsor of the proposal.\n  On this subject, I do believe I speak for a majority of Alaskans as I \nsupport this legislation. Mr. President, 90 percent of Alaskans who \nhave contacted my office since this matter was proposed are in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  Our support comes on a little different basis, Mr. President, than \nothers who stand on this floor. We live a long way from this Capitol. \nWe are actually closer to Tokyo than to Washington, DC. We are an \nindependent bunch. Yet we have some very deep-seated feelings on this \nissue. Why are we for this bill? It is because the flag is truly the \nsymbol of the Nation that we sought to join as a State not too long \nago.\n  As a veteran, I have felt and seen our flag's importance overseas. \nLiving away from home, overseas, away from our freedoms, those of us \nwho served during the long period of World War II learned to respect \nour flag deeply. It represents what our country stands for, qualities \nthat no other nation can offer its citizens. We stand for freedom in \nthis country, and that is what this flag reminds us all of. Our \nNation's anthem, ``The Star Spangled Banner,'' captures the bond that \nAmericans feel toward our flag.\n  The flag does, in fact, represent America. The 13 stripes represent \nthe 13 States that brought about our Constitution. There are 50 stars, \none for each State. I remember well the day that the 49th star was \nplaced on that flag. I was in Maryland assisting in raising the first \nflag. And also in Alaska, once a territory, now becoming a State, Rita \nGravel, the wife of a former Senator, climbed up a long ladder to pin \nthe 49th star on a flag flying in our major city. Those of us who had \nworked in the statehood movement will never forget that moment. It \nmeant a great deal to us.\n  In short, it is more than just a symbol. It is a question of \nbelonging. Every State is represented there on that flag, and that has \nbeen our tradition since the very beginning. As I said, participating \nin the statehood movement, which does not happen very often, is \nsomething that is deeply ingrained in the soul. It was and remains \nmeaningful to us to have our star on the flag.\n  I think, then, that desecration of the flag has meant a great deal to \nStates. \n\n[[Page S18342]]\n I am not sure how many Members of the Senate know, it has probably \nbeen said on the floor time and time again, but 48 of our States had \nlaws on the books that punished flag desecration when the Supreme Court \nrejected such laws.\n  The Supreme Court has indicated that, absent an expression from the \nnational legislature, State and Federal prohibitions on flag \ndesecration are subject to strict first amendment proscriptions. I do \nbelieve we must act now to give our people the opportunity to reverse \nthat position.\n  I do not take too lightly, and I do not think Alaskans take too \nlightly, the concept of suggesting and supporting amendments to our \nConstitution. That is a powerful action to suggest, and a route that \nhas not been taken too often by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, we pledge allegiance to our flag and to the Nation it \nrepresents. If anyone doubts, really, what it means to a veteran to \nconsider the flag, I think a person should take a trip to the Iwo Jima \nmonument. Nothing, I think, represents the Nation the way the flag \ndoes. Therefore, I am hopeful that this amendment will be approved by \nour States, and that it will restore the demand for everyone in this \nNation to respect the symbol of our freedoms.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for his \nexcellent statement and for the continuing great work that he does as a \nMember of the Senate. I really appreciate him personally and I \nappreciate his support for this amendment.\n  I might mention that earlier in the day my colleague and friend from \nMassachusetts said there just are not many flag-burning desecrations, \nand he cited some statistics that I think are quite wrong.\n  Based on information provided to me by the Congressional Research \nService, the number of flags desecrated have been as follows--and keep \nin mind these are ones that are reported, the ones where we have had a \nfuss about. This does not begin to cover those desecrated that were not \nreported:\n  In 1990, at least 20 flags in this country; in 1991, at least 10 \nflags; in 1992, at least 7 flags; in 1993, at least 3 flags; in 1994, \nat least 5 flags; for a total of 45 flags between 1990 and 1994. In \n1995, there have been over 20 flags so far.\n  Every one of these known flag-burning cases have been covered by the \nmedia, so millions of people have been affected by them. Millions of \npeople have seen our national symbol desecrated and held in contempt.\n  Millions of people are beginning to wonder, why don't we have any \nvalues in this country? Why don't we stand up for the things that are \nworthwhile? Why don't we stand up for our national symbol? What is \nwrong with that?\n  What this amendment would do is allow the Congress of the United \nStates to pass legislation that would protect the flag. What is so \nwrong about that? It would allow us to do that. We could do whatever we \nwanted to.\n  If people did not like it, they could vote against it. They could \nfilibuster it, where you have to get 60 votes in the Senate. The \nPresident, if he does not like it, has a right to veto it, where you \nhave to get 67 votes in the Senate. It is not like people's rights are \nbeing taken away because we pass a constitutional amendment.\n  I wonder if my friend from Massachusetts believes that the Supreme \nCourt has so far construed the first amendment correctly by holding \nthat it does not protect obscenity and child pornography?\n  He was attempting to make the point that this amendment is somehow an \nunprecedented infringement on the first amendment. With all due \nrespect, that is a joke. Last Friday, I listed 21 instances where the \nSupreme Court upheld laws which limit speech or conduct which some have \nargued was protected by the first amendment. What we are considering \nhere is not something new.\n  Some of those cases involved actual speech, including obscenity and \nlimitations on Government speaking. Here, we are talking about \noffensive conduct, not speech. The Supreme Court, in one of its off \ndays--in fact two off days, when you consider both Johnson and \nEichman--decided by a 5 to 4 margin, that this offensive conduct rises \nto the dignity of free expression.\n  If my friend from Massachusetts thinks it is terrible to interfere \nunder any circumstances with speech or conduct which some might argue \nis somehow protected by the first amendment, what about laws \nprohibiting child pornography? What about laws against obscenity?\n  Put aside whether my friend would use the same legal test for \ndetermining what is obscenity or child pornography as the Supreme Court \npresently uses. He may not. But I think he would admit that would not \nwant his children or grandchildren to be buffeted by child pornography.\n  If, after 200-plus years of legal precedent to the contrary, the \nSupreme Court were to decide, by a 5 to 4 vote, that obscenity is \nprotected by the first amendment, I wonder if some of the people who \nhave argued against this amendment, because they claim it infringes \nupon the first amendment, would oppose an amendment authorizing the \nprohibition of the sale and distribution of obscenity or pornography?\n  And if my friend felt that the 5-to-4 decision was wrong, would he \nview such an amendment as tampering with the Bill of rights, or just \noverturning a mistaken judicial interpretation of it?\n  Would my friend be demanding on the floor of Congress that supporters \nof an antiobscenity amendment determine in advance whether this or that \nhypothetical picture, photograph, or writing would qualify as obscene \nunder the amendment?\n  I doubt it. I sincerely doubt it.\n  I want to say a few words about Senator Biden's content-neutral \nconstitutional amendment, and then I understand my friend from Idaho is \nhere, and also my friend from Kentucky.\n  A few critics of the flag amendment believe that all physical \nimpairments of the integrity of the flag, such as by burning or \nmutilating, must be made illegal or no such misuse of the flag should \nbe illegal. An exception is provided for disposal of a worn or soiled \nflag. This all or nothing approach flies in the face of nearly a \ncentury of legislative protection of the flag.\n  A content neutral amendment would forbid an American combat veteran \nfrom taking an American flag flown in battle and having printed on it \nthe name of his unit and location of specific battles, in honor of his \nunit, the service his fellow soldiers, and the memory of the lost.\n  Then Assistant Attorney General for Legal Counsel William S. Barr \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary committee August 1, 1989, and \nbrought a certain American flag with him:\n\n       Now let me give you an example of . . . the kind of result \n     that we get under the [content-neutral approach]. This is the \n     actual flag carried in San Juan Hill. It was carried by the \n     lead unit, the 13th Regiment U.S. Infantry, and they proudly \n     emblazon their name right across the flag, as you see; 1,078 \n     Americans died following this flag up San Juan Hill.\n       . . . Under [a content neutral approach], you can't have \n     regiments put their name on the flag that's defacement . . . \n     (Testimony, Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr, \n     August 1, 1989, at 68).\n\n  I wish to empower Congress to prohibit the contemptuous or \ndisrespectful physical treatment of the flag. I do not wish to compel \nCongress to penalize respectful treatment of the flag. A constitutional \namendment which would force the American people to treat the placing of \nthe name of a military unit on a flag as the equivalent of placing the \nwords ``Down with the Fascist Federal Government'' or racist remarks on \nthe flag is not what the popular movement for protecting the flag is \nall about. I respectfully submit that such an approach ignores \ndistinctions well understood by tens of millions of Americans.\n  Moreover, never in the 204 years of the first amendment has the free \nspeech clause been construed as totally ``content neutral.'' Prof. \nRichard Parker, of Harvard Law School, who believes in ``robust and \nwide-open'' freedom of speech and that it ought to be more robust than \nthe Supreme Court currently allows in some respects, noted as much in \nhis testimony:\n\n       . . . Everyone agrees that there must be ``procedural'' \n     parameters of free speech--involving, for example, places and \n     times at which certain modes of expression are permitted. \n     Practically everyone accepts some explicitly ``substantive'' \n     parameters of speech content as well. Indeed, despite talk of \n     ``content-neutrality,'' the following principle of \n     constitutional law is very clear: Government sometimes may \n     sanction you for speaking because of the way the content of \n     what you say affects other people.\n       What is less clear is the shape of this principle. There \n     are few bright lines to define it. \n\n[[Page S18343]]\n     The Supreme Court understands the principle to rule out speech that \n     threatens to cause imminent tangible harm: face-to-face \n     fighting words, incitement to violation of law, shouting \n     ``fire'' in a crowded theater. And it does not stop there. It \n     understands the principle, also, to rule out speech that \n     threatens certain intangible, even diffuse, harms. It has, \n     for instance, described obscenity as pollution of the moral \n     ``environment.''\n\n  I think he makes some very important points. But what about \npolitical speech critical of the Government? Is there not there a \nbright line protecting that, at least so long as no imminent physical \nharm is threatened? The answer is: No. The Court has made clear, for \ninstance, that statements criticizing official conduct of a public \nofficial may be sanctioned if they are known to be false and damage the \nreputation of the official. There has been no outcry against this rule. \nIt was set forth by the Warren Court--in an opinion by Justice Brennan, \nthe very opinion that established freedom of speech as `robust and \nwide-open.' [New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)]. It has \nbeen reaffirmed ever since. Allowing the Congress to prohibit \ncontemptuous treatment of the American flag does not unravel the first \namendment or freedom of speech.\n\n  Incidentally, I might add that, in order to be truly ``content \nneutral,'' an amendment must have no exceptions, even for the disposal \nof a worn or soiled flag. Once such an exception is allowed, as in the \nBiden amendment, the veneer of content neutrality is stripped away. The \nTexas versus Johnson majority itself pointedly noted:\n\n       if we were to hold that a state may forbid flag burning \n     wherever it is likely to endanger the flag's symbolic role, \n     but allow it whenever burning a flag promotes that role--as \n     where, for example, a person ceremoniously burns a dirty \n     flag--we would be saying that when it comes to impairing the \n     flag's physical integrity, the flag itself may be used as a \n     symbol . . . only in one direction . . .'' [491 U.S. at 416-\n     417].\n\n  Of course, if Congress proposes and the States ratify a \nconstitutional amendment with such an exception, the Supreme Court \nwould have to uphold the exception. But the amendment would not be \ncontent neutral.\n  The suggestion that a worn or soiled flag is no longer a flag, in an \neffort to escape the logical inconsistency of a so-called content \nneutral amendment which would permit an exception for disposal of such \na flag, is unavailing. Obviously, a worn or soiled American flag is \nstill a flag, recognizable as such, even if no longer fit for display.\n\n\n                       biden amendment--odd form\n\n  Mr. President, I draw to my colleagues' attention the text of the \namendment by my friend from Delaware. I say with great respect to my \nfriend, and to my colleagues, you will search the Constitution in vain \nfor anything that looks like this. Even if I agreed with its substance, \nnot in 206 years have we had a statute written right in to the text of \nthe Constitution itself with Congress given no more than a right to \nvote on it up or down.\n  We have always prided ourselves on distinguishing our fundamental \ncharter from a statutory code. This amendment is a textbook case of \nblurring that 206-year-old distinction.\n  Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from Idaho is here. \nI will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for yielding to me and let me thank him personally for the \ntremendous leadership he has shown in the area of protecting our flag \nand offering forth this unique constitutional amendment. He has, \nwithout doubt, led the way for us to finally bring this critical issue \nto the floor.\n  I think it is high time that we listen, that we listen to not only \nthe debate on the floor but, more important, we listen to the American \npeople on the issue of flag protection and this amendment.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember that more than a year ago, I came \nto this Senate floor with memorials from 43 State legislatures--\nmemorials urging Congress to take action to protect the American flag \nfrom physical desecration. Those memorials were inserted in the \nCongressional Record for all to read.\n  Now the number of those memorials has reached 49, and a 1995 Gallup \nPoll found that almost 80 percent of the American public supports a \nflag protection amendment.\n  This is a truly historic outpouring of popular support. And we have \nan opportunity to respond to the American people by passing a very \nsimple amendment and sending it to the States for ratification: It \nauthorizes Congress and the States to prohibit physical desecration of \nthe flag of the United States.\n  Opponents of this amendment are doing their best to find bogeymen \nhiding inside this proposal, or to tie it up in a mass of legal \ncomplications--but in fact, it is a very straightforward issue to most \nAmericans.\n  Old Glory holds a special place in our hearts. No other emblem, \ntoken, or artifact of our Nation has been defended to the death by \nlegions of patriots. No other has drawn multitudes from abroad with the \npromise of freedom. No other unifies the diverse cultures that form the \namalgam we call the United States.\n  No other has inspired generations with the belief that life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness are the birthright of every human being. \nIt is because the flag holds the unique place in the hearts of \nAmericans that they have demanded ultimate protection for it. Congress \nhas already tried furnishing that protection by statute, and, as we \nknow, the Supreme Court shut the door on that particular strategy--\nfirmly and for all time, in my opinion. A constitutional amendment is \nthe only vehicle left for those who believe in protecting the flag.\n  I expect the opposition to argue that protecting the flag from \nphysical desecration somehow runs afoul of the first amendment and the \nfreedom of expression, Mr. President. That is part of the debate that \nhas been going on here now for a good many hours. I believe--and I \nthink all Americans believe--that nothing could be further from the \ntruth. The flag amendment does not prevent the expression of any ideas. \nAs a matter of fact, there are far more direct ways of expressing one's \nopinion than engaging in an act--even the act of destroying or defiling \na flag.\n  Another accusation the opposition will try to use is that this is a \nslippery slope to Government censorship. I say hogwash as \nstraightforward and as best I can, Mr. President. We are trying to \nprotect the flag--and only the flag and only from physical \ndesecration--because it is uniquely revered by Americans. That \nuniqueness absolutely prevents this effort from being extended to \nanything else. It is a very specific amendment.\n  Mr. President, obscene speech that outrages a community is not \nprotected by the Constitution. Fighting words that outrage individuals \nand provoke violence are not protected by the Constitution. Both these \nstandards are well known and widely accepted in this country. Yet, when \n80 percent of Americans say they are outraged by the physical \ndesecration of the flag and ask us to protect it, our opponents accuse \nthem of advocating censorship and interfering with the freedom of \nspeech.\n  I say to the American people, do not believe them. This amendment is \nnarrowly tailored to allow protection only of the flag and only from \nphysical desecration. It will not force anyone to salute the flag. It \nwill not mandate participation in the Pledge of Allegiance. It will not \nstop individuals from telling the world exactly and in detail how they \nfeel about the flag, even if they despise it. This simply allows \nCongress and the States to prevent one act: the physical act of \ndesecrating the flag.\n  The concern has been raised that physical desecration can be defined \nto mean anything. That may be true in a vacuum. But it is most \ncertainly not true in the marketplace of ideas, where all points of \nview have an opportunity to be heard, and that is precisely where this \ndefinition is going to be written, Mr. President.\n  This amendment enables the American people to weigh in on this \ndefinition, whether they support or oppose protecting the flag. There \nwill not be any midnight, closed-door, secret session to write this \ndefinition. It is going to be fully and openly discussed in every State \nin the Union.\n  Mr. President, Congress has acted once before to protect the flag. By \nthe narrowest of margins, the Supreme Court stopped that effort from \nsucceeding. However, the Supreme Court's decision did not change the \nvalue at \n\n[[Page S18344]]\nstake, it did not change the need for this protection, and, most \nimportant, it did not change the heart and the minds of the American \npeople.\n  Against all odds, against all expectations, support for this effort \ncontinues to grow, not to diminish. At a time when some are wringing \ntheir hands about the erosion of values in America, we have a \ngrassroots movement demanding the opportunity to protect the symbol of \nour country's aspirations and our country's values.\n  Are we so preoccupied with the problems of our Nation here in \nWashington that we cannot recognize the positive signs when we see it, \nMr. President? Millions of our fellow citizens are telling us that the \nsight or mention of our flag still has the power to awaken the American \nspirit of the American patriot. We should be cheering them on, not \nignoring them or denying them access to their Constitution.\n  In providing two methods for amending the Constitution, article V \nsafeguards the people's right to correct what they believe is a wrong \ndecision by the Supreme Court or the Congress. The people have asked \nfor this opportunity to make a correction in the case of the flag, and \nI urge my colleagues to listen to them, to send the American people an \namendment allowing protection of the great flag of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. We are operating \nunder a unanimous-consent agreement, are we not, that anticipates that \nI will send to the desk an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nwhich will be voted on in the morning, along with the constitutional \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3097\n\n                   (Purpose: To provide a substitute)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I therefore send that amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of myself, Senator Bennett, Senator Dorgan, and Senator \nBumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), for himself, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3097.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after resolving clause and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ''Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and in circumstances where the person \n     knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000 \n     or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(b) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States and intentionally destroys or damages \n     that flag shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned \n     not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years, \n     or both.\n       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.\n       ``(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `flag \n     of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or \n     any part thereof, made of any substance, in any size, in a \n     form that is commonly displayed as a flag and would be taken \n     to be a flag by the reasonable observer.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     33 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     the item relating to section 700 and inserting the following \n     new item:\n\n700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag \n              of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I assume that I have to do nothing \nfurther in order to have this amendment in the nature of a substitute \nbe pending in the morning for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators McConnell and Bennett in offering a statutory proposal, rather \nthan a constitutional amendment, to prohibit the desecration of the \nAmerican flag.\n  For me and for most American citizens, the flag of this Nation holds \na special place in our minds and hearts as the unique symbol of our \nNation and of the fundamental democratic freedoms for which it stands. \nIt symbolizes the extraordinary sacrifices that millions of Americans \nhave made over the past 200 years to preserve those freedoms. And \nfreedom-loving Americans throughout this great Nation are appalled when \nsomeone chooses to defile, deface, or destroy our national symbol.\n  Honorable men and women in this country and in this body may disagree \non the means to achieve the objective we all share--the protection of \nthe flag of the United States. But we are united in our love and \nrespect for it. Protecting the flag from those who would destroy it is \nnot in dispute. What is in dispute is how we best achieve the objective \nof protecting our national symbol while preserving the principles and \nvalues for which it stands.\n  One of the most fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution \nand symbolized by the flag is the right to express one's views without \nfear of retribution. It is enshrined in the first amendment to the \nConstitution. It is part of the Bill of Rights. It is a right we all \ncherish. It is a right we all want to preserve. Preserving this basic \nright guaranteed by the Constitution is not always easy. Often it poses \na dilemma. Such is the case with protecting the flag. But preserving \nthe Constitution should be the backdrop of this debate. Justice Holmes \nframed the issue this way:\n\n       [I]f there is any principle of the Constitution that more \n     imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the \n     principle of free thought--not free thought for those who \n     agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.\n\n  His imperative is one we should all take to heart.\n  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of the flag debate has been highly \ncharged. Accusations of disloyalty have been hurled against those who \noppose the proposed constitutional amendment while those who support it \nare referred to as patriots. I hope we can lower the rhetoric and \ninstead focus on the substance of this issue. Let us begin the debate \nby agreeing that honorable men and women can disagree on this very \n\n[[Page S18345]]\nimportant issue. As the esteemed senior Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Thurmond, has stated: ``The fact is, there are intelligent \narguments on both sides of the debate.''\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with Senators McConnell and \nBennett to develop a legislative solution to protect the flag that we \nbelieve will pass constitutional muster. The American Law Division of \nthe Congressional Research Service has provided an analysis of our \nproposal which makes us optimistic that our approach will survive any \nconstitutional attack on first amendment grounds. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the CRS analysis be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Amending the Constitution should never be taken lightly. \nIt is an approach that ought not be pursued if there is an alternative \nwhich can achieve the same objective. The amendment we are offering \nprovides such an alternative, and I hope my colleagues will give it \ncareful consideration.\n  Our amendment, which was introduced earlier this year as S. 1335, \nwould punish criminal acts of incitement, damage, or destruction of \nproperty involving the flag of the United States. The destruction of \nthe flag can be intended to incite a violent response rather than to \nmake a political statement. If that is the intent, that conduct is \noutside the protections offered by the first amendment, just like \nshouting fire in a crowded theater is outside its purview. Under our \nlegislation, those who destroy or damage the flag with the intent of \ninciting violence or breaching the peace would be fined or imprisoned \nor both. Our proposal would also punish those who steal a flag \nbelonging to the Federal Government and intentionally destroy or damage \nit.\n  Our purpose in offering this amendment is clear. We want to provide \nthe maximum protection of our flag from those who would defile it while \npreserving the constitutional liberties that it symbolizes. We believe \nour proposal strikes that important and delicate balance.\n  During a June 21, 1990 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration, several \nconstitutional scholars were asked to analyze a similar bill which had \nbeen introduced by Congressman Jim Cooper in the House of \nRepresentatives. The views of these experts is quite telling.\n  One of them, Charles Fried, the Carter Professor of General \nJurisprudence at Harvard University, said that this approach was \nperfectly proper and perfectly constitutional. He stated that if a \nperson burns a flag in a situation which presents an immediate \nincitement to violence, that is squarely within Supreme Court doctrine \nas the kind of thing which can be criminalized.\n  Many other experts also agree that our legislative proposal would \npass constitutional muster and protect the flag from those who would \nuse it to promote violence or to infringe on another's right to wave \nthe flag. Those are important goals and ones which I believe are the \ncrux of this issue. We can achieve these goals by passing a statutory \nremedy. We do not need to, nor should we, amend the Constitution of the \nUnited States if a statutory alternative can accomplish the same \nobjective. I ask unanimous consent that a very thoughtful column which \nappeared in the Washington Post and was written by James H. Warner, a \nformer marine pilot and POW in Vietnam, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 11, 1989]\n\n                  When They Burned the Flag Back Home\n\n                          (By James H. Warner)\n\n\n                        thoughts of a former POW\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force \n     base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I \n     looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as \n     tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country \n     more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver \n     Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared \n     with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to \n     serve the cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time after 5\\1/2\\ years, it hurts me \n     to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. But I have \n     been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of \n     hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the \n     flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish \n     the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were \n     wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released \n     early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful \n     accepted, most did not. In our minds, early release under \n     those conditions would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades, \n     of our country and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured, and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the \n     summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutrition. I had \n     long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal \n     parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our \n     cause worth all of this? Yes, it was worth all this and more.\n       Rose Wilder Lane in her magnificent book ``The Discovery of \n     Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men \n     must know in order to be free. They must know that all men \n     are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free. \n     Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept \n     bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal \n     to teach slaves to read.\n       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp. \n     Marxists believe that ideas are merely the product of \n     material conditions; change those material conditions, and \n     one will change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``re-\n     educate'' us. If we could slow them that we would not abandon \n     our belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the \n     falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by \n     teaching them about freedom through our example. We could \n     show them the power of ideas.\n       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in you country \n     protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No, I said. ``That proves that I am right. In my country \n     we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people \n     disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an \n     instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party, \n     was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British \n     definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view. Bevan \n     responded, forcefully, that if Khrushchev really wanted to \n     know the difference, he should read the funeral oration of \n     Pericles.\n       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides \n     ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted \n     democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike the \n     Spartans, he said, the Athenians did not fear freedom. \n     Rather, they viewed freedom as the very source of their \n     strength. As it was for Athens, so it is for America--our \n     freedom is not to be feared, for our freedom is our strength.\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. The flag in Dallas was burned to protest the \n     nomination of Ronald Reagan, and he told us how to spread the \n     idea of freedom when he said that we should turn American \n     into ``a city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' \n     Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Warner's sentiments express far better than I am able \nwhy we should not amend the Constitution to safeguard the flag. I hope, \ntherefore, that my colleagues will join our efforts to protect the flag \nfrom desecration without amending the Bill of Rights. I believe that is \nthe right approach. The flag, which all of us love and respect, will \nthen be protected, as will be the freedoms our flag has symbolized \nsince the dawn of the Republic.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     To: Honorable Kent Conrad.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Analysis of S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free \n         Speech Act of 1995.\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for an analysis of the constitutionality of S. 1335, the Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995. This bill would amend \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 700 to criminalize the destruction or damage \n     of a United States flag under three circumstances. First, \n     subsection (a) of the new Sec. 700 would penalize such \n     conduct when the person engaging in it does so with the \n     primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent \n     violence or a \n\n[[Page S18346]]\n     breach of the peace and in circumstances where the person knows it is \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace.\n       Second, subsection (b) would punish any person who steals \n     or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of \n     another, a United States flag belonging to the United States \n     and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag. Third, \n     subsection (c) punishes any person who, within any lands \n     reserved for the use of the United States or under the \n     exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States, \n     steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use \n     of another, a flag of the United States belonging to another \n     person and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag.\n       The bill appears intended to offer protection for the flag \n     of the United States in circumstances under which statutory \n     protection may still be afforded after the decisions of the \n     Supreme Court in United States v. Eichman\\1\\ and Texas v. \n     Johnson.\\2\\ These cases had established the principles that \n     flag desecration or burning, in a political protest context, \n     is expressive conduct if committed to ``send a message,'' \n     that the Court would review limits on this conduct with \n     exacting scrutiny; and legislation that proposed to penalize \n     the conduct in order to silence the message or out of \n     disagreement with the message violates the First Amendment \n     speech clause.\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Subsections (b) and (c) appear to present no constitutional \n     difficulties, based on judicial precedents, either facially \n     or as applied. These subsections are restatements of other \n     general criminal prohibitions with specific focus on the \n     flag.\\3\\ The Court has been plain that one may be prohibited \n     from exercising expressive conduct or symbolic speech with or \n     upon the converted property of others or by trespass upon the \n     property of another.\\4\\ The subsections are directed \n     precisely to the theft or conversion of a flag belonging to \n     someone else, the government or a private party, and the \n     destruction of or damage to that flag.\n       Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, \n     subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster. \n     The provision's language is drawn from the ``fighting words'' \n     doctrine of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire.\\5\\ In that case the \n     Court defined a variety of expression that was unprotected by \n     the First Amendment, among the categories being speech that \n     inflicts injury or tends to incite immediate violence.\\6\\ \n     While the Court over the years has modified the other \n     categories listed in Chaplinsky, it has not departed from the \n     holding that the ``fighting words'' exception continues to \n     exist. It has, of course, laid down some governing \n     principles, which are reflected in the subsection's language. \n     Thus, the Court has applied to ``fighting words'' the \n     principle of Brandenburg v. Ohio,\\7\\ under which speech \n     advocating unlawful action may be punished only if it is \n     directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and \n     is likely to incite or produce such action.\\8\\\n       A second principle, enunciated in an opinion demonstrating \n     the continuing vitality of the ``fighting words'' doctrine, \n     is that it is impermissible to punish only those ``fighting \n     words'' of which government disapproves. Government may not \n     distinguish between classes of ``fighting words'' on an \n     ideological basis.\\9\\\n       Subsection (a) reflects both these principles. It requires \n     not only that the conduct be reasonably likely to produce \n     imminent violence or breach of the peace, but that the person \n     intend to bring about imminent violence or breach of the \n     peace. Further, nothing in the subsection draws a distinction \n     between approved or disapproved expression that is \n     communicated by the action committed with or on the flag.\n       There is a question which should be noted concerning this \n     subsection. There is no express limitation of the application \n     of the provision to acts on lands under Federal jurisdiction, \n     neither is there any specific connection to flags or persons \n     that have been in interstate commerce. Therefore, application \n     of this provision to actions which do not have either of \n     these, or some other Federal nexus, might well be found to be \n     beyond the power of Congress under the decision of the Court \n     in United States v. Lopez.\\10\\\n       In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the \n     bill, if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, \n     should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment \n     grounds. Subsections (b) and (c) are more securely grounded \n     in constitutional law, but subsection (a) is only a little \n     less anchored in decisional law.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your request.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we all agree that flag burning is \nreprehensible. After all, hundreds of thousands of Americans have given \ntheir lives to protect the principles that our flag represents, and \nburning the flag offends the memory of those who made that ultimate \nsacrifice. Acting on this belief, I voted for legislation to protect \nthe flag. Unfortunately, however, our statute was struck down by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Although we should protect the flag, we must also approach amendments \nto the Constitution with great caution. Throughout our 200-year history \nwe have never amended the Bill of Rights--the guardian of the \nprinciples and freedoms that our flag represents. During all this \ntime--through a bloody Civil War, two world wars, a Depression, and \nurban riots--the first amendment has needed no repair.\n  Mr. President, I have great faith that the American flag is strong \nenough to withstand the foolish actions of a handful of extremists. The \nBill of Rights, however, is much more fragile. If we pass a \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit this behavior--deplorable as it \nis--sooner or later the Government may prohibit other more legitimate \ntypes of expression and protest. So to my mind, protecting our revered \nsymbol means ensuring that we do not infringe upon the freedoms that it \nrepresents.\n  One of the most persuasive arguments against this amendment came from \nKeith Kruel of Fennimore, WI. A former national commander of the \nAmerican Legion, he wrote that ``when the flag is not accorded proper \nconsideration under the present flag code, it upsets patriotic \nAmericans. Rightly so. [but] no one ever has, nor can, legislate a \npatriot.'' I agree.\n  And do not take my word for it, ask the editorial writers of \nWisconsin. Across my home State, from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel to \nthe Eau Claire Leader-Telegram to the Appleton Post-Crescent to the \nLaCrosse Tribune, these newspapers firmly believe that a flag \ndesecration amendment is a bad idea. I ask that these editorials be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  In closing, Mr. President, we should all be clear on our opposition \nto flag burning. But we should also resist this well-intentioned but \nunwise effort to tinker with the Bill of Rights.\n  The editorials follow:\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 12, 1995]\n\n                       Flag Amendment Ill-Advised\n\n       Probably nine-tenths of the knuckleheads who get their \n     jollies from burning the American flag or desecrating it in \n     other ways have no idea what freedoms that flag symbolizes. \n     Because these people are stupid as well as ungrateful, they \n     never think about the precious gift they have been given.\n       The irony is that the American flag stands for, along other \n     things, the freedom to express yourself in dumb and even \n     insulting ways, like burning the flag. This is a freedom \n     literally not conferred on hundreds of millions of people.\n       A few years ago, several states passed laws that made it \n     illegal to desecrate the flag, but in 1989 the Supreme Court \n     ruled that such statutes violated the Bill of Rights. \n     Congress is now moving to amend the Constitution itself, so \n     that flag desecration laws can be enacted.\n       That movement is as ill-considered as it is understandable. \n     The Constitution should be amended only reluctantly and \n     rarely, when a genuine threat to our nation emerges and when \n     there is no other way to guard against it.\n       That is why the founding fathers made it so difficult to \n     revise the Constitution, and why, as a Justice Department \n     spokesman pointed out the other day, the Bill of Rights has \n     not been amended since it was ratified in 1792.\n       The unpatriotic mischief of adolescent punks is \n     infuriating. But it is not a serious enough act to warrant \n     revision of the nation's charter. The Bill of Rights exists \n     to protect people whose behavior, however repugnant, injures \n     nothing but people's feelings.\n     \n[[Page S18347]]\n\n       The American flag protects even people who burn it; it \n     prevails over both them and their abuse. That is one of the \n     reasons the flag and the nation it stands for are so strong.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          [From the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram, June 18, 1995]\n\n                   Let's Concentrate on Real Problems\n\n       There's no winning for those who oppose a constitutional \n     amendment to outlaw desecration of the American flag.\n       You might as well be against Mother's Day.\n       But for several reasons we ought to let this idea die.\n       Sure, burning the American flag to protest one thing or \n     another is a stupid thing to do. And the few times we've seen \n     someone burn the flag on television, we've never seen the \n     protester follow up by sweeping up the ashes with a broom and \n     dust pan, so it seems there is grounds to nail the protester \n     on a littering charge anyway.\n       But even if they beat the littering rap, the only thing \n     such protesters prove is their ignorance. Burning a flag \n     doesn't signify anything positive or suggest alternatives to \n     make our nation stronger. It's just an action that indicates \n     you oppose our nation. So what? How do they propose to make \n     it better?\n       But it's quite a jump from not liking stupidity to \n     tinkering with the U.S. Constitution to make flag-burning \n     illegal. The Constitution has guided us well for more than \n     200 years, and to amend it in an effort to prohibit flag-\n     burning--which by one estimate occurs only about eight times \n     a year--seems to be an overreaction.\n       But the most important reasons to stop this proposal are \n     that there are far more important things for Congress and the \n     people to worry about, and that it promotes a mindless \n     nationalism that challenges citizens to ``prove'' their \n     patriotism by endorsing the litmus test in the form of a \n     constitutional amendment.\n       Politicians without the guts or the brains to solve what \n     really ails this country know that they can fool many voters \n     simply by using the flag as a political prop and making \n     flowery speeches about patriotism, love of country, etc.\n       We should be more worried about where the flag gets its \n     strength. Instead of focusing on the flag itself, what about \n     the federal deficit (more than $200 billion a year) and the \n     national debt (nearing $5 trillion)? These are far greater \n     threats to Old Glory than some clown with a cigarette lighter \n     at a protest rally.\n       What a legacy to leave to our children: ``Hey, kids, we've \n     mortgaged your future in the name of special interests and \n     for our convenience, but we've protected the flag with an \n     amendment. Pretty smart, huh?''\n       What's at work here is a time-tested political practice. \n     That is, if you can't solve the real problems, throw up a \n     diversion to get people thinking and talking about something \n     else.\n       Paying for health care, environmental protection, defense, \n     education and all the rest are complex issues that bore \n     readers and viewers. So if the real goal is to be re-elected \n     to a job with a six-figure salary, what a better way than to \n     focus on push-button issues like patriotism, the flag, etc.\n       Burning the American flag won't solve anything, but neither \n     will outlawing burning of the flag while the nation it \n     represents crumbles underneath it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the Appleton Post-Crescent, Oct. 28, 1995]\n\n              Flag-Protection Amendment Not What It Seems\n\n                         (By William B. Ketter)\n\n       Congress is about to put an asterisk on the First \n     Amendment.\n       I am talking about the constitutional amendment to \n     ``protect'' the American flag from the kind of free \n     expression that this country was founded on.\n       It is more commonly called the flag-desecration amendment, \n     and it protects nothing, not the flag, not values and \n     certainly not free speech.\n       It does represent a test of will that has Congress on the \n     spot with The American Legion, Women's Army Corps, Navy \n     League and every other well-meaning veterans and fraternal \n     organization.\n       The House in June overwhelmingly passed the amendment. The \n     Senate showdown could come any day now. Sixty-seven Senate \n     votes are needed to send it to the states for ratification. \n     The protect-the-flag partisans are flooding lawmakers with \n     tens of thousands of God-and-motherhood telegrams.\n       If it is approved, the essence of free political speech \n     will drift from the first time from the First Amendment \n     mooring that gives every citizen a constitutional right to \n     challenge, even cast aspersions on, the icons of government.\n       The federal government and the 50 states will have wide \n     latitude in determining what desecrates the flag. Given the \n     emotions over this issue, flag-themed soda cans, bumper \n     stickers, or the shirt on your back could be targets of local \n     harassment. Already, there's a town in Minnesota that wants \n     to keep car dealers from flying more than four U.S. flags on \n     their lots.\n       Yes, this is a Boston Tea Party type of issue even if we \n     don't think of it that way. And yes, few institutions, the \n     press included, seem terribly bothered by it all.\n       The principal reason for the apathy: The issue has been \n     miscast as a patriotic cause to safeguard the flag against \n     the scruffy likes of Gregory Lee Johnson, and never mind our \n     revered right to free speech.\n       It is easy to dislike Gregory Lee Johnson. He's the radical \n     protester who doused the American flag with kerosene, then \n     put a match to it in front of the Dallas City Hall during the \n     1984 Republican National Convention.\n       He was arrested and convicted and no one cared. Except the \n     U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1989 that the flag-\n     protection law used to prosecute Johnson violated his \n     constitutional right to free expression.\n       ``It was enough to make any American's blood boil,'' says \n     William M. Detweiler, immediate past national commander of \n     The American Legion. ``We cannot allow our proud flag--and \n     our proud nation--to be ripped apart, piece by piece.\n       Most Americans, myself among them, hate what Johnston did \n     to the flag. From the cradle, we are taught to respect it as \n     a symbol of our unprecedented form of democracy. We grow up \n     saluting it as school children, little leaguers, girl scouts, \n     soldiers, proud citizens.\n       Beyond that, many of us have family members who died \n     fighting for the exception freedom the flag represents. We \n     don't want it spit at, trampled under foot, burned in protest \n     or in any way defaced.\n       Yet it is because of that special freedom--including the \n     right to extreme political views--that the Senate should \n     reject the flag amendment.\n       No nation has a more important history of tolerating \n     dissent, even conduct we have come to genuinely hate, than \n     the United States. The Founding Fathers wanted it that way. \n     They experienced the heavy hand of the British Crown, and saw \n     the right of protest as a vital bulwark against injustice and \n     tyranny. It's what sets America apart from nations that quash \n     citizen protest--and especially flag-burning--nations such as \n     China, North Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Iraq, Cuba.\n       In other words, any effort to limit liberty is ultimately \n     directed at you. The flag amendment--and the laws that would \n     follow--probably would not prevent extremists from doing \n     violence to the flag. It is attention that the Gregory Lee \n     Johnsons of this world crave, and getting arrested is part of \n     the act.\n       Furthermore, there aren't a lot of lunkheads like Gregory \n     Lee Johnson. Only four cases of flag burning were reported \n     last year in all of America. And those were prosecuted, with \n     the full authority of existing law and the First Amendment.\n       How can this be, given the Supreme Court's flag ruling?\n       Simple. All those cases were prosecuted under other laws \n     prohibiting theft, vandalism or inciting riots.\n       So to solve a problem that does not exist (when was the \n     last time you remember someone burning a flag?), the \n     proponents of this amendment would chip away at the \n     fundamental freedoms guaranteed to all Americans.\n       And in case that sounds like a self-interested argument \n     from a First Amendment fundamentalist listen to U.S. Sen. Bob \n     Kerrey of Nebraska, a Vietnam veteran who lost a leg in the \n     war. ``The community's revulsion at those who burn a flag'' \n     Kerrey said, ``is all that we need. It has contained the \n     problem without the government getting involved.''\n       Indeed, in their effort to protect the flag, the advocates \n     of this amendment do far greater damaged to the principles of \n     liberty for which that flag stands. We need not wrap \n     ourselves in the flag to protect it.\n       We do need, however, to standing up for the freedom that \n     Old Glory represents and urge the U.S. Senate to turn down \n     the flag amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, June 14, 1995]\n\n                   Flag Burning Amendment Unpatriotic\n\n       Today, Flag Day, is an occasion to celebrate liberty. And \n     one of the best ways you can celebrate liberty is to write \n     your congressman to urge a vote against the proposed \n     constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.\n       It may seem unpatriotic to stand up for a right to burn the \n     American flag. But the proposed amendment is not about \n     whether it is patriotic to burn a flag. It is about whether \n     it is right to limit the liberties for which our flag flies. \n     A true patriot would answer no.\n       Consider: It's futile, even counter-productive, to try to \n     require patriotism by law.\n       In fact, it would inspire greater respect for our nation to \n     refrain from punishing flag burners. As conservative legal \n     scholar Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice told a \n     House subcommittee, we can lock up flag burners and by doing \n     so make them martyrs, ``or we can demonstrate, by tolerating \n     their expression, the true greatness of our republic.''\n       Laws to protect the flag would be unworkable.\n       The proposal now before the House seeks a constitutional \n     amendment to allow Congress and the states to pass laws \n     banning physical desecration of the flag. It would require \n     approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate and three-\n     fourths of the states.\n       It's called the flag burning amendment because many of its \n     supporters consider burning the flag to be the most egregious \n     form of desecration.\n     \n[[Page S18348]]\n\n       But what counts as desecration of the flag? What if someone \n     desecrated something made up to look like a flag with some \n     flaw, like the wrong number of stars or stripes? Does that \n     count? What if a flag is used in art that some people \n     consider rude or unpatriotic? Does that count as desecration?\n       The arguments could rage on and on, enriching lawyers and \n     diminishing the nation.\n       A ban on flag burning would set a dangerous precedent.\n       The proposed amendment is a reaction to 1989 and 1990 \n     Supreme Court rulings that invalidated federal and state laws \n     banning flag desecration. The court ruled that peaceful flag \n     desecration is symbolic speech, protected by the First \n     Amendment freedom of speech clause.\n       Supporters of a ban on flag burning argue that burning a \n     flag is not symbolic speech at all but hateful action. But if \n     today's cause is to ban flag burning because it is hateful \n     action, tomorrow's cause may be to ban the display of the \n     Confederate flag because many people consider it to be \n     hateful action. Or to ban the use of racial or sexist \n     comments because they amount to hateful actions. And on and \n     on until we have given up our freedoms because we are \n     intolerant.\n       The right to protest is central to democracy.\n       A democracy must protect the right to protest against \n     authority, or it is hardly a democracy. It is plainly \n     undemocratic to take away from dissenters the freedom to \n     protest against authority by peacefully burning or otherwise \n     desecrating a flag as the symbol of that authority.\n       If the protesters turn violent or if they steal a flag to \n     burn, existing laws can be used to punish them.\n       Flag burners are not worth a constitutional amendment.\n       A good rule of thumb about amending the U.S. Constitution \n     is: Think twice, then think twice again. Flag burning is not \n     an issue that merits changing the two-centuries-old blueprint \n     for our democracy.\n       This nation's founding fathers understood the value of \n     dissent and, moreover, the value of the liberty to dissent. \n     So should we.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the La Crosse Tribune, June 7, 1995]\n\n                               Editorial\n\n       The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case in 1989 that \n     flag burning is protected by the First Amendment as a form of \n     speech. The court's decision didn't go over very well with \n     friends of Old Glory then, and six years later that ruling \n     still sticks in the craw of many patriots--so much so that \n     constitutional amendments protecting the flag against \n     desecration have picked up 276 co-sponsors in the U.S. House \n     of Representatives and 54 in the Senate.\n       The House Judiciary Committee takes up the amendment today, \n     with a floor vote expected on June 28. The Senate Judiciary \n     Committee tackled a similar amendment on Tuesday.\n       For two centuries soldiers have given their lives to keep \n     the American flag flying. It is a symbol of freedom and hope \n     for millions. That is what infuses the stars and strips with \n     meaning and inspires the vast majority of Americans to treat \n     it with respect. But to take away the choice in the matter, \n     to make respect for the flag compulsory, diminishes the very \n     freedom represented by the flag.\n       Do we follow a constitutional amendment banning flag \n     desecration with an amendment requiring everyone to actually \n     sing along when the national anthem is played at sports \n     events? An amendment making attendance at Memorial Day \n     parades compulsory?\n       Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., argues that the flag unites us \n     and therefore should be protected. But Heflin and like minded \n     amendment supporters are confusing cause and effect. The flag \n     is a symbol of our unity, not the source of it.\n       Banning flag burning is simply the flip side of the same \n     coin that makes other shows of patriotism compulsory. What \n     are the names of the countries that makes shows of patriotism \n     compulsory? Try China, Iraq. The old Soviet Union.\n       Coerced respect for the flag isn't respect at all, and an \n     amendment protecting the American flag would actually \n     denigrate that flag.\n       Allegiance that is voluntary is something beyond price. But \n     allegiance extracted by statute--or, worse yet, but \n     constitutional flat--wouldn't be worth the paper the \n     amendment was drafted on. It is the very fact that the flag \n     is voluntarily honored that makes it a great and powerful \n     symbol.\n       The possibility of the Balkanization of the American people \n     into bickering special interest groups based on ethnicity or \n     gender or age or class frightens all of us, and it's tempting \n     to try to impose some sort of artificial unity. But can the \n     flag unit us? No. We can be united under the flag, but we \n     can't expect the flag to do the job of uniting us.\n       We oppose flag burning--or any other show of disrespect for \n     the American flag. There are better ways to communicate \n     dissent than trashing a symbol Americans treasure. But making \n     respect for the flag compulsory would, in the long run, \n     decrease real respect for the flag.\n       The 104th Congress should put the flag burning issue behind \n     it and move on to the nuts-and-bolts goal it was elected to \n     pursue: a smaller, less intrusive, fiscally responsible \n     federal government. A constitutional amendment protecting the \n     flag runs precisely counter to that goal.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Oshkosh Northwestern, May 28, 1995]\n\n                  Beware Trivializing Our Constitution\n\n       It is difficult to come out against anything so sacrosanct \n     as the American flag amendment--difficult but not impossible.\n       An amendment to protect the flag from desecration is before \n     Congress and has all the lobbying in its favor.\n       The trouble is, it is an attempt to solve, through the \n     Constitutional amendment process, a problem that really is \n     not a problem.\n       Flag burning is not rampant. It occurs occasionally; it \n     brings, usually, society's scorn upon the arsonist, and does \n     no one any harm, except the sensitivities of some.\n       These sensitivities give rise to the effort to abridge the \n     freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment, \n     which has been held by the courts to include expressions of \n     exasperation with government by burning its banner.\n       At worst, this flag protection is an opening wedge in \n     trimming away at the basic rights of all Americans to \n     criticize its leaders. That right was so highly esteemed by \n     the Founding Fathers that they made free speech virtually \n     absolute.\n       At best, the flag protection amendment trivializes the \n     Constitution.\n       That is no small consideration. The Constitution was \n     trivialized once before. The prohibition amendment had no \n     business being made a constitutional chapter. It was not of \n     constitutional stature. It could not have been done by \n     statute alone. Its repeal showed that it was a transitory \n     matter rather than being one of transcendent, eternal \n     concern.\n       The flag protection amendment is trivial in that flag \n     burning is not always and everywhere a problem. If the \n     amendment succeeds, what else is out there to further \n     trivialize the document?\n       Must the bald eagle be put under constitutional protection \n     if it is no longer an endangered bird?\n       This is a ``feel good'' campaign. People feel they \n     accomplish something good by protecting the flag from \n     burning. (Isn't the approved method of disposing of tattered \n     flags to burn them, by the way?)\n       But it offers about the same protection to flags that the \n     18th offered to teetotaling.\n       If someone has a political statement to make and feels \n     strongly enough, he'll do the burning and accept the \n     consequences. The consequences surely will not be draconian \n     enough that flag burning would rank next best thing to a \n     capital offense.\n       Congress has more pressing thing to do than put time into \n     this amendment.\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

In 1964, Grayson left \nthe Capitol to work full time in the pulpit.\n  But when he retired from the ministry in 1983, he returned to the \nHill, and he remained here until last Friday.\n  On this last day of service, Grayson spoke with pride about waiting \non seven Presidents of the United States, and he said that the Senate \nwas ``almost a second home to me.''\n  The high regard in which Grayson is held by all Senators could be \nseen when our entire Republican caucus gave him a standing ovation at \nour policy lunch several weeks ago.\n  There are countless others who would have joined in that standing \novation had they been there, including a number of Senate food service \nemployees who have returned to college classes because of Grayson's \nurging and encouragement.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all Senators in extending our \nthanks to Julian Grayson, and in wishing him a happy and healthy \nretirement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the underlying matter before us is a \nproposed constitutional amendment. I see the principal sponsor of that \namendment on the floor, the senior Senator from Utah, and I have some \nquestions I would like to ask the Senator, if he would be good enough \nto respond to them.\n  My first question is, as I understand the amendment that he has now \nfinally come up with after some changes, but I understand the amendment \npresently before us provides that a Federal statute can pass forbidding \nthe desecration of the flag. Am I correct in that, I would like to ask \nthe Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would please state that again. I am sorry.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that the amendment that the \nSenator presently has--there have been some changes in it, as I \nunderstand--but the amendment that he hopes for us to vote on tomorrow \nwill be one that will permit the enactment of a statute forbidding the \ndesecration of the flag? Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. All the amendment will say, should it be \nenacted tomorrow, is: ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States,'' which would \nleave it up to Congress to enact a statute later, if Congress so \nchooses to do.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator would be good enough to help me. \nWhat would be an example of desecration of the flag?\n  Mr. HATCH. Whatever Congress calls it. Whatever Congress would decide \nto do. I suspect that Congress would pass a fairly narrow statute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Such as burning the flag?\n  Mr. HATCH. I presume that Congress would delineate very carefully \nwhat type of burning of the flag would be prohibited under the statute. \nI suspect Congress would also try to narrowly define what really brings \ncontempt upon the American flag. But, in any event, Congress will be \nable to make that determination.\n  I suspect it would be very narrow. I suspect that there would not be \nany concern about using representations of the flag as emblems for \nclothing or articles of clothing, sportswear and so forth, just actions \nthat would bring the flag into contempt.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Would the Senator help me? Do we have a very serious \nproblem here? What brings this statute to the floor, this need for a \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. We know, from the Congressional Research Service, of at \nleast 45 flags that have been desecrated between 1990 and 1994, and in \nthis year alone there have been over 20 additional desecrations.\n  Now, those numbers represent only part of the problem. Because, as \nthe Senator from Rhode Island knows, millions of people see reports on \ntelevision and in other news media of every flag that is burned or \ndesecrated. So each flag burning or desecration affects millions and \nmillions of people across this country.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. In 1993, as I see it, from the Senator's own statistics, \nthere were three examples of a burning of the flag.\n  Mr. HATCH. There may have been many more, but three that the \nCongressional Research Service knows about. Millions of people, we \nbelieve, were informed of those three flags that were burned, and \nmillions of people were offended by it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, this burning of the flag, I assume that that is \nlooked on as a very troublesome procedure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Only where the flag is brought into contempt, where people \ndeliberately, or contemptuously treat it in a destructive manner.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, let me----\n  Mr. HATCH. Excuse me. We certainly would make exceptions for soiled \nor damaged flags that do need to be destroyed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me take a look at the Boy Scout handbook here.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. In the Boy Scout handbook, of which there has been 35 \nmillion, it says regarding the flag: ``If it is torn or worn beyond \nrepair, destroy it in a dignified way, preferably by burning.'' We have \na pretty serious problem here, I suspect, if these Boy Scouts are \nburning the flag. What would we do? Would we send them to jail?\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, I think my good friend listened to me \nearlier, when I talked about actions that bring the flag into contempt, \ncontemptuous conduct with regard to the flag. Of course, I think any \nstatute in this area would make it very clear that the respectful \ndisposal of a soiled or worn out flag, including by burning, would \ncertainly be acceptable.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let us take the situation, we have got two flag burnings \ntaking place outside of a convention hall. One we have a bearded, \nuntidy protester that is burning a flag. The other we have a Boy Scout \nin uniform, and he is burning the flag, shall we say, in accordance \nwith the handbook. He is \n\n[[Page S18350]]\nburning the flag in a dignified fashion. What happens? Could you help \nme out?\n  Mr. HATCH. First of all, I do not think you would find a Boy Scout \nburning a flag outside a convention hall, even in a dignified fashion.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Suppose he chose to? He is a good Boy Scout. He is going \nfor a Star badge. So he is burning it in a dignified fashion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us say we have a flag that is soiled or otherwise \nready for destruction being burned in a dignified fashion.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let us assume the bearded protester----\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Let me----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No, your chance will come.\n  Mr. HATCH. I doubt any young person or Boy Scout would be doing that. \nBut if they could show that was the case, that they were respectfully \ndisposing of a worn or soiled flag by burning it, I do not think \nanybody is going to find any fault. Where that was the case, the law \nwould not make a distinction between the Boy Scout and someone who has \na beard or was disheveled in appearance. But I would have a difficult \ntime imagining any circumstance in which the public burning of a flag \nwould not be held contemptuous, unless it was literally a Boy Scout \nprocedure whereby they are burning a soiled or otherwise worn flag.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, we have a further problem. Up in my State, the good \nladies of 100 years ago did a magnificent hooked rug. It is on display. \nAnd it has a flag on it, American flag. That was made as a rug to walk \non. Now, if the good ladies of Providence, RI, should do a hooked rug \nnow and put it down and we walked on it, what would we do? Would they \ngo to jail?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I would certainly believe that the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, like myself, would have a little more \nrespect for the ability of Congress to do a good job of defining what \nconstitutes desecration of the flag. I have no doubt that Congress \nwould not do penalize conduct where it is clear that the flag is not \nbeing treated with contempt, such as the display of hooked rug which \nmay include a depiction of a flag. What would constitute contempt for \nor desecration of the flag would be determined by whatever statute \nCongress passes, in the event this amendment is ratified and becomes \npart of our constitution.\n  But let us be honest about this subject. We have all seen beautiful \nsweaters, we have seen beautiful ties, we have even seen sports \nequipment containing representations of the flag. I cannot imagine \nanybody in Congress prohibiting that. I think Congress would only be \nconcerned with those instances where the flag is physically treated \nwith contempt. Of course, we all know what that is, and that, in turn, \nwould be determined by the courts of law in accordance with the statute \nwe enact.\n  Now, if the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is concerned \nabout it, then he has 534 other people who he can work with to insure \nthat whatever flag protection statute is adopted is not too broadly \nwritten, so that it results in action being taken against people who \nreally are not trying to deface or otherwise treat the flag with \ncontempt.\n  Frankly, I have total confidence in the Congress of the United States \ncoming up with a very narrowly prescribed, very narrowly defined \nstatute on what exactly is holding the flag in contempt, what exactly \nis desecration of the flag. We all know what it is. It is a little bit \nlike obscenity. One of the Justices said, ``I know what it is when I \nsee it.'' I think the Court will have to make that determination.\n  I suspect we in Congress will do a good job. If the distinguished \nSenator sits in Congress at that time, and he does not like what \nstatute is advanced by Members of Congress, he has 534 people to which \nto appeal.\n  Let me make one last point. When Congress considers a flag protection \nstatute under this amendment, assuming it is adopted, you will still \nhave all of the legal and procedural protections of the Senate, \nincluding the right to filibuster, which would require 60 votes for \ncloture. In addition, we will always have the President, who can veto \nany legislation we pass. But remember, and this is the key point, \nwithout this amendment, or something similar thereto, neither the \nCongress nor the American people will ever--will ever--be able to \nprohibit desecration of the American flag. So that is why this \namendment is so important, and I think people understand that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, to label this amendment as important is \none of the great overstatements I have heard around this place.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think so.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And overstatements are not rare in this Chamber, I might \nsay. Here we are mustering the full power of the Federal Government to \ngo after something that has occurred 45 times in 6 years and, indeed, \nin 1 year there were three occasions.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can comment----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will give you your opportunity.\n  Mr. HATCH. For a correction.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. When the time comes. Let me finish my statement.\n  What the Senator from Utah is proposing is to cover a situation which \nhas rarely occurred in our country. He himself has said 45 instances of \nmedia coverage, and the truth of the matter is, the only time anybody \nburns a flag is when there is media coverage, except for these Boy \nScouts, and he has assured me he is not going to send them all to jail \nif they follow the precepts of the handbook where it says burn the \nflag, if you do it, it is perfectly all right, according to the \nhandbook.\n  I do not know what the law of the Senator from Utah is going to do to \nthem. But if they do it in a dignified way, it is all right.\n  What is going to happen, as clear as we are here today, is you pass \nthis statute and how is somebody going to get attention? They are going \nto burn the flag with hopes that the police will come along and they \nwill be dragged away in chains with handcuffs, with television all over \nthe place.\n  Mr. President, this is serious business what the Senator from Utah is \ndoing. What he is doing is adding an amendment to the Constitution that \nhas served us for 206 years, and in the course of those 206 years, \nthere have been 26 amendments. And, indeed, only 24 of them are still \nthere because one passed and was subsequently repealed by another \namendment, the so-called prohibition amendment. The 18th amendment was \nsubsequently repealed.\n  What are those amendments about? Are they about how to sing the Star \nSpangled Banner, or about burning flags? The amendments are about the \ngreatest things our country stands for. They are about freedoms--the \nfreedom to speak and the freedom to publish and the freedom to worship \nand the freedom from unlawful search and seizure and the freedom from \nslavery and the right to vote--rights and freedoms. They are not about \nprohibitions. They are about rights. The right to vote, the right for \nwomen to vote, the right for those 18 years and older to vote. They are \nwhat this country is all about.\n  In my State, when we built the State House at the turn of the \ncentury, those who built it inscribed around the rotunda the following \nwords in Latin. The translation is: ``Rare felicity of the times when \nit is permitted to think as you like and to say what you think.''\n  That all comes from the Constitution of the United States.\n  Here we are trivializing the Constitution. We are adding words about \ndesecration of the flag, as though that is a real problem in this \ncountry, in which 45 incidents have occurred over the past 6 years.\n  I just think it is a tragedy that we are spending time taking this \ngreat document, which is revered all over the world, not just in the \nUnited States, and trivializing by doing something about what is going \nto happen to the flag.\n  The second point is the one I have made about not only is this not a \ngreat problem, but the Senator from Utah has dealt with this subject \nfor 6 years. The last vote we had on it was 5 years ago in 1990, and it \nhas not come up since. But the Senator has been working on it, seeking \npassage, dealing with it, and now, 24 hours before we vote, he has \nchanged it.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Utah, what prompts him, when he \nhas been so deeply concerned with this matter, that suddenly he comes \nin at the last moment and changes it? I ask if there have been hearings \nin his committee on the language as he is now presenting it. \n\n[[Page S18351]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The answer to the distinguished Senator is that because \nthere has been criticism by some of our colleagues that under the \namendment, as originally worded, we could have 50 different State \nstatutes, we decided it is appropriate for Congress to be able to make \nthat final determination with respect to protection of what is our \nnational symbol. We therefore agreed to remove the language which would \ngiven the State power to enact flag protection statutes, and limit this \npower to the Congress.\n  But I think the Senator from Rhode Island is neglecting a key fact. \nThe amendment itself does not forbid anything. It merely allows \nCongress to enact a flag protection statute. In enacting any such \nstatute, the Senate would, of course, take into account the concerns of \nSenator Chafee and others. If my colleague does not believe that \nCongress can write a reasonable flag protection law, why should the \nAmerican people trust us to do anything?\n  So, I think this issue has been considered. I think we all understand \nit. I think we all know what we are doing here. There is just one \nsimple change in the amendment, and I think it is an appropriate \nchange. I agreed to make that change, even though there are many who \nwould prefer not to do so. So instead of both the Congress and the \nStates having the constitutional authority to enact flag protection \nlaws, under the revised amendment, only Congress would be able to do \nso.\n  In a very real sense, that is appropriate because we represent the \nwhole country. We would have a uniform flag protection statute. It \nmakes sense, and I would think the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland would be the first to admit that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator will be good enough to respond to \nthe specific question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Has there been a hearing on the amendment as the Senator \nis now presenting it to this body?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think so.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Or was it a hearing on the language previous to his \nchanging it here?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the hearing was on the all-embracing subject of \nwhether or not we should protect our flag, and the issue of States' \nrights came up during that hearing. It has been part of the discussion. \nThere is nothing new here.\n  Frankly, I do not think you need a hearing to determine whether you \nshould have 50 States do it or have the Congress. I think we are \ntotally capable right here in the Senate of the United States to make \nthat determination, and I believe that there are those who feel much \nmore confident that this amendment is the way to go than there were \nthose who supported having 50 States each with the power to enact a \nstatute.\n  Keep in mind, the reason we did it that way to begin with--and it was \npart of the hearings--is because before the Johnson case was decided, \nwe had 48 States plus the Federal Government with flag protection \nstatutes. Frankly, this was not something that was ignored or not \nconsidered. So, no, there is nothing new here. We hope this change will \nbring more people on board, thereby enabling us to pass this amendment. \nCongress will then have the power to pass a flag protection statute, \nwhich will hopefully put a stop to desecration of the flag, which I \nhappen to think is a very, very important thing. I am not alone. The \nvast majority of Senators believe in this. They should not be \ndenigrated, just as we do not denigrate those who disagree. We think \nyou are patriotic, intelligent Members of the Senate, that you believe \nin the value of the Constitution, in your own sense, and that you are \nfighting against this for good principles.\n\n  Well, we are fighting for it based on our own strongly held \nprinciples. This is not a political or partisan issue, as some have \nsuggested. Some of us feel very deeply that the flag needs to be \nprotected by a great Nation, and I am one of them.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do find it interesting that at this \ntime, particularly in this Senate, where the idea of States rights is \nin such complete sway and we must give the States control over \nMedicaid, the welfare, and whatever it might be, suddenly there is a \nreverse of course here in connection with this amendment, the amendment \nhaving been presented, in which it was either the Federal Government or \nthe 50 States, has now, in the last 24 hours before the vote arises, \nbeen changed to eliminate the States having the power to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that we have a lot of things we ought \nto be doing around this place. What are some of them? Well, I think we \nall recognize our education system in the United States needs some \nattention. I think we are all concerned about the recent peace \nagreement in Bosnia, whether we should commit our troops or whether we \nshould not commit our troops. We are all worried about the budget, how \nto balance it, what to do, what programs to increase, what programs to \nreduce. This is a matter of major concern to Americans. I believe our \nhealth care system is deserving of all the attention we can give to it. \nEach of these measures--and there are others we can think of--are \ndeserving of the hard work and attention of this body.\n  Now, is flag burning an offensive act? Of course, it is; we all \nrecognize that. And rightfully Americans are upset by it. But it seems \nto me that if we value the freedoms that define us as Americans, we \nwill refrain from taking an action like this to amend our Constitution.\n  I just want to read two letters, one from a Boy Scout in Rhode \nIsland, who wrote me on this subject:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chafee: I am a Boy Scout of troop 1 East \n     Greenwich, and I am a member of the civil air patrol. I am \n     writing to say that I am against amending the Constitution to \n     prohibit burning the flag as a protest. I think this because, \n     in this country, you have the right to protest peacefully. \n     Burning the flag may be offensive. But if everything \n     offensive were to be outlawed, then this country would not be \n     as free as it is today. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Stewart Fields.\n\n  I would like to read another statement, by James Warner, a decorated \nmarine who was held by the North Vietnamese as a prisoner of war for \n5\\1/2\\ years. He wrote about his experiences and about the \nextraordinary power of the idea of freedom. This is what he said:\n\n       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation where I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said, ``people in your country \n     protest against your cause; that proves that you are wrong.'' \n     ``No,'' I said, ``that proves I am right. In my country, we \n     are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people \n     disagree with us.''\n       The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face purple \n     with rage. He smashed his foot onto the table and screamed at \n     me to ``shut up.'' While he was ranting, I was astonished to \n     see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I have not \n     forgotten that look nor the satisfaction that I felt at using \n     his tool, the picture of the burning of the flag, against \n     him.\n\n  Mr. President, for those various reasons, trivializing of the \nConstitution, taking this document that provides the great freedoms \nthat we all live by and putting in a provision about burning the flag--\nthat is not the way we deal with the Constitution of the United States. \nWhat is next--that you have to stand at attention when they sing the \nStar Spangled Banner?\n  Mr. President, we have plenty of work to do around this body, and \nthere are matters that ought to take our time, and we should not be \nspending it like this. We are dealing with a subject that is hardly an \nepidemic in the United States--45 instances in 6 years. Yet, we go to \nall this trouble to enact a constitutional amendment for it.\n  Mr. President, you cannot mandate respect or pride in the flag. I \nthink it is far better to act from motives of love and respect than out \nof obedience. So I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment put forth \nby the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, first of all, it is not 45 in 6 years; it \nis 65 in 5 years. I might add that that is just the Congressional \nResearch Service's figure. That does not include numerous other \nincidents of flag desecration that may have occurred, and it does not \naccount for the millions of people who have seen our flag desecrated.\n  Some say there is no need for this amendment, that it is not \nconstitutional. Those who say that have not \n\n[[Page S18352]]\nread the Constitution very carefully, particularly article V. Amending \nthe Constitution is the mechanism provided by the Founding Fathers to \nenable us, among other things, to correct wrongful decisions by the \nSupreme Court. That is why we have article V in there, to be able to \namend the Constitution.\n  By the way, there are 27 amendments to the Constitution, not 26 as \nstated by Senator Chafee.\n  I might say this to those who say there is no need for the amendment \nand that we are not faced with many flag desecrations: First, if we \nfail to provide legal protection to the American flag, it is we, as \nMembers of Congress, who would be devaluating the flag. As Justice \nStevens, one of our more liberal Justices, stated in his dissent in \nJohnson, ``Sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish \nits value--both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and \nfor those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.'' One \nyear later, in Eichman, Justice Stevens wrote that the value of the \nflag as a symbol of the ideas of liberty, equality, and tolerance that \nAmericans have passionately defended throughout our history has already \nbeen damaged as a result of this Court's decision to place its stamp of \napproval on the act of flag burning. We can and should act to correct \nthat damage by restoring to Congress the power to protect our flag \nagainst physical desecration.\n  Moreover, the problem of flag desecration remains with us. I have to \nsay that, earlier this year for example, two American flags were burned \nin Honolulu as a show of sovereignty for what protesters called the \nKingdom of Hawaii and as a protest against statehood. There were other \nflag burnings during protests in Illinois and Pennsylvania. Last year, \nthere was a flag burning during a demonstration against proposition 187 \nin California. A college student who tried to prevent a second such \ndesecration was beaten by the protesters. In another instance, an \nAmerican flag was burned during a news conference outside police \nheadquarters in Cleveland, OH, after the U.S. Supreme Court let stand \nan Ohio Supreme Court ruling overturning the conviction of an \nindividual who burned an American flag during a protest against the \nPersian Gulf war. Another flag burning occurred during a demonstration \nagainst capital punishment in Nebraska. I suspect there are many \nothers.\n  To compare the burning of the flag by a Boy Scout--a soiled or \notherwise worn out flag--to that of the bearded Gregory Johnson, is, I \nthink, stretching it just a wee bit. Johnson held the flag in contempt, \nand there is no doubt that his burning of the flag was done for \npublicity purposes, so that millions of Americans would see and be \naffected by how he treated our flag.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island sees little difference between \nthe bearded protester burning a flag to start a riot and the Boy Scout \nwho ceremoniously burns a flag to dispose of it, as Boy Scouts are \ntaught to do when flags are soiled or otherwise ruined.\n  Without this amendment they are both treated exactly the same. I find \nthat offensive and reprehensible that we treat the respectful action of \na young Boy Scout in burning a soiled or otherwise wornout flag, the \nsame as the conduct--and it is ``action,'' not speech--of a Gregory \nJohnson. Without this amendment, they are both treated the same.\n  Do my friends who make these kinds of arguments want there to be 60 \nGregory Johnsons running around defiling the flag without fear of \nsanction? They may, but 80 percent of Americans disagree with them, and \nrightfully so. They may, but 312 of our colleagues over in the House \ndisagree with them, and rightfully so. They may, but 49 State \nlegislatures, including that of the Senator's own home State of Rhode \nIsland, disagree with him. And the other supporters of this amendment, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, disagree with him as well.\n  I have to respectfully take exception with a few of my colleagues \nwhen they ask why we are taking time to consider this amendment when we \nhave so many important things to do. We spend time around here in so \nmany desultory ways that do not amount to a hill of beans; it is about \ntime we spent time on something this significant.\n  Ask the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Gold Star \nWives of America, and the millions of members of organizations who have \njoined together in the Citizens Flag Alliance why they brought us this \nproposal, or why they asked us to debate it.\n  Mr. President, we are debating legislation these Americans consider a \nhigh priority. There are millions of them. I hope that the opponents of \nthis measure would not argue that this citizen-initiated effort is \nunworthy of the debate by this august body.\n  I suggest my colleagues would be candid and should get all our work, \nincluding this amendment, done. There is nothing that would stop us \nfrom doing that; all we have to do is do it.\n  I would also call to my colleagues' attention the fact that it was a \nvery short time after the Bill of Rights was passed that the 11th \namendment to the Constitution was added to it.\n  Why? It was added to it to overturn a bad Supreme Court decision, \nChism versus Jordan. There have been other amendments to the \nConstitution overturning bad Supreme Court decisions. I think you have \nto look long and hard to find a Supreme Court decision much worse than \nthe Johnson and Eichman decisions. They were 5-to-4 decisions, hotly \ncontested.\n  By the way, some of the most liberal people on the Court disagreed \nwith those decisions, such as Justice Stevens. In the past, some of the \nmost liberal Justices on the Court, including Chief Justice Warren, Abe \nFortas, Hugo Black, a first amendment absolutist, and Justice Stevens, \njust to mention four, have all stated we have a right to protect the \nflag.\n  Now, all of a sudden, because of a wrong-headed 5-to-4 decision, the \nlaw is otherwise. Unfortunately, it cannot be changed by mere statute, \nas some would like to do so. The fact of the matter is, why do we have \nany concern at all? Why would we take so much time debating this when \nwe ought to pass it without even much of a debate?\n  Let the States determine whether they want to ratify this as an \namendment to our Constitution. Amending the Constitution is not a \nsimple task. That is why we only have 27 amendments to the \nConstitution. Not only do we have to have a two-thirds vote in both \nbodies of congress, but we then have to get three-quarters of the \nStates to ratify any proposed amendment.\n  The reasons some of my friends do not want this amendment to be \nadopted are multifold, I am sure. I will not denigrate their reasons or \npatriotism in the process, but they should not denigrate ours, either, \nespecially since we are in the vast majority, and the vast majority of \npeople in this country feel the way we do.\n  The fact of the matter is that if three-quarters of the States would \nvote to ratify this, then it ought to be in the Constitution. I'd bet \nmoney that three-quarters of the States would ratify this amendment so \nfast that it would make the head of my dear friend from Rhode Island \nspin in the process. The fact of the matter is this is what the \nAmerican people want, and the reason they want it, is because they \nvalue the flag of the United States, and devalue those who would hold \nit in contempt, as they should.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I was interested in the presentation of \nthe Senator from Utah where he stressed I should be impressed that 47 \nStates, or whatever it is, asked Congress to pass this amendment \nincluding the legislature in my own State; I should be impressed by \nthat.\n  It comes from the same Senator who in his own amendment has \neliminated the State's power to pass laws in connection with the \ndesecration of the flag.\n  On one hand, the States are people who should be listened to with \ngreat caution and respect; on the other hand, he eliminates them from \nhis amendment 24 hours before it comes up for a vote.\n  Now, Mr. President, since we are quoting from the Supreme Court, and \nI might say he quoted extensively from the decision involving Texas \nversus Johnson. Johnson has gained greater fame from burning the flag \nthan he ever would if he stood at attention and saluted it.\n  That, seems to me, Mr. President, is the reason people burn the flag. \nYou \n\n[[Page S18353]]\nmake it against the law and they will be out there to a far greater \nextent than they are now because that will get them attention. That is \nwhat they want. These are misguided individuals. Most of all, they want \nthe police to come and seize them and drag them off to jail because \nthey burnt the flag. Mr. Gregory Johnson is now famous, far more famous \nthan if the situation had just been ignored.\n  This is what the Supreme Court said:\n\n       The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to \n     punish those who feel differently about these matters, it is \n     to persuade them that they are wrong. You courageous self-\n     reliant men with confidence in the power of free and fearless \n     reasoning applied through the processes of popular \n     government, no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear \n     and present unless the incidence of the evil is so imminent \n     that it may fall before there is an opportunity for full \n     discussion. We can imagine no more appropriate response to \n     burning a flag than waving one's own, no better way to \n     counter a flag burner's message than by saluting the flag \n     that burns, no surer means of preserving the dignity even of \n     the flag that is burned, than by, as one witness here did, \n     [referring back to the situation in Texas] according to the \n     remains a respectful burial. We do not desecrate the flag by \n     punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the \n     freedom that this cherished emblem represents.\n\n  We have not discussed here today that the whole reason this is before \nus is that the Supreme Court of the United States has said this is a \nlimitation on the freedom of expression when you pass statutes such as \nsuggested by the Senator from Utah.\n  So instead of expanding our freedoms, it is a limitation of our \nfreedom. I think it should be rejected. I certainly hope it is.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my friend quoted the Johnson decision \n``just persuade them that they are wrong.'' My goodness, I guess you \ncould apply that to anything. The reason that Gregory Johnson got so \nmuch notoriety out of his act of desecration was not because the Texas \nflag desecration was effectively enforced, it was because the statute \nwas not effectively enforced. It is because he got away with it.\n  Had that statute been effective in preventing his flag desecration, \nwe would never have heard of Gregory Johnson. The reason we have heard \nof him is because people were outraged by the action that he committed.\n  ``Persuade them they are wrong''--I guess that is what we should do \nwith regard to marijuana usage. Do not treat our children in such a bad \nway. Persuade them they are wrong.\n  A reason we punish people is to persuade them they are wrong. That is \none reason why we have criminal laws. Let me tell you, Gregory Johnson \nwould have learned a lot quicker that he is wrong if he had been \npunished under that Texas statute, instead of getting away with it as \nhe did.\n  What if we just had 45 murders in this country? Would that mean we \nwould not want to do something about murder? The fact of the matter is, \nI do not think it is a question of numbers here. It is a question of \nwhat is right and what is wrong.\n  I do not intend to be much longer on this. I notice the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama wants to speak, and I want to listen to him, \nbecause, in my opinion, he is one of the people I most admire in this \nbody. I think he can speak with authority on this issue, as much if not \nmore than any other person.\n  But for those who have been so critical about this, let me just ask a \nfew questions. The equal protection clause of the 14th amendment is an \nextremely important part of our Constitution, as is the first \namendment. Let us just assume that the year is 1900, just a few years \nafter the Supreme Court's infamous 8-to-1 decision in Plessy versus \nFerguson, interpreting the equal protection clause as permitting \nseparate but equal State facilities. Suppose 49 legislatures had called \nfor a constitutional amendment to overturn that decision, which is what \nis the case here. Suppose 312 Members of the other body had voted for a \nconstitutional amendment that said, ``No State shall deny any person \nequal access to the same transportation, education and other public \nfacilities and benefits on the basis of race''?\n  Now this amendment is before the Senate. Would my friend be arguing, \nin 1900, ``Oh, I deplore and detest the States' separation of races, \nbut the Supreme Court has just told us by an overwhelming majority that \nthe equal protection clause allows separate but equal facilities, so \nthere is nothing Congress can or should do about it''? Would the \nSenator view the amendment as amending the equal protection clause, or \njust reversing a tragically erroneous interpretation of that clause?\n  Would my friend be arguing that, as much as he disagrees with Plessy \nversus Ferguson, the equal protection clause is what the Supreme Court \nsays it is at any one time? Would he vote against the amendment \noverturning Plessy? Of course not. The same situation is now before us. \nThe Supreme Court has misconstrued the first amendment, after all these \nyears, in 1989--misconstrued it.\n  We do not have to acquiesce in that error. It was a 5-4 decision. \nThey were wrong. Article V gives us a right to amend the Constitution \nand change that wrongheaded decision, something that has been done \nbefore. I cite the 11th amendment, among others. The question is, and I \nthink this is a legitimate question, and in this sense certainly my \ncolleague from Rhode Island raises a good question, and that is: Is it \nimportant enough to the Senate to overturn the Supreme Court decisions \nin Johnson and Eichman? Is it important enough to restore to the \nAmerican people the power they had for 200 years to protect the \nnational emblem, our American flag?\n  A majority of this body, and hopefully a constitutional majority of \nthis body, say yes, you are doggone right it is. And I am one of them, \nand so is the distinguished Senator from Alabama. So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I can only assume the Senator from Utah \nwas being facetious when he started suggesting that murder is no \ndifferent from the burning of the flag.\n  I also would point out, as I am sure the Senator from Utah knows \nbeing a constitutional scholar, that the equal protection amendment \nexpanded freedoms in the United States. It did not limit freedoms; it \nexpanded them. Whereas this amendment is a limitation on the freedom of \nexpression, and there is a whale of a difference right there.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my great hope that this constitutional \namendment will be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his kind words that he said about \nme earlier. Unfortunately, I was not on the floor. I had an appointment \non a vital matter. I had to leave, so I did not hear him. But I thank \nhim very much.\n  I want to make some distinctions. One is the difference between \nconstitutional language and implementing legislation. In the Biden \namendment, there is a limitation on what can be done by the Congress if \nthat constitutional amendment is adopted. It says the Congress has the \npower to enact the following law, and then sets out that law in some \nspecificity.\n  The Hatch amendment basically allows Congress to be able to enact \nlegislation dealing with the physical desecration of the flag, and all \nof these matters pertaining to rugs, Boy Scouts and all of that as \nmentioned by my friend and colleague Senator Chafee, can be taken care \nof in implementing legislation.\n  There is a distinction between constitutional language and \nimplementing legislation. So, by adopting very brief language which \ngives authority to Congress to adopt implementing legislation, it does \nnot mean that you are going to have a situation where it would be \nunlawful to walk on a hooked rug or where it would be unlawful for a \nBoy Scout to burn a flag in a situation where it has been torn or \nsoiled or something of that nature. That is for implementing \nlegislation to be able to address in order to take care of that \nsituation.\n  The next matter I want to address is the issue pertaining to \ntriviality. I think we have entered a stage in our society where we \nlook at things that are extremely important sometimes as being trivial. \nWe look to some things and we say that they are trivial, but I think we \nhave trivialized so many values and symbols that, basically, we no \nlonger have anything that is sacred. I \n\n[[Page S18354]]\nthink it is time that we have some matters, including symbols, that are \nsacred in this United States.\n  We have seen the deterioration of morals, we have seen the \ndeterioration of respect for institutions and for traditions, and I \nthink it is time we look at some of these concerns that are very \nimportant to this country. I think the flag is, and I think the flag \nought to be sacred.\n  I have spoken previously and recited statements of the feelings of \ncertain great protectors of the first amendment, such as Justice Hugo \nBlack, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, and \ntheir feelings toward the Constitution and the right to protect the \nflag. I think, when you look at their writings and see how they express \nthemselves on this, that is an answer to those who feel that this is \nsomething that will take away from the freedoms or that Congress is \ninvading an area that it should not invade. I think that we also have a \nright to likewise prohibit desecration of the American flag without \nimpinging on Americans' right to freedom of speech.\n  I strongly support a constitutional amendment to prevent the \ndesecration of the American flag. As an original co-sponsor, along with \nSenator Hatch, I urge our colleagues to join in protecting the sanctity \nof this symbol of our great Nation. As I have said before on the Senate \nfloor, I feel that the Supreme Court's decision in Texas versus \nJohnson, incorrectly places flag burning under the protection of the \nfirst amendment. In my judgement, it is our responsibility to change \nthat decision and return the flag to the position of respect it \ndeserves.\n  Few people would disagree with the argument that the American flag \nstands as one of the most powerful and meaningful symbols of freedom \never created. Justice Stevens calls the flag a national asset much like \nthe Lincoln Memorial. He states that:\n\n       Though the asset at stake in this case is intangible, given \n     its unique value, the same interest supports a prohibition on \n     the desecration of the American flag.\n\n  I must agree with Justice Stevens in his belief that the flag should \nbe protected from such desecration. However, I believe that the flag \nalso has a tangible value. I feel that the Court could have expressed \nan opinion that would have allowed protection to both values.\n  The flag holds a mighty grip over many people in this country. Its \npatriotic appeal is as unique to every person as a fingerprint. \nThousands of Americans have followed the flag into battle and many, to \nour sorrow, have left these battles in coffins draped proudly by the \nAmerican flag. Nothing quite approaches the power of the flag as it \ndrapes those who died for it--or the power of the flag as it is handed \nto the widow of that fallen soldier. The meaning behind these flags \ngoes far beyond the cloth used to make the flag or the dyes used to \ncolor Old Glory--red, white, and blue. The flag reaches to the very \nheart of what it means to be an American. It would be a tragedy for us \nto allow the power of the flag to be undermined through desecration. \nAllowing the burning of that flag creates a mockery of the great \nrespect so many patriotic Americans have for the flag.\n  As I have stated before, I feel on many different levels that the \nSupreme Court's decision was wrong. I feel it was wrong for me \npersonally, it was wrong for patriotism, it was wrong for this country, \nbut perhaps most importantly, this decision was judicially wrong.\n  I want to emphasize that although I am a strong believer in first \namendment rights, I recognize that first amendment rights are not \nabsolute and unlimited. There have been numerous decisions of the \nSupreme Court that limit freedom of expression.\n  Some of history's great protectors of the freedom of speech have \nagreed that the first amendment is not absolute. Many of these \nprotectors have agreed that the flag is a symbol of such profound \nimportance that protecting it is permissible. I will be quoting from \nsome of the protectors of the flag and the freedom of speech such as \nSupreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Hugo Black, Justice \nJohn Paul Stevens and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n  In a landmark case reflecting the Supreme Court's long-held belief \nthat the freedom of expression is not absolute, the Court in Shenk v. \nUnited States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), stated that:\n\n       The most stringent protection of free speech would not \n     protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and \n     causing a panic.\n\n  Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated that:\n\n       The question in every case is whether the words [actions] \n     used are used in such clear circumstances and are of such a \n     nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will \n     bring about the substantive evils that the Congress has a \n     right to prevent.\n\n  Clearly the indignation caused by the Johnson decision and the \nfisticuffs which have broken out in flag burning attempts show that \nflag burning should not be protected by the first amendment. What if \nthe flag burning had occurred in wartime? Certainly, a clear and \npresent danger would be present.\n  Justice Stevens wrote in Los Angeles City Council v. Taxpayers for \nVincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984), that:\n\n       The first amendment does not guarantee the right to imply \n     every conceivable method of communication at all times and in \n     all places.\n\n  Arguments have been made that limitations on the freedom of \nexpression refer only to bodily harm, however, the Supreme Court has \nrecognized the need for individuals to protect their honor, integrity, \nand reputation when injured by libel or slander. This is seen in New \nYork Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), which provides standards \nregarding the libel of public figures and Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. \n374 (1967), which provides standards regarding libel of private \nindividuals.\n  These holdings protect an individual's honor from defamation. I see \nno reason why the honor of our flag should not be protected.\n  Arguments have also been made that limitations on free speech involve \nonly civil suits. However, the Court has continually upheld criminal \nstatutes involving obscene language and pornography. This is seen in \nNew York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), which upholds a New York \nstatute regarding child pornography and Miller v. California, 413 U.S. \n15 (1973), which provides much of the current legal framework for the \nregulation of obscenity.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has even upheld criminal statutes involving \ndraft card burning. In United States v. O'Brian, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), \nthe Court upheld the Federal statute which prohibited the destruction \nor mutilation of a draft card. In reaching this decision the Court \nexpressly stated:\n\n       [w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless \n     variety of conduct can be labeled ``speech'' whenever the \n     person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an \n     idea.\n\n  Certainly the people of America have a right to expect that the \nhonor, integrity, and reputation of this Nation's flag should be \nprotected. If draft card burning can be prohibited, surely burning the \nAmerican flag can also be prohibited. Does a draft card have more honor \nthan the American flag? Certainly not.\n  In his dissent in Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 577 (1969), Chief \nJustice Earl Warren wrote:\n\n       I believe that the states and the federal government do \n     have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \n     and disgrace . . . However, it is difficult for me to imagine \n     that, had the court faced this issue, it would have concluded \n     otherwise.\n\n  In this same case, Justice Hugo Black dissented stating:\n\n       It passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a state from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American flag an offense.\n\n  I do not think that anyone can question that Hugo Black and Earl \nWarren were champions of the first amendment, but they recognized that \nthe flag was something different, something special. The Supreme Court \nsubstantiated this view in Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974), when \nthe majority of the court noted that:\n\n       [c]ertainly nothing prevents a legislature from defining \n     with substantial specificity what constitutes forbidden \n     treatment of the United States flag.\n\n  Finally I would like to quote from Justice Stevens in Texas v. \nJohnson, when he says about the flag:\n\n       It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of \n     religious tolerance and of good will for other people who \n     share our aspirations. The symbol carries its message to \n     dissidents both home and abroad who may have no interest at \n     all in our national unity and survival.\n\n  I am a strong believer that the rights under the first amendment \nshould be \n\n[[Page S18355]]\nfully protected and do not feel that an amendment changing these rights \nshould be adopted except in very rare instances. The Founding Fathers, \nin drafting article V of the Constitution, intended that if it would be \nextremely difficult to amend the Constitution, requiring a two-thirds \nvote of both Houses of Congress and a difficult ratification process \nrequiring the vote of three-fourths of the States. The history of this \ncountry shows that only 27 amendments to the Constitution have been \nadopted and only 17 after the Bill of Rights was ratified.\n  Some may ask Why have a constitutional amendment; Why not try \nlegislation? To those I would say the Senate has passed statutes \nconcerning flag desecration. As a body we have tried to oppose the \nprotection of flag desecration, but statutory law has not worked. We \nhave a number of groups that have joined together to form the Citizen's \nFlag Alliance. There are about 90 organizations in this wide ranging \ncoalition. In addition, 46 States' legislatures have passed \nmemorializing resolutions calling for the flag to be protected by the \nCongress.\n  In my judgement, we should heed this call and act decisively to \nensure that the American flag remains protected and continues to hold \nthe high place we have afforded it in both our hearts and history. The \nflag is indeed an important national asset which we must always support \nas we would support the country herself. In closing, I want to share \nwith you the eloquent words of Henry Ward Beecher's work, ``The \nAmerican Flag,'' which expresses this sentiment:\n\n       A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, sees not \n     the flag only, but the nation itself. He reads in the flag \n     the government, the principles, the truths, the history which \n     belong to the nation that sets it forth.\n\n  I hope that my colleagues will consider all that the flag means to \nthem, and in so doing support this amendment, which protects those \nideals.\n  I would like to also make a statement concerning the issue pertaining \nto Judiciary Committee hearings on the amendment. I believe Senator \nChafee asked if any hearings were held? There was an extensive hearing \nheld on the proposed constitutional amendment.\n  During that hearing, as is the purpose of congressional hearings, you \nhave criticisms that are made, and you have alternatives that are \noffered. So, therefore, the committee had alternatives that were \npresented. The results of the hearing raised some legitimate issues \npertaining to the question of having the States have their right to \npass statutes banning flag desecration. The committee did not \nnecessarily hear comments on the exact language of every possible \nconstitutional word that might be considered.\n  But in the end, you have a record which shows that the hearing \ngenerally covered those questions which would apply to the particular \nissue of whether or not the States ought to have the right to ban flag \ndesecration. So this issue was considered and members of the committee \nwere informed as to the merits of allowing States to adopt implementing \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I am glad to follow my good \nfriend from Alabama in remarks that he made about the amendment. I want \nto speak about the amendment as well. So I want it very clear that in \nspeaking today, I do so in strong support of the constitutional \namendment to protect the American flag.\n  I also want to state that there is a pending amendment by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, my good friend, Senator McConnell. And I also want to \nsay that I rise in strong opposition to the statutory approach to \nprotecting the American flag. I believe that Senator McConnell's \namendment is either unconstitutional or unnecessary. Either way, I \noppose it and stand in strong support of the constitutional amendment.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that I was one of only three \nRepublicans who opposed Senator Biden's statutory attempt to protect \nthe flag when it passed this body several years ago. So I believed \nthen, as I do now, that the only way to permit the American people to \nprotect the flag is to change the Constitution.\n  The approach advocated by Senator McConnell can be interpreted in two \nways. Under one interpretation, this statute provides important new \nprotections for the American flag. If this is the correct \ninterpretation, then the statute is unconstitutional under the Eichman \ndecision which struck down Senator Biden's statutory approach, passed \nby the Congress several years ago.\n  Under the other interpretation, this statute simply makes explicit \nprotections for the flag which have already existed and which exist, \nnot to protect the flag by the way, but to protect the public peace and \nproperty.\n  For example, the statute would criminalize the destruction of the \nflag if the destruction would lead to a breach of peace. Well, this \nprobably is the case in most States already, most of which have \ndisorderly conduct crimes already on their statute books.\n  So in conclusion, I oppose the statute because it is either \nineffective as a way of protecting the flag or it is unconstitutional \nas the Court has already expressed in the Eichman case when it struck \ndown Senator Biden's statute that I was one of only three Republicans \nto vote against at that time.\n  Even though I am respectful of Senator McConnell's good intentions, I \nstill support the constitutional amendment. This amendment represents \nAmerican democracy at work and American democracy at its best. I know \nthat there is an overwhelming groundswell of support for this \namendment. And I know that that is true because in my home State of \nIowa I have seen this expressed. On a daily basis I receive letters and \nphone calls from concerned Iowans asking that we in the Senate do what \nit takes to protect the flag. I think it is time then that we do the \nright thing, and doing the right thing is passing this constitutional \namendment.\n  I also think this debate is timely as the first American troops are \nnow arriving in Bosnia. I am skeptical of the mission to Bosnia, but I \nsupport, like all of my colleagues will do, the efforts of our troops \nthere. I support the flag under which those troops will serve.\n  As a rule, Iowans are very politically active and aware. Any of my \ncolleagues who have tried to run for President, because we are the \nfirst caucus State, know that to be a fact. But with this amendment, I \nhave the definite sense that even those Iowans that are not generally \npolitically active have become deeply involved in the efforts to \nprotect the flag.\n  In other words, this desecration amendment is part of a grassroots \neffort which has energized segments of our Nation which, for whatever \nreasons, chose not to participate in the political process. And I think \nthat is a wonderful thing to have happened in our democratic system.\n  This flag protection amendment is the product of tireless efforts by \nthe American people. I believe it would be wrong for the Senate to \nstand in the way of the American people on such a very important issue. \nNow, some may ask, ``Why have the American people become so involved in \nthis effort to protect the flag?'' I believe the answer lies in the \nrediscovery of core American values, like respect for authority. Our \nflag is the ultimate symbol of our great Nation and what America stands \nfor.\n  For many years, starting with the so-called counterculture in the \n1960's, it seemed very fashionable to criticize our Government, to \ncriticize our Nation as a people. That, of course, led to the lack of \nrespect for our great country in general, and, of course, lack of \nrespect for the flag in particular was one way of expressing an \nantiauthoritarian attitude. But those critics have been proven wrong, \nand their shrill anti-Americanism has been thoroughly rejected.\n  With last November's election returns--and those election returns \nwere expressing the view of the American people--they were expressing a \nview of support of core American values like respect for authority and \nrespect for our country. It seems to me that since last November, then, \nit is only natural that right now the American people are pushing \nharder than ever before to protect the American flag.\n  As far as I am concerned, we as a nation will never realize our full \ndestiny as a great nation and a great people \n\n[[Page S18356]]\nuntil we instill respect and concern for America in every one of our \nyoung people. That is a very important reason to support this \namendment. Passing this amendment will not do that by itself, but \npassing this amendment is going to express at the highest degree that \nwe do have in our society basic constitutional principles that are a \nbasis for our society, a basis for our society for 207 or 208 years.\n  Finally, we simply cannot discuss the flag without our considering \nwhat the flag means to our veterans, to those brave Americans who \nfought for freedom in far away places.\n  I have to be somewhat apologetic when I speak about the \nsentimentalism that is legitimate for our veterans who have fought and \ndied to protect our country, because, Mr. President, as I am sure you \nknow, I have never served in the military.\n  I have an awesome responsibility when I speak about what our veterans \nhave done to explain that I, as an individual, do not fully understand, \nnot having served in the military, exactly what that is all about. But \nthat does not lessen my respect for what our veterans have gone \nthrough, and I praise the Lord that they have sacrificed for the \nfreedom that we all enjoy today.\n  On the other hand, I have seen the hand of the veteran very much in \nthis grassroots movement to pass this constitutional amendment.\n  So I say, if any of my colleagues in this body are undecided on this \namendment, I encourage each of them to consult with the veterans and to \nremember all those Americans who have died protecting the American \nflag, protecting the principles of our great society that the American \nflag stands for.\n  Quite frankly, if we do not pass this amendment, I do not see how we \ncan go home and look our veterans square in the eyes. With budgetary \ncutbacks forcing Congress to make difficult cuts in all Federal \nprograms, even including veterans programs, it seems to me the least we \ncan do is to pass this amendment out of respect for what they have done \nfor our country.\n  With a President who has restored diplomatic relations with the \nCommunist regime in Vietnam without a full accounting of our war dead \nand MIA's, it seems to me the least we can do is pass this amendment. \nAnd with American troops soon in harm's way, as they are with 6 million \nmines in Bosnia, of where we have only discovered 1 million of them \nthus far, it seems to me that the least we can do is to pass this \namendment.\n  Finally, I want to mention what I think is an ironic situation. Some \nwho oppose this amendment feel that it is dangerous to amend the first \namendment. I think this stems from a sincere feeling that the first \namendment is sacrosanct and, in fact, it is, Mr. President. But the \nfact of the matter is that many of these same people who oppose this \nflag amendment as a constitutional amendment have sponsored another \nconstitutional amendment, or maybe more than one constitutional \namendment to change the first amendment in other contexts. But I only \nwant to speak about one of those efforts.\n  This irony certainly does not apply to everyone in the Senate who \nopposes this flag protection amendment, but there is a long list of \npeople in past Congresses who opposed a flag amendment, and look at the \nlist of people who have cosponsored or favored a constitutional \namendment which amends the first amendment, the same as the flag \namendment does, but in this other instance I am speaking of, it \noverturns the Buckley versus Valeo decision to permit limits on \ncampaign expenditures.\n  In other words, I am saying to you, Mr. President, that we have \nMembers of this body who say that the first amendment is so well \nwritten and historically has never been changed--and the implication is \nthat it should never be changed in the future--that we should not pass \nan amendment that would protect the flag, thereby somewhat changing the \nfirst amendment as it relates to that aspect of free speech.\n  But those same people would say that it is all right to amend the \nfirst amendment when it comes to campaign expenditures and, in fact, if \nyou overturn the Buckley case, it is a very significant limit on true \npolitical speech. It would be a limit on verbal free speech as opposed \nto our amending the first amendment in the case of the flag which, at \nthe most, can be said to be a limit on nonverbal free speech.\n  So, what we have here is a situation where those of us who favor this \namendment and those who say it is wrong to amend the first amendment in \nthe case of the flag, but that it is OK to amend the first amendment if \nyou want to limit verbal free speech when it comes to campaign \ncontributions, that you have more than enough votes right here to pass \nthe amendment.\n  This amendment, I think, is going to pass anyway, but if there is \nsome doubt about it, there are a few Members of this body who take the \nposition you should not amend the first amendment to protect the \nAmerican flag, but it is OK to pass an amendment to limit political \nspeech through limits on campaign spending. If you put those together, \nwe have more than enough to pass this amendment.\n  So there is some inconsistency between people who are making the \nargument that we should not amend the first amendment in the case of \nthe flag because of what it might do to nonverbal speech--and I do not \nthink that nonverbal speech is protected by the first amendment--and \nthose who are willing to change the Constitution when they overturn the \nValeo case. What makes this inconsistency even more ironic, when you \ntend to limit campaign expenditures, that tends to benefit incumbents \nrather than challengers. We can support that statistically. That is a \nvery selfish motive for changing the first amendment.\n  People can be inconsistent. I am probably inconsistent on some things \nmyself, but I think it really weakens the argument against this flag \namendment, when you are in favor of amending the Constitution to limit \ncampaign expenditures, which is the ultimate of political speech.\n  So, in conclusion, Mr. President, it is time that the Senate do the \nright thing. We tried it once before several years ago, did not get the \njob done and passed a statute that was declared unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court. It seems to me there ought to be ample evidence that if \nwe want to ultimately protect the flag and do it in the surest way \npossible, then the only right thing to do is for this Senate to pass \nthis constitutional amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just have printed in the Record a \nfew items. I have a letter from Harvard Law School from Richard D. \nParker, professor of law, with regard to the McConnell law and why it \nwas unconstitutional and why it would become such by the Supreme Court \nof the United States as a statute. There is no way the statute could be \nheld constitutional under the decisions of Johnson and Eichman.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, December 9, 1995.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Recently, I have read two more \n     commentaries on the constitutional validity of the proposed \n     ``Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' One is a \n     letter from Mr. Bruce Fein. The other is a memo from Mr. \n     Robert Peck and two professors of law [hereinafter the Peck \n     Memo]. Both claim that the narrow protection of the American \n     flag afforded by the proposed statute is ``content-neutral'' \n     and, hence, would be upheld by the Supreme Court under its \n     established principles of First Amendment law.\n       The advice is inaccurate. The reason is that it is based on \n     misunderstanding of the principles and precedents to be \n     applied. Since the Fein letter is perfunctory and includes no \n     claim not also made in the fuller Peck memo, I'll concentrate \n     on the latter, breaking into three categories its \n     misrepresentation of the view--as crystallized since 1989--of \n     a majority of the Justices.\n       (1) The Flag Cases: Johnson and Eichman.\n       The Peck Memo misreads these two decisions by tearing them \n     away from the principle that undergirds them. It portrays \n     parts \n\n[[Page S18357]]\n     of the governing doctrine as if they constituted the whole. It mistakes \n     the tip for the whole iceberg. Thus is betrays a fundamental \n     canon of good lawyering: that the parts can be understood \n     only in the context of the whole that makes sense of them.\n       The Memo observes that neither Johnson nor Eichman involved \n     a proven breach of the peace or incitement to imminent \n     violence through destruction of a flag and that neither \n     involved theft of the flag that was destroyed. It says the \n     Court noted that those factors were not present. Then, it \n     commits an elementary error. It suggests that the principle \n     underlying the two decisions is, therefore, inapplicable when \n     those factors are present--as they would be under the \n     proposed statute. Law students learn, early in their \n     education, that a step in the step-by-step unfolding of law \n     should not be read as if it were the final step, the complete \n     unfolded doctrine. The trick of interpreting court decisions \n     involves discerning the deeper general principle that is \n     immanent in them.\n       The Peck Memo seems, at times, to suggest that the \n     principled focus of Johnson and Eichman had only to do with a \n     definition of what constitutes ``protected'' expressive \n     conduct. It insists that the sorts of conduct reached by the \n     proposed statute (incitement of imminent violence through \n     destruction of a flag and destruction of a stolen flag) are \n     not ``protected'' expression. It thereby obscures the deeper \n     principled focus of modern free speech law--the focus, \n     indeed, of the Johnson and Eichman opinions themselves. That \n     is to say, it obscures the Court's focus on what interest \n     government is serving. In Johnson, the Court made this very \n     clear: ``It is, in short, not simply the verbal or nonverbal \n     nature of the expression, but the governmental interest at \n     stake that helps to determine'' the validity of a regulation. \n     (491 U.S. at 406-407.) By the same token, the Eichman Court \n     located the ``fundamental flaw'' of the statute in the \n     ``concern'' of the Congress that gave rise to it. (496 U.S. \n     at 317.) The question, then, is: What kind of governmental \n     interests is it that offends the Court's basic theory of the \n     First Amendment?\n       The Memo assumes that there are but two sorts of \n     governmental interest that might invite judicial criticism of \n     regulations involving the flag: a direct interest in \n     prohibiting expression and a discriminatory interest in \n     prohibiting advocacy--through destruction of a flag--of some \n     (but not other) particular ``points of view.'' It insists \n     that the interest behind Subsections (b) and (c) of the \n     proposed statute does not involve direct prohibition of \n     expression. And it insists that the interest behind \n     Subsection (a) does not involve prohibition of the \n     expression--through use of a flag to incite violence--of some \n     (but not other) particular ``points of view.'' But it thereby \n     covers up the third kind of governmental interest that \n     triggers that Court's constitutional condemnation, an \n     interest that, in fact, lies behind all three provisions of \n     the proposed statute. That is: an interest in singling out \n     certain determinate ideas or certain determinate messages for \n     governmental protection.\n       This was, as is well known, the main point of the seminal \n     scholarship that gave rise to the Johnson and Eichman \n     decisions. In ``Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles \n     of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment \n     Analysis,'' John Ely (professor and former Dean of the \n     Stanford Law School) wrote that the flag ``represents'' a \n     certain set of messages and that, when government ``singles \n     out'' the flag for any sort of coercive protection, it \n     thereby acts on an impermissible interest in ``singling out'' \n     those messages for protection. ``[A]lthough improper [flag] \n     use statutes do not single out certain messages for \n     proscription,'' he wrote, ``they do single out one set of \n     messages, namely the set of messages conveyed by the American \n     flag, for protection.'' The same, he went on, ``is not true \n     of a law that generally prohibits the interruption of \n     speakers: such a law is neutral not only respecting the \n     content of the interruption but also respecting the content \n     of the message interrupted.'' Protective legislation singling \n     out the flag is definitely not ``content-neutral'' in that \n     very important sense. The distinction, Ely concluded, is \n     ``critical.'' (88 Harvard Law Review at 1505-1507.)\n       In Johnson, the Supreme Court recognized this point. The \n     flag, it stated, is inherently ``[p]regnant with expressive \n     content.'' It expresses a particular message as the ``symbol \n     of our country.'' (491 U.S. At 405.) It is ``a symbol of \n     nationhood and national unity, a symbol with a determinate \n     range of meanings.'' In Johnson and Eichman, the Court noted \n     that government may ``foster'' and ``encourage'' respect for \n     the flag. But the majority of the Justices made clear that \n     they regard use of the criminal law for special government \n     protection of the flag--and the ``determinate'' message it \n     conveys--as something utterly different. (491 U.S. at 418; \n     496 U.S. at 318.)\n       When Senator McConnell introduced the proposed ``Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995'' on the floor of the \n     Senate on October 19, he affirmed that its purpose is not \n     ``content-neutral.'' He affirmed that the interest it is \n     meant to serve is the interest in protecting the particular \n     message the flag represents. He announced that he is \n     ``disgusted by those who desecrate our symbol of freedom.'' \n     Thus--by describing its purpose--the primary sponsor of the \n     proposed statute ensured that, if enacted into law, it would \n     be struck down by the Supreme Court under the foundational \n     principle of the Johnson and Eichman cases.\n       In fact, it would have made no difference if the Senator \n     had not spoken. For the impermissible interest behind the \n     proposed statute is clear on its face. It is entitled as an \n     Act for ``flag protection.'' And--tellingly--it does not \n     probit the ``waving'' of a stolen flag or the incitement of \n     violence through the ``waving'' of a flag. Instead, it would \n     punish only those who ``destroy or damage'' a flag. Its \n     ``content-discrimination--as defined by the majority of the \n     Justices--is thus doubly obvious.\n       (2) The R.A.V. Decision.\n       In 1992, in the R.A.V. decision, the Court further \n     elaborated the requirement of ``content-neutrality'' that \n     would lead it to strike down the proposed statute. The case \n     had to do with a St. Paul ordinance that--like the proposed \n     statute--``singled out'' certain ``fighting words'' for \n     regulation on the basis of their message. Although ``fighting \n     words'' are not protected by the First Amendment, the Court \n     condemned this ``singling out'' of some among them. The Peck \n     Memo strains to obscure the fatal relevance of the decision.\n       First, the Memo suggests that R.A.V. forbids only \n     discrimination among particular ``points of view.'' The \n     proposed flag statute, it claims, applies without regard to \n     the ``points of view'' expressed through specified uses of \n     the flag. Thus the Memo (again) hides the principle that \n     singling out the flag--and so its determinate message--for \n     protection against such uses (indeed, only for protecting \n     against destructive uses) would, itself, be seen by a \n     majority of the Justices as ``content discrimination.'' In \n     the R.A.V. opinion, the Justices explicitly noted, in fact, \n     that the St. Paul ordinance involved both ``viewpoint \n     discrimination'' and ``content discrimination''--and was to \n     be held unconstitutional on both counts. (505 U.S. At 391.)\n       Second, the Memo suggests that singling out the flag would \n     not violate R.A.V., because of the Court's recognition in \n     Johnson and Eichman that the flag may be afforded certain \n     sorts of ``special attention.'' What the Memo neglects to \n     mention is what sorts of ``special attention'' the Court was \n     referring to in those opinions. For the only ``special \n     attention'' it approved there specifically involved \n     ``encouraging'' or ``fostering'' respect for the flag without \n     employing the criminal law. It is the absence of a criminal \n     sanction that, according to the Court, justifies the \n     ``special attention'' it approves. The proposed statute, by \n     contrast, does employ criminal law to protect the flag \n     against destruction. The ordinance that the Court struck down \n     in R.A.V. employed it as well. The argument made in the Memo \n     is, therefore, a misleading fantasy.\n       Third, the Memo cites the R.A.V. opinion's statement that \n     it is permissible to single out the President for special \n     protection against threats of violence ``since the reasons \n     why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment \n     (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the \n     disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that \n     the threatened violence will occur) have special force when \n     applied to the person of the President.'' (505 U.S. at 388.) \n     The Memo then seems to suggest that the ``reasons why'' theft \n     and destruction of stolen property and incitement to imminent \n     violence are outside the First Amendment have ``special \n     force'' when applied to thefts of flags, destruction of \n     stolen flags and incitement of violence through flag \n     destruction. The third suggestion is utterly baseless, and \n     the Memo offers no basis for it. The first two are patently \n     ridiculous. The Court, no doubt, would treat these claims as \n     frivolous.\n       Fourth, the Memo cites the R.A.V. opinion's statement that \n     it is permissible to single out one industry for regulation \n     of price advertising ``because the risk of fraud (one of the \n     characteristics of commercial speech that justifies depriving \n     it of full First Amendment protection . . .) is in its view \n     greater there.'' (Id.) Again, the Memo seems to suggest an \n     analogy. It seems to suggest that the risk of theft and \n     destruction of stolen property is greater when the property \n     involved is a flag and that the risk of violence is greater \n     when a flag is destroyed to incite it than when other means \n     of incitement are employed. And, again, both claims are \n     plainly frivolous.\n       Finally, two other aspects of the R.A.V. opinion deserve \n     mention. (They are not mentioned in the Peck Memo.) In \n     condemning St. Paul's singling out of certain messages, the \n     Court stated, first of all, that there was a ``realistic \n     possibility that official suppression of ideas [was] afoot.'' \n     (505 U.S. at 390.) To support its suspicion, the Court twice \n     cited statements made by officials of the city. (Id. at 394-\n     395.) Were the Court to be presented with the proposed flag \n     protection statute, it would not have to look beyond Senator \n     McConnell's insistence on ``zero tolerance for those who \n     deface the flag'' to support a similar--and similarly \n     devastating-- suspicion.\n       Secondly, the R.A.V. Court emphasized that St. Paul had \n     available a ``neutral'' alternative: It could simply enact a \n     ``general'' ordinance forbidding all ``fighting words,'' \n     whatever their message. By the same token, the Congress has \n     available the ``neutral'' alternative of relying on a \n     ``general'' statute prohibiting all thefts and destruction of \n     all sorts of government property, all thefts and destruction \n     of all sorts of property on government lands, and all sorts \n     of incitement to imminent violence (that may be reached by it \n     under Article I). Of course, such a ``neutral'' alternative \n     would not do what Senator \n\n[[Page S18358]]\n     McConnell wants to do--single out the flag for protection. The majority \n     of the Justices will not, however, allow the Congress to do \n     that now.\n       (3) The Mitchell Decision.\n       Reaching for its last straw, the Peck Memo cites the \n     Mitchell decision. There, the Court upheld a statute under \n     which a ``sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced'' \n     because the batterer ``intentionally selected his victim on \n     account of the victims's race.'' The Memo claims that a \n     ``fair reading'' of Mitchell indicates that the proposed flag \n     statute would not be struck down under R.A.V. Of all the \n     misunderstandings of law in the Memo, this is the wildest. \n     For the basis of Mitchell was not just that battery is not \n     covered by the First Amendment. It was, more importantly, \n     that race-discriminatory motivation--penalized under several \n     civil rights statutes--does not involve expression covered by \n     the First Amendment. The point is that the case, as the Court \n     saw it, simply was not in any way about singling out ideas or \n     messages, whether for prohibition or protection by \n     government. That fully distinguishes Mitchell from any \n     relevance to R.A.V.--or to the proposed flag protection \n     statute.\n       The failure of the misleading claims in the Fein Letter and \n     the Peck Memo serves to reinforce one conclusion: The \n     proposed statute, like its predecessor in 1990, would be \n     quickly struck down by the majority of the Justices. They \n     only way to establish the constitutionality of this statute \n     or of a less oddly narrow one--the only way to single out the \n     flag for protection--is to amend the Constitution, as the \n     farmers of Article V meant us to do.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard D. Parker,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it comes down to this: will the Senate of \nthe United States confuse liberty with license? Will the Senate of the \nUnited States deprive the people of the United States of the right to \ndecide whether they wish to protect their beloved national symbol, Old \nGlory? Forty-nine State legislatures have called for a flag protection \namendment. By a strong, bipartisan 312-120 vote, the other body has \npassed an amendment. So it comes down to each individual Senator, no \ndoubt about it.\n  I will offer an amendment removing the States from the constitutional \namendment. Only Congress will have the power to protect the flag. All \nof the concerns about conflicting or different State laws will not \napply to the amendment that I, Senator Heflin, Senator Feinstein, and \nothers will ask you to support. We are going more than halfway to meet \nthe concerns of critics. I think it is time for opponents of the \namendment to join with us in offering protection of the American flag \nat the Federal level and to send the revised amendment to the other \nbody where I am sure it will be accepted.\n  The words of Justice John Paul Stevens, in his dissent in the Texas \nversus Johnson decision, put it well:\n\n       The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible \n     force in motivating leaders like Patrick Henry, Susan B. \n     Anthony, and Abraham Lincoln, schoolteachers like Nathan Hale \n     and Booker T. Washington, the Philippines Scouts who fought \n     at Bataan, and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at Omaha \n     Beach. If those ideas are worth fighting for--and our history \n     demonstrates that they are--it cannot be true that the flag \n     that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of \n     protection from unnecessary desecration. [491 U.S. at 439].\n\n  Put somewhat differently, is it not ridiculous that the American \npeople are denied the right to protect their unique national symbol in \nthe law? If my colleagues step back from all the legal talk on both \nsides of this issue, I ask, ``Is there not room for a little common \nsense on this issue? Does the law have to be totally divorced from \ncommon sense?''\n  We live in a time when standards have eroded. My colleagues can see \nthis erosion in the movies they, their children, and their \ngrandchildren can watch. I am aware that our colleagues, Senators \nLieberman and Nunn, have expressed concerns about the erosion of \nstandards in some aspects of daytime television. We all know the kind \nof lyrics our children can listen to.\n  Civility and mutual respect--preconditions for the robust expression \nof diverse views in society--are in decline.\n  Individual rights are constantly expanded, but responsibilities are \nshirked and scorned.\n  Absolutes are ridiculed. Values are deemed relative. Nothing is \nsacred. There are no limits. Anything goes.\n  It is ironic that a recent example of this trend involves the \nphysical desecration of the American flag. In Oklahoma this year, a 17-\nyear-old youth stopped at a convenience store and used a full-size \nAmerican flag to clean oil from his car's dipstick. A veteran saw it; \nthe individual was arrested, but, of course, he will not be charged and \nprosecuted. When the veteran told the youngster he should not use the \nflag for that purpose, he replied that he could do whatever he wanted.\n  I realize, of course, that we pride ourselves on our freedom in the \nUnited States. I also understand that the I-can-do-anything-I-want \nattitude has a legitimate appeal, up to a point, to many Americans, \nincluding me. But we all know that freedom has its limits. We all know \nthat there is a difference between liberty and license. I might add \nthat the veteran who witnessed the use of the flag to wipe a car's \ndipstick, upon learning that the individual would not be charged, said, \n``you go into battle behind the American flag. There has got to be a \nway to protect this symbol.''\n  This Oklahoma episode reminds me of the commonsense testimony of R. \nJack Powell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1989:\n\n       The members of Paralyzed Veterans of America, all of whom \n     have incurred catastrophic spinal cord injury or dysfunction, \n     have shared the ultimate experience of citizenship under the \n     flag: serving in defense of our Nation. The flag, for us, \n     embodies that service and that sacrifice as a symbol of all \n     the freedoms we cherish, including the First Amendment right \n     of free speech and expression.\n       Curiously, the Supreme Court in rendering its decision [in \n     Texas v. Johnson] could not clearly ascertain how to \n     determine whether the flag was a `symbol' that was \n     `sufficiently special to warrant . . . unique status.' In our \n     opinion and from our experience, there is no question as to \n     the unique status and singular position the flag holds as the \n     symbol of freedom, our Constitution and our Nation. As such \n     it must be defended and provided special protection under the \n     law.\n       I am concerned that there is some impression, at least in \n     the media and by some others that are around, that the \n     idea of supporting the flag is some idea of just right-\n     wing conservatives, and I have heard some Senators say, \n     those veteran organizations, and that kind of thing.\n       In fact, the flag is the symbol of a constitution that \n     allows Mr. Johnson to express his opinion. So, to destroy \n     that symbol is again a step to destroy the idea that there is \n     one nation on earth that allows their people to express their \n     opinions whether they happen to be socialist opinions or neo-\n     Nazi opinions or republican opinions.\n\n  Mr. Powell then goes on to say something that is so very apt, whether \nit is to the young man who wiped his car's dipstick with the American \nflag, or to the American Civil Liberties Union, or to an intemperate \nAmerican Bar Association whose leader foolishly and wildly questioned \nthe patriotism of flag amendment supporters. Indeed, Mr. Powell's next \nwords say something important to all of us. Here is what else he said:\n\n       Certainly, the idea of society is the banding together of \n     individuals for the mutual protection of each individual. \n     That includes, also, an idea that we have somehow lost in \n     this country, and that is the reciprocal, willing giving up \n     of unlimited individual freedom so that society can be \n     cohesive and can work. It would deem that those who want to \n     talk about freedom ought to recognize the right of a society \n     to say that there is a symbol, one symbol, which in standing \n     for this great freedom for everyone of different opinions, \n     different persuasions, different religions, and different \n     backgrounds, society puts beyond the pale to trample with. \n     [September 13, 1989 at 432-437].\n\n  We seek to teach our children a pride and love of country--a pride \nthat will serve as the basis of good citizenship, and for sacrifice in \nour country's interests, perhaps even the ultimate sacrifice. We hope \nour children will feel connected to the diverse people who are their \nfellow citizens. We ask our schoolchildren--we ask them, we do not \ncompel them--to pledge allegiance to the flag. But five members of the \nSupreme Court dictate that we must tell them that the very same flag is \nunworthy of legal protection when it is treated in the most vile, \ndisrespectful, and contemptuous manner.\n  We also have a very diverse country. We all know the flag is the one \noverriding symbol that unites a diverse people in a way nothing else \ncan, or ever will. We have no king, we threw him out over 200 years \nago. We have no State religion. We have the American flag.\n  I have to take exception when a few of my colleagues ask why we are \ntaking time to consider this amendment. \n\n[[Page S18359]]\nAsk the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Gold Star \nWives of America, and the millions of members in the organizations in \nthe Citizens Flag Alliance why they brought us this proposal and why \nthey asked us to debate it. Mr. President, we are debating legislation \nthese Americans consider a high priority. I hope that opponents of this \nmeasure would not argue that this citizen-initiated effort is unworthy \nof debate in this body.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that we can, in fact, get all of our work \ndone, including this amendment.\n  Now, let us clarify again this point: The flag protection amendment \ndoes not amend the first amendment. It reverses two erroneous decisions \nof the Supreme Court. In listening to some of my colleagues miss this \npoint and talk about how we cannot amend the Bill of Rights or infringe \non free speech, I was struck by how many of them voted for the Biden \nflag protection statute in 1989. They cannot have it both ways. How can \nthey argue that a statute which bans flag burning does not infringe \nfree speech, and turn around and say that an amendment which authorizes \na statute banning flag burning does infringe free speech?\n  Some of my colleagues have said, I regret that the Supreme Court \nruled the way it did. But now that it has, we cannot do anything about \nit. Even though it is difficult to think of flag burning as speech \nrather than conduct, since the Court says so, to override the Court is \nto override this newly minted so-called constitutional right. In my \nview, this concedes too much to the judiciary.\n  The Supreme Court is not infallible. Its Dred Scott decision is just \none example of its fallibility. Let me pose a question to my \ncolleagues.\n  Let us suppose that the year is 1900. A few years earlier, the \nSupreme Court had interpreted a very crucial part of the Constitution, \nthe equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. In its 8-1 Plessy \nversus Ferguson decision, the Court had ruled that separate-but-equal \nis equal. The Constitution only requires separate-but-equal public \ntransportation and public education. We all know that is not what the \nequal protection clause means. Suppose the other body, in 1900, had \nalready voted 312-120 to pass a constitutional amendment which says \nthat no State shall deny equal access to the same public \ntransportation, public education, and other public benefits because of \nrace or color.\n  Would any of my colleagues be arguing, oh, we cannot pass that \namendment, that would be amending the sacred 14th amendment? Would they \nsay, we wish the Court had ruled differently, but, the Court voted 8-1 \nthat separate-but-equal is equal, so that must be what the 14th \namendment means? Of course not. Would they argue that the amendment I \njust mentioned amends the 14th amendment? Or would they admit it just \noverturns a deeply erroneous decision of the Supreme Court \nmisconstruing the equal protection clause? And would my colleagues vote \nagainst an amendment overturning Plessy? I think we all know the answer \nto these questions.\n  We are faced with a similar situation here. The Court had \nmisconstrued the first amendment. The question is this: Is it important \nenough to let the American people, through their Congress, decide if \nthey wish to protect the American flag, by overturning erroneous \nSupreme Court decisions?\n\n  Let me be clear. I said this last week. Patriots can disagree about \nthis amendment. Opponents of this amendment love the flag no less than \nthe amendment's supporters. There are war heroes on both sides of this \nissue, including Members of the Senate. Similarly, supporters of this \namendment are strong believers in the first amendment. It is simply a \nquestion of judgment on this amendment. Is it important enough to give \nthe American people the right to express their traditional values \nregarding the protection of their flag? Or is it more important to \npreserve the right to engage in one particular, narrow mode of \nexpression with respect to this one object, and one object only, our \nflag? That is our choice.\n  As Justice Stevens said in his Johnson dissent, ``sanctioning the \npublic desecration of the flag will tarnish its value * * * That \ntarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free expression \noccasioned by requiring that an available, alternative mode of \nexpression--including uttering words critical of the flag--be \nemployed.'' [491 U.S. at 437.] I urge my colleagues to view the \nconstitutional amendment in the same way.\n  The suggestion by some opponent that restoring Congress' power to \nprotect the American flag from physical desecration tears at the fabric \nof our liberties is so overblown that it is difficult to take \nseriously. Even one of the principal lawyers some opponents rely upon \nto make their case, Bruce Fein, himself a strong opponent of the \namendment, has said, ``The proposed amendment is a submicroscopic \nencroachment on free expression that would still leave the United \nStates galaxies beyond any other nation in history in tolerating free \nspeech and press.''\n  These overblown arguments ring particularly hollow because until \n1989, 48 States and the Federal Government had flag protection laws. \nWas there a tear in the fabric of our liberties? To ask that question \nis to answer it. Of course not.\n  I should add that the American people have a variety of rights under \nthe Constitution. Indeed, if it was not for the right of the people to \namend the Constitution, set out in article 5, we would not even have a \nBill of Rights in the first place. The amendment process is a difficult \none, but it is there. The Framers of the Constitution gave Congress a \nrole in that process. They did not expect us to surrender our judgment \non constitutional issues just because the Supreme Court rules a \nparticular way. The Framers did not expect the Constitution to be \nroutinely amended, and it has not been. But the amendment process is \nthere as a check on the Supreme Court in an important enough cause. \nThis is one of those causes.\n  I know we will debate a few amendments today. I know my friend from \nKentucky will offer a statute as a complete substitute for the flag \nprotection amendment. The McConnell amendment is a killer amendment. It \nwill completely displace the flag protection amendment. A vote for the \nMcConnell amendment is a vote to kill the flag protection amendment. \nSenators cannot vote for both the McConnell amendment and the flag \nprotection amendment.\n  I know my friend from Kentucky reveres the flag. I know he would like \nto do something to protect it in law. But I say with great respect, his \namendment is a snare and a delusion. We have been down this statutory \nroad before and it is an absolute dead end.\n  The Supreme Court has told us twice that a statute singling out the \nflag for special protection is based on the communicative value of the \nflag and, therefore, in its misguided view, violates the first \namendment. Even if one can punish a flag desecrator under a general \nbreach of the peace statute, the McConnell amendment is not a general, \nFederal breach of the peace statute. It singles out flag desecration \ninvolved in a breach of the peace. Johnson and Eichman have told us we \ncannot do that, we cannot single the flag out in that way. The same \ngoes for protecting only one item of stolen Federal property, a Federal \nGovernment-owned flag, in a special way, or protecting a stolen flag \ndesecration on Federal property in a special way. We all know why we \nwould pass such a statute. Do any of my colleagues really believe we \nare going to fool the Supreme Court? Many of my colleagues, in good \nfaith, voted for the Biden statute and the Court would not buy it. They \ntook less than 30 days after oral argument and less than eight pages \nand threw the statute out. They will do the same to the McConnell \nstatute. The American people know better and they want to see us take \naction that can really protect the flag.\n  Even if the McConnell statute is constitutional--and it is not, with \nall respect--it is totally inadequate. Far from every flag desecration \nis intended to create a breach of the peace or occurs in a \ncircumstances in which it constitutes fighting words. And, of course, \nmany desecrated flags are neither stolen from the Federal Government \nnor stolen from someone else and desecrated on Federal property. \nIndeed, most of the desecrations that have occurred in recent years do \nnot fit within the McConnell statute.\n\n[[Page S18360]]\n\n  Just as an illustration of its inadequacy, if the McConnell statute \nhad been on the books in 1989, the Johnson case would have come out \nexactly the same way. Why? The Supreme Court said that the facts in \nJohnson do not support Johnson's arrest under either the breach of the \npeace doctrine or the fighting words doctrine. Morever, the flag was \nnot stolen from the Federal Government. Finally, the flag was not \ndesecrated on Federal property. So the McConnell statute, which my \nfriend from Kentucky will offer to replace completely the flag \nprotection amendment, would not have reached Johnson.\n  What, then, is the utility of the McConnell statute, as a practical \nmatter, other than to kill the flag protection amendment?\n  I urge my colleagues to support the substitute flag protection \namendment that we will offer and to reject the other amendments to be \noffered today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18349-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18360-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18360-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18360-S18362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON BOSNIAN SERB SANCTIONS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED \n              DURING THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE--PM 101\n\n  Under the authority for the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on December 8, 1995, received a message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On May 30, 1992, in Executive Order No. 12808, the President declared \na national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States arising from actions \nand policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, acting under \nthe name of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, in their involvement in and support for groups \nattempting to seize territory in Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina by force and violence utilizing, in part, the forces of the \nso-called Yugoslav National Army (57 FR 23299, June 2, 1992). I \nexpanded the national emergency in Executive Order No. 12934 of October \n25, 1994, to address the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb \nforces and the authorities in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina that they control.\n  The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and \n1703(c) and covers the period from May 30, 1995, to November 29, 1995. \nIt discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related to \nthe exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of \na national emergency in Executive Order No. 12808 and Executive Order \nNo. 12934 and to expanded sanctions against the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY (S)'') and the Bosnian \nSerbs contained in Executive Order No. 12810 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR \n24347, June 9, 1992), Executive Order No. 12831 of January 15, 1993 (58 \nFR 5253, January 21, 1993), Executive Order No. 12846 of April 25, 1993 \n(58 FR 25771, April 27, 1993), and Executive Order No. 12934 of October \n25, 1994 (59 FR 54117, October 27, 1994).\n  1. Executive Order No. 12808 blocked all property and interests in \nproperty of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, or held in the \nname of the former Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia or the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \nthen or thereafter located in the United States or within the \npossession or control of United States persons, including their \noverseas branches.\n  Subsequently, Executive Order No. 12810 expanded U.S. actions to \nimplement in the United States the United Nations sanctions against the \nFRY (S) adopted in United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution \n757 of May 30, 1992. In addition to reaffirming the blocking of FRY \n(S) Government property, this order prohibited transactions with \nrespect to the FRY (S) involving imports, exports, dealing in FRY \n(S)-origin property, air and sea transportation, contract \nperformance, funds transfers, activity promoting importation or \nexportation or dealings in property, and official sports, scientific, \ntechnical, or other cultural representation of, or sponsorship by, the \nFRY (S) in the United States.\n  Executive Order No. 12810 exempted from trade restrictions (1) \ntransshipments through the FRY (S), and (2) activities related to the \nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Conference on \nYugoslavia, or the European Community Monitor Mission.\n  On January 15, 1993, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12831 \nto implement new sanctions contained in UNSC Resolution 787 of November \n16, 1992. The order revoked the exemption for transshipments through \nthe FRY (S) contained in Executive Order No. 12810, prohibited \ntransactions within the United States or by a United States person \nrelating to FRY (S) vessels and vessels in which a majority or \ncontrolling interest is held by a person or entity in, or operating \nfrom, the FRY (S), and stated that all such vessels shall be \nconsidered as vessels of the FRY (S), regardless of the flag under \nwhich they sail.\n  On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12846 to implement in \nthe United States the sanctions adopted in UNSC Resolution 820 of April \n17, 1993. That resolution called on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the \nVance-Owen peace plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, \nif they failed to do so by April 26, 1993, called on member states to \ntake additional measures to tighten the embargo against the FRY (S) \nand Serbian-controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia. Effective April 26, \n1993, the order blocked all property and interests in property of \ncommercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or entities \norganized or located in the FRY (S), including property and interests \nin property of entities (wherever organized or located) owned or \ncontrolled by such undertakings or entities, that are or thereafter \ncome within the possession or control of United States persons.\n\n  On October 25, 1994, in view of UNSC Resolution 942 of September 23, \n1994, I issued Executive Order No. 12934 in order to take additional \nsteps with respect to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia (59 FR 54117, \nOctober 27, 1994). Executive Order No. 12934 expands the scope of the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12808 to address the \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and \npolicies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that they control, \nincluding their refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement \nof the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The Executive order blocks all property and interests in property \nthat are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United \nStates, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control \nof United States persons (including their overseas branches) of: (1) \nthe Bosnian Serb military and paramilitary forces and the authorities \nin areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of \nthose forces; (2) any entity, including any commercial, industrial, or \npublic utility undertaking, organized or located in those areas of the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb \nforces; (3) any entity, wherever organized or located, which is owned \nor controlled directly or indirectly by any person in, or resident in, \nthose areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control \nof Bosnian Serb forces; and (4) any person acting for or on behalf of \n\n[[Page S18361]]\nany person within the scope of the above definitions.\n  The Executive order also prohibits the provision or exportation of \nservices to those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under \nthe control of Bosnian Serb forces, or to any person for the purpose of \nany business carried on in those areas, either from the United States \nor by a United States person. The order also prohibits the entry of any \nU.S.-flagged vessel, other than a U.S. naval vessel, into the riverine \nports of those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under \nthe control of Bosnian Serb forces. Finally, any transaction by any \nUnited States person that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of \nevading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set \nforth in the order is prohibited. Executive order No. 12934 became \neffective at 11:59 p.m., e.d.t., on October 25, 1994.\n  2. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was \nmade pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, including the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of \nthe United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the \nCongress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the \nexpansion of that national emergency under the same authorities was \nreproted to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions \nset forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the \nauthority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the \nFederal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United \nNations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c).\n  3. Effective June 30, 1995, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro) Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 585 (the \n``Regulations''), were amended to implement Executive Order No. 12934 \n(60 FR 34144, June 30, 1995). The name of the Regulations was changed \nto reflect the expansion of the national emergency to the Bosnian \nSerbs, and now reads ``Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia & \nMontenegro) and Bosnian Serb-Controlled Areas of the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina Sanctions Regulations.'' A copy of the amended \nRegulations is attached.\n  Treasury's blocking authority as applied to FRY (S) subsidiaries \nand vessels in the United States has been challenged in court. In \nMilena Ship Management Company, Ltd. v. Newcomb, 804 F.Supp. 846, 855, \nand 859 (E.D.L.A. 1992) aff'd, 995 F.2d 620 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. \ndenied, 114 S.Ct. 877 (1994), involving five ships owned or controlled \nby FRY (S) entities blocked in various U.S. ports, the blocking \nauthority as applied to these vessels was upheld. In IPT Company, Inc. \nv. United States Department of the Treasury, No. 92 CIV 5542 (S.D.N.Y. \n1994), the district court also upheld the blocking authority as applied \nto the property of a Yugoslav subsidiary located in the United States, \nand the case was subsequently settled.\n  4. Over the past 6 months, the Departments of State and Treasury have \nworked closely with European Union (the ``EU'') member states and other \nU.N. member nations to coordinate implementation of the U.N. sanctions \nagainst the FRY (S). This has included continued deployment of \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sanctions \nassistance missions (SAMs) to Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the \nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine to \nassist in monitoring land and Danube River traffic; support for the \nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) monitoring \nmissions along the Serbia-Montenegro-Bosnia border; bilateral contacts \nbetween the United States and other countries for the purpose of \ntightening financial and trade restrictions on the FRY (S); and \nongoing multilateral meetings by financial sanctions enforcement \nauthorities from various countries to coordinate enforcement efforts \nand to exchange technical information.\n\n  5. In accordance with licensing policy and the Regulations, the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) has exercised its authority to \nlicense certain specific transactions with respect to the FRY (S), \nwhich are consistent with U.S. foreign policy and the Security Council \nsanctions. During the reporting period, FAC has issued 90 specific \nlicenses regarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S) or assets \nto owns or controls, bringing the total specific licenses issued as of \nOctober 13, 1995, to 1,020. Specific licenses have been issued: (1) for \npayment to U.S. or third country secured creditors, under certain \nnarrowly defined circumstances, for preembargo import and export \ntransactions; (2) for legal representation or advice to the Government \nof the FRY (S) or FRY (S)-located or controlled entities; (3) for \nthe liquidation or protection of tangible assets of subsidiaries of FRY \n(S)-located or controlled firms located in the United States; (4) for \nlimited transactions related to FRY (S) diplomatic representation in \nWashington and New York; (5) for patent, trademark, and copyright \nprotection in the FRY (S) not involving payment to the FRY (S) \nGovernment; (6) for certain communications, news media, and travel-\nrelated transactions; (7) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel \nmaintenance, and emergency supplies for FRY (S)-controlled ships \nblocked in the United States; (8) for the removal from the FRY (S), \nor protection within the FRY (S), of certain property owned and \ncontrolled by U.S. entities; (9) to assist the United Nations in its \nrelief operations and the activities of the UNPROFOR; and (10) for \npayment from funds outside the United States where a third country has \nlicensed the transaction in accordance with U.N. sanctions. Pursuant to \nU.S. regulations implementing UNSC Resolutions, specific licenses have \nalso been issued to authorize exportation of food, medicine, and \nsupplies intended for humanitarian purposes in the FRY (S).\n  During the period, FAC addressed the status of the unallocated debt \nof the former Yugoslavia by authorizing nonblocked U.S. creditors under \nthe New Financing Agreement for Yugoslavia (Blocked Debt) to exchange a \nportion of the Blocked Debt for new debt (bonds) issued by the Republic \nof Slovenia. The completion of this exchange will mark the transfer to \nSlovenia of sole liability for a portion of the face value of the $4.2 \nbillion unallocated debt of the FRY (S) for which Slovenia, prior to \nthe authorized exchange, was jointly and severally liable. The exchange \nwill relieve Slovenia of the joint and several liability for the \nremaining unallocated FRY (S) debt and pave the way for its entry \ninto international capital markets.\n  During the past 6 months, FAC has continued to oversee the \nliquidation of tangible assets of the 15 U.S. subsidiaries of entities \norganized in the FRY (S). Subsequent to the issuance of Executive \nOrder No. 12846, all operating licenses issued for these U.S.-located \nSerbian or Montenegrin subsidiaries or joint ventures were revoked, and \nthe net proceeds of the liquidation of their assets placed in blocked \naccounts.\n  In order to reduce the drain on blocked assets caused by continuing \nto rent commercial space, FAC arranged to have the blocked personality, \nfiles, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions in New York \nmoved to secure storage. The personality is being liquidated, with the \nnew proceeds placed in blocked accounts.\n  Following the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic in January 1995, \nfive Yugoslav-owned vessels remain blocked in the United States. \nApproval of the UNSC's Serbian Sanctions Committee was sought and \nobtained for the sale of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic (and the M/V Bor, \nwhich was sold in June 1994).\n  With the FAC-licensed sales of the M/V Kapetan Martinovic and the M/V \nBor, those vessels were removed from the list of blocked FRY (S) \nentities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC. As of October 12, \n1995, five additional vessels have been removed from the list of \nblocked FRY (S) entities and merchant vessels maintained by FAC as a \nresult of sales conditions that effectively extinguished any FRY (S) \ninterest: the M/V Blue Star, M/V Budva, M/V Bulk Star, M/V Hanuman, and \nM/V Sumadija. The new owners of several other formerly Yugoslav-owned \nvessels, which have been sold in other countries, have petitioned \n\n[[Page S18362]]\nFAC to remove those vessels from the list.\n  During the past 6 months, U.S. financial institutions have continued \nto block funds transfers in which there is a possible interest of the \nGovernment of the FRY (S) or an entity or undertaking located in or \ncontrolled from the FRY (S), and to stop prohibited transfers to \npersons in the FRY (S). The value of transfers blocked has amounted \nto $137.5 million since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12808, \nincluding some $13.9 million during the past 6 months.\n  To ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses that have been \nissued under the program, stringent reporting requirements are imposed. \nMore than 318 submissions have been reviewed by FAC since the last \nreport, and more than 130 compliance cases are currently open.\n  6. Since the issuance of Executive Order No. 12810, FAC has worked \nclosely with the U.S. Customs Service to ensure both that prohibited \nimports and exports (including those in which the Government of the FRY \n(S) or Bosnian Serb authorities have an interest) are identified and \ninterdicted, and that permitted imports and exports move to their \nintended destination without undue delay. Violations and suspected \nviolations of the embargo are being investigated and appropriate \nenforcement actions are being taken. Numerous investigations carried \nover from the prior reporting period are continuing. Since the last \nreport, FAC has collected 10 civil penalties totaling more than \n$27,000. Of these, five were paid by U.S. financial institutions for \nviolative funds transfers involving the Government of the FRY (S), \npersons in the FRY (S), or entities located or organized in or \ncontrolled from the FRY (S). One U.S. company and one air carrier \nhave also paid penalties related to unlicensed payments to the \nGovernment of the FRY (S) or other violations of the Regulations. Two \ncompanies and one law firm have also remitted penalties for their \nfailure to follow the conditions of FAC licenses.\n\n  7. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from May 30, 1995, through November 29, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nthe FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated \nat about $3.5 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in FAC and its Chief Counsel's \nOffice, and the U.S. Customs Service), the Department of State, the \nNational Security Council, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of \nCommerce.\n  8. The actions and polices of the Government of the FRY (S), in its \ninvolvement in and support for groups attempting to seize and hold \nterritory in the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina by \nforce and violence, and the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb \nforces and the authorities in the areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina under \ntheir control, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates. The United States remains committed to a multilateral \nresolution of the conflict through implementation of the United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions.\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply \neconomic sanctions against the FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serb forces, \ncivil authorities, and entities, as long as these measures are \nappropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill for the relief of certain former employees of the \nUnited States whose firefighting functions were transferred from the \nDepartment of Energy to Los Alamos County, NM; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n                  LOS ALAMOS FIREFIGHTERS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will enable \nthe Federal Government to fulfill an outstanding obligation to a small, \ndedicated group that has committed years of service in the national \ninterest.\n  In 1989, firefighting responsibilities in Los Alamos, NM, were \ntransferred from the Department of Energy to Los Alamos County. The \ntransfer was part of a larger, continuing effort to divest the Federal \nGovernment of functions normally performed by State and local \ngovernment that the Federal Government has performed in Los Alamos \nsince the Manhattan Engineering District assumed control of all \nactivities at Los Alamos during World War II.\n  The transfer affected 43 firefighters who, after years of Federal \nservice that for many of them began in Viet Nam, became Los Alamos \nCounty employees. At the time, the firefighters were told by the \nDepartment of Energy that they would be transferred ``as whole,'' \nmeaning they would lose no benefits. Unfortunately, that did not happen \nlargely due to changes in administration at the Department of Energy \nand Los Alamos County.\n  Each firefighter received a severance payment, in accordance with \nnormal practice, that included reimbursement for moneys each had \ncontributed to the Federal retirement system. However, that payment was \nsignificantly less than the amount required to purchase service time in \nthe retirement program available to Los Alamos County employees \nequivalent to their time of Federal service.\n  The result is straightforward; these firefighters, who continue to \nperform exactly the same work today as when they were Department of \nEnergy employees, have lost the majority of their retirement because \nthe Federal Government has failed to meet its obligation to transfer \nthem ``as whole.'' These are dedicated workers who continue to provide \nvital firefighting service to Los Alamos County and the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory. They should be treated fairly.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would remedy this unfairness. \nIt would direct the Federal Government pay to the firefighters current \nState retirement program a sum that when combined with the severance \npayment made to the firefighters upon their transfer would provide the \nfirefighters with a service credit in the State program equivalent to \ntheir Federal time of service. The result would be that the \nfirefighters retirement would not be impacted by the change from \nFederal to county status.\n  Mr. President, there is some urgency to this matter. A number of \nthese firefighters are approaching retirement age. Without the benefits \nof this legislation, they will be entitle to almost no retirement \nbenefits when they reach the mandatory retirement age for firefighters.\n  I hope my colleagues will give prompt and considered attention to \nthis matter.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, in introducing legislation today that will fairly compensate \na group of dedicated former Federal employees for the loss of \nretirement benefits that they experienced as a result of the transfer \nof their duties from the Department of Energy to the County of Los \nAlamos, NM.\n  Mr. President, in 1989, the responsibility for the Los Alamos Fire \nDepartment, which jointly serves the Los Alamos National Laboratories \nand Los Alamos County municipality, was transferred from the Department \nof Energy to the county. As a result of the transfer, some of these \nfirefighters lost more than $20,000 in retirement funds that they had \naccrued with the Federal Government. And, as a result of the transfer, \nthese individuals, who have served an average of 15 years with the \nDepartment of Energy, no longer have retirement benefits. Clearly, this \nis a situation that must be remedied as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, with the support of Senator Domenici I am sure that we \nwill finally be able to provide these firefighters with the \ncompensation for lost retirement benefits they have incurred as a \nresult of the transfer of their responsibilities from the Federal \nGovernment to the State of New Mexico and I look forward to working for \nthe prompt consideration and passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1467. A bill to authorize the construction of the Fort Peck Rural \nCounty Water Supply System, to authorize assistance to the Fort Peck \nRural County Water District, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the \nplanning, design, and construction of the water supply system, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the fort peck rural county water supply system act of 1995\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in July; I introduced S. 1154, a \nbill to authorize construction of the Fort Peck Rural County Water \nSupply System in Valley County, MT. Since the introduction of this \nbill, my staff has been meeting with the Senate Energy Committee staff \nconcerning the bill and its provisions. In addition, I have had \ndiscussions with the other members of the Montana congressional \ndelegation about this urgent situation under which hundreds of people \nmust haul their water supplies for miles because of the contamination \nof the ground water. Based on all of these discussions, the legislation \nhas been redrafted for reintroduction today to reflect the comments of \nthe Energy Committee staff. I want to thank Chairman Murkowski and his \nstaff for their help in streamlining this bill. I am pleased to be \njoined in the sponsorship of this bill by my colleague, Senator Baucus. \nI appreciated his assistance with this measure. An identical bill will \nalso be introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative \nPat Williams. The Montana delegation is unified in our efforts to \nobtain congressional authorization for this rural water system to help \nthis depressed area of our State. We look forward to working with \nSenator Murkowski to move this bill to hearings and a markup.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S18364]]\n\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon request of the District, the \n     Secretary shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the \n     District for the planning, design, and construction by the \n     District of the water supply system.\n       (b) Service Area.--The water supply system shall provide \n     for safe and adequate rural water supplies under the \n     jurisdiction of the District in Valley County, northeastern \n     Montana (as described in the feasibility study).\n       (c) Amount of Federal Contribution.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (3), under the \n     cooperative agreement, the Secretary shall pay the Federal \n     share of--\n       (A) costs associated with the planning, design, and \n     construction of the water supply system (as identified in the \n     feasibility study); and\n       (B) such sums as are necessary to defray increases in the \n     budget.\n       (2) Federal share.--The Federal share referred to in \n     paragraph (a) shall be 80 percent and shall not be \n     reimbursable.\n       (3) Total.--The amount of Federal funds made available \n     under the cooperative agreement shall not exceed the amount \n     of funds authorized to be appropriated under section 4.\n       (4) Limitations.--Not more than 5 percent of the amount of \n     Federal funds made available to the Secretary under section 4 \n     may be used by the Secretary for activities associated with--\n       (A) compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and\n       (B) oversight of the planning, design, and construction by \n     the District of the water supply system.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The funds \n     authorized to be appropriated may be increased or decreased \n     by such amounts as are justified by reason of ordinary \n     fluctuations in development costs incurred after October 1, \n     1994, as indicated by engineering cost indices applicable to \n     the type of construction project authorized under this Act. \n     \n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator \nBurns in introducing legislation to ensure that the over 500 people who \nlive near Fort Peck Reservoir have a safe, dependable domestic water \nsupply. Currently those who live adjacent to one of the largest bodies \nof water ever developed by the Federal Government in the West, the Fort \nPeck Reservoir, are forced to travel many miles several times a week to \nfill tanks and barrels for their domestic water use.\n  This bill will authorize the development of a rural municipal water \nsystem for the residents of the Fort Peck Rural Water District in \nnortheastern Montana. The project will tap into Fort Peck Reservoir to \nconstruct a safe and reliable drinking system for both municipal and \nagricultural purposes. It will also enable this scenic area of Montana \nto attract economic development which has been stifled due to the lack \nof water.\n  I propose that this project be a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment, the State of Montana, and local interests. The State and \nlocal groups will contribute 20 percent of the cost of the project's \ncompletion. A needs assessment and feasibility study conducted by the \nBureau of Reclamation [BOR] has completed a needs assessment and \nfeasibility study that estimates the total Federal expenditure will be \nless than $6 million.\n  If we can afford to spend millions of dollars developing domestic \nwater supplies in other nations around the world, we can and should be \nable to do the same for Montanans.\n  I urge the committee to take prompt action on this critical measure \nand will work toward expeditious passage through the full \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18363-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 413\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr. Levin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 413, a bill to amend the \nFair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage rate \nunder such Act, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the names of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] and the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 704, a bill to establish the Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the names of the Senator from \nMississippi [Mr. Cochran] and the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings] were added as cosponsors of S. 1028, a bill to provide \nincreased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1200\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1200, a bill to establish and \nimplement efforts to eliminate restrictions on the enclaved people of \nCyprus.\n\n\n                                S. 1224\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Mr. Cohen] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1224, a bill to amend \nsubchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, relating to \nalternative means of dispute resolution in the administrative process, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the names of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] and the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1228, a bill to impose sanctions on foreign \npersons exporting petroleum products, natural gas, or related \ntechnology to Iran.\n\n\n                                S. 1296\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Exon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1296, a bill to amend the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to clarify the \ntreatment of a qualified football coaches plan.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 11\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 11, a concurrent resolution supporting a resolution to the \nlong-standing dispute regarding Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18364-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18364-S18365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n           THE AMERICAN FLAG CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        BIDEN AMENDMENT NO. 3093\n\n  Mr. BIDEN proposed an amendment to the joint resolution (S.J.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world.\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and in circumstances where the person \n     knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000 \n     or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(b) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States and intentionally destroys or damages \n     that flag shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned \n     not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years, \n     or both.\n       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.\n       ``(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `flag \n     of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or \n     any part thereof, made of any substance, in any size, in a \n     form that is commonly displayed as a flag and would be taken \n     to be a flag by the reasonable observer.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     33 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     the item relating to section 700 and inserting the following \n     new item:\n\n``700.

Mr. President, yesterday was International Human \nRights Day, a day to mark how far the world has come toward respect for \nhuman rights, and also a day to reflect on how far we have to go.\n  In October, President Mary Robinson of Ireland gave an address at \nYale Law School in which she discussed the often inadequate response to \nextreme human rights crises around the world. She spoke of the \nuniversal acceptance of the key principles of the international human \nrights movement and the value of activities by the United Nations and \nregional organizations which set human rights standards. Having \nrecently returned from Rwanda and Zaire, she poignantly described the \ngross human rights violations there and the failure of the world to \nmake an adequate response. At the end of her address, she notes that \nthese basic principles of human rights are also at stake in Bosnia.\n  When President Clinton visited Ireland 10 days ago, he invited \nPresident Robinson to the United States for a state visit in June 1996. \nI look forward to her visit, and I ask that her address at Yale be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The address follows:\n\n        The Need to Honour Development Human Rights Commitments\n\n\n                   SPEECH by PRESIDENT MARY ROBINSON\n\n       It is an enormous pleasure to be here this evening. I \n     recall when I was studying law at a place just outside Boston \n     in the late '60s, this institution was referred to as ``that \n     other place in New Haven''. The compliment implied in not \n     naming that other place naturally whetted my interest, but \n     this is the first opportunity I have had to visit. I am \n     greatly honoured to be here as the 1995 Sherril lecturer.\n       The title of my address this evening--the need to honour \n     developing human rights commitments--has been carefully \n     chosen to provide me with an opportunity to comment on the \n     state of our commitment at the end of the century.\n       I use the term ``honour'' as opposed to ``compliance'' or \n     ``conformity'' because the lives and integrity of human \n     beings are at stake and because it calls on our notions of \n     dignity and moral obligation. The word ``commitment'' has \n     been chosen because it goes further than both legal or moral \n     obligation--while eccompassing both. It also connotes the \n     idea of being ``committed'' to a great cause at a higher \n     level of obligation, as well as a preparedness to take steps \n     to promote and further that cause, without interrogating the \n     legal necessity or obligation to do so. In the area of human \n     rights one can find no greater elucidation of the meaning of \n     ``commitment'' than in the Preamble to the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights. Lastly, I am conscious that our \n     human rights commitments are dynamic and not static. They are \n     constantly evolving and developing. At the end of this \n     millennium the honouring of developing human rights \n     commitments, to the best of our abilities and resources, is a \n     first order principle of national and international life.\n       Yet we are all aware that major problems persist. Torture, \n     inhuman prison conditions, unfair trials, and famine have not \n     been eradicated although we take a certain pride in the \n     institutions and procedures that we have set up to deal with \n     them. Ethnic cleansing and the daily spectacle of civilian \n     casualties in Sarajevo remind us that the evils of the past \n     cast a long shadow. In a real sense the World Conference on \n     Womens' Rights in Beijing was all about the failure to honour \n     our commitments to women, particularly in the areas of \n     protection against violence and sexual abuse.\n       We do not have cause for satisfaction. The essential theme \n     of my remarks, having returned a few days ago from Rwanda, is \n     that we should reflect even more on our political commitment \n     to invest our human rights mission with the resources that \n     match the strength of our beliefs, and that our failure to do \n     so--when confronted with situations such as that in Rwanda \n     which cry out for a more committed, more integrated and more \n     resourced response--compromises our achievements, blunts our \n     sensitivities to situations where gross violations are taking \n     place and diminishes our capacity to transmit these values \n     meaningfully to succeeding generations. In other words, \n     acquiescence to a low level of response is an affront to the \n     principle of the universality of human rights.\n       As you will have gathered, I have chosen this title with \n     great anxiety--the anxiety, firstly, of a lawyer confronted \n     by the contradictions between promise and performance. The \n     anxiety, secondly, of a Head of State returning from a visit \n     to Rwanda and Zaire, who has been exposed in the literal \n     sense of that term, and for the second time, to the terrible \n     humanitarian aftermath of genocide and its accompanying \n     social, political and economic disintegration. A witness also \n     to the continued inability of the international community to \n     rouse itself sufficiently to bring greater hope and promise \n     to that land of despair and tragedy. The anxiety, lastly, of \n     a witness left speechless and fumbling for the correct and \n     appropriate response in the face of our own inadequacies as a \n     community of human beings when faced, eyeball to eyeball, \n     with human disaster on such an overwhelming scale.\n       The contradiction, witnessed painfully in Rwanda, between, \n     our lofty human rights values on the one hand, and the \n     pressure of reality on the other, provokes a natural and \n     human response. I hear the words ``Never again''--the call \n     that became the `leitmotif' for the development of human \n     rights this century--and am deeply dismayed and angered at \n     the human capacity for self-delusion.\n       But this despair should not lead us to be distracted from \n     the real advances that have been made, at both the regional \n     and the universal level, in the protection and promotion of \n     human rights and in the central position that the concept of \n     human rights now occupies in the world stage.\n       In a very short space of time three key ideas which \n     underpin the entire international human rights movement have \n     come to be accepted universally. They are all connected to \n     what can be called the principle of universality.\n       First, that countries can no longer say that how they treat \n     their inhabitants is solely their own business. The concept \n     of human rights has torn down (though not completely \n     destroyed) the sometimes oppressive veil of domestic \n     jurisdiction. The role of the media in showing us the \n     dramatic pictures of civilians being cut down in Sarajevo, of \n     the famine in Somalia or of the genocide in Rwanda, has \n     contributed immeasurably to strengthening this development. \n     The global village has highlighted our global \n     responsibilities.\n       Second, that the effective protection of human rights is \n     indissociably linked to international peace and security. \n     Internal disorder, civil war, heightened regional \n     and international tension can in our recent history, be \n     causally related to violations of human or minority \n     rights. Respect for human rights is thus essential for \n     genuine peace.\n       Third, that human rights are universal and indivisible. The \n     principle of universality of human rights was asserted by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is the central \n     pillar on which all else rests and has come under increasing \n     attack over the last decade under the guise of ``regional \n     particularities''. To the great credit of the World \n     Conference on Human Rights, the principle that the protection \n     of human rights is a duty for all states, irrespective of \n     their political, economical or cultural system, was \n     emphatically re-affirmed. Let me quote from Paragraph 3 of \n     the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by \n     consensus by the member states of the United Nations:\n       ``All human rights are universal, indivisible and \n     interdependent and inter-related. The international community \n     must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, \n     on the same footing and with the same emphasis.''\n       Side by side with the development of what I have called the \n     principle of universality stand the vital standard-setting \n     activities of the United Nations and regional bodies such as \n     the Council of Europe, the Organisation of American States \n     and the Organisation of African Unity. The catalogue of human \n     rights and freedoms set out inter alia in the United Nations \n     Covenants, the European Convention on Human Rights, the \n     American Convention on Human Rights, the African Charter of \n     Human and People's Rights and other major human rights \n     treaties form the central core of a corpus of universal human \n     rights standards encompassing both civil and political as \n     well as social, economic and cultural rights.\n       There are several remarkable features about standard-\n     setting activities which merit being highlighted in an era \n     where the emphasis--quite properly--is on enforcement and \n     effectiveness.\n       The first is that the relevant treaty standards not only \n     define the States' international obligations to its \n     inhabitants and to the international community at large but \n     also directly impact on the content and quality of national \n     law. In many countries these standards have the force of law \n     and can be enforced directly through local courts. Indeed, \n     some of the most important principles, for example the \n     prohibition against torture and slavery, have become part of \n     the customary law of nations. International norms have also \n     become an essential vade-mecum for NGO's, providing them with \n     a focused set of standards to guide them in their work and \n     judgment. In these different ways, the specificity of \n     international human rights law can exercise a vitally \n     important influence on national arrangements and can lead to \n     an improvement in people's lives. I believe that the role \n     human rights law has played, and continues to play, in \n     shaping the legislative agendas of the new democracies in \n     eastern and central Europe, not to mention the new South \n     Africa, cannot be underestimated. The authoritative \n     interpretation of these standards by the European and \n     American Courts of Human Rights and by other treaty bodies, \n     adds a further important dimension to the effectiveness of \n     this process.\n     \n[[Page S18367]]\n\n       My second observation is central to the theme of developing \n     human rights commitments. Standard-setting, regionally and \n     universally, is a continuous on-going process. The UN Torture \n     Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are \n     examples of the developing nature of the law. But regard must \n     also be had to the numerous and increasingly influential non-\n     treaty standards embodied in instruments such as the Standard \n     Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Body of \n     Principles for the Protection of All Persons under any form \n     of Detention or Imprisonment or the Declaration on the \n     Elimination of Violence against Women.\n       However it seems clear that it is in responding to the most \n     severe and pressing human rights problems that much progress \n     needs to be made. Can there be any doubt that the credibility \n     of the international community's attachment to the cause of \n     human rights is intimately bound up with its ability to \n     respond effectively to situations where human rights are \n     being grossly violated? The Secretary-General of the United \n     Nations recognized this in his 1992 report on the work of the \n     UN when he observed that while the UN was responding \n     adequately to ``normal situations'' it had not been able to \n     act effectively in the area of massive human rights \n     violations.\n       We seem to have created for ourselves the following \n     paradox. The human rights developments that have taken place \n     since the end of the Second World War have led to the \n     creation of international courts of human rights to enforce \n     state obligations, to important standard-setting activities \n     by the UN and regional organisations, to the creation of \n     teams of special rapporteurs to examine disappearances, \n     torture, political executions or situations in particular \n     countries. We have recently created a High Commissioner for \n     Human Rights to be the focal point for human rights action in \n     the UN system. All these positive advancements are in a \n     sense, directly related to the political commitments made \n     following upon gross violations of human rights earlier this \n     century.\n       Yet the institutions we have created appear to be stricken \n     with inertia and paralysis when confronted with the \n     reoccurrence of the very evils that have led to their \n     foundation. Of course, we cannot stop wars and we may be \n     unable to foresee or forestall outbreaks of violence on a \n     massive scale. And there will always be countries in the \n     world where human rights are trampled underfoot. But doesn't \n     honouring the commitment require us to respond to this \n     unacceptable paradox and to the deep international concern \n     about gross violations? Does it not require us to assume \n     collective responsibility and to develop institutions and \n     processes to anticipate, deter, prevent and terminate gross \n     human rights violations?\n       It is in our response to these questions that future \n     generations will determine whether our great treaties were \n     merely splendid baubles, worthless pieces of paper or genuine \n     commitments that we sought valiantly to honour.\n       Central to this concern is the possibility of taking \n     preventive action through the effective operation of early-\n     warning devices. But alarm bells must be listened to. In the \n     case of Rwanda they were loudly rung by the NGO community and \n     by the Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial, Summary or \n     Arbitrary Executions in his reports prior to the Rwanda \n     genocide in April 1994.\n       It is difficult to speak of the situation in Rwanda today \n     with restraint and without anger--the more so against a \n     background of what happened there and how the world \n     responded. Could the international community not have done \n     more? Could we not do more today? Has the United Nations \n     honoured its human rights vocation? Has the international \n     community, behind the persona of the United Nations, honoured \n     its human rights commitments?\n       I ask these questions because my own sense of justice has \n     been outraged by what I have witnessed there in a manner \n     which defies my powers of articulation and explanation. The \n     facts plead for themselves.\n       A year ago I visited this small country in the aftermath of \n     the genocide of up to a million people and the breakdown of \n     civil society. The structures of government had been \n     destroyed by the killings and the massive exodus which \n     followed. In the capital, Kigali, I saw appalling evidence of \n     that genocide. In many churches thousands who had fled for \n     sanctuary were slaughtered.\n       Returning a year later I noted courageous progress by the \n     Rwandan Government in rebuilding their society, and \n     appreciated the access they gave me to the places I felt I \n     must see. On this visit I travelled to Nyarabuye, near the \n     Tanzanian border, where a hilltop church and school complex \n     have become a national place of commemoration. The bodies of \n     several thousand men are in mass graves outside, where they \n     had tried to defend the women, the children, the old people. \n     Inside I was shown the heaped, rotted bodies and decayed \n     clothes of those women and children in room after room of \n     dark school buildings.\n       In witnessing these conditions my mind has been drawn back \n     inexorably to the Irish famine of the last century. I \n     recalled the images given voice by the Irish poet and Nobel \n     Laureate, Seamus Heaney, in his poem ``For the Commander of \n     the Eliza''. A routine boat patrol off the coast of West Mayo \n     tacks and hails a row boat crew in Gaelic:\n     ``. . . O my sweet Christ,\n     we saw piled in the bottom of their craft\n     six grown men with gaping mouths and eyes\n     bursting the sockets like spring onions in drills\n     six wrecks of bone and pallid, tautened skin,''\n       On my first visit a year ago the prison population was \n     under 9,000. Now it is over 53,000, in conditions which have \n     been described by NGO's as a humanitarian nightmare. I \n     visited one of the prisons, in the southern city of Butare. \n     It was built for 1,500 inmates, but was home to 6,276 men, \n     216 women, and 102 youths. Nearly all--except the 56 infants \n     imprisoned with their mothers--are awaiting trial on charges \n     of complicity in last year's genocide. Flying in by \n     helicopter we saw prisoners perched on the tin roofs \n     surrounding a central courtyard. They live there day and \n     night. The courtyard is full. Every building is jammed with \n     inmates, so that there is no room to lie down. Walking \n     through the prison with the Director and a Red Cross official \n     there was no sign of serious malnourishment or dehydration, \n     but the overcrowding is so severe--in some prisons four per \n     square meter--that some suffer from oedema and gangrene. \n     Although there are no exact figures, it has been estimated \n     that there are three hundred deaths every week. In Rwanda, \n     there is a sense among some that only death can bring release \n     from captivity. No trials, national or international, have \n     yet taken place. A Commission set up to screen detainees has \n     led to an insignificant number of releases. The International \n     Committee of the Red Cross--to whom I pay warm tribute--are \n     simply overwhelmed. Its field workers provide food, water, \n     and some health care to these 53,000 detainees held in \n     numerous detention centres.\n       The human rights situation in Rwanda today is a complex and \n     inter-related one. The principal human rights problems are: \n     arbitrary arrest on the basis of accusation, arbitrary \n     detention with no court process, inhumane conditions of \n     detention, and impunity for past human rights violations. \n     Other violations occur on a lesser scale; they include \n     torture and arbitrary killings.\n       There have been two particular human rights initiatives in \n     response to the scale of this problem: an International \n     Tribunal to try the main perpetrators of the genocide and a \n     human rights field operation under the High Commissioner for \n     Human Rights. The inadequacies of both initiatives show all \n     too clearly our failure to understand the fundamental \n     necessity to integrate a resourced human rights response with \n     the peacekeeping role and the humanitarian relief.\n       Following my visit last year I urged upon all Heads of \n     State the importance of establishing the International \n     Tribunal without delay and beginning the healing process \n     through prosecutions of the ringleaders. It was approved by \n     Security Council resolution last November but one year later \n     there has not been a single indictment, although it is hoped \n     to have the first prosecutions before the end of this year or \n     early next year. When I met the Deputy Prosecutor in Kigali \n     last week he confirmed that the problem was lack of \n     resources.\n       The Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda was entrusted by \n     the UN system and by the Government of Rwanda with the \n     following integrated mandate: (a) to carry out investigations \n     into violations of human rights and humanitarian law; (b) to \n     monitor the ongoing human rights situation and through its \n     presence, prevent future violations; (c) to co-operate with \n     other international agencies in re-establishing \n     confidence, and thus, to facilitate the return of refugees \n     and displaced persons and the rebuilding of civic society; \n     and (d) to implement programmes of technical co-operation \n     in the field of human rights, particularly in the area of \n     administration of justice as well as of human rights \n     education.\n       This is a uniquely proactive mandate. But speaking to field \n     officers on the ground I learned of their great frustration \n     in seeking to implement it. Lack of financial resources means \n     that there has been inadequacy in the logistics, in the \n     planning, in the administrative and operational \n     professionalism. Those who know about human rights, who have \n     creative ideas about addressing them, are without a budget \n     for such projects. I am told that what UNAMIR spends in a \n     week, or what is spent in the refugee camps in a week, is \n     more than the human rights budget for a year. The development \n     of a human rights culture is a complex undertaking, \n     especially in post human rights disaster situations. The UN \n     took an important step by creating the human rights field \n     operation. But it needs to go further to build up a corps of \n     professional and creative agents of social change, properly \n     deployed and supported, who have access to the funds and \n     flexibility needed to address effectively human rights \n     problems.\n       In the context of Rwanda I can see more clearly now how \n     broad based and varied the needs are: whether it is resources \n     to develop an infrastructure for the supreme court judges who \n     have been appointed there within the last few days, or the \n     provision of human rights materials and training for local \n     soldiers and police, or the production of public information \n     campaigns relative to human rights in co-operation with local \n     human rights N.G.O.'s and womens groups, there is above all \n     the challenge to react in a timely and effective fashion to \n     support movement in the direction of compliance with human \n     rights.\n       I am convinced we have the legal standards, the expertise, \n     the necessary experience and the resources to draw upon in \n     order to honour our commitments. The peace-building \n     operations in Namibia, El Salvador, \n\n[[Page S18368]]\n     Cambodia and Haiti and the deployment of trained human rights monitors \n     there have shown this to be the case. Can we justify the lack \n     of commitment to play an active and properly resourced role \n     in helping to reconstruct and redevelop Rwanda?\n       Tragically the same questions arise when we consider the \n     fate of up to two million refugees, many of whom had \n     participated in acts of genocide, living outside Rwanda's \n     borders in camps in Zaire and Tanzania, of whom more than \n     50,000 died last year of cholera, dysentery and dehydration. \n     Their continued presence in these countries has transformed \n     the Rwandan problem into a regional crisis which could \n     deteriorate, with unthinkable consequences, at any moment. \n     Yet, apart from bouts of forced repatriation in August 1995, \n     voluntary repatriation has been limited and vulnerable to \n     events in Rwanda. Refugees are afraid to return, many of them \n     fear being accused of having participated in genocide by \n     those who have recently occupied their properties. The \n     apprehension of reprisal killings, the massacre in Kibeho in \n     which thousands of internally displaced persons were killed, \n     the mass arrests, inhuman prison conditions, the lack of an \n     effective judicial system and the control exercised by camp \n     leaders though intimidation and hate propaganda--are all \n     factors which have effectively impeded the process of \n     voluntary repatriation.\n       An added and poisonous complication is that mixed in which \n     the civilian refugee population are some 20,000 Hutu soldiers \n     and 50,000 militia who are believed to have regrouped and \n     rebuilt their military infrastructure. They have been accused \n     by NGO's of diverting humanitarian aid and effectively \n     holding the refugees hostage. Calls have been made, in an \n     effort to break in logjam, to remove weapons from the camps \n     and to isolate those responsible for incitement to violence \n     and hatred.\n       The refugee situation is intimately bound up with \n     developments inside Rwanda. The policy of voluntary \n     repatriation can only be implemented when conditions inside \n     Rwanda have sufficiently improved. In a climate where \n     detention, on the basis of finger-pointing only, is perceived \n     as the equivalent of a death sentence, deadlock is \n     inevitable. We should understand therefore that assistance \n     given in helping Rwanda to rebuild its institutions and \n     restore justice and the rule of law is a humanitarian \n     investment which will contribute to break the refugee \n     deadlock, rescue the children from the shadow of the machette \n     and the horrors of genocide. In doing so, to lessen regional \n     tensions and lay the basis for the future.\n       Should we not listen carefully to those members of the NGO \n     community on the ground who have been telling us, patiently \n     but persistently for many months now, that if more assistance \n     is not given by the international community to managing the \n     refugee crisis by taking appropriate measures, both within \n     and beyond Rwanda's frontiers, a further human disaster will \n     ensue?\n       I have mentioned earlier that the Vienna Declaration has \n     re-affirmed the vital principle of universality. At the World \n     Conference we had an extraordinary opportunity to evaluate \n     the legal and political structures underpinning our human \n     rights commitments. Rwanda has put to the test our capacity \n     to honour those commitments with the structures and processes \n     we have developed. I fear that we are floundering. \n     Universality has been described as an unblinkered view with \n     no dead angles. But in failing to honour our commitments are \n     we not damaging the very principle of universality? Are we \n     not permitting ourselves a dead angle? And if we so permit, \n     what is the value and worth the principle afterwards? And how \n     will we be judged by succeeding generations if we stand idly \n     by?\n       In his address on the occasion of the opening of the new \n     Human Rights Building in Strasbourg, Vaclaving Havel referred \n     to the war that was raging in Bosnia. He made the point--\n     uncomfortably on such a festive occasion--that while we were \n     all watching helplessly, waiting to see who would win, we had \n     completely forgotten that what was happening just a few \n     hundred miles away from the peaceful plains of Alsace was not \n     just a war between the Serbs and others. It was a war for our \n     own future--it was a war that was being waged against us all, \n     against human rights and against the coexistence of people of \n     different nationalities or religious beliefs. It was a war \n     against meaningful human coexistence based on the \n     universality of human rights. As he put it, it was an attack \n     of the darkest past on a decent future, an attack of evil on \n     the moral order.\n       As usual his perception is unerring. What happened in \n     Bosnia was a conscious assault on the universal human rights \n     ideal. Rwanda is the same type of assault because the \n     genocide was targeted at destroying the agreed political \n     accommodation of the Arusha Accord. We must not think of it \n     as just another tribal war. We cannot distance ourselves from \n     what is happening in the prisons in Rwanda or in the refugee \n     camps. We have stood by and witnessed a genocide of a million \n     people followed by the fastest refugee exodus in recent \n     history. What is happening today in Rwanda is our problem \n     because it interrogates and tests the mettle of our \n     strongest-held convictions. Our capacity to react to this \n     human tragedy is a significant challenge to our commitments \n     to human rights at the end of the century. It is not too late \n     to honour them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18366-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18368-S18369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SECRETARY JESSE BROWN\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to express my admiration \nand respect for Secretary Jesse Brown and my appreciation for his \nachievements on behalf of our Nation's veterans.\n  In choosing Jesse Brown as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, President \nClinton couldn't have made a better choice from the standpoint of \nAmerica's veterans. A combat-wounded Marine veteran of Vietnam, a \nformer executive director of the Disabled American Veterans, Jesse \nBrown is a strong and aggressive advocate for the men and women who \nhave served our country.\n  During his tenure in the Cabinet, Jesse Brown has compiled a truly \noutstanding record of success. To cite just a few accomplishments, \nJesse Brown has:\n  Expanded the list of Vietnam veterans' diseases for which service-\nconnected compensation is paid based on exposure to agent orange;\n  Expanded and improved health care services for combat veterans \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder;\n  Created a presumption of service-connection for ex-prisoners of war \nwho contracted wet beri-beri and later suffered ischemic heart disease;\n  Established a host of new clinics offering veterans more convenient \naccess to VA health care;\n  Expanded and improved services for women veterans, which include \nmammography quality controls and counseling and medical programs for \nwomen veterans suffering the after-effects of service-related sexual \ntrauma;\n  Successfully fought for a law allowing the VA to pay compensation \nbenefits to chronically disabled Persian Gulf veterans with undiagnosed \nillnesses;\n  Established environmental research centers focused on the \nenvironmental exposures of Persian Gulf veterans and launched extensive \nepidemiological and other research efforts aimed at identifying the \ncauses of illnesses from which these veterans and their families are \nsuffering;\n  Made programs for homeless veterans a high priority--more than \ndoubling the budget for specialized programs for homeless veterans, \nconducting the first National Summit on Homelessness Among Veterans, \nand carrying out a new program of grants to assist public and non-\nprofit groups to develop new programs assisting homeless veterans;\n  Established a presumption of service-connection for veterans who \nexperienced full-body exposure to mustard gas or Lewisite as part of \nour military's testing of these substances;\n  Conducted an outreach campaign through which 602,000 veterans' home \nloans were refinanced at lower interest rates, saving these veterans an \naverage of $l,500 per year; and\n  Wrote to 44,000 Persian Gulf veterans and 47,000 Vietnam veterans \nnotifying them of their potential entitlement to benefits and \nencouraging them to file claims.\n  In addition to these efforts, Mr. President, Secretary Brown is \nworking to improve the VA's benefits and health care systems, \nrestructuring both its headquarters and field operations to enhance \nefficiency.\n  There's no question Jesse Brown is an untiring and outspoken \nadvocate--both within the administration and on Capitol Hill--for \nadequate funding for VA medical programs and benefits processing. But \nas one who strongly supports a balanced budget, Mr. President, I admire \nthose who make us think hard about prioritizing scarce Federal dollars, \nwho help us understand the consequences of the policy decisions we \nmake, and who force us to defend our actions.\n  Recently, Secretary Brown has been harshly criticized for speaking \nout on behalf of adequate budgets for the Veterans Administration. But \ncharacterizing his support as partisan--as some have done--ignores \nJesse Brown's nearly 3 decades of steadfast commitment to our Nation's \nveterans and their families and his strong personal beliefs in our \ncountry's responsibilities to them. It also fails to recognize his own \npersonal experiences as a combat veteran in Vietnam.\n  Jesse Brown reminds us all that, even in these tight budget times, \nour Nation has an obligation to its warriors and their survivors that \nwe simply cannot ignore.\n  And that is why, Mr. President, that I am proud to call Jesse Brown \nmy \n\n[[Page S18369]]\nfriend--and why I appreciate his strong support for the veterans of our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18368-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PAST POLITENESS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Colbert King, a member of the editorial \npage staff of the Washington Post, recently wrote an op-ed piece about \na group of young people who are meeting to establish greater \nunderstanding.\n  It may seem like a small thing to many people, but it is precisely \nwhat needs to happen in our country.\n  I remember many years ago speaking to the Hillel Foundation at the \nUniversity of Illinois. This is the Jewish student organization there.\n  It was an anniversary of some sort, and I suggested, among other \nthings, that since at the University of Illinois there were people of \nboth Jewish and Arab backgrounds that a few students getting together \nregularly might really contribute something. One of the students \npresent said that would be meaningless but, interestingly, a few of the \nstudents got together and, for at least a short period of time, held \nsome regular meetings between American Jews, Israeli Jews, and students \nfrom Arab countries. These were simply informal discussions long before \nPresident Sadat made his dramatic visit to the Knesset in Israel.\n  I wish I could report to you that something dramatic came out of \nthese student meetings. I do not know that anything came out of them, \nother than one extremely important thing--greater understanding.\n  We are in a world that needs that, and I would like more people to \nread the op-ed by Colbert King, which I ask to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The op-ed follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 1995]\n\n                    Past Politeness and Into Honesty\n\n                          (By Colbert I. King)\n\n       While countless adults have been living out the year \n     clenching their teeth by day and hyperventilating at home by \n     night over one racially tinged issue or another, a small \n     group of youngsters have been quietly making sure they don't \n     end up leading the same kind of lives. Seventeen area high \n     school students--nine African American and eight Jewish--have \n     been meeting since January to build a future in which their \n     generation will live without alienation and bitterness. What \n     they have achieved in 12 months should put us to shame.\n       In a town that worships influence and power, these young \n     people have neither. But when it comes to tolerance, trust, \n     and having friendships that cut across racial and religious \n     lines, they're up there with the best of their elders. Not \n     that they started out that way.\n       When they joined the first class of Operation \n     Understanding, D.C.--a fledgling nonprofit organization out \n     to revive the historical relationship between Jews and \n     African Americans through young peopel--many carried the same \n     heavy baggage that adults well into their autumn years still \n     lug around. To be sure, they were bright, curious, committed \n     to their community, and loaded with leadership potential--all \n     the things Operation Understanding, D.C., was seeking. But \n     they also tracked in a fair amount of ignorance, suspicion \n     and prejudice--some of which they acted out through words and \n     song during an Operation Understanding reception for parents \n     and guests a few weeks ago. A small sample:\n       Jamie: ``I know what it means to be black. How come it \n     seems that the Jews don't know what it means to be Jewish in \n     America?''\n       Andrew S.: ``How come blacks are so lazy? And how come so \n     many are on welfare?\n       Johnathan: ``Isn't there a Jewish Yellow Pages where they \n     can use their own lawyers and doctors and accountants and \n     only go to stores owned by Jews?''\n       Emily: ``Why are black men so scary?''\n       Atiba: ``How come Jews have all that money? They live the \n     good life. How'd they get all that money anyway?''\n       Mimi: ``How come blacks are such great dancers?''\n       You get the picture: mistrust, misconceptions, \n     misunderstanding. These youngsters stand out, however, \n     because they chose not to remain smug and comfortable with \n     their hangups. They began meeting several times a month to \n     get to know one another, to talk about each other's culture \n     and history, to learn more about their own. They didn't do it \n     through touchy-feely gab sessions. They got into each other's \n     lives.\n       They went to Daniela's sister's bat mitzvah; it was Tiba's \n     first time in a synagogue, Mimi went to Tiba's church on Palm \n     Sunday--her first time in a black church. Everyone went to \n     Muhammad's mosque in March.\n       They called on Capitol Hill and heard D.C. Del. Eleanor \n     Holmes Norton and other black and Jewish members of Congress \n     discuss how they coalesced on legislation. They met with a \n     range of local speakers--as a sign they were long-suffering \n     and up for just about anything, they even endured part of an \n     evening with me. But they also got out of Washington and into \n     communities that would give them a deeper understanding of \n     African American and Jewish cultures and collaborative \n     history.\n       Before their trip, however, they made a Shabbat dinner \n     together. As youngsters of the '90s, they did it their way: a \n     soul food Shabbat--fully equipped with fried chicken, \n     biscuits, greens, sweet potatoes, and challah, backed by lit \n     candles, recitation of the Motzi and prayer over the wine. \n     What can I say?\n       And off they went to Crown Heights in Brooklyn--both the \n     Lubavitcher and African American sides--Ellis Island and the \n     Jewish Museum, and places that resonate with civil rights \n     history such as Selma, Montgomery, Birmingham and Charleston.\n       They had hoped to go to Sengal and Israel, but despite the \n     plate-passing at black churches and donations from \n     foundations, corporations, congregations and individuals, \n     they couldn't raise enough money. Maybe next year in \n     Jerusalem and Dakar.\n       But a lot was learned at home. Jamie could hardly believe \n     what he heard from Holocaust survivors in Atlanta and New \n     Orleans. The visit to the Charleston plantation made Simone \n     cry uncontrollably. ``It was as if all the slaves who lived \n     there came to me all at once,'' she said. They walked across \n     the Edmund Pettus Bridge and spontaneously began singing ``We \n     Shall Overcome.''\n       The Class of 1995 ends in April; a new group of high school \n     juniors begins next month. Class No. 1 still meets monthly, \n     but unlike most of us older folks, they're long past being \n     polite with each other; now they're just honest. That's \n     because after all they've gone through, they know respect and \n     trust each other.\n       Black nationalists and Jewish chauvinists out there, have \n     no fear: Operation Understanding is a life-changing \n     experience, but racial and religious identities don't get \n     lost. If anything, these young people now have a stronger \n     sense of themselves and their own history. They cherish both \n     their similarities and differences. It's America's cultural \n     and racial divides they will abide no longer. And no one's \n     going to tell them who can be their friend. These are strong \n     kids. They even think they can change the world.\n       This is what Operation Understanding's kinetic (no other \n     word for it) president, Karen Kalish, hoped to achieve when \n     she started the D.C. program. The idea came from United Negro \n     College Fund president and former U.S. representative William \n     Gray III; who started Operation Understanding in Philadelphia \n     with George Ross of the American Jewish Committee 10 years \n     ago. The Class of 1995 is the new generation of bridge \n     builders they had in mind.\n       As the program ended, Jessica, who is Jewish, began singing \n     ``Lift Every Voice and Sing.'' She was joined by the group--\n     as the eyes of many African American parents and guests began \n     to glisten. Then Bridgette, an African American, began ``Oseh \n     Shalom''--and Jewish eyes were full. Those tears tell us a \n     lot about our times.\n       Schmaltzy? Perhaps. But maybe if a few more Operation \n     Understandings had been at work around the globe long ago, \n     President Clinton wouldn't have had to visit Belfast this \n     week, and 20,000 American troops wouldn't be gearing up for \n     Bosnia. We're leaving our youth a pretty scratchy world. But \n     rest assured, as far as Operation Understanding's graduates \n     are concerned. America is going to be okay in their \n     hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18369-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JULIAN GRAYSON\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

WILDERNESS\n\n   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a native \nSouth Carolinian and the ``Father of South Carolina's Mountain Bridge \nWilderness,'' C. Thomas Wyche. On December 7, 1995, here in Washington, \nTommy Wyche was recognized for his outstanding contributions to \nenvironmental conservation when he was awarded one of the Nation's top \nenvironmental awards, The Alexander Calder Conservation Award.\n  Located just 30 miles up the road from Tommy's hometown of \nGreenville, the rolling red clay hills of the South Carolina piedmont \nsuddenly springs into the foothills of the Great Smokey Mountains. The \narea, known as South Carolina's Blue Ridge Escarpment, is one of \nunusual natural beauty. Typified by high cliffs, steep terrain, rushing \nrivers and dense forests, it is relatively pristine despite being \nlocated within 30 miles of one of the Nation's fastest growing \ncommunities. It is for preserving this natural wonderland that Tommy \nWyche was recognized.\n  Mr. President, the Mountain Bridge is just one of Tommy's many \nconservation successes. Over the last quarter century, he has almost \nsinglehandedly led the fight to ensure that the mountains of South \nCarolina are preserved for the benefit of future generations. He \nspearheaded efforts to designate the Chattooga River as a wild and \nscenic river, and drafted the South Carolina Heritage Trust Act, the \nfirst in the United States. In addition, he has produced books \ncelebrating the area, a guidebook and a photographic journal, both of \nwhich have played an important part in educating the public on the \narea's natural treasures.\n  Tommy's crowning achievement, and the basis for the Calder Award, is \nhis work to preserve 40,000 acres along the South Carolina-North \nCarolina border--the Mountain Bridge Wilderness Area. Tommy began \nefforts to preserve the area in the early 1970's. As I mentioned \nearlier, this is an area of rough terrain which contains a number of \nnatural wonders like Raven Cliff Falls, a 400 foot waterfall--one of \nthe highest east of the Mississippi--and a monolith known as Table \nRock. A recent biological assessment of just a portion of the \nwilderness area produced a number of astonishing finds, enormous trees, \ntrophy-size native brook trout, and a stunning variety of birds, \nreptiles, amphibians and insects, many of them rare or endangered and \ntwo new to science. The scientist concluded the area was ``the most \nsignificant wilderness remaining in South Carolina.''\n  Tommy not only originated the idea of the Mountain Bridge but he is \nresponsible for its success. In the beginning, he organized a nonprofit \norganization known as the Natureland Trust to preserve the area we now \nknow as the Mountain Bridge. Working with the Natureland Trust, Tommy \nmet with numerous landowners, walked their properties, and developed \nplans for the donation or bargain sale of their lands to the State. In \nmany instances, he volunteered his expertise as a tax attorney to \ninsure the most beneficial transfer for all parties. Slowly but surely, \nTommy's efforts began to pay off--a hundred acres here, a thousand \nacres there. The wilderness acres began to take shape.\n  Today the Mountain Bridge is almost complete, although Tommy has \nrecently been working on one last acquisition. Although Tommy and the \nNatureland Trust are closing in on their goal, I am sure he is looking \nfor other mountains, not to climb, but to preserve--other missions, \nlike the Mountain Bridge which will ensure future generations enjoy the \nnatural beauty of South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, for a quarter century Tommy Wyche has worked \ntirelessly and unselfishly to coordinate efforts to preserve this piece \nof South Carolina's wilderness. I encourage others to follow his lead. \nGiven the severity of the current budget deficit, the Federal \nGovernment has limited resources dedicated to preserving wild areas. I \nencourage others to use Tommy Wyche as a model for cooperative \nconservation. I commend him for a job well done, congratulate him for \nthe Calder award and encourage him to continue his good works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/S18370-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18370-S18371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ERNEST BOYER\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it was with great sadness that I \nlearned of the death of Ernest Boyer who was president of the Carnegie \nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching.\n  Ernie Boyer was a friend to many of us in the Senate, and to \nthousands who will never know his name but who will feel his influence \nfor years to come. His contributions to education are well known. \n``Ready to Learn'' and ``The Basic School,'' his excellent primers on \nthe state of American education, both make the strong case that we \ncan't start too soon in preparing our children--through education--for \nthe world they will face.\n  It was my good fortune, Mr. President, to have Ernest Boyer as a \nsounding board, an ally, and a friend. We have lost a remarkable man \nwith his death, and I hope that others of us will be able in some small \nmeasure to carry on with his ideas.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about ``sensible men and conscientious men \nall over the world [who] were of one religion of well-doing and \ndaring.'' I believe, Mr. President, that Ernest Boyer's well-doing and \ndaring sprang from his sensible view and his conscientious approach. He \nwas very fine, and I will miss his counsel and friendship.\n\n[[Page S18371]]\n\n\n       AUTHORIZING APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE ON PART OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
