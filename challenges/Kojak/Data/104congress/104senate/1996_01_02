Mr. President, I have been here on the floor several times \nduring the past few days over the New Year's weekend, as have the \ndistinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic \nleader, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and \nothers who have been working the effort of trying to get this budget \nback together.\n  It is ironic that we are here and we hear statements coming from \nsome, primarily in the other body from back in their home States and \nhome districts, that show to me at least the disconnect with reality. I \nhope some of these Members when they return to Washington will have a \nfresh perspective on the human toll this foolish Government shutdown \nhas taken. This foolish Government shutdown has taken a human toll. In \nfact, it is ironic that the House and Senate cannot seem to come \ntogether and get the work done necessary to get us out of this, but we \nare getting paid at the same time there are hundreds of thousands of \nFederal employees who want to work and they are not being paid. There \nare others deemed essential who go to work and will not be paid.\n  These people have mortgages. These people have rent, heat, food, \nchild care, everything else, to pay. They are not getting their \npaychecks. They are real human beings, whether they are in Vermont or \nany other State.\n  My New Year's wish is that the House may replace its severe case of \nintransigence with some true leadership to get us out of this, because \nthis kind of Government close-down foolishness is not necessary.\n  The balanced budget talks are going on right now with the President, \nwith the distinguished leadership on both sides. That has nothing to do \nwith whether Congress completes its work. We have 13 appropriations \nbills that are supposed to be passed by the end of the fiscal year. The \nreason much of Government is closed down is because a number of those \nbills have not been passed. I might suggest a bill that the House could \naccept, if they are unwilling to pay Federal employees, they ought to \npass the bill that the Senate has already passed which says that \nMembers of Congress will not be paid until this is done. They will not \ndo that. In fact, we had one Member of the House who said that he has \nto be paid because he is in the Constitution. I looked through the \nConstitution. I did not find his name, and I would love to see which \ncopy he is referring to.\n  The fact is that we have people, Federal workers, who are being \npunished unnecessarily. I would like to have some of these members who \ndo not want us to go back to work to talk to Angelia and Jeffrey Brace \nof Milton, VT. They cannot go to work at the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service office in South Burlington, VT, and they and \ntheir 3\\1/2\\-year-old daughter are not going to get a paycheck. There \nare headlines like this in the Vermont press, ``Budget Squeeze Hits \nHome.'' It is happening in every one of our States.\n  I know the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, if it was left to them and with the President, we \ncould get this done. We have passed legislation here to put us back to \nwork. If it was left to the leadership here in the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle this could be done. Just because some--in this case, a \nsmall group of freshmen who I admit each have 12 months of experience \nwith the Government--have made a decision that we will become a \nlaughingstock to the rest of the world because our Government is shut \ndown, because they are not getting every bit of their way.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter to the editor in my hometown newspaper \nfrom Mr. George D. Sack, president of the Vermont chapter of the \nNational Treasury Employees Union, that says if the chief executive \nofficer of IBM and the board of directors had a dispute over policy, it \nis doubtful they would close their plants until they reach a decision. \nYet that is exactly what happened when Congress and the administration \nclosed the Government.\n  This is not the way to do things. This is costing taxpayers hundreds \nof millions of dollars in wasted productivity, wasted time. Some will \ngo on and say, ``Do you miss the Government?'' Ask that of somebody \ntrying to get a visa, or ask that of somebody who has a mortgage \napplication before the Veterans Administration. Ask any number of \npeople, and it will go into the millions of people being \ninconvenienced. Ask the people who are in private business who are \nbeing hurt because the Government is closed down.\n  The fact of the matter, Mr. President, we could put the Government \nback to work in the next hour and we would still have negotiations on \nthe budget, negotiations that would bring about a balanced budget in 7 \nyears. We are not going to have a Clinton budget or Gingrich budget or \nDole budget or Leahy budget, but we could have a budget where we all \nwork together, protect the environment, protect education, protect \npeople that need medical care, still balance the budget. That is what \nwe ought to do.\n  This kind of posturing, when it hurts people who cannot pay the \nmortgage, the heat, their children's doctors' bills, that is cruel.\n  It is especially cruel when the taxpayers have paid for airplane \ntickets for those same House Members to go home for Christmas vacation; \nthe taxpayers have paid them a couple of thousand dollars a week to sit \nat home doing nothing. They ought to be back here getting us back to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 5 minutes allocated to \neach Senator for morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19326-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19326-S19327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A CLEAN CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to make once again a very strong \nplea for a clean continuing resolution in order to allow the Federal \nemployees to go back to work and for the Government to function while \nthe negotiations continue over a 7-year budget plan.\n  The shutdown of the Government ought not to be used as a coercive \ntactic in order to reach a particular solution with respect to the 7-\nyear budget plan. Unfortunately, that is what has happened.\n  The employees are being used as pawns in this game, in this tragic \ngame. And what is happening now is that you have over 500,000 employees \nwho have been going into their offices and working, but who are not \nbeing paid for the period since December 16. You have another 260,000 \nemployees who have been furloughed. So you have a total of almost \n800,000 employees not being paid for doing their jobs.\n  Of course, their inability to do their jobs affects citizens all \nacross the country. There is an impact upon the private sector and upon \nmillions of citizens. The NIH, which should be processing its grants to \nthe private researchers, is not able to do so because people are on \nfurlough. A number of States are slowing down the operation of their \nsafety and health programs and their unemployment insurance programs \nbecause of the partial closedown in the Federal Government. You have a \nnumber of agencies that are not providing very needed services--the \npassport office, for example. A lot of people get passports for \nbusiness reasons. Others have planned trips for long periods of time. \nAll of a sudden, none of them can carry through on their plans often at \ngreat expense and inconvenience.\n  The impact of this partial closedown on the Federal Government is \ndisrupting the lives of millions of people, not only the Federal \nemployees, but ordinary citizens who depend upon the Federal employees \nto provide them with important services.\n\n  There are strong differences about the basic 7-year plan. Those \ndifferences \n\n[[Page S19327]]\nought to be fought out. But the employees in the Government ought not \nto be taken hostage as a coercive tactic in that debate, in that sharp \ndifference over what the budget priorities ought to be. We have \ndiscussed those differences at length on the floor of the Senate, and I \nassume further discussions are going on, about the deep cuts in \nMedicare services, and in Medicaid services versus tax breaks for \npeople at the top end of the economic scale. But we ought not to be \nholding hostage Federal employees to that debate.\n  This week, people will receive paychecks that pay them for only 1 \nweek, up until the 16th of December, when the last continuing \nresolution expired. Instead of a 2-week paycheck, they are going to get \na 1-week paycheck. They will not get the second week because that was \nbeyond the time of the continuing resolution, although over 500,000 of \nthese employees were brought in to work. Although these employees were \nbrought in to work, over half a million of them--and another 260,000 \nwho have been furloughed find themselves in the same situation--they \nwill get the 1-week paycheck, not beyond that. Then, after this week, \nunless the Congress takes action, they are not going to get paid.\n  It is said that we are going to pass a provision which later, when we \nget a budget and an appropriation, will go back and pay these people. \nThat is only decent and humane and just, it certainly should be done. \nBut what are these workers to do in the meantime? There seems to be an \nassumption on the part of many Members of the Congress--maybe it \nreflects their own particular financial situation--an assumption that \npeople somehow have money stashed away that they can simply draw down \non. So when the paycheck does not come in, it does not make any \ndifference in their standard of living.\n  That is not true for a great many people. Most people need a regular \npaycheck in order to make car payments, house payments, tuition \npayments--to meet their ordinary living expenses. This is particularly \ntrue of people at the lower and middle grades, but it applies \nthroughout the Federal service.\n  What is being done to dedicated employees is an absolute outrage. It \ndefies all reason and all common sense. There is no way, rationally, \none can justify what is now happening and it clearly flouts common \nsense.\n  The Washington Post, in a very strong editorial--and I ask unanimous \nconsent the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Washington Post editorial said:\n\n       Federal employees have every right to feel as if they are \n     the real pawns in this sorry mess. One day they are proud and \n     productive members of the Federal Government, protecting the \n     health and safety of the Nation; the next, they are handed a \n     slip of paper and sent home with no idea when they will be \n     paid. That is no way to motivate a work force, let alone \n     demonstrate respect for it.\n\n  Let us pass a clean continuing resolution. Let the people go back to \nwork. Let the Government function. And then let the debate over the \nbroader budget, the 7-year budget plan, continue without this coercive \neffort to use the Federal employees as a pawn in that debate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 1995]\n\n                        A Shutdown's Other Costs\n\n       There is more to the stalemate of the government than the \n     failure of the president and the GOP to agree on a seven-year \n     balanced-budget plan. The furloughing of federal employees \n     exacts a terrible cost from a valuable work force. Nothing \n     can be more demoralizing to men and women who look out for \n     the nation's veterans, hunt for the cures to deadly diseases, \n     keep our air and water clean, send out the Social Security \n     checks and otherwise serve the nation in ways most of us \n     don't think about, than to be told that despite their \n     fidelity and contribution, they are really ``nonessential.'' \n     That insult, being added to all the other guff federal \n     workers catch in the halls of Congress, on talk shows and \n     from television comics, comes as an undeserved kick in the \n     teeth from their own government.\n       Federal employees have every right to feel as if they are \n     the real pawns in this sorry mess. One day they are proud and \n     productive members of the federal government, protecting the \n     health and safety of the nation; the next they are handed a \n     slip of paper and sent home with no idea when they will be \n     paid. That is no way to motivate a work force, let alone \n     demonstrate respect for it.\n       The daily payroll cost for the furlough of employees is no \n     small matter--even if employees are paid retroactively for \n     their days out of work. But there are consequences of the \n     cavalier treatment of the federal work force that will be \n     felt long after the government is back in business.\n       A government that is in gridlock--worse yet, shuttered--\n     does little to bolster a political system already losing the \n     public's confidence. It downright debilitates its own work \n     force. As a furloughed federal economist said during the last \n     interruption, ``Can you imagine a Fortune 500 company \n     operating like this? If they had a dispute between their \n     board of directors and their president, and they sent \n     everybody home?'' And in addition to the effect on morale, \n     can such interruption be supposed to be a help to the work \n     they do?\n       In an open letter to federal employees, President Clinton \n     and Vice President Gore signaled their recognition of the \n     shabby treatment afforded the federal work force: ``you \n     remain good people caught in what Churchill called the `worst \n     system of government devised by the wit of man, except for \n     all the others,' '' they wrote. Good people--and they are--\n     should not be made to pay for the failures of their leaders. \n     Getting federal employees out of the middle and back on the \n     job is the way to respect them.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19326-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19327-S19328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TIME FOR AN AGREEMENT ON A BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise also to talk about the dilemma that \nwe are in. I agree with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nMaryland that we ought not to be where we are. I believe it is time \nthat we come to an agreement on the balanced budget. If you really want \nto come to a solution, you could have come to a solution by now--all of \nus. If you want to find a solution, you can find a solution. You cannot \njust continue to talk and say we have had useful conversations and walk \naway, having made no decisions. That is not a way.\n  I have a little different view, however, of some of the reasons that \nwe are here than the Senator from Maryland. The President could have \nsigned the appropriations bills. He could have had those people back to \nwork. He chose not to do that.\n  We started on November 14, I believe, with an agreement to find a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, using CBO numbers. And that was not done. \nOn the part of the administration, nor indeed the other side of the \naisle, a process to do that was not forthcoming.\n  So, I think we should not be where we are. I have been here since \nThursday, hoping the leadership would come forward and say, ``Here is a \nway to put people back to work.'' I have been here each of those days \nto do that. We have had objections from the other side of the aisle not \nto do that. ``We do not want to do that.''\n  So that is where we are, and we ought to change that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what we are really doing here, that \nis, trying to balance the budget. In 45 days we have not done that. The \nadministration promised to bring that forward. There were four budgets, \nnone of them balanced. Instead of that, there has generally been \nposturing at the polls, saying what an exaggerated effect would happen \nif we reduced the rate of growth in the budget. That is what we talked \nabout, when everyone in this place knows you have to reduce the rate of \ngrowth in the budget. Not a soul in here would deny that has to be \ndone.\n  Still, we cannot do it. Everyone rises up and says, ``I want to \nbalance the budget. We have to balance the budget.'' But can we go \nforward? We hear all of the reasons why we cannot do that. We have not \ndone it for 30 years. We have not balanced the budget one time. Then I \nguess we wonder why it is that when you say ``then we will talk about \nbalancing the budget,'' we say, ``That is what you said when we tried \nto get an amendment to balance the budget.'' We are going to gut Social \nSecurity, so we cannot do that. It did not have anything to do with \nSocial Security.\n\n  So here we are. I agree entirely we ought not to be here. Not only \nFederal employees in my State, as in your State, many people, \nYellowstone Park concessionaires, for example, are out of work because \nthe President did not sign the Interior bill, among other things. So \nYellowstone Park is closed.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about some fundamental \n\n[[Page S19328]]\n  changes. You know, not going around the edges and trying to do a little \nsomething. We are talking about a balanced budget, one that has to do \nwith financial and fiscal responsibility, one that has to do with not \ncontinuing to put it on the debt so our kids have to pay it. Our credit \ncard is maxed out. We know that. We cannot come to any kind of \nagreement. We are going to talk some more today, I guess, and talk some \nmore tomorrow. We probably will not be able to come to an agreement.\n  There is lots of room to come to an agreement. The parameters are \npretty large--a balanced budget in 7 years, CBO numbers. Aside from \nthat, you can bargain in there. That is a pretty broad parameter. We \ncould do that. We could do that.\n  Mr. President, we ought to do that. We ought to get folks back to \nwork. This is a ridiculous arrangement. We have to make some decisions. \nThe people who are doing the negotiating need to make some decisions. \nThat is our job.

Mr. President, we are now in the 18th day of the \nlongest Government shutdown in the history of the Nation. Serious \nnegotiations continue on the budget, but still the Republican majority \nin Congress refuses to pass legislation to fund the normal function of \nGovernment; that is, a clean continuing resolution. This persistent \nrefusal to provide funding for normal Government operations is \nirresponsible. It is irresponsible conduct by the Republican majority, \nparticularly in the House, which must originate appropriations bills \nregardless of which side may be right or wrong on the policy issues in \nthe budget negotiations.\n  Any time the negotiation occurs, each side begins by assessing its \nown as well as its opponent's strengths and weaknesses. Each side \ndetermines the actions that it can take to put pressure on the other to \nreach concessions.\n  In these negotiations over the budget, for the first time in our \nNation's history the Republicans who are controlling Congress have \ndetermined that they have the right to shut down the Government and \nthey can use that right as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with \nthe President. They do not see the obligation to keep Government \nfunctioning as a shared obligation. They do not see it. They do not see \nit as an obligation of both the executive and the legislative branches \nas previous Congresses have. Instead, they are quite willing to assign \nthat responsibility exclusively to the President while, for their own \npart, keeping the Government closed as a bargaining ploy. This is a \nprofound change in the way Congress views its responsibilities. It is \nsimply wrong to see this is as more business as usual, more of the \ntraditional bickering that characterizes Washington politics.\n\n  In November, we had the longest shutdown in the 207-year history of \nthe Republic, and it was 6 days long. Now we are at 18 days and \ncounting in the second shutdown of this Congress.\n  When our Founders embarked on the task of bringing to life the \nconstitutional system, they devised in Philadelphia in 1787, it was the \nlegislative branch of the Government which they called on to commence \nproceedings under the Constitution.\n  The Congress met in New York in 1789, organized itself, provided for \nthe counting of Presidential electoral votes and the inauguration of \nthe President. The Congress then passed legislation to establish the \ngreat departments of the executive branch, to provide for the \norganization of the judicial branch, and to furnish appropriations to \nenable all the branches of our new national Government to perform their \nconstitutional functions.\n  It would be, frankly, unimaginable to our Founders that our branch, \nthe first branch of Government whose duty it was to bring to life the \nFramers' plan, would ever think that it was within its purview to \ndisable that plan by refusing to perform the Congress' primary \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  It would be unimaginable for the new Congress to have decided not to \ncomplete the work of setting up the Government that the Constitutional \nConvention contemplated. In fact, it would have precipitated a major \nconstitutional crisis for a radical majority in the first Congress to \ndecide not to set up a particular department or not to fund a \nparticular department just to get the bargaining leverage with a new \nPresident. Such a step then might have doomed the future of our new \nconstitutional Republic.\n  My Republican colleagues argue that it is not they who are acting \nirresponsibly in causing Government to remain closed. After all, they \npassed appropriations bills and the President has chosen to veto those \nbills. They are right; the President has exercised his veto. He has \ndone so as provided in the Constitution. He has returned those bills to \nthe Congress, also as provided in the Constitution. But when the \nPresident uses the veto, the Framers of the Constitution contemplated \nthat Congress would either muster the two-thirds majority in each House \nneeded to override the veto or make the changes necessary in the bill \nto satisfy the President's objections. When time has been required to \nresolve differences between the President and Congress on spending \nbills, all previous Congresses, 103 of them, have enacted continuing \nresolutions to maintain the normal functioning of Government.\n  When this Congress and this Republican majority came, that all \nchanged. For the first time in our Nation's history, the majority in \nCongress is refusing to perform its primary constitutional \nresponsibility to maintain a functioning Government. It is abusing its \npower under the Constitution. This refusal, this abrogation of \nresponsibility, this abuse of power is being explained away as a \nnatural consequence of policy differences between the President and the \nCongress. But there have been many times in our history when policy \ndifferences between Congress and the President were great and were \nstrongly held. Never before has Congress approached the negotiations of \nthose differences with the view that responsibility for maintaining a \nworkable Government rests exclusively with the President and the \nability to keep the Government closed is a bargaining chip that \nCongress brings to the negotiations.\n\n  If this Republican view is accepted with respect to a partial \nGovernment shutdown, why should it not also apply with respect to \nincreasing the debt limit and extending the full faith and credit of \nthe United States? If it is OK to shut down the functioning of \nGovernment to force the President to accept the Congress' negotiating \nposition, why would it not be just as acceptable for the Congress to \nrefuse to increase the debt limit for the same purpose? Why would it \nnot be just as acceptable for the Republicans in Congress to say it is \nthe President's responsibility alone to ensure the full faith and \ncredit of the United States and he has to do it by agreeing to whatever \nwe in Congress demand?\n  This view by the Republican leadership of Congress is as radical as \nit is wrong. The Founders of our Nation provided for a government in \nwhich responsibility as well as power was to be shared. If the Congress \nwill not hold itself responsible for maintaining a workable government, \nthen the people who elect the Congress will surely do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19328-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19328-S19329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as if in morning business and have the time for morning \nbusiness extended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S19329]]\n\n\n                            END THE SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come from a town of 400 people in \nsouthwestern North Dakota, a very small community, a community probably \nlike most other small communities in this country. Good people live \nthere, thoughtful people, people who help others. Oh, the community has \na few hotheads like most communities have, a few freeloaders like most \ncommunities have.\n  My home community is probably not unlike the Congress; 535 people \nserve here in the U.S. Congress, mostly good, thoughtful, hard-working \npeople, Republicans and Democrats who love their country and care about \ndoing the right thing for their country. And we have a few hotheads \nhere and we have a few hot dogs here, I guess.\n  We find ourselves today in a most remarkable position, one that I \nthink causes all Americans to scratch their heads and wonder, what on \nEarth can they be thinking about in the U.S. Congress?\n  We have a disagreement over a 7-year budget plan. The disagreement is \nnot over small issues; it is over some very significant issues. And \nthere is a good reason that there would be disagreement over large \nquestions, such as a $245 billion tax cut, a $270 billion proposed cut \nin Medicare spending, and a range of other things. There is good reason \nthat there would be very substantial disagreement about those issues. \nAnd yet we know from two centuries of history that in a democracy you \nfind compromise; you reason together; you find a way to come together \nand reach common solutions.\n  This year, however, it has been different. There is a disagreement on \nthe 7-year budget plan. There are talks now ongoing at the White House, \nand I have been involved in some of those talks over this weekend at \nthe White House, and I shall not talk about the merits of the balanced \nbudget issues because I have been a part of those discussions. But I \ndid want to say that because we find ourselves at this junction, we now \nhave a partial shutdown of the Federal Government by some who want to \nuse that shutdown as leverage to try to get what they might think they \ncan get in this 7-year balanced budget negotiation.\n  It does not make any sense to me that we use a partial shutdown of \nthe Federal Government as leverage. There is no connection. It does not \nmake any sense.\n  Can you imagine the city council of my hometown or your hometown, a \ncity council that says we, as a city council, cannot agree on a budget, \nso you know what we are going to do? We are going to decide that city \nworkers will not come to work, or we are going to have half of them not \ncome to work and half of them come to work, and to those we prevent \nfrom coming to work we say, you stay home, we will not allow you to \ncome to work and when this is over, we are going to pay you for work we \nwill not allow you to do. To those who come to work we say, you come to \nwork because that is your responsibility, and when you get here we are \nnot going to pay you, but we will pay you later when we resolve this \ndispute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This would be nurses at a veterans hospital, security \nguards at the prisons, and so on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Many of whom work from paycheck to paycheck and live \npaycheck to paycheck. And that is who we are telling in this \ncircumstance that they should bear the brunt of this dispute.\n  I would be happy to yield for a moment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Very quickly. The Washington Post in a recent editorial \nsaid, and I quote them, ``Can you imagine a Fortune 500 company \noperating like this, if they had a dispute between their board of \ndirectors and their President and they sent everybody home.''\n  It is a coercive bargaining tactic that ought to have no place in the \npicture. As the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said, the regular \noperations of Government ought to be able to continue while we try to \nthrash out the very tough questions involved in this 7-year budget \nprojection.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I might say Senator \nDole has been in the Chamber and he has made the point several times \nthat it is not his desire to see this shutdown continue.\n  I think and I hope very much that we will be able to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution to end the shutdown. I know the previous Senator \nwho spoke this morning said, well, we--meaning people on his side--have \nproposed to bring the Government workers back to work but we have \nobjected.\n  Well, that sort of paints a different picture than exists. We have \nover 2 weeks now proposed clean continuing resolutions that people come \nback to work and be paid for coming back to work, and they have been \nobjected to.\n  Aside from what has happened in the past, we ought to today, on \nTuesday, all of us, decide that this is the day to end this shutdown, \nend this bizarre impasse, and pass a clean continuing resolution to \nhave the Federal workers come back to work, to be paid for coming back \nto work, and stop this nonsense.\n  It does not make any sense to dangle those Federal workers at the end \nof a chain here and say, you are the ones who will be used as a pawn in \nthis budget issue. That is not fair to them. I wonder, if we were \ntalking about CEO's or Wall Street investors, whether someone would be \nsaying, well, we would like to dangle you; we would like to use you as \nbait here in budget negotiations. I do not expect you would see people \nusing CEO's like that or Wall Street folks like that. It is just the \nFederal work force that people think they can use like that.\n  My hope is that at the end of the day we in the Senate, Republicans \nand Democrats, all of us who understand this makes no sense--the \nPresiding Officer in the chair has made that same point--my hope is all \nof us can decide at the end of the day, at least with respect to the \nSenate, we will pass a clean continuing resolution, send it to the \nHouse and urge that they do the same. Then we should move on to \nhonestly and aggressively negotiating an end as well and a solution as \nwell to the 7-year balanced budget plan.\n  It can and should be done and, I think, will be done, but this \nshutdown really makes no sense. It pokes the American taxpayer in the \neye and dangles Federal workers as bait or as pawns in a circumstance \nthat is terribly unfair to them.\n  In an hour--in a half hour, for that matter--we could, it seems to \nme, pass a clean appropriations bill to continue funding and end this \nshutdown, and I hope that will be the case this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19328-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19329-S19330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         POLICY DIFFERENCES AND CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota for his very strong statement. I know how \nkeenly he has followed this matter. I also want to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico for his very thoughtful analysis. \nHe made some extremely important points about the workings of the \nAmerican constitutional system.\n  We have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances. \nThat means that one branch cannot simply abdicate itself from assuming \na measure of responsibility when sharp policy differences confront \ndecisionmakers.\n  There are sharp policy differences over the components of a 7-year \nbalanced budget. One approach would make a cut of $270 billion in \nMedicare and give tax breaks of $250 billion. There are many of us who \nthink that is a wrong set of priorities, that we ought not to be giving \nthe tax breaks and, by not doing so we would not be making deep cuts in \nMedicare. That is an issue that needs to be argued out among the \nMembers of the Congress and between the Congress and the President.\n  The President has stated he wants to move to a balanced budget, but \nhe does not want to do it at the sacrifice of important priorities \ninvolving Medicare, \n\n[[Page S19330]]\nMedicaid, health care for our citizens, involving educational programs, \nthe opportunity for young people to go to college, involving \nenvironmental matters, in terms of safeguarding our air and water and \nprotecting and enhancing our environment. So there are sharp \ndifferences over priorities.\n  Many of us regard the proposal to make sharp cutbacks in the level of \nservices for those programs as a radical proposal. In any event, no \nmatter how one resolves such issues, the closedown of the Government \nought not to be a coercive tactic that is permitted. In other words, \nworkers are being taken financial hostage in order for one side to get \nits way on a set of policies.\n  There are millions of citizens who are not getting services that they \nrequire. It is impeding the functioning of the private sector, of the \nprivate economy all across the country. The private sector is not able \nto carry forward as it otherwise would do because the Government is not \nproviding certain important services which everyone agrees need to be \nprovided.\n  In addition, the punishment that is being inflicted upon those who \nwork for the Government is extremely unfair and unfortunate.\n  I do not know what people assume about the ordinary person's ability \nto meet their financial obligations week to week and month to month. I \nreally ask people all across the country to stop and think for a \nmoment: If you cease to be paid, if you were not getting your salary \ncheck, your paycheck, how would you meet your obligations? There are \nsome people--I think a limited number--who could handle that situation \nwithout any difficulty. They have lots of savings, they have lots of \naccumulated wealth put away and they would simply draw down on it. But \nthat is not true of the ordinary citizen, and it is not true of the \nordinary Federal worker. They now are confronted with what amounts to \nfamily crises.\n  Over half a million of those workers have been coming in to work. \nThey have been called in. They have been working, but they are not \ngetting paid. Another 260,000 have been furloughed. They are not \ngetting paid. The answer to this is, of course, for the Government to \nstart up again under a clean continuing resolution while the budget \ndiscussions continue and allow the Government to function and provide \nits services to allow its employees to be paid; not to hold them \nhostage as part of a coercive strategy in order to achieve one's way \nwith respect to the broader budget question. Very important budget \nquestions, but we ought not to be using this tactic in order to coerce \nthe opposite party into submission to a set of budget priorities about \nwhich there is sharp disagreement.\n  So I hope that in short order we will be able to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution that allows the workers to come back to work, \nallows the Government to open up and allows the workers to be paid.\n  There is another proposal discussed last week to bring them in, but \nthey would not be able to do anything because they would be precluded \nfrom incurring new obligations--in other words, the Government would \nnot really perform its functions--and at the same time the workers \nwould not be paid. Some of the employee groups have gone into court \nasserting bringing them in to work and failing to pay them violates \ntheir constitutional rights. I do not know what the outcome of that \njudicial proceeding will be, but it is very clear that you are \ninflicting tremendous personal and family harm on people who are in no \nposition to meet their obligations if you cease to provide them with \ntheir regular pay.\n  So I hope very much that we will stop this practice, cease this use \nof the Federal employees as pawns which has put them in a state of \nturmoil and apprehension. Let these dedicated people go back to work, \nlet them be paid, and let the citizens of the country receive the \nbenefits of the services that they are dedicated to providing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me first commend the Senator from \nMaryland for his comments.

Mr. President, this is a most unusual time that we are \nin. There are people in Washington who are now arguing about who are \nessential employees and who are nonessential employees. I think the \npeople of my State of Louisiana have already made a conclusion. After \nseeing the Congress over the last 24 days not able to keep the \nGovernment in working order, they have decided that the Congress is \nnonessential; that we are incapable of governing, that we are incapable \nof keeping the Government working.\n  I have been in Congress over 23 years now, and I have never been in a \nsituation like we are in today, and it is most unfortunate.\n  When people look to find who is to blame for this, I think there is, \nquite frankly, enough blame to go around for everybody. That is not \ngoing to get us out of this predicament. Deciding that it is the fault \nof the Republican Party or the Democratic Party is not going to solve \nthe problem.\n  My colleague on the Republican side, Senator Chafee, and I offered a \nproposal about 2 weeks ago now which was a compromise. It was \nsignificant in that it was not just two U.S. Senators but that it was \n14 who signed up in a bipartisan fashion to make a recommendation that \nwould have brought this stalemate of trying to reach a balanced budget \nto a conclusion.\n  That proposal said that there would be tax cuts, but the tax cuts \nwould be less than many Republicans would like to see. That proposal \nsaid, ``Yes, there were going to be reductions in Medicaid and \nMedicare,'' and more than many Democrats would like to see. But the \nbottom line is, that was the essence of an agreement, it was an \noutline, a blueprint of how balancing the budget in 7 years could be \nachieved.\n  It used CBO numbers and made recommendations that were tough on both \nsides. But it was an agreement. It was actual, real numbers on the size \nof a tax cut. It was actual, real numbers on the size of reductions in \nvarious programs that are going to have to see less money being made \navailable than in the past if we are going to balance the budget in 7 \nyears.\n  That was really the first bipartisan agreement that I have seen that \nhas been offered by Members of both parties as a way out of this mess. \nIt is very clear that a way out is not just to blame the other side. We \nare past that. The people in my State of Louisiana and people in many \nStates have come to the conclusion that something is basically wrong \nwhen people who are elected to govern can no longer govern, can no \nlonger keep the Government operating the way it should.\n  While we have done some things, I imagine when people read some of \nthe things we have done compared to what we have not been able to do, \nthey are going to scratch their heads in further amazement at the \ninability of the system to work as it was designed to work.\n  One of the things we did do, which I think is sort of ironic, is that \nthe Federal Government and the Senate did manage to pass one piece of \nbusiness, as this article of yesterday, January 1, points out. They \ngave final approval to a bill ensuring that the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization office in Washington would stay open. Without the \nlegislation, the PLO office would have closed.\n  If we can keep the PLO office open, how come we cannot keep nine \nDepartments of our own Government open?\n  If we can keep the Palestine Liberation Organization open and \noperating, why can we not keep the Department of Commerce working?\n  If we can keep the PLO office open, how come we cannot keep the \nEducation Department working?\n  If we can keep the PLO office open, how come we cannot keep open the \nHealth and Human Services Department?\n  Or if we can keep open the PLO office in Washington, how come we \ncannot find enough intelligent men and women \n\n[[Page S19331]]\nto come together to find a way to keep the Departments of Housing and \nJustice and Labor and State working?\n  So it really is a question of priorities, and I think that so many of \nus on both sides of the aisle have tried to offer suggestions and ideas \nabout what to do. As I mentioned, and I see the distinguished junior \nSenator from Virginia on the floor, and he joined with me and Senator \nChafee and 14 other Senators to offer a package of suggestions that \nwould have brought this stalemate to an end, would have opened up the \nnine departments, along with the PLO office that we were able to open, \nkeep it open and functioning.\n\n  I was talking to people over the recess here in Washington that are \nactually prohibited from going into the Department of Education. The \nguards at the desk have a list of who is essential, and if you are not \non the list you cannot even come to the building and work if you wanted \nto. You cannot volunteer to keep your job going to serve the people of \nthis country because Congress has not been able to come together. We \nhave come together to keep the PLO office open.\n  People are really wondering in amazement what has gone wrong in \nWashington. They are telling me ``Enough is enough. We have heard the \narguments, we have heard the blame game. Can't you folks get together \nand make it work? That is what we elected you for.'' There are some, \nparticularly in the other body, who make the argument we will keep the \npressure on the President by shutting down the Government and by \nshutting down the Government and making these people not be able to \nwork and not get paid while we keep the PLO office open--somehow that \nwill put pressure on the President to make compromises he might \notherwise not make. That has proved fruitless--24, 25 days now the \nGovernment has been partially closed.\n  I hope this evening in the negotiations with our team of negotiators \nand the Republican team and the President, who are supposed to meet at \n6 p.m, hopefully we can move toward an agreement. I hope somebody in \nthat meeting would pick up the Chafee-Breaux proposal along with the \nSenator from Virginia, Senator Robb, and say, is this not a pretty good \nstarting point, and throw that down on the table see if there is a way \nto split some of the differences and get an agreement.\n  I want to point out just for a minute or two the illogic of trying to \nsay that by shutting the Government down and hurting the Federal \nemployees and telling the people that we cannot govern that somehow \nthat will pressure the negotiators to come to an agreement. Mr. \nPresident, we are getting full salary. We are getting paid like it is a \nnormal day. We get $133,600 a year; the leadership gets a little bit \nmore than that, and they richly deserve it. As long as the Congress is \ncontinuing to get paid like nothing is happening, we are not going to \nhave any real pressure.\n  Senator Barbara Boxer from California offered a resolution to cut the \npay of Members of Congress several weeks ago. I said that is, maybe, \njust a little too extreme. That type of rhetoric is not really \nessential and really necessary. But as each day has passed I have come \nto the conclusion that she is right, that as long as we are getting \npaid for performing our duties--which I suggest we are not performing \nas we should--there is not a lot of pressure for us to make the real \ncompromises that are essential to get the job done.\n  I was amazed by an article which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record from the Washington Post of Tuesday, January 2, \n1996, entitled, ``Don't Touch Our Pay, House Republicans Say.'' ``Hill \nChecks Protected During Budget Fight.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 2, 1996]\n\n               Don't Touch Our Pay, House Republicans Say\n\n\n               hill checks protected during budget fight\n\n                           (By Larry Marasak)\n\n       House Republicans have offered an abundance of proposals in \n     their drive for a balanced budget agreement, but giving up \n     their paychecks apparently isn't one of them.\n       While the partial government closure will leave some \n     760,000 federal workers with pruned paychecks, House GOP \n     leaders repeatedly have rebuffed attempts to halt \n     congressional pay during a shutdown.\n       House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (Tex.), the third-ranking \n     House Republican, offered these reasons for the opposition in \n     a recent CNN appearance: Balancing the budget ``has nothing \n     to do with our pay''; Democrats were ``demagoguing'' the \n     issue by trying to change the subject from a balanced budget; \n     and, as a member of Congress, he was a ``constitutional \n     officer,'' not a federal employee.\n       Rank and file House lawmakers--Republican and Democrat \n     alike--are paid $133,600; Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) gets \n     $171,500; Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.) gets \n     $148,400, as does Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-\n     Mo.).\n       Although some federal employees make more than $100,000 a \n     year, the norm is the same as ``most working Americans, the \n     majority of whom live paycheck to paycheck,'' said John \n     Koskinen, deputy director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget.\n       President Clinton, who makes $200,000 a year, has not given \n     up his pay, though his aides have said for days that his \n     staff was researching whether forsaking his salary would be \n     constitutional.\n       Three times, the Senate uanimously approved language that \n     would decree--during a full or partial shutdown--that no \n     paychecks go out to the 435 House members, the 100 senators \n     or the president.\n       Five times, Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he tried \n     to get the House to consider the proposal and was rebuffed by \n     Republicans--especially in the leadership-controlled Rules \n     Committee.\n       ``I think the Republican leadership is very two-faced,'' \n     said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the chief Senate sponsor \n     of the legislation. ``They want federal employees and \n     contractors [serving the government] to sacrifice themselves \n     on the altar of their balanced budget plan, but are not \n     willing to sacrifice themselves on that altar.''\n       ``It's cowardice on their part for them to put the \n     paychecks of a lot of innocent people on the line and refuse \n     to put their own paychecks on the line,'' Durbin said.\n       In addition to Durbin's rejection in the Rules Committee--\n     the gatekeeper panel that decides which bills and amendments \n     go to the floor--the Boxer proposal was deleted by a House-\n     Senate conference from legislation to abolish the Interstate \n     Commerce Commission.\n       When DeLay was asked on CNN's ``Talk Back Live'' on Dec. 19 \n     whether he would support congressional pay cuts during a \n     shutdown, he told the audience participation show: ``No, I \n     would not, I am not a federal employee. I am a constitutional \n     officer. My job is in the Constitution of the United States.\n       ``I am not a government employee. I am in the \n     Constitution.''\n       Boxer has introduced another version of the legislation to \n     answer congressional critics who said stopping their pay \n     could treat members of Congress more harshly than other \n     federal workers. The latest bill would treat lawmakers the \n     same as the most adversely affected federal employee.\n       ``If they lost a week's pay we would lose a week's pay,'' \n     Boxer said. ``If their pay was delayed, our pay would be \n     delayed.''\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Some of the quotes are absolutely amazing, from some of \nour Republican colleagues: ``Balancing the budget has nothing to do \nwith our pay.''\n  A further comment was, ``As a Member of Congress this Member was a \nconstitutional officer, not a Federal employee.''\n  Three times the Senate has passed unanimously language that would, \nduring a full or partial shutdown of our Government, say that no \npaychecks would go out to the 435 Members of the House and the 100 \nMembers of the Senate. Five times they tried to enact that same \nlegislation in the House. Each time they were prevented from bringing \nit up. When this particular Member was asked about whether they would \nsupport this congressional pay provision, they said ``No, I will not. I \nam not a Federal employee. I am a constitutional officer. My job is in \nthe Constitution of the United States. I am not a Government employee. \nI am in the Constitution.''\n  Mr. President, I think people back home have had enough. They have \nhad enough of people who grandstand, of people who play the blame game, \nand people in the Congress who say they are better than anyone else. We \nare getting full salary and let the rest of the people suffer because \nwe want to make a point.\n  I think it is time to come to insist on rather drastic action. I \nsupport the efforts of Senator Boxer. I think she was right on target. \nShe was early and ahead in the game in offering something that I \nguarantee will make a difference.\n  If we had our pay cut today, can you imagine how many Members would \nbe back in Washington, no matter where they might be in the world or in \ntheir respective States. No matter how many times flights would change \nand schedules would change, Members would be \n\n[[Page S19332]]\nrushing back to Washington to say, do you know something, we are not \ngetting paid, we better get back and fix the problem. There is not \ngoing to be any pressure that anybody can put on anybody in the \nCongress like saying we are not going to get paid when we cannot make \nthe Government work. To some of us that is our only income. It will \nmake one heck of a big difference.\n  I thought it was pretty much high rhetoric when initially offered. I \ncannot think of anything else to do. We got together with a bipartisan \ngroup. We offered a bipartisan suggestion. This is a blueprint or an \noutline. It has not worked. It still has not made the progress that I \nthink is essential.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that when, as I understand it, we have to \nhave another continuing resolution that is going to be offered, I think \nmaybe tomorrow sometime, because there is a continuing resolution to \nensure that foster care payments and AFDC payments and veteran payments \nand Medicare payments would have to be made, that at that time if we \nhave not reached some kind of a framework of an agreement, I will \nattempt to offer once again a suggestion, and part of that legislation, \nan amendment to that continuing resolution which will say Members of \nCongress shall be treated in the same manner as the basic pay of the \nmost adversely affected Federal employees who are not going to be \ncompensated during the shutdown period.\n  Mr. President, we cannot be treated better than the people that we \nare responsible for their jobs. I guarantee that if that amendment \npasses there will be a rush back to Washington by Members of both \nparties who will come to Washington, roll up our sleeves, and stay here \nand not leave until we get the job done. That may be the only way I \nthink that we are going to push ourselves into making a proper \ncompromise that is absolutely essential and necessary.\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I have been listening to our colleagues this \nmorning and I was not initially planning to say anything but with my \ndistinguished senior colleague in the chair at this particular moment I \nknow that I reflect his views in what I say, and what I say is that the \ncontinuing shutdown of the Federal Government and the impact it is \nhaving on not only Federal employees--and in most cases it is the most \nvulnerable and the least able to withstand this kind of treatment--but \nthe impact it is having on many, many others who are directly or \nindirectly affected by the Federal Government or by the activities of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, the continuation, indeed, the extent, indeed, the fact \nthat we are having a shutdown at all, is unconscionable. I think that \nit makes no sense, no sense for either side, no sense for anyone who is \ninvolved in this particular debate, to see this protracted shutdown, \nthe protracted demeaning, demoralizing impact on so many of our \ncitizens continue.\n  I recognize that the feelings on both sides are very deeply felt. I \nrecognize that there are important philosophical differences that are \nbeing debated, and indeed I have been very much supportive of the basic \nthrust of those who want to achieve more fiscal discipline. As the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, during the time I served as \nGovernor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, one of the things I was most \noften identified with was fiscal responsibility and making certain that \nwe acted within our means. I have voted for, on several occasions, a 7-\nyear balanced budget using CBO numbers. I think there is general \nagreement on both sides that we are going to come up with such a \nbudget, hopefully in the near term, although some of the philosophical \ndifferences are very, very deep and may not be resolved but we should \nnot ask those who are most vulnerable to continue to bear the brunt of \nthis shutdown.\n  Again, I am not speaking just of the 200,000-some Federal employees, \nmany of whom reside in the State that the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and I represent, but all over the country, but so many others \ndependent on the effective operation of our Government. A huge number \nof citizens are uncertain whether they will be able to make their \npayments. For some, it will be a very basic decision as to whether or \nnot they will be able to purchase food, medicine, what have you, the \nnext time around, because they live from paycheck to paycheck. Others \nhave mortgages, they have rent payments, they have car payments, they \nhave all kinds of tuition payments, everything that you can imagine. \nMany things that we cannot imagine.\n  I have been in the last few days here at the Capitol, listening to \nstories of individuals who have been enormously inconvenienced by this \ncontinued shutdown. I appeal to the leadership on both sides. I believe \nin the Senate that there is virtual unanimous agreement that this \nshutdown should not continue. Indeed, the Senate has attempted on \nseveral occasions to pass some legislation that would keep the \nGovernment functioning.\n  But I appeal to those who are in a position to make decisions at this \ntime to move forward, to not let this continue. Do not let this \ndebilitating shutdown, which is so unconscionable, continue, and to put \nthe people we are asking to provide Government services back to work, \nto stop the complete inefficiency and the waste of taxpayer dollars, \nand then to get on to the serious business of negotiating some very \nreal differences that I acknowledge.\n  Mr. President, I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia leaves the floor, I wish to express my appreciation to him for \nthe references he made about me while I was the Presiding Officer. I \nknow that my fellow Senator from Virginia has worked very diligently on \nthe question of trying to resolve this budget impasse.\n  But, Mr. President, I would also like to suggest in his very careful \ncomments about the Federal employees, which I do share, we should also \nbring to the attention of the Senate the severe suffering that has been \nplaced upon the Nation's Capital, the Greater Metropolitan Washington \narea, composed of the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland, \nbecause this area not only houses the Federal Government in large \nmeasure, but it also houses so many of the private organizations and \ninstitutions that have, as a consequence of this shutdown, been closed. \nThat is bringing about a severe financial crisis here in the Nation's \nCapital because, as my distinguished colleague knows, tourism is one of \nthe major sources of income in this region. The Commonwealth of \nVirginia, together with Maryland, provides the facilities for so many \nof these tourists to stay for whatever period, overnight, or, hopefully \nseveral days. It provides the meals and quality of life. That industry \nis virtually at a standstill.\n  So the distinguished colleague of mine from Virginia, and I, together \nwith those colleagues from Maryland, have a very special desire to see \nthat the Government returns to work.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask my distinguished senior colleague to \nyield for a comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. ROBB. Let me join with my colleague and say I fully understand \nthe point he was making. Indeed, perhaps less eloquently, I tried to \nmake the same point. But it is not just in the Nation's Capital. It is \nnot just in our Commonwealth of Virginia. I think people would expect \nit of us, representing a disproportionate number of those who are \ndirectly affected, but it is all over this country and indeed all over \nthe world in terms of Federal employees and people who depend on the \nFederal Government. Many of those small businesses, people who depend \non the national parks and other facilities for their living, when those \nparks are shut down, when those visitor attractions are shut down all \nover this country, small business men and women who make their living \nbeing accessible to \n\n[[Page S19333]]\nthose who come to those institutions are going through the same kind of \na shutdown. They do not have any guarantee. Indeed, they are not going \nto be paid back whatever they lose after the shutdown is over. That is \nwhy this makes so little sense.\n  If everybody who has been laid off or furloughed in this process is \ngoing to be ultimately made whole, it is an enormous waste of taxpayer \ndollars. But those individuals after the inconvenience and the trauma, \nin many cases, of not being able to pay their bills on time, are going \nto be made whole. Many others, who are directly related to those, are \nnot going to be made whole. The impact is a little bit like a cancer. \nIt is corrosive and it continues. And I thank my senior colleague for \nyielding on that particular point. It is clearly important to those of \nus who represent the States contiguous to our Nation's Capital, but \nit affects everyone throughout this country and many, many small \nbusinesses and others who are simply not on anybody's radar screen are \nwondering right now whether or not they are going to make it.\n\n  With that I thank the Chair and I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank again my distinguished junior \ncolleague. A day or so ago, as a matter of fact I think it was on \nSaturday, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, together with \nothers, passed legislation here in the Senate to enable the military to \nreceive their pay raise, which was in the defense authorization bill. \nMy distinguished colleague and I, since we both serve on the Armed \nServices Committee together with the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom Idaho, recognize that there was at least some recognition of the \nurgency to move on with this.\n  I would like to add also, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for his kind remarks about the \nmajority leader today, Senator Dole. Indeed, the leadership of the \nSenate, I think, has been working diligently to bring this impasse to \nresolve.\n  I am very pleased to hear this morning, by and large, constructive \ncomments about this problem. I think it is not in the interests of the \nSenate, indeed the Congress as a whole, to have a blame game going on, \nsort of passing the football back and forth to each other as to who is \nat fault. It seems to me certainly America saw this weekend, over a \nperiod of 72 hours, enough football, some 12 magnificent games played \nacross our Nation. I think it is time for the Congress to recognize \nmaybe we better put the football of blame on the 50-yard-line and blow \na timeout so the President, together with the distinguished majority \nleader, Mr. Dole, and others can work with the leadership of this \ninstitution, the Congress of the United States, again, today, to try to \nresolve this problem.\n  I am going to be joining with the distinguished majority leader, Mr. \nDole, on a continuing resolution which I hope will be offered at the \nearliest opportunity, and that will provide the restoration of the pay \nand full benefits for a period of time here, into January, such that \nthese negotiations can continue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Mr. President, without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the Senator from Virginia for that statement. \nI know how hard he has been working at this issue. I think it is very \nimportant that we pass a clean continuing resolution.\n  People should be put back to work and they should be paid. If you \nbring them in but do not pay them, you still are creating a financial \ncrisis in their lives. I know the Senator is most sensitive to what \npeople are going through and I appreciate his efforts.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Maryland. We have worked \ntogether these many years in this Chamber on behalf of the Greater \nMetropolitan Washington area. I listened very carefully, as I was \nprivileged to preside this morning, to his comments, and particularly \nthe reference to the hardship being thrust upon the innocent persons, \nsome 500,000 who are basically working without pay, and another 260,000 \nremaining at home, in all close to 800,000 individuals. They are indeed \nhostages. I am hopeful with this CR we can stop that at the earliest \npossible time and restore them to work. And, in a sense, restore \nAmerica's confidence in the ability of the Congress of the United \nStates to work with the President to resolve such problems.\n  No Senator feels more strongly about the balanced budget and the 7-\nyear stipulated timeframe within which to resolve this problem than the \nSenator from Virginia. Indeed, I would say both Senators from Virginia \nhave stood steadfast on that principle.\n  As my colleague from Maryland stated this morning, and, indeed the \nSenator from Virginia, who has taken a very active role in negotiations \nwith a group of Senators over here on, should we say, a third \nproposal--neither the President's nor that being pursued primarily by \nthe leadership of the House and Senate--this third proposal, all of \nthose have to be melded together to see what we can do.\n\n  With the majority of both the House and the Senate under the control \nof the Republican Party, America put that power into the hands of the \nRepublicans, such that we have the responsibility to redirect, in a \nmajor way, the course on which this Nation has been embarked for so \nmany years, and such a tragic deficit that is being rolled up each year \ntogether with a mounting national debt now at some $5 trillion.\n  I commend my colleagues who are working on this situation. I am very \nhopeful we can resolve it here in the near future and that, today, we \ncan pass, or at the earliest tomorrow, given that the House of \nRepresentatives, as I understand it, although subject to call is not in \nsession today--that we can put a stop to the question of the Federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, I see on the floor the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska who, likewise, has been a tower of strength with respect to the \nFederal employees all through these many years that I have been \nprivileged to serve with him in the Senate.\n  Therefore, I ask, at the request of the majority leader, unanimous \nconsent that the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the \nChair, following a period for the remarks by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19332-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19333-S19336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I had hoped to stay in Alaska. I have \nbeen in Alaska and had a very interesting visit. I intended to spend \nthe rest of the week, but due to a call I received from my good friend \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, I have returned so I can confer with \nhim about matters on the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  I have come to the floor today to talk a little bit about this \nshutdown. I think there have been some statements in the press, \nunfortunately, made without knowledge of the past history of these \nlapses in appropriations.\n  For those Members who are interested, I have spoken on the floor \nbefore about the work of James P. McGrath, who is the analyst in \nAmerican national government, in the Government division of the \nCongressional Research Service. He has issued a series of bulletins on \nthis whole subject of lapses in appropriations and the shutdown of the \nFederal Government and the effects on the Federal work force.\n  I find it very interesting. It has been pointed out in his report \nthat from fiscal year 1962 to fiscal year 1981, in the 2 decades \npreceding the opinion of Attorney General Civiletti, who was President \nCarter's Attorney General, that the General Accounting Office found \ninterruptions in agency fundings took place 32 times. Mr. McGrath \nreports that,\n\n       Such lapses appear to be the rule, rather than the \n     exception, according to GAO, which noted that from 1961 to \n     1980, ``85 percent of appropriations bills for Federal \n     agencies have passed after the start of the fiscal year.''\n\n  The reason we now have a different circumstance is that in a landmark \nopinion in 1980, just prior to leaving office, Attorney General \nCiviletti issued an opinion concerning the Anti-deficiency Act, and Mr. \nMcGrath's report states that ``Prior to that landmark 1980 decision, \nFederal agency managers, while cognizant of the anomaly of continuing \nto operate during a lapse \n\n[[Page S19334]]\nof appropriations, and while concerned about the legal implications \nthereof, did precisely that.'' I am still quoting from this report:\n\n       They did so under the belief that ``Congress does not \n     actually intend that the Federal Government shut down while \n     the agencies wait for enactment of appropriations or the \n     passage of a continuing resolution.''\n\n  Now, what has changed? In 1981, as I said, the Attorney General \nissued this opinion. The problem that we have now is that \nnotwithstanding the substantial interruptions of the past--and, Mr. \nPresident, let me clear that up, too, while I am at it, because we have \na very good chart that has been made by the CRS, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it appear in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. In fiscal year 1978, which was really the calendar year \n1977, Congress had a lapse from the 30th of September until the 13th of \nOctober, the next lapse was from the 31st of October until the 9th of \nNovember, and the next one from the 30th of November through the 9th of \nDecember.\n  In other words, Mr. President, in 1977, during the term of President \nCarter, there were three lapses, substantial lapses. In 1978, for \nfiscal year 1979, again there was a substantial lapse, from September \n30 until October 18. As a matter of fact, lapses as we have indicated \nhave been the rule rather than the exception. The difference is this \nyear we have the great problem of the fact that the President has \nvetoed five bills, five appropriations bills, a continuing resolution, \nand the debt ceiling and has decided to put pressure on the Congress by \nsending people home. I find that very unfortunate, and I think it is \nharming a lot of people, people who do live from paycheck to paycheck, \nas Senator Dole has said, people who really need their income.\n  They are people who work on an annual salary basis, Mr. President. \nThey are people who are going to get paid anyway. They have been paid--\nno Congress has ever failed to pay an employee who is subject to a \nlapse in appropriations, and both leaders have said this is not going \nto happen this time. Why in the world should we send them home? Why \ndoes the President send them home?\n  I take the position that there is no nonessential Federal employee. \nIf they are not essential, they should not be on the payroll to start \nwith. And we are looking at the opinion of an Attorney General in \ninterpreting the problem of the Antideficiency Act, and that is why we \nare all in this situation.\n  I believe that we should all, the President and the Congress, get \ntogether and agree that what Congress did before the Civiletti opinion \nwas right. Congress presumed, the managers presumed that Government \nwould go on, that employees would be paid, and in fact they were paid. \nThis President has taken the unprecedented action of borrowing from the \ntrust funds of the Federal retirement plans. As chairman of that \ncommittee, I am going to make a report one of these days as to what \nactually happened in terms of that. But we have not reached the point \nwhere we have a crisis in Government due to the failure to have funds \nto operate. Everybody knows that. We have not reached the point where \nthe debt ceiling act is really putting the pressure on the President to \ndo what he has done. As a matter of fact, in my judgment, it is not \nsomething the President alone should bear. The Congress bears some of \nthe responsibility here, too. And we have to find a way to put these \npeople back to work.\n  They are people who live as I used to live when I worked in the \nDepartment of Interior years ago with a family of five small children. \nWe could not have gone from one paycheck period to another paycheck \nperiod without having some help.\n  This is a most unfortunate situation for Government employees. I have \nbeen chairman of the subcommittee on Government employees in Federal \nservice this year, and I was before for 7 years. I have served on it \nnow for a very long time in the Senate. But I say to the Senate and to \nthe Congress and to the President, these people are public servants. \nThey have been employed to work for the Government. They have not done \nanything wrong. They are going to be paid when this is all over. There \nis no reason for them not to be called back to work.\n\n  I say that as strongly as I can. There is no reason for these people \nnot to be called back to work. It is absolutely essential that we end \nthis situation where the only pressure between the Congress and the \nPresident is being felt down at the level of the employee who cannot \nwork or cannot exist without his or her paycheck every pay period. That \nis something we must face up to. It is, in my judgment, a sad, sad \nfollow-on to the opinion of the Attorney General that I mentioned that \nwas issued in 1980.\n  There has been one other thing brought to my attention this morning, \nMr. President, and I thank Liz Connell of my office for bringing this \nto my attention, and Phil Baker-Shenk of the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee. The two of them this morning have mentioned that the lack of \nthe continuing resolution means the Interior appropriations bill has \nnot been passed. By the way, we hope that bill will be sent back to the \nPresident again. It is one of the ones he vetoed. But the lack of \nfunding for the Interior Department is now going to have a substantial \nimpact on American Indians and Alaska Natives. Native American self-\ndetermination contracts and self-governance compacts operate, Mr. \nPresident, on a calendar-year basis. That is the reason that until now \nit has not been a matter of great concern. Until December 31, the funds \non which the tribal organizations operated these programs were there. \nBeginning today, however, these organizations have no money to operate \nor to pay employees.\n  This is the situation where Congress, under what is known as Public \nLaw 93-638, authorized the BIA and the IHS to contract with Indian and \nNative organizations to run the entities that assist our aboriginal \npeople in this country. The organizations receive funds under contracts \nor compacts with the BIA and the IHS. As of December 31, those funds \nexpired.\n  The great problem now is--and we need to get rulings from the BIA and \nthe IHS on this, I believe--we do not believe they are Government \ncontractors in the usual sense. As far as I am aware, no backpay \npromise has been extended to Federal contractors like building security \nguards or truck drivers. But tribal contracts and compacts have been \nunderstood by law to be different from Federal procurement contracts, \nbecause tribes stand in the shoes of the Federal agency, assuming \nresponsibilities for activities and programs formerly carried out by \nthe Federal Government for the tribes. Tribal contracts and compacts \nhave also been considered to be different from Federal privatizing \ncontracts because the tribal contracts and compacts maintain and \nenhance the ongoing government-to-government relationship between \ntribes and the United States.\n  These people are people who are carrying out the work of Government \nin connection with the organizations that assist American Indians and \nNatives. For instance, child care, job training, and provision of \nhealth care services--programs that do not flow through the normal \nprocess of the Health and Human Services appropriations--come through \nthe Interior appropriations bills to the BIA and IHS, and then go out \nto these agencies that conduct programs for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives.\n  The BIA and the IHS apparently have no solution to how we are going \nto get money to these contract entities that actually hire the people \nwho are doing this work, which is essential. If these people were still \non the Federal payroll, they would have been deemed essential by the \nbills we passed before the end of the year. Now, I do want everyone to \nbe aware of the fact that their phones are going to ring off the hook \nif they live in areas that have American Indians or Native populations, \nbecause they are going to wake up to the fact today that the moneys to \nrun their contract entities and their contracting operations expired on \nDecember 31, 1995. To make matters worse, there is currently no \nprovision for employee back pay or operating expenses for these 638 \ncontractors.\n  That is another reason I am on the floor. It is another reason I have \ncome back from Alaska, to try to find a solution. Many, many Alaska \nNatives are employed by or receive funds that they \n\n[[Page S19335]]\nare entitled to through the 638 contractors who are in fact Alaska \nNative organizations.\n  Mr. President, I am quite hopeful that we can find a way to deal with \nthis. I wish to assure my friends from Virginia, I heard what they \nsaid. I hope that we would work together in good faith to find some way \naround this. But it is not a one-sided thing to me.\n  I would say to the Senator from Virginia that when I was home I \ntalked to many, many people who are being affected by this inaction of \nCongress.\n  Not one of them asked me to come back here and try to change the \ncourse that we are on. They asked me to come back here and find out why \nCongress and the administration--together--have allowed this hiatus to \ndevelop as far as Federal employees being on the job. They are going to \nbe paid anyway.\n  I am sure the Senator from Virginia has heard the same concerns from \nhis constituents that I have heard from mine. Not one of them has \nfailed to ask me, ``Why aren't you letting those people work if you are \ngoing to pay them?''\n  I believe this problem has come about because of our failure to \nrecognize that Civiletti's opinion was wrong. The President and the \nCongress, prior to Civiletti's opinion, assumed that we did not intend \nthis stupid result and, therefore, it did not take place.\n  We have to find some way to reverse the Civiletti opinion, and that \nis what the bill that the distinguished Senator from Virginia and I \ncosponsored and was offered by Senator Dole does. I am hopeful the \nHouse will pass that bill. At least it will take care of a portion of \nthe problem we face and certainly is something that must be done very \nsoon.\n  It will not, unfortunately, take care of the problem I mentioned \nabout Indians and Alaska Natives. That is something that comes because \nof a failure to have a continuing resolution for the Interior \nappropriations bill and is something that must be addressed rather \nquickly, because, there again, some of the most indigent people in this \ncountry are American Indians and Alaska Natives. They should not be \nhung out to dry because of this battle between the executive branch and \nthe Congress, in which I support the congressional position, as I am \nsure the Senator from Virginia does, but it is our job to find a \nsolution to eliminate this hiatus.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          TABLE 2.--APPROPRIATIONS FUNDING GAPS: FISCAL YEARS 1977-1995                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Fiscal year                Date gap commenced \\1\\    Full day(s) of gaps    Date gap terminated \\2\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1977.................................

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nin morning business 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not dispute what my distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska said. When I made reference to the need to \nrecognize that there is an entirely added class of individuals that is \nsuffering as a consequence of this shutdown, they are not Federal \nemployees. It is the infrastructure in the greater Metropolitan \nWashington area, primarily Virginia, of persons being affected by this \nshutdown and losing in the same manner as others, and there is no \nrestitution in sight for them.\n  Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the assurances that the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, \nhas given this Senator and others from time to time about restitution \nof pay to Federal employees. But there is no restitution that is going \nto the infrastructure of hotelkeepers and innkeepers and all others who \nare trying to work their way through this crisis at a time when \nCongress has not been able thus far to resolve the problem with the \nPresident.\n  Again, I strongly believe that we have to cool the rhetoric in \nCongress and, as I said earlier, do the best we can to give support to \nour leadership on this side of the aisle and that side of the aisle, to \nwork with the President to resolve this thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nassurances to which I referred earlier in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                December 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: During the last furlough of government \n     employees, you and Speaker Gingrich signed a letter \n     indicating your commitment to retroactively restoring any \n     lost wages, which was done after the last Continuing \n     Resolution was passed.\n       As we are now in another shutdown, and even closer to \n     Christmas, I would appreciate it if you would once again \n     indicate your position in writing. Even though the number of \n     furloughed employees has dropped since last time, it is at \n     least as disruptive to those who are not now at work. Your \n     letter was a morale booster during the last furlough, and my \n     furloughed constituents need all the positive influences \n     possible now.\n       As was the case before, I stand ready to assist you in any \n     way to resolve this latest shutdown, and I appreciate your \n     concern for our federal employees.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                                December 20, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate\n\n     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,\n     Hon. Constance A. Morella,\n     Hon. Tom Davis,\n     U.S. House of Representatives.\n       Dear Colleagues: Because of your interest in the ongoing \n     budget negotiations and your strong support for federal \n     employees, we wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm our \n     letter of November 10, 1995, in which we made clear that \n     employees furloughed through no fault of their own should not \n     be punished.\n       It is unfortunate that President Clinton has chosen to veto \n     appropriations bills that would have funded the salaries of \n     federal employees at the Departments of Justice, State, \n     Commerce, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban \n     Development, as well as independent agencies such as the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. Similarly, procedural \n     objections by Democrats have prevented the funding of \n     salaries at the Department of Labor, HHS and Education.\n       The direct result of those actions is that furloughed \n     federal employees at those particular agencies cannot be \n     paid. However, we would like to reaffirm our commitment to \n     restoring any lost wages for federal employees in a \n     subsequent funding bill.\n       Thank you for your continued and strong leadership on \n     behalf of federal workers.\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker of the House.\n     Bob Dole,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Governor George Allen Calls on President, Congress To Stay at Work \n                           Until Job Is Done\n\n\n              Balanced Budget Critical to Economic Health\n\n       Richmond.--Governor George Allen today said that Congress \n     and the President should work until they can reach a balanced \n     budget agreement to balance the budget in seven years. The \n     following is the Governor's statement:\n       ``Today, for the second time in as many months, nearly a \n     quarter of a million federal workers--many of whom live in \n     Virginia--are on furlough. For the sake of these workers--and \n     all Americans--it's time to put an \n\n[[Page S19336]]\n     end to the merry-go-round and complete the work on an honest bill that \n     will balance the federal budget.\n       ``It would be cruel for President Clinton and Congress to \n     go off to enjoy their holidays with the budget still \n     unresolved and folks left wondering when and if they are \n     going to be furloughed again.\n       ``But the worst cruelty is the price all Americans will pay \n     if Washington fails to complete the long-awaited agreement to \n     put us on the path to a seven-year balanced budget. A \n     balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages, \n     automobiles, student loans, and even the interest paid by \n     states and localities ($548 million debt service savings for \n     Virginia alone; $75 million for Norfolk and $42 million for \n     Virginia Beach). It means we stop piling more debt onto our \n     children and grandchildren (a child born this year \n     immediately inherits a lifetime tax bill of $187,150 to pay \n     interest on the national debt).\n       ``The Republican Congress made a good start with the Seven-\n     Year Balanced Budget Act that the President vetoed. It was a \n     tough bill that got the job done, and in the process \n     overhauled the failed welfare system, provided critical tax \n     relief to working Americans, and freed states from \n     Washington's Medicaid mandates that have been threatening to \n     bankrupt us.\n       ``It is past time for the President to come to the table \n     with an honest budget proposal. And it is essential that any \n     agreement reached not just shift costs to the states, as \n     would the per capita cap on Medicaid the President has \n     proposed. The states can make the most of scarce federal \n     dollars only if they have real freedom, and real flexibility \n     as provided in the new MediGrant program in the Seven Year \n     Balanced Budget Act.\n       ``Virginia and virtually every other state passes and lives \n     within a balanced budget year after year--I submitted another \n     balanced budget just yesterday. It's been 27 years since we \n     saw a balanced budget from Washington. Roll up your sleeves, \n     stay at work, and get the job done!''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n               Government Shutdown Affecting Contractors\n\n       Impact of Shutdown will be felt by Contractors. Federal \n     employees are not the only group that will be effected by a \n     shutdown. Thousands of companies which are federal \n     contractors will be impacted the same, if not more, due to \n     the uncertainty, inconsistency, and risk.\n       Shutdown/Startup is Costly to Government. Shuting down a \n     contract for a few days and restarting the function adds cost \n     to the government. Government laws require that contractors \n     divide all their costs evenly among all government contracts. \n     If there are changes in the indirect costs and overhead \n     rates, which will occur if employees cannot be directly \n     charged to a contract for a day's work, those costs will be \n     spread across all government contracts. Even a 1 day shutdown \n     can alter rates for the entire year.\n       Payments to Companies may be Delayed or Not Paid. For-\n     profit companies depend on revenues for services rendered, in \n     order to remain in business and continue employing \n     individuals. A company who performs for the government during \n     a shutdown runs the risk of not being paid or having to wait \n     for payment beyond the time when accounts payable are due. \n     For example, employees are paid on a set schedule and \n     subcontractors require payment in a timely manner. Even if \n     the government does not pay or delays payment, the accounts \n     payable still must be made. This disruption cuts into \n     operating funds and potentially profits, negatively affecting \n     the financial health of the company.\n       Private Companies may have to Layoff Employees. Many \n     companies working as contractors to the federal government \n     operate on very small profit margins (2%-4%) and their \n     overhead rates remain very low in order to stay competitive. \n     These companies cannot afford to carry employees for an \n     extended period of time who are not directly billable to a \n     contract, because those expenses go into the overhead rate. \n     Therefore, if a shutdown occurs private sector employees may \n     be laid off, because a company cannot afford to keep idle \n     employees on the payroll.\n       Delays in New Systems, New Solutions will Occur. The \n     mission-critical systems that are a priority to move to \n     completion will be halted and deadlines slip, if the \n     government shuts down. Congress and agencies have priority \n     projects such as new intelligence tools or peacekeeping \n     systems or critical databases that are expected to be \n     delivered in a short deadline. If the government stops \n     working, federal employees are requiring contractors, in many \n     cases, to stop working as well. This puts a hold on project \n     completion.\n       Claims and Disputes Likely will Result from \n     Inconsistencies. Federal contracts have a system whereby \n     contract claims or disputes can be adjudicated. This system \n     could be overloaded with cases of inconsistent or \n     inappropriate handling of contracts, due to a shutdown. The \n     result of increased case loads is greater operating costs to \n     the government, unanticipated payments for settlements in \n     future years, and loss of productivity for employees spending \n     time on the case.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator did not intend to end my \ncomments, did he?\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I again \nmake this request that the Senate stand in recess subject to the call \nof the Chair following the conclusion of the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska and the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, which I understand will be 5 minutes, the Senator \nfrom Iowa having been on the floor earlier and was unable to obtain \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object. I hope I am not held to \nabsolutely 5 minutes. I would like to have a little leeway. I do not \nthink I will go for 10 minutes, but it will be less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair has been instructed by the majority leader to \ntry and contain the remarks of Senators on both sides of the aisle to 5 \nminutes. Should we say 7, in compromise, for the Senator from Iowa, \nwhich will follow the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19336-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT THROUGHOUT COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intended to close following the \nstatement of my good friend from Virginia. I want the Record to show \nthe District of Columbia is not the only place that relies \nsubstantially upon the income of Federal employees or the activities of \nthe Federal Government. There is substantial impact throughout the \ncountry. Even my own city of Anchorage had an impact because of the \nshutdown.\n  The difficulty I have with coming here today is that I do not think \nmost Members nor the executive branch have thought over the \nconsequences of Attorney General Civiletti's opinion.\n  It is my judgment, and I say this advisedly as the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee now, that we should join together and \nfind a way to legislate permanently so that this kind of a situation \ndoes not continue to occur. I think the taxpayers have every right to \nbe very, very irate over the fact that we will pay a substantial number \nof people for not working, and those people who have been sent home as \nbeing nonessential Federal employees are chagrined over that decision \nof their superiors. They, too, take the position that their job is \nessential and that they should be paid.\n  I believe it is absolutely essential that we not send Federal \nemployees home in the belief that somehow or another pressure will be \ncreated on one branch of government or the other as a result of these \npeople not being allowed to do their work. The real pressure ultimately \ncomes on the taxpayer who is paying for work that is not done, and I \nthink it is our job to change that. I hope the Congress will do \nsomething this week about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19336-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19336-S19337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE 18TH DAY OF SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are in the 18th day of a partial \nGovernment shutdown, the longest in our history. The Senator from \nAlaska just said the taxpayers ought to be irate. They should be \nirate--all taxpayers--because it is not just the more than 700,000 \nFederal employees who are either working and not getting paid, or are \nstaying home and not getting paid, but who know they will be paid some \ntime in the future who are being affected. The fact is, this shutdown \nis estimated to cost taxpayers $40 million a day.\n  Mr. President, 18 days, that is $720 million. We are approaching $1 \nbillion that this unnecessary shutdown has cost the taxpayers of this \ncountry, and yet those who prolong it fancy themselves as fiscal \nconservatives. They are willing to throw the taxpayers' money away by \nshutting down the Federal Government.\n  Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, has offered time and time \nagain a clean continuing resolution that would continue the Government \noperations to a date certain. This would put these Federal workers back \nto \n\n[[Page S19337]]\nwork and end the waste, yet that has been turned down time and time and \ntime again by the Republican side. All we've asked is to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution, keep the Government operating to a date certain \nand we do not care what that date is. We can do it once a week or \nsomething similar, but at least get these people back to work and stop \nthe $40 million a day waste of taxpayer money.\n  I forget how many times Senator Daschle has tried to offer that or \nhas offered it here and has been turned down. More than 10 times, I \nbelieve.\n  So we have tried on this side of the aisle to save the taxpayers this \n$40 million a day and to try to have some compassion and understanding \ntoward Federal Government workers who have to make their house payments \nand their car payments and pay their doctor bills and everything else. \nYet they are not getting their paychecks. Oh, they will get it some \ntime in the future, but how do they make those payments right now? And \nto have done it over the Christmas season to me is just being \nhardhearted at its worst.\n  However, Mr. President, one group stands above it all: Members of \nCongress. Unlike Federal workers, our pay is guaranteed no matter what \nhappens. Senator Boxer from California and I have offered on a number \nof occasions a bill that says that Members of Congress should not be \ntreated differently, they should be treated like other Federal workers. \nIt has passed three times in the Senate. Yet, it always seems to die \nsomeplace in conference or in the House of Representatives.\n  Here is an article that appeared in the Washington Post just today. \nThe headline is: ``Don't Touch Our Pay, House Republicans Say.''\n  The article goes on to say that the House majority whip, Tom DeLay of \nTexas, the third ranking House Republican, said that ``I'm not a \nGovernment employee. I'm in the Constitution,'' when he was asked about \nthis bill that says that we should be treated like other Federal \nemployees.\n  On CNN's ``Talk Back Live'' on December 19, asked whether he would \nsupport congressional pay cuts during a shutdown, he told the audience \nparticipation show: ``No, I would not. I'm not a Federal employee. I'm \na constitutional officer. My job is in the Constitution of the United \nStates. I am not a Government employee. I am in the Constitution.'' \nThat statement was made by House majority whip Congressman DeLay. Talk \nabout the arrogance of power. I ask the House majority whip, who signs \nhis paycheck? Is it signed by the U.S. Constitution? No, it is the \nSecretary of the Treasury. It is the Federal Government. You may be in \nthe Constitution but first of all, we are all Federal Government \nemployees. We are paid by the taxpayers of this country.\n\n  Our bill is being held up by arrogance, an arrogance of power. Some \nMembers obviously see themselves as above the average person. They are \nabove Federal employees. Senator Boxer, I and others have offered, and \nwe will do so again, an amendment that says that if the Government is \nshut down, Members of Congress should be treated like the most \nadversely affected Federal employee. If they are not getting their pay, \nwe should not get ours either. If they are going to get paid back \nsometime in the future we would get paid back sometime in the future.\n  It is, again, an arrogance of power for us to say to a Federal \nemployee, you have to go to work but you do not get paid. That is what \nwe are saying. Or, you can stay home and not get paid, but you will get \npaid later on sometime. I think we should cover Members the same way \nand make sure that Members of the Senate and the House are treated just \nlike the most adversely affected Federal employee.\n  Last, Mr. President, this Government shutdown is not about whether or \nnot we have a 7-year budget agreement. The shutdown is related to \nwhether or not our annual appropriations bills are passed and signed \ninto law. They are not. And I again point out, at the end of the fiscal \nyear, last September, only two appropriations bills had been passed. \nOnly 2 of 13. We did not filibuster any of them, Mr. President. We did \nnot filibuster one appropriations bill on this side. We wanted them to \ngo through. The President, then, of course, has his constitutional \nprerogative to veto them and we try to work out something that he will \nsign.\n  I heard the Senator from Wyoming earlier say he mentioned November 14 \nwhen the negotiations started. I say that this summer, is when \nappropriations bills should have been passed and sent to the \nPresident--before September 30. Let the President, if he wants to veto \nthem, he has that right, and we could have spent October and November \nworking out appropriations bills that would pass. That was not done. \nLast year we passed every appropriations bill on time before September \n30 last year.\n  Again, we should not get this confused. The reason the Government is \nshut down, the reason it is costing taxpayers $40 million a day has \nnothing to do with reaching a 7-year balanced budget agreement which we \nall support. It has to do with whether or not we are going to do the \njob we should have done last year before September 30 in getting the \nappropriations bills passed and down to the President. We should not \nconfuse those two.\n  We have to be about getting a balanced budget agreement. We have to \nmake sure in reaching that in balancing the budget which I strongly \nsupport--and I know the present occupant of the chair supports--we may \nhave a difference in how we get there--but I believe there is room to \nnegotiate as long as we do not hurt people, as long as we do not take \nit out of the elderly and our young students in order to give big new \ntax breaks for the wealthy in this country and we cut down on corporate \nwelfare.\n  Yes, then we can reach a balanced budget in a way that is fair, \ndecent, compassionate and caring to people of this country. If we can \nagree on that we will have a balanced budget in 7 years. However, if \nall we want to do is give new tax breaks to the highest income \nAmericans and we want to make the elderly pay a lot more for their \nMedicare, I do not see how we can do that. We have to hold firm. We \nhave to hold firm that we are not going to balance this budget in 7 \nyears on the backs of the elderly or on the students or on hard working \npeople in this country. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19336-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  So the motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the amendment was adopted in the agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The foregoing \namendment is agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19337-3", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19338-S19339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreceives from the House a bill entitled ``A bill to provide for deficit \nreduction and achieve a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002,'' and the \nmajority and minority leaders are in agreement, that the bill should be \nconsidered under the reconciliation process, and then once the Senate \nbegins consideration, the bill be deemed a reconciliation bill, and all \nprovisions under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 apply to the \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just comment briefly here, because \nthis is a matter of some contention. Even though it is a Senate matter, \nthe reason we had expedited procedure in the other provision is we \ntried to get consent on the Senate side and it was objected to. So the \nHouse put in a bill and sent it over here. I think the concern was if \nwe did reach some agreement with the President and the Democratic \nleaders in the House and Senate and Republican leaders in the House and \nSenate, that when it came to the Senate, it could be subject to \nfilibuster and might take 2 weeks or 3 weeks.\n  So I have discussed this at length with the Democratic leader, \nSenator \n\n[[Page S19339]]\nDaschle, and we have agreed that if we have an agreement with the \nPresident and leadership, we will, in effect, say it is considered in \nthe reconciliation process and be a reconciliation bill.\n  Under those procedures, I can move to reduce the time to 15 hours, to \n20 hours, whatever, and it would speed up the process considerably. I \nhope my colleagues in the House appreciate the fact that we think we \nhave moved along the process here considerably if, in fact, there \nshould be an agreement. That is why we have stricken the expedited \nprocess language out of the previous bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19338-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19339-S19343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1643, MFN \nstatus for Bulgaria; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that there be one amendment in order, the text of which \nis a clean continuing resolution for all agencies of Government without \nfunding at this time which shall expire January 12, 1996; that the \namendment be deemed agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  I send up the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nMr. President, it seems to me this is a significant advancement in this \nprocess. I know that the majority leader has not been an advocate for a \nshutdown. He has indicated that a number of times on the floor of the \nSenate. We have all wanted to get to this point where the Senate could \npass a clean CR. We have offered on 10 occasions a clean CR. This is a \nclean continuing resolution that provides additional funding through a \ndate certain. We would prefer that it be beyond January 12 but we \ncertainly are in agreement that doing it this way would bring Federal \nworkers back to work with pay, restore the Federal Government to the \nfunctions that it was able to perform previous to this shutdown. This \nis a major step forward.\n  I hope very much that the House of Representatives will see fit as \nearly as possible to also accept this clean continuing resolution. \nDoing so would then end this partial shutdown that now exists. I do not \nobject to this and fully support the continuing resolution.\n  As I have indicated, we were prepared today to offer on the 11th \noccasion a clean CR that is identical to the unanimous-consent request \nthat has been made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nMr. President, let me congratulate the distinguished majority leader on \nhis last proposal. While I supported two previous ones, I think the \nimportant one to many, many Americans is the last one which would say \nthrough the 12th day of January the U.S. Government goes back to work. \nThe people that work for the Government would go back to work and would \nbe paid. I think it is time we do this.\n  Obviously, I understand the House has some different problems than we \nhave. I think it is right for the U.S. Senate under your leadership to \nproceed this evening to send this measure to the U.S. House for their \nconsideration.\n  I want to suggest to the Senate that in my home State where, \nobviously, we have a considerable number of Federal employees, even \nthose who are not Federal employees are very perplexed and concerned \nabout something they do not understand. I think they make a great \npoint. That is, Federal employees are furloughed but there is a \ncommitment that when they come back to work we will pay them for the \ntime they did not spend working. More constituents are calling me \nasking, what kind of business is that? We have people who are being \npaid for not working, and then you have Federal employees who have been \ndeemed necessary, they are on the job and they are being paid but they \nmust work. Frankly, most Federal employees are saying they would like \nto work for their pay.\n  As I understand the distinguished majority leader's proposal, not \nonly would it open Government through the 12th day of this month, but \npay the back pay for all the workers who have been furloughed. We would \nbe back to a position where they would all receive their money and \ntheir back pay and the other things that are bothering us around the \ncountry. I compliment him for that.\n  I hope the House gives serious consideration to this and soon we will \nget to part of our efforts to get a balanced budget, which is separate \nand distinct, but nonetheless we must have the White House negotiating. \nThey must concede some issues. They cannot win everything. Hopefully, \nthat will continue while we move ahead with the continuing resolution \nat this time. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. It would also provide that there would be no double-\ndipping. You could not get unemployment compensation then be paid back \npay. You would subtract any unemployment compensation pay for the pay \nthat you should have been entitled to, which I think is fair.\n  Let me just say I read a wire story there is a split between the \nHouse and the Senate on what ought to happen. I do not get that feeling \nat all in talking with the Speaker. In fact, we just had a 30-minute \nmeeting. The Senator from Virginia was there, I was there, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico was there, the Speaker, the majority leader of the \nHouse, Mr. Armey was there, and we had a good discussion. I think there \nis some difference on just how we should proceed, but in my view what \nwe really want, of course, is to get people back to work.\n  I felt that way for some time. I have a hard time rationalizing \npaying people for not working when I know they want to work. If they \ndid not want to work, I say they should not be paid. These people want \nto work. They are caught. They are in the middle. They are pawns. I do \nnot believe at this point--I think if there was a point to make, that \npoint has been made. I know the Speaker indicated you just have to do \nwhat you have to do.\n  We are going to send this to the House. The House will be back \ntomorrow. Hopefully tonight at 6 o'clock we will have serious \ndiscussions. I think we have had enough preliminary discussions at the \nWhite House. It is time that I think we will get serious about whether \nor not we will reach a balanced budget over the next 7 years.\n  I wanted to correct an impression that there might be some rift \nbetween the House and the Senate. I think there are some House Members \nwho have a different view. They feel this is helpful in bringing about \na balanced budget. That is not my view. I think it may have been \nhelpful the first time around, but if you add up the time people have \nhad off with the two shutdowns, it would be almost a month--about 30 \ndays they have been out of work which they will be paid for. It is no \nfault of theirs. I am not critical. That is a huge cost when the work \nwas not performed by willing workers.\n  It seems to me that if we extend this continuing resolution until the \n12th of January we will know by then if we are serious about a balanced \nbudget over the next 7 years. If we do not know by then, we ought--I do \nnot know what we do. I think we would not have to be a rocket scientist \nto know by then. That way we will all be covered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \nmajority leader. I had the opportunity to be in that meeting. I suggest \nhe look at his words again. He said half an hour; it was 2\\1/2\\ hours \nthat we were there.\n  Indeed, I certainly perceive no split between the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Speaker of the House. There are a wide range of \nissues which were discussed in a very objective manner. I think there \nwas a clear perception that the American public now understand the \ncomplexity of this situation and there is a feeling of a sense of \nfairness emerging. That sense of fairness says to the Congress, we have \nto work with our President to come to some conclusion. It is not fair \nto the Government employees. They are being held hostage. More than \nthat, there is a ripple effect. It is not just the Federal Government \nemployees. It is many others who are dependent upon a functioning of \nthe U.S. Government for their daily livelihood. Particularly that class \nof individual cannot look to compensation subsequently, like the \nGovernment employees, and I again thank the distinguished majority \nleader and indeed the speaker and others for confirming they will be \npaid. But \n\n[[Page S19340]]\nthis other group, this ripple effect, they are not likely to get any \ncompensation. An empty hotel room tonight is an empty hotel room \nforever. A lost wage to a taxi driver, all of the people, for instance, \nin the greater metropolitan area who are here every day to make it \npossible that tourism--one of the largest industries in this area--can \nfunction are suffering irreparably. People are losing wages, and that \nis taking place all across the country, not only in the greater \nWashington metropolitan area.\n  I wish to be a cosponsor, Mr. Leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator is a cosponsor and the Senator from New Mexico \nwill be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I commend you again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). Is there objection to the \nunanimous-consent request of the majority leader with reference to the \ncontinuing resolution?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would it be possible to speak for a couple of minutes \nafter its adoption? I am quite content to have it go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3115) was deemed agreed to, as follows:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 106(c) of Public Law 104-56 is \n     amended by striking ``December 15, 1995'' and inserting \n     ``January 12, 1996''.\n       (b) Effective Period.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall be considered to have taken effect on December 16, \n     1995.\n\n     SEC.   . ELIGIBILITY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.\n\n       Begining on January 2, 1996, any federal employee who is \n     excepted from furlough and is not being paid due to a lapse \n     in appropriations shall be eligible for unemployment \n     compensation benefits with no waiting period for such \n     eligibility to accrue. With respect to any person who is \n     eligible for such benefits by reason of the preceding \n     sentence, any such benefits received shall be subject to \n     repayment in the same manner and to the same extent when \n     eligibility by reason of the preceding sentence ceases as if \n     such cessation were an end to the period of unemployment.\n\n  So the bill (H.R. 1643), as amended, was read the third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nmajority leader and all who have worked with him in bringing forth this \nclean extension of the CR with which my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia said it is not just the Federal employees affected, although \nthey are clearly very much affected, but there is a large part of the \nprivate sector also impacted and impacted in a very negative way by \nwhat has occurred.\n  This, of course, will carry through until the 12th of January and \ngive us an opportunity to correct the difficulties that have existed \nthus far and hopefully avoid any difficulties from arising in the \nfuture. I think it will bring, at least for now, significant relief in \nterms of anxiety and apprehension and tension and turmoil to a lot of \nfamilies which have been very negatively impacted. I very much hope it \nwill be adopted on the House side when they consider the matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, both Senator Dole and myself have been in \ncontact almost on a daily basis with Congressman Wolf, Congressman \nDavis, and Congresswoman Morella. They are very much included. We are \ngoing to start meeting daily on this problem to give to the leadership \nof both Houses our best judgment as to the severity of the problem in \nthe greater metropolitan area of Washington. I welcome the \nparticipation by my distinguished colleague from Maryland.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I hope the House would take a look at this \ntomorrow. They are all back tomorrow. It was an opportunity for them to \nhave been in their districts.\n  I know some have said this is an indication that the Government is \ntoo big, that they are not essential or they have not been missed, what \nis the big deal?\n  If we want to make the Government smaller, then we ought to make the \nGovernment smaller. If we want to eliminate departments--some of us \ndo--then we ought to do it. Bring it out here, have the debate, and \nsay, OK, we will eliminate Energy and HUD and Commerce and Education, \nfor example. But this is not the way to do it. If we do it through \nlegislation, that is one thing, but if we just say we are not going to \npay people, I, at least, think that is not, in my judgment, how it \nought to be done.\n  People who work for the Federal Government are good people, and they \nunderstand that from time to time, as part of the Federal \nestablishment, they have to make certain sacrifices when it comes to \ncost-of-living adjustments or even temporary Government shutdowns. So \nthis is the second shutdown. This has been a lengthy shutdown. And, as \nI said earlier, if there is any point to be made I think that point \nshould have been made by now.\n  Some of these Federal employees--in fact, I am certain the Senator \nfrom Maryland knows, what percentage make less than $25,000? Probably \n20, as a percent of the total?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Probably even more than that, I would say.\n  Mr. DOLE. And they live from paycheck to paycheck.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly.\n  Mr. DOLE. When they do not get the check, we say, ``Oh, well, they \ncan borrow the money.'' If they borrow the money, they have to pay for \nit--if they can borrow the money.\n  So I hope, based on fairness and getting people back to work and \neliminating some of the stress that I am certain some have undergone, \nthat the House will look upon this favorably. If not, I think the \nsecond option--I know it is not the preferred option by a lot of \npeople--would be the first bill we passed, which deems all workers \nessential and promises they will be paid. That is not the same as being \npaid. Plus, we added a number of categories--the Senator from Maryland \nwas not here at the time--to take care of Meals on Wheels, protective \nservices for children, unemployment insurance--there are about 11 \nStates, plus D.C., which will have exhausted Federal funds for \nadministering the Federal Unemployment Insurance Program, including, I \nmight add, the State of Kansas, where somebody said today they shot out \nthe windows at the unemployment office. I have not verified that story. \nIn other words, if the office is closed, people with unemployment \nbenefit claims cannot have their claims addressed.\n  The District of Columbia would be included, and also assistance \npayments to 53,000 Indian families and foster family care for about \n3,000 Indian children. Then we have the same problem with about 170,000 \nveterans. And we believe that, of course, if you have a CR, you do not \nhave to worry about that. If you do not have a CR, then the backup \nwould be adopting the deeming provision.\n  Let me just say, in fairness--I will not make all these requests, \nbecause I hope that we have a bipartisan, or nonpartisan solution here \nthat can be dealt with in the same way on the House side--but I would \nsay, everybody wants to assign blame. I am not here to assign blame. I \nam just here to suggest that we have three appropriations bills that \nwere vetoed. Had they not been vetoed, a lot of people would be \nworking, they would not be worrying about the 7- or 9-day CR. But the \nPresident vetoed those bills. I understand some of them just have two \nor three areas where we have disagreements. I urge my colleagues--on \nthe Interior bill, for example, I understand there are only three areas \nof disagreement. If we can work out the areas of disagreement, we ought \nto pass the bill, meet the President's request, and send it back and \nthat will take care of any future problems in case the Government was \nshut down a third time. I hope that would not happen.\n\n  The same is true with VA-HUD. I understand that is another bill that \ncould be, with a little effort, worked out, just a give and take on \nboth sides.\n  State, Justice, Commerce, I think there are probably a number of \ndifferences there. I am not certain that can be accommodated.\n  On the D.C. appropriations bill, there is one issue, vouchers. Only \none issue keeps that bill from going to the President and being signed \nby the President.\n  Foreign operations, one issue, one issue on the Mexico City policy. \nThat is the only issue that keeps that bill from going to the \nPresident. I do not think he has a problem with that bill.\n  Finally, Labor-HHS, and we have had two party-line votes on bringing \nit to the membership on the floor. It takes 60 votes. It has been a \nparty-line vote so we have not been able to bring \n\n[[Page S19341]]\nLabor-HHS to the floor. Maybe there is some way to work out our \ndifferences there.\n  But one way to avoid the CR's and the potential problems of a \nshutdown would be to get together on the appropriations bills. We are \nurging our colleagues on this side to do that starting immediately. We \nwould be happy to accommodate anybody on the other side. I know there \nis a lot of interest in Interior and State, Justice, Commerce; foreign \noperations; HUD; District of Columbia. If those bills could be passed--\nand three of them have been vetoed--but passed again, to accommodate \nsome of the concerns raised by the administration, then we would not be \nhere worrying about 5 days, 9 days, and 10 days.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting minority leader.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just observe that we have seen \nprevious vetoes of appropriations bills in the history of the U.S. \nCongress, but that did not result in a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. I would not want people listening to this to believe that \nbecause appropriations vetoes occurred this year, that resulted in a \nshutdown of the Government. That is not why we have a shutdown. The \nshutdown, it seems to me, was a matter of strategy by some.\n  I might say, not the majority leader. He has made it, I think, clear \na number of times on the floor of the Senate that he is not an advocate \nof shutdowns. Nonetheless, I think it has been a matter of strategy to \nuse the shutdown as leverage with respect to the balanced budget talks.\n  Another Senator mentioned that his constituents could not understand \nthis shutdown. I would say, my constituents have told me the same \nthing--they could not understand it. I have said that is pretty \nreasonable, because it is not an understandable policy. It defies all \ncommon sense. It does not make any sense to decide to shut the \nGovernment down, pay $40 million a day for labor that you prevent being \nperformed by Federal workers, but that you say you will reimburse \nlater. I think, when all of the noise and all of the dust and all of \nthe wind is over, at least today we will have been seen as taking a \nfirst sensible step. That is a CR that funds the Government, brings \nFederal employees back to work, and pays them.\n\n  I might say that the proposal that we have offered on previous \noccasions, a continuing resolution to fund these functions of \nGovernment and bring people back to work, would take us through the end \nof January. The CR that we are enacting today in the Senate takes us \nonly through January 12. While we would prefer that this go to the end \nof January, and that during this period, between now and the end of \nJanuary, we would have a set of budget negotiations that would result \nin an agreement and we would not again be faced with the circumstances \nof a threatened shutdown, we accept January 12 because it is a step \nforward. If the House will address this, it will resolve this impasse.\n  Again, my fervent hope is that early tomorrow the House of \nRepresentatives will take this up. I hope they would agree with it by a \nvoice vote as the Senate has and restore people back to work, pay them \nfor coming back to work. And, I say again as I said before, I commend \nthe Senator from Kansas for this initiative.\n  We have offered this initiative previously. I know the Senator from \nKansas has not been an advocate of a shutdown. But nonetheless we were \nfaced with this set of circumstances. If the House acts on this in the \nmorning, it seems to me we finally have this back on track and perhaps \nwe will not again see a shutdown that penalizes the American taxpayer, \npenalizes Federal workers, and does nothing good for anyone that I can \nsee. It is fundamentally a nonunderstandable policy.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Kansas, the majority leader. We were \nhappy to accommodate the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, throughout the day the distinguished \nacting minority leader has been on the floor, active in the debate. But \nI think it was very important that the majority leader bring up the \nfact that the veto of the appropriations bills is a very strong factor \nin the problem that we are addressing here with the CR.\n  The distinguished minority leader has stated his case. But I also \nfeel very strongly that the majority leader, in good conscience, had to \nbring that matter up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting minority leader.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I accept his point. My only observation was we could \ndebate all this. On Labor-HHS, Republicans deserted on the vote there \nas well. Some of the vetoes were fully expected, in terms of what was \nin the legislation when it went to the President.\n  My hope is that now, beginning at 6 o'clock, the negotiations on the \nbalanced budget plan will bear fruit and we will have no further \nshutdowns. We will have appropriations bills resolved the way they \nshould be resolved, not by the leverage of a Government shutdown but by \nthe give and take as between the Congress and the President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I said earlier today it is senseless that \nwe pass the football to your side, you pass it back to us. The blame \ngame exchange will not get us anywhere. Let us put the football on the \n50-yard line and blow time out on the blame game and let us get behind \nthe President and the distinguished leaders of this body, who will go \ndown in just a matter of minutes and try and reconcile this problem.\n  We all wish them luck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just make the observation that I think \nall of the appropriations bills that were mentioned had legislation on \nan appropriations bill. Of course, if we did not do that to begin with, \nwhy, it would be an easier task dealing with the appropriations bills. \nThe President took issue with some of that and vetoed the bills.\n  I listened carefully to the majority leader who suggested maybe if \nsome of those objections could be accommodated, it might be possible to \nwork out the differences between the President and the Congress on that \nlegislation. Therefore, there is a chance some of them might be \nenacted. And it seems to me that is a worthwhile path to explore.\n  The other thing though is I do feel very strongly, as I indicated \nearlier today, that this closing down of the Government was without \nreason and without common sense. And I wish to underscore one point \nbecause I think it tends to get overlooked. There is a tendency to \nthink of this in terms of the Federal employees who are not working. \nThat is a very important aspect of it. But by not working, they are not \nproviding services that are needed by the private sector. So it is \nhaving an impact, a far-reaching impact through our economy and through \nour country.\n  In other words, people who want passports are not able to get those \npassports. You have people who planned trips for years. You have had \nbusiness reasons to take such trips. Grants by the NIH have been put on \nthe shelf, and so forth and so on. So there is a strong impact. People \nwho contract with the Federal Government have found themselves unable \nto carry through and, of course, that is going to start affecting \nunemployment offices; they are closing down. That is not unemployment \noffices for the Federal workers. That is unemployment offices for \neveryone. So someone who gets laid off from some private job in some \nStates now is not going to be able to find an open unemployment office \nwith which to file a claim in order to obtain unemployment benefits in \norder to carry his family through a very difficult period.\n  Now, obviously, the way to address it is the way it is being \naddressed here, and that is with a clean CR which brings the workers \nback in, pays them, they do the job, they perform the services, they \nmeet the need, the private sector can then interact with the Government \nas it does, and we can move forward from there.\n  So I again wish to thank the majority leader for moving forward with \nthis \n\n[[Page S19342]]\nCR, and I am hopeful that the House will accept it when it takes it up \non tomorrow.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. I would like to add my own word of thanks and appreciation \nto the distinguished majority leader and those who have worked with him \nto propose the continuing resolution at this point. I think it is very \nimportant. Understandably, because of the serious differences in some \nof the philosophical questions that have been presented in this debate, \nit is not easy for leaders on either side of the debate to make a move \ntoward getting us beyond a step which many of us feel is simply \nunconscionable and indefensible to continue.\n  I hope that the leadership that the distinguished majority leader has \nprovided in moving us to this point will indeed provide an impetus for \nour colleagues in the other body to act in accord so that we may move \nbeyond this particular impasse.\n\n  The big issues can still be debated, but the question of whether or \nnot it makes any sense to continue the furlough of Federal employees \nwho will eventually get paid so this Government is saving no money but \nwhich represents an enormous waste of taxpayer resources and an \ninconvenience for many and serious economic concerns for others who \ninteract with the Federal Government, for many small businesses that \nare dependent upon the successful actions of the Federal Government, \nall of this can be resolved at least in the near term with this \nparticular action, and all of the essential arguments that have been \nmade by both sides are preserved for full debate at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I again thank the majority leader for exercising this leadership. I \nthank my distinguished colleague and senior Senator from Virginia, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Maryland, and others in the region \nwho are most impacted by this particular situation but all who have \nshown the good will in an attempt to get beyond the difficulties that \nhave held us up.\n  So to all, including my good friend from Rhode Island, who may be \nabout to speak on this topic, I say thank you for bringing us to this \npoint and hope that they will succeed in urging our colleagues in the \nother body to follow the leadership of our distinguished majority \nleader.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my friend from Virginia. I will be happy to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I just want to join in congratulating the \nmajority leader for what he has done today. This is really terribly \nimportant. And while many citizens in the country are not suffering at \nall--they are getting their Social Security check, the VA checks, the \nAFDC checks--there are literally hundreds, and, indeed, thousands who \ntruly are suffering out of this, whether it be a passport they cannot \nobtain, having made payments on flights that are not redeemable, \nwhether it is the AmeriCorps individuals who are working in the inner \ncities and live paycheck to paycheck and are not receiving their check, \nwhether it is those who are under some Government contract and not \nbeing paid. There is a lot of suffering taking place across the \ncountry.\n  And so I just give high praise to our distinguished majority leader, \nthe senior Senator from Kansas, for what he has done, and I just hope \nthe House accepts it. It is, as I understand, until January 12. And in \nthe meantime the negotiators on the biggest subject, namely the budget, \ncan keep working. This is not something that is fostering--in other \nwords, the shutdown is not fostering the talks. Nothing is being gained \nfrom that. The administration is not being bullied, and the Republicans \nare not being bullied. It is a nonwinner. It is one of those rare \nthings where everybody loses.\n  So I congratulate the majority leader, and I just hope the House \naccepts this and we can get on with the Government reopening. If things \nare not worked out by January 12, well, then have another. But \nmeanwhile I just know everybody who is involved is trying to reach a \nsettlement on this budget.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I certainly share \ntheir view. I do not see any sense in what we have been doing, frankly. \nMaybe I missed the point. I have been here a while. Maybe something \nwent by me. But I think we have had shutdowns before lasting a day or 2 \ndays, and you can handle that. But when it is--what is today, day 18? \nAnd we have already had a 7-day. As I said earlier, you are going to \nhave 30 days here very quickly. I do not believe any side gains.\n  I do not believe we are sitting down because the Government is \npartially shut down. I do not believe the President is sitting down \nbecause the Government is partially shut down. We better be sitting \ndown because we agreed we ought to balance the budget in 7 years. And \nthe Federal employees are going to be part of that. I think they are \ngoing to be asked to make sacrifices like everybody else if that is \ndone. But to say that they cannot work and they cannot be paid until we \nput together an agreement--I know there are some of my colleagues in \nthe House who feel just as strongly the other way, but I do not quite \nunderstand the logic of it all. As I said earlier, I think the Speaker \nis inclined to be receptive. All the House Members are back, I \nunderstand, tomorrow, and they will have an opportunity to discuss \nthis. I hope that we could have quick action. People have been gone \nfrom their jobs long enough. Enough is enough.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens be added as a cosponsor \nto amendment 3115, the CR until January 12, 1996.\n  Mr. DORGAN. And anybody else who wants to----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to join.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senator Robb, and Senator Dorgan already have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senator Daschle, and Senator Sarbanes, and anybody else.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if I might ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a description of the effects of the shutdown offered by \nOMB. I believe it was the description that Senator Dole referred to, \nand I think it would be useful to have that in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate we did not cover all those in the other one \nbecause we thought some were not as urgent as others, but I think we \nought to enable people to be able to get a passport, to open the parks, \nand other things that I think are important to all people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Effects of the Continuing Shutdown, Tuesday, January 2, 1996\n\n       Administration on Aging: 600,000 elderly Americans face the \n     potential of losing their services of ``Meals on Wheels,'' \n     transportation and personal care provided by HHS if a CR is \n     not passed this week.\n       Protection and services for children: As of today, states \n     will lose $74 million in quarterly grants for discretionary \n     child protection programs, which help states respond to more \n     than 2.5 million reported cases of child maltreatment each \n     year. In addition, the Federal Parent Locator Service, to \n     which 20,000 child support cases per day on average are \n     referred, is closed.\n       Unemployment insurance: By the end of this week, 11 states \n     (plus DC and the VI) will have exhausted Federal funds for \n     administering the unemployment insurance program (NJ, AL, RI, \n     TN, KS, AK, MA, NH, VT, UT, NM). In order to keep \n     unemployment offices open, states will have to fill the gap \n     with their own funds. Otherwise, unemployment offices would \n     have to close and benefit payments would cease. Kansas has \n     already closed its unemployment office.\n       Securities markets: The SEC's funds are expected to be \n     exhausted by the end of next week, causing review of an \n     estimated three-fourths of pending and new SEC filings for \n     the months of January to be delayed. A delay in review of \n     filings for initial public offerings, mergers and \n     acquisitions, and filings for new debt or stock offerings \n     would eventually impact the flow of corporate financing and \n     capital formation.\n       Home-buyers: Each day of the shutdown, the Federal Housing \n     Administration cannot process 2,500 home purchase loans and \n     refinancings ($200 million of mortgage loans) for moderate- \n     and low-income working families. \n     \n[[Page S19343]]\n\n       Protection of workers: Since the start of the shutdown, \n     over 1000 workplace safety complaints have gone unanswered \n     and 3,500 investigations involving pension, health and other \n     employee benefit plans have been suspended.\n       Environmental protection: All EPA non-Superfund civil \n     environmental enforcement actions have stopped, costing $3 \n     million a day in fines or injunctive relief against \n     polluters; and as of today, up to 32 Superfund cleanups will \n     be shut down.\n       District of Columbia: The December 22 CR expires tomorrow \n     which will continue the uncertainty over how DC an continue \n     to operate its services.\n       Passports: Each day, the State Department can't process \n     23,000 applications for passports that it would receive.\n       Programs for native Americans: The Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     cannot make general assistance payments due to about 53,000 \n     Indian families and individuals, or to guardians and foster \n     families that care for about 3,000 Indian children.\n       Veterans: While the December 22 CR provided funding for \n     certain benefits and payments, it expires tomorrow; \n     consequently, contractors providing services and supplies to \n     hospitals will not be paid and benefits for January will not \n     be paid (on February 1). In addition, approximately 170,000 \n     veterans did not receive their December Montgomery GI Bill \n     education benefits and will not receive benefits in January. \n     Funding has also lapsed for processing veterans' claims for \n     educational & rehabilitation counseling, and enabling \n     veterans to obtain VA guaranteed home loans.\n       Small businesses: Each day of the shutdown, over 260 small \n     businesses are not receiving SBA-guaranteed financing; and \n     1,200 small business owners are not receiving SBA-Sponsored \n     training and counseling normally available to them.\n       National parks/forests and related businesses: Each day, an \n     average of 383,000 people cannot visit National Parks. \n     Potential per day losses for businesses in communities \n     adjacent to National Parks could reach $14 million, due to \n     reduced recreational tourism.\n       Foreign visitors: Each day, the State Department cannot \n     issue 20,000 visas to visitors, who normally spend an average \n     of $3,000 on their trips.\n       Export promotion: On an average day--export licenses with a \n     value of $30.5 million that would otherwise have been \n     approved by the Bureau of Export Administration will not be \n     acted upon; more than $92 million in sales of U.S. products \n     are blocked due to inability to process license applications; \n     and more than 2500 telephone calls and faxes from U.S. \n     businesses seeking export information are not being answered.\n\n\n                       Effects on Federal Workers\n\n       Due to Congress' failure to approve short-term funds, \n     beginning last Friday, December 29, about three-quarters-of-\n     a-million Federal employees received only half their usual \n     pay. They received pay for December 10 to 15, but not \n     December 16 to 23. Unless the Congress approves funding by \n     late this week, emergency and furloughed employees will not \n     receive pay for the current pay period on time (i.e. next \n     week).\n       480,000 emergency workers are working, and the government \n     is obligated to pay them, but they can't be paid until \n     Congress approves funds to end the shutdown (includes federal \n     law enforcement officials, prison guards, and nurses at \n     Veterans Hospitals).\n       280,000 non-emergency workers are currently furloughed and \n     not being paid (and have no guarantee they will receive back \n     pay unless Congress acts to approve back pay).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/02/senate-section/article/S19339-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
