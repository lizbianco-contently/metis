I wish the President pro tempore a good morning.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a couple remarks, if I can, about \nthe securities litigation reform legislation.\n  The bill before us highlights the real problem that faces companies \nwhen frivolous lawsuits are filed against them by lawyers for a quick \nprofit. Our goal should be to address this problem without undermining \nthe ability of investors to protect themselves against real fraud. \nRegrettably, the bill reported from conference goes too far, \neffectively closing the courthouse door on investors with legitimate \nclaims.\n  While fixing the problem presented by frivolous lawsuits requires \nremedy, this bill goes beyond that and, as a result, leaves investors \nunprotected against fraud in many instances.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n                                 NOTICE\n\n                    LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1995\n\n A special joint notice from the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk \n of the House concerning implementation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act \n  of 1995 (P.L. 104-65) appears in this issue of the Record following \n both the proceedings of the Senate and the House. See pages S19290-91 \n                             and H15634-35.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n[[Page S19146]]\n\n  The well-targeted veto of the President can force this bill back on \nthe right track. Proponents and opponents of this legislation recognize \nthat our first priority must be to protect investors. Families, senior \ncitizens, and working people need to feel secure when they invest. They \nneed to be encouraged to save and invest for their health care, their \nretirement, and their education.\n  But such investors will only have confidence in the market if they \nconsider them to be fair. They must expect that they will be protected \nif they are defrauded. They need to know that the law will continue to \nprotect small investors, pension funds, and taxpayers against another \nCharles Keating. Yet, under this bill, when the next Charles Keating \nappears, and one will, victims will recover almost none of their \nlosses. The victims of the Keating fraud recovered over $260 million. \nFuture victims will get a mere fraction of that. The lawyers who sued \nKeating say they would only have recovered $16 million under the new \nbill--$16 million--a fraction of the $260 million under the current law \nthey have received.\n  The President indicated in his veto message that he would be willing \nto sign this bill if improvements were made. By sustaining his veto, we \ncan address real problems raised by frivolous lawsuits, while avoiding \nthe overly broad language that is now in the bill.\n  The President's veto message focuses on three problems with the \nconference report.\n  First, the bill allows corporate insiders to make false statements, \nso long as they are accompanied by ``cautionary language.''\n  Second, it raises the bar so high on pleading standards that victims \nof fraud cannot get into court.\n  Finally, it forces victims to risk paying legal fees of wealthy \ndefendants if they want their day in court.\n  Each of these problems should be addressed before this bill becomes \nlaw. Because the President's concerns are drawn very narrowly, a new \nbill with revisions to address these shortcomings can be written and \napproved. We can craft a better approach that protects investors while \nending frivolous lawsuits. That should be the goal of this legislative \nexercise.\n  Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nthe Senator from Maryland, and others, who have laid out in a much more \nelaborate fashion over the last couple of days many of the same \nreservations that I just expressed this morning. We need to join them \nin sustaining the President's veto.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withhold that request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19145-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19146-S19154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT--VETO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the veto message with respect to \nH.R. 1058, the securities litigation bill. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1058) to reform Federal securities litigation, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the reconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to see to it that \nthe much-needed reform in the area of securities litigation is \nundertaken. By overriding the President's veto, that reform would be \nensured.\n  I have notes here, comprehensive notes that detail the reasons why we \nhave to change this system--one reform the bill makes is to bar \nprofessional plaintiffs, people who have little interest in a \ncorporation who might own 10 shares of stock who are literally hired by \nthe lawyers to bring these suits. That is wrong, but that is what is \ngoing on.\n  The legislation makes all kinds of improvements, but let me put my \nnotes aside and refer to this morning's Washington Post. In its lead \neditorial, the Washington Post says quite clearly: ``Override the \nSecurities Bill Veto.''\n  Let me refer to just one part of it:\n\n       This bill would correct important flaws in the securities \n     laws that are being systematically exploited by lawyers in \n     ways that have nothing to do with fairness.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what this legislation does. It \ncorrects the law to protect investors. It gives to those people who are \ndefrauded the opportunity, for the first time, to see to it that \nlawyers who will really represent their interests lead the case, as \nopposed to having a lawyer in charge who says, ``I have the best \npractice in the world because I have no clients.''\n  Imagine this attorney who, by the way, has contributed millions of \ndollars to a political party and who is exerting incredible pressure, \nwho has paid millions of dollars for people to take out ads, phony \ngroups, little startup groups, groups that then say, ``Protect the \ninvestors, protect the investors''. He has spent millions of dollars to \noppose this bill--millions of dollars, and he brags about the fact that \nhe makes his living--a very comfortable one of millions of dollars--\nbecause he has no clients. ``I have no clients. That's the best kind of \npractice to have.''\n  We have to put those lawyers out of business. Let me say, when it \ncomes to protecting the interests of attorneys and litigants and seeing \nto it that claims can and should be sustained where there is merit, \nthis Senator has been there with his support every time. I am not \nsuggesting to you that this bill is perfect. I am not suggesting to you \nthat there may not be some areas in which we will have to reform this \nlegislation, but to suggest that we are now going to permit fraud is as \nwrong as it is to suggest that what is taking place now is preferable \nto reform. It is not and this legislation is not going to permit fraud.\n  This practice is wrong. This is bilking the system. This is bilking \nthe small investor. This system as it stands is encouraging the kind of \noperation that hurts small investors and makes no sense; this \nlegislation is long overdue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Washington Post \neditorial that appeared today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 22, 1995]\n\n                   Override the Securities Bill Veto\n\n       President Clinton was wrong to veto the securities bill. He \n     caved to the trial lawyers' lobby, big contributors to the \n     Democratic Party, in a dark-of-night action. Congress should \n     override him. The House of Representatives voted the other \n     day to do just that, with 89 Democrats joining the \n     Republicans. Now it's up to the Senate.\n       This bill would correct important flaws in the securities \n     laws that are being systematically exploited by lawyers in \n     ways that have nothing to do with fairness. When the price of \n     a company's stock drops sharply, the present law invites \n     suits on the questionable grounds that the company's past \n     expressions of hope for its future misled innocent \n     stockholders.\n       This kind of suit has turned out to be a special danger to \n     new companies, particularly high-technology ventures with \n     volatile stock prices. The country has a strong interest in \n     encouraging these companies and \n\n[[Page S19147]]\n     shielding them from a style of legal assault that is not far from \n     extortion. The bill would protect companies' forecasts as \n     long as they did not omit significant facts.\n       Under present law, the first lawyer to file one of these \n     strike suits controls the litigation regardless of who else \n     might sue on the same grounds later. Frequently the lawyers \n     who specialize in this work settle their suits on terms that \n     bring trivial benefits to the shareholders but fat fees to \n     the lawyers themselves. The bill that Mr. Clinton vetoed \n     would instead give the judge the authority to pick the lead \n     plaintiff--usually the plaintiff with the biggest stake in \n     the outcome. Plaintiffs would then choose their own lawyers \n     and make their own decisions on whether and how to settle. \n     That is clearly a desirable reform and a major improvement in \n     shareholders' rights.\n       Mr. Clinton vetoed the bill because, he said, it would make \n     too many difficulties for shareholders with legitimate \n     grievances. There are two things to be said about that. This \n     bill has been under intense debate and negotiation between \n     the two parties for nearly a year, and if these defects are \n     as significant as the president suggests, it's strange that \n     the administration did not make an issue of them earlier.\n       More broadly, Mr. Clinton speaks of future injustices that \n     he believes this bill might create but has little to say \n     about the real and substantial injustices that the present \n     law is creating. Overriding his veto will end an egregious \n     misuse of securities laws in ways that harm both companies \n     and shareholders.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 9 minutes 4 \nseconds. The Senator from New York has 8 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and ask the \nChair to let me know when the 3 minutes have been used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe veto. We have a number of public interest groups that are in strong \nsupport of this veto. The North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation and the Association of the States Securities Regulators \nhave written to Members of the Senate to urge us ``to sustain President \nClinton's veto.''\n  They go on to say--and this is a very important point that we have \ncontinually emphasized during the debate:\n\n       While everyone agrees on the need for constructive \n     improvement in the Federal securities litigation process, the \n     reality is that the major provisions of H.R. 1058 go well \n     beyond curbing frivolous lawsuits and will work to shield \n     some of the most egregious wrongdoers from legitimate \n     lawsuits brought by defrauded investors.\n\n  That is the whole point. This legislation goes well beyond the \npurpose of curbing frivolous lawsuits. The examples that are always \ncited on the other side are examples with which we do not take issue. \nWe would like to curb those kinds of examples, but we do not want to go \nbeyond that, as the North American Securities Administrators say, ``to \nshield some of the most egregious wrongdoers from legitimate lawsuits \nbrought by defrauded investors.''\n  I will ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks, along with a letter from the \nNational League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational Association of County Treasurers and Finance Officers, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, Government Finance Officers Association, the \nMunicipal Treasuries Association, which also states that those \norganizations support ending frivolous lawsuits, but pointing out that \nthey are major investors of public pension funds and taxpayer moneys, \nwho want to ensure that litigation reform is balanced and does not harm \ninvestors. They go on to say, unfortunately, H.R. 1058 is a bill that \nis special-interest excess masquerading as reform, and it makes a \nmockery of our world-renowned system of investor protection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is not only State regulators and local government \nofficials, whom I just cited, but consumer groups and legal experts.\n  Money magazine has editorialized on this issue, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Money magazine, December 1995]\n\n Now Only Clinton Can Stop Congress From Hurting Small Investors Like \n                                  You\n\n                            (By Frank Lalli)\n\n       The debate over Congress' reckless securities litigation \n     reform has come down to this question: Will President Clinton \n     decide to protect investors, or will he give companies a \n     license to defraud shareholders?\n       Late in October, Republican congressional staffers agreed \n     on a so-called compromise version of the misguided House and \n     Senate bills. Unfortunately, the new bill jeopardizes small \n     investors in several ways. Yet it will likely soon be sent to \n     Clinton for his signature. The President should not sign it. \n     He should veto it. Here's why:\n       The bill helps executives get away with lying. Essentially, \n     lying executives get two escape hatches. The bill protects \n     them if, say, they simply call their phony earnings forecast \n     a forward-looking statement and add some cautionary boiler-\n     plate language. In addition, if they fail to do that and an \n     investor sues, the plaintiffs still have to prove the \n     executives actually knew the statement was untrue when they \n     issued it, an extremely difficult standard of proof. \n     Furthermore, if executives later learn that their original \n     forecast was false, the bill specifically says they have no \n     obligation to retract or correct it.\n       High-tech executives, particularly those in California's \n     Silicon Valley, have lobbied relentlessly for this broad \n     protection. As one congressional source told Money's \n     Washington, D.C. bureau chief Teresa Tritch: ``High-tech \n     execs want immunity from liability when they lie.'' Keep that \n     point in mind the next time your broker calls pitching some \n     high-tech stock based on the corporation's optimistic \n     predictions.\n       Investors who sue and lose could be forced to pay the \n     winner's court costs. The idea is to discourage frivolous \n     lawsuits. But this bill is overkill. For example, if a judge \n     ruled that just one of many counts in your complaint was \n     baseless, you could have to pay the defendant firm's entire \n     legal costs. In addition, the judge can require plaintiffs in \n     a class action to put up a bond at any time covering the \n     defendant's legal fees just in case they eventually lose. The \n     result: Legitimize lawsuits will not get filed.\n       Even accountants who okay fraudulent books will get \n     protection. Accountants who are reckless, as opposed to being \n     co-conspirators, would face only limited liability. What's \n     more, new language opens the way for the U.S Supreme Court to \n     let such practitioners off the hook entirely. If such a lax \n     standard became the law of the land, the accounting \n     profession's fiduciary responsibility to investors and \n     clients alike would be reduced to a sick joke.\n       Moreover, the bill fails to re-establish an investor's \n     right to sue hired guns, such as accountants, lawyers and \n     bankers, who assist dishonest companies. And it neglects to \n     lengthen the tight three-year time limit investors now have \n     to discover a fraud and sue.\n       Knowledgeable sources say the White House is weighing the \n     bill's political consequences, and business interests are \n     pressing him hard to sign it. ``The President wants the good \n     will of Silicon Valley,'' says one source. ``Without \n     California, Clinton is nowhere.''\n       We think the President should focus on a higher concern. \n     Our readers sent more than 1,500 letters in support of our \n     past three editorials denouncing this legislation. As that \n     mail attests, this bill will undermine the public's \n     confidence in our financial markets. And without that \n     confidence, this country is nowhere.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. They conclude by saying: ``This bill will undermine the \npublic's confidence in our financial markets and, without that \nconfidence, this country is nowhere.''\n  I am fearful that that is the price we will pay for this legislation.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from Prof. Arthur Miller at the Harvard Law School.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard law school,\n\n                                 Cambridge, MA, December 19, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC. 20500.\n       Dear Mr. President: On December 12 I wrote to you \n     concerning the so called ``securities reform'' legislation, \n     then embodied in Senate Bill 240. I urged you to oppose that \n     legislation because (1) it was based on a totally erroneous \n     assumption that there had been a sharp increase in securities \n     litigation in the recent past, which is completely belied by \n     every statistical measure available, (2) the federal courts, \n     exploiting a variety of procedural tools such as pretrial \n     management, summary judgment motions, sanctions, and enhanced \n     pleading requirements, were achieving many of the goals of \n     the so called reformists, most particularly the deterrence of \n     ``frivolous'' litigation; (3) recent history suggests that \n     the same vigilance is needed today to guard against market \n     fraud as was needed during the superheated activity in the \n     securities business in the mid-1900's; and (4) the SEC simply \n     is unable to perform the necessary prophylaxis to safeguard \n     the nation's investors, and private enforcement is an \n     absolutely integral part of policing the nation's \n     marketplaces.\n     \n[[Page S19148]]\n\n       I am writing again because the latest version of the \n     legislation, H.R. 1058, contains provisions regarding \n     pleading in securities cases and sanction procedures that, if \n     anything, make the legislation even more draconian and \n     access-barring than Senate Bill 240. It simply is perverse to \n     consider it a ``reform'' measure.\n       I have always taken great pride in the fact that the words \n     ``equal justice under law'' are engraved on the portico of \n     the United States Supreme Court. I fear, however, that if the \n     proposed legislation is signed into law, access to the \n     federal courts for those who have been victimized by illicit \n     practices in our securities markets will be foreclosed, \n     effectively discriminating against millions of Americans who \n     entrust their earnings to the securities markets. As \n     difficult as the existing Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure already make it to plead a claim for securities \n     fraud sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, \n     especially given existing judicial attitudes toward these \n     cases, the passage in House Bill 1058 requiring that the \n     plaintiff ``state with particularity facts giving rise to \n     a strong inference'' that the defendant acted with \n     scienter, in conjunction with the automatic stay of \n     discovery pending adjudication of dismissal motions, \n     effectively will destroy the private enforcement \n     capacities that have been given to investors to police our \n     nation's marketplace. Despite misleading statements in the \n     Statement of Managers that this provision is designed to \n     make the legislation consistent with existing Federal Rule \n     9, the truth is diametrically the opposite, since the \n     existing Rule clearly provides that matters relating to \n     state of mind need not be pleaded with particularity. \n     Indeed, it would be more accurate to describe the proposal \n     as a reversion to Nineteenth Century notions of procedure. \n     The proposed legislation also does considerable damage to \n     notions of privilege and confidence by demanding that \n     allegations on information and belief must be accompanied \n     by a particularization of ``all facts on which that belief \n     is formed.''\n       The situation is compounded by the proposed fee shifting \n     and bond provisions that relate to the enhanced sanction \n     language in the legislation. It is inconceivable that any \n     citizen, even one with considerable wealth and a strong case \n     on the merits, could undertake securities fraud litigation in \n     the face of the risks created by these provisions. As the \n     person who was the Reporter to the Federal Rules Advisory \n     Committee during the formulation and promulgation of the 1983 \n     revision of Federal Rule 11, the primary sanction provision \n     in these Rules, I can assure you that no one on that \n     distinguished committee would have possibly supported what is \n     now so cavalierly inserted into the legislation.\n       I use the word ``cavalierly'' intentionally, because, as I \n     indicated to you in my earlier letter, there is not one whit \n     of empiric research that justifies any of the procedural \n     aspects of this so called ``reform'' legislation. Not only \n     does every piece of statistical evidence available belie the \n     notion that there is any upsurge in securities fraud cases, \n     but these proposals, with their devastating impact on our \n     nation's investors, have completely bypassed the carefully \n     crafted structure established in the 1930's for procedural \n     revision that has enabled the Federal Rules to maintain their \n     stature as the model for procedural fairness and currency. \n     Thus, the proposed legislation represents a mortal blow both \n     to the policies that support the private enforcement of major \n     federal regulatory legislation and to the orderly \n     consideration and evaluation of all proposals for the \n     modification of the Federal Rules. From my perspective, which \n     is that of a practitioner in the federal courts, a teacher of \n     civil procedure for almost thirty-five years, and a co-author \n     of the standard work on federal practice and procedure, I \n     fear that all of that is extremely regrettable.\n       I hope you will give serious consideration to vetoing the \n     legislation. If I can be of any further assistance to you or \n     your staff in considering these and related matters, please \n     do not hesitate to inquire. My telephone number is 617/495-\n     4111.\n       My very best to you and your family during this wonderful \n     holiday season.\n       Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Arthur R. Miller,\n                                   Bruce Bromley Professor of Law.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Professor Miller says in the course of this letter,\n\n       I have always taken great pride in the fact that the words \n     `equal justice under law' are engraved on the portico of the \n     Supreme Court. I fear, however, that if the proposed \n     legislation is signed into law, access to the Federal courts \n     for those who have been victimized by illicit practices in \n     our securities markets will be foreclosed, effectively \n     discriminating against millions of Americans who entrust \n     their earnings to the securities markets.\n\n  Do not make the mistake of exposing our investors to the pitfalls \nthat the public officials, State security regulators, and these \ndistinguished academics have pointed out. I urge sustaining the veto.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n [Letter from National League of Cities (NLC), National Association of \nCounties (NACo), National Association of County Treasurers and Finance \n   Officers (NACTFO), U.S. Conferences of Mayors (USCM), Government \n    Finance Officers Association (GFOA), and Municipal Treasurers' \n                   Association (MTA), Dec. 21, 1995]\n\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: On behalf of the state and local \n     government officials we represent, we urge you to vote to \n     sustain President Clinton's veto of the Private Securities \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 1058) and support \n     legislation in Congress that truly accomplishes the goal of \n     reducing frivolous litigation. Our organizations all support \n     ending frivolous lawsuits because as issuers of municipal \n     securities, we too may be sued, especially in light of the \n     new Securities and Exchange Commission requirement for \n     issuers to disclose annual financial information. On the \n     other hand, we also are major investors of public pension \n     funds and taxpayer monies who want to ensure that litigation \n     reform is balanced and does not harm investors. \n     Unfortunately, H.R. 1058 is a bill that is special interest \n     excess masquerading as reform and it makes a mockery of our \n     world-renowned system of investor protection. The over 1,000 \n     letters from state and local government officials from all \n     over the country that have been sent to Congress in the last \n     few weeks attest to our deep conviction that this bill should \n     not become law.\n       The following are the major concerns state and local \n     governments have with the bill and the major reasons we \n     supported a veto:\n       Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements--The safe-harbor \n     provision relating to forward-looking statements would allow \n     false predictions to be made as long as they are accompanied \n     by cautionary language. Municipal bond issuers take great \n     care to provide full and accurate disclosure related to their \n     finances and operations and cannot countenance a lesser \n     standard for corporate issuers under any circumstances. No \n     issuer, whether governmental or corporate, should be able to \n     mislead potential investors. In addition, these provisions \n     will be particularly harmful to state and local government \n     pension funds, which rely on corporate information to assist \n     in their investment decisions and would be denied recovery \n     under this section.\n       Aiding and Abetting Liability--There is no language in the \n     bill making aiders and abettors liable for fraud. If aiders \n     and abettors of fraud are immune from civil liability, state \n     and local governments, as issuers of securities, would become \n     the ``deep pockets'' in a lawsuit and, as investors, we would \n     be limited in our ability to recover losses. Our confidence \n     in consultants who assist us in complex municipal bond \n     transactions and in investing public funds is diminished by \n     this bill because these consulting professionals have been \n     granted immunity from responsibility. It is not reasonable to \n     hold out the hope that this important issue can be dealt with \n     in a subsequent bill. It must be dealt with as part of this \n     reform effort or the opportunity will have been lost.\n       Statute of Limitations--It is equally important that the \n     statute of limitations be extended. Otherwise, investors will \n     be harmed by wrongdoers who are able to conceal fraud beyond \n     the allowable period. Again, we do not believe this important \n     change will be given serious consideration in the future if \n     H.R. 1058 is passed in its present form.\n       Loser-Pays Provision--Finally, under the bill, fraud \n     victims would face a potential ``loser-pays'' sanction and \n     possible bond posting requirement at the beginning of a case. \n     We are sure you are aware of the difficulty public officials \n     would have in justifying proceeding with an investor lawsuit \n     if there was also the risk that the injured government \n     investor would have to pay the legal fees of a Wall Street \n     investment banking firm, which is a defendant in a securities \n     lawsuit. To us, this is an unacceptable and unfair approach \n     to investor protection.\n       We urge you to support the President on this important \n     issue. We are not asking you to support frivolous litigation. \n     To the contrary, we want you to support legislation that \n     stops the deplorable strike suits that are the target of \n     securities litigation reform. However, a new law can be \n     fashioned that deals with lawsuit abuses without jeopardizing \n     our most basic and essential investor protections. Our groups \n     pledge to work with the President and members of Congress so \n     that a new law can be fashioned that deals with these \n     concerns.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                             Administrators Association, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 1995.\n     Re securities litigation reform.\n\n     All Members,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing today on behalf of the North \n     American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) to \n     urge you to sustain President Clinton's veto of H.R. 1058, \n     the ``Securities Litigation Reform Act.'' In the U.S., NASAA \n     is the national organization of the 50 state securities \n     agencies.\n       While everyone agrees on the need for constructive \n     improvement in the federal securities litigation process, the \n     reality is that the major provisions of H.R. 1058 go well \n     beyond curbing frivolous lawsuits and will work to shield \n     some of the most egregious wrongdoers from legitimate \n     lawsuits brought by defrauded investors.\n       NASAA supports reform measures that achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     providing relief to honest companies and professionals who \n     may unfairly find themselves the target of frivolous \n     lawsuits. Unfortunately, H.R. 1058 does not achieve this \n     balance. NASAA's \n\n[[Page S19149]]\n     concerns with H.R. 1058 go beyond those articulated by President \n     Clinton in his veto message. In sum, NASAA has the following \n     concerns with H.R. 1058;\n       The bill fails to incorporate a meaningful statute of \n     limitations. This single omission means that all but the most \n     obvious frauds likely will be shielded from civil liability.\n       The bill's safe harbor lowers the standard for assuring the \n     truthfulness of predictive statements about future \n     performance. While we believe that information flow to the \n     marketplace is a vital component of strong markets, we also \n     believe that we should take prudent and reasonable steps to \n     ensure that the information is reasonably reliable. However, \n     rather than assuring the reliability of the forward-looking \n     statement, the bill instead focuses on cautionary \n     statements. Indeed, these cautionary statements likely \n     will become the vaccine to immunize a host of intentional \n     wrongdoing.\n       The bill fails to include aiding and abetting liability for \n     those who participate in fraudulent activity. Failure to \n     include such a provision makes recovery for investors \n     doubtful in cases where the principal defendant is bankrupt, \n     as was true in the notorious Keating/Lincoln Savings and Loan \n     case. The result is that professionals who assisted, and \n     perhaps could have prevented the fraud, would be virtually \n     unreachable in civil actions. Since the bill proposes a \n     proportionate liability system, rather than joint liability, \n     it makes sense to require aiders and abettors of securities \n     fraud to pay their fair share.\n       A provision of the bill's proportionate liability section \n     is unworkable and disfavors older Americans. Under current \n     law, a successful plaintiff may recover judgment from one or \n     more of the defendants responsible. Under H.R. 1058, each \n     defendant will be liable only for his or her proportionate \n     share of the harm. Congress did make an exception in cases \n     where a plaintiff can prove that his or her net worth is less \n     than $200,000. This presents two problems. First, the \n     provision is entirely unworkable in a class action involving \n     hundreds of plaintiffs; because each plaintiff must meet the \n     net worth test, proving individual net worth for hundreds of \n     plaintiffs would not justify the effort for the meager \n     rewards provided for in the bill. Second, the provision \n     specifies that the value of a personal residence must be \n     included in the net worth calculation. This provision will \n     work against older Americans who usually have paid for their \n     homes, although their annual income may be relatively modest. \n     Consequently, if personal residence is not removed from the \n     net worth calculation, these seniors likely will be unable to \n     avail themselves of this provision, even though seniors as a \n     group are more devastated by fraud because many live on fixed \n     incomes and what little they get from investment of their \n     savings.\n       NASAA's view from the outset has been that it is possible \n     to curb frivolous lawsuits without making it equally \n     difficult to pursue rightful claims against those who commit \n     securities fraud. NASAA respectfully urges you to sustain the \n     President's veto and to draft a balanced reform measure that \n     does not harm our system of saving for retirement and \n     preserves the rights of defrauded investors to bring suit \n     under federal securities law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark J. Griffin,\n                                            NASAA President-elect.\n\n\n    Why Support the Securities Litigation Reform Conference Report?\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, when the Senate considered its version of \nsecurities litigation reform, I supported a number of amendments to it \nand eventually voted for the bill. I did so because it is my belief \nthat that the bill stuck the best available balance between protecting \ninvestors from fraud perpetuated by unscrupulous issuers and shielding \ngrowing businesses seeking investment capital from frivolous and costly \nlawsuits.\n  Currently, frivolous lawsuits act as a damper on economic growth--\nimposing additional costs to growth and expansion that are both \nunwarranted and unnecessary. Lawyers can now tie up businesses in years \nof seemingly endless discovery and litigation--thus creating incentives \nfor innocent issuers to settle rather than go through a protracted \nlegal battle. There is little doubt that these suits impose a burden on \nthe economy and should be stopped.\n  At the same time, individual investors need to be able to rely on the \ninformation that they receive about potential products and they need to \nknow that the legal system is there to protect them in the case of an \nunscrupulous issuer.\n  As it has emerged from conference, the bill has been modified in a \nnumber of ways. Much attention has been directed to the pleading \nstandard, the safe harbor, and the fee shifting provisions among other \nissues. The President identified these three area of concern in his \nveto message.\n  I have carefully reviewed the conference report and weighed the \narguments on both sides. My conclusion is that the conference report \nwould, on balance, achieve the goals of I sought when I voted for the \nSenate-passed bill--stemming the tide of meritless litigation while at \nthe same time putting in place certain pro-investor measures. How does \nthe bill do this?\n  First, it ensures that lawsuit must have merit by setting forth \npleading standards which require that plaintiffs must have a basis for \ntheir case before they are allowed to proceed. Many times, a case is \nbrought with little evidence and legal fishing expedition ensues \nthrough the defendant's files. In some cases, firms will settle the \nsuit in order to save themselves the long-run costs associated with \ndiscovery and litigation of the case.\n  Now much has been made of the exact specifications surrounding the \npleading standard in the bill. A number of critics contend that it goes \nbeyond the already stringent standards of the second circuit--and would \nhave the effect of closing the courthouse door for many small \nplaintiffs. Ambiguities in the statement of managers have served only \nto heighten these criticisms. In fact, the language of the bill does \ncodify the second circuit standard in part--and the statement of \nmanagers says so.\n  But even within the second circuit, there are varying interpretations \nof the standard. That is why the conference report deliberately rejects \na complete codification of the second circuit and adopts language which \nis substantially similar to the language in the Senate-passed bill and \nits report language. The major change, the substitution of the words \n``state with particularity'' for ``specifically allege,'' was made at \nthe request of the Judicial Conference and therefore does not \nsubstantially modify the language as passed by the Senate.\n  For investors, the bill would also ensure much greater accuracy in \nthe statements made by issuers of debt and, at the same time, encourage \nthem to disclose more fully, relevant information. The bill achieves \nthis end by creating a workable safe harbor for so-called forward-\nlooking statements--i.e. predictions about the future of a particular \nsecurity. In essence, issuers are required to accompany their \npredictions by ``meaningful cautionary'' language--language that should \nserve as ample warning to potential investors about the risks that the \nparticular security may entail. This safe harbor has been endorsed by \nthe chairman of the SEC.\n  But the SEC has a further role to play to ensure the fairness of the \nsafe harbor. Many critics contend that it will create a ``license to \nlie'' and lead to the duping of unwary investors by unscrupulous \nissuers. There is a strong need for the SEC to add content to the \nregulations written to interpret this bill. Specifically, it will need \nto set out in a clear, rigorous and responsible manner, the facts that \nshould be included in forward-looking statements so that they are truly \n``meaningful and cautionary''. In addition, the Commission needs to \nmake clear which part of the second circuit pleading standard is to be \nenforced and how. The SEC has a role in making this bill work, and its \ninvolvement in the process will be critical to achieving the goals the \nunderlie the conference report.\n  The bill also creates incentives against filing meritless litigation \nby bolstering the use of rule 11--which provides sanctions for filing \nfrivolous lawsuits. Though it exists in current law, rule 11 is rarely \nused. The conference report requires a judge to make a finding as to \nwhether rule 11 has been violated and then to impose sanctions subject \nto the discretion of the court. In addition, the report sets forth \ncircumstances under which the sanctions under rule 11 could be \nmitigated.\n  The bill also contains a number of other provisions designed to first \nreduce the pressure to settle frivolous claims by reforming the \nliability system, second, produce meaningful information about the \nfairness of a settlement by requiring accurate disclosure of settlement \nterms, and third make it easier for participants in a class action to \nunderstand how lawyers are being compensated and to challenge \nattorney's fees by reforming the way in which attorney's fees may be \ncalculated in these suits.\n  Finally, some critics have contended that the bill will truly mean \nthat the small investor will not have access to the judicial system. I \nbelieve that this \n\n[[Page S19150]]\nis not the case. I have already discussed may of the major issues of \nconcern above. There is one additional area that gives me pause. The \nconference report includes a discretionary bonding requirement that was \nnot in the Senate bill. Opponents claim that the possibility of \nrequiring a bond is yet another impediment to small investor access to \nthe judicial system. In fact, the bonding provision is at the \ndiscretion of the judge. Similar bonding options exist in other parts \nof the securities law and have not proven to be particularly \nburdensome. Of course, should the bonding provision prove unworkable or \na true bar to the courthouse, it should be revisited, as should any \nother portion of this bill which becomes problematic. I certainly stand \nready to reconsider this bill should it not achieve the goals which I \nhave set out, but on balance I think its advantages outweigh its \ndisadvantages.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is an old gypsy curse that goes \nlike this: May you be the innocent defendant in a frivolous law suit.\n  It is a curse stopping companies from creating good, high paying \njobs. It is the curse of our economy, of Silicon Valley, our high tech \nbiotech and high-growth companies.\n  Frivolous law suits are the curse of our capital markets.\n  These companies have volitile stock prices. But stock volitility is \nnot stock fraud, yet it is the basis for multimillion lawsuits that \nyield investors pennies on the dollars for their losses and millions \nfor a handful of strike suit lawyers.\n  This legislation had 182 cosponsors in the House and 51 cosponsors in \nthe Senate. It is legislation that was cosponsored by a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators spanning the ideological spectrum--Senator Helms and \nSenator Mikulski.\n  We had 12 days of hearings, hundreds of submissions. Countless \nmeetings and negotiating sessions.\n  The major reforms--the safe harbor and the proportionate liability \nprovisions were not mentioned in the President's veto message. The SEC \nsupports the current safe harbor and its principle concerns have been \nmet regarding the rest of the bill.\n  The President objected to the pleading standard. Yet it is the Second \nCircuit's pleading standard. It is written to the specifications of SEC \nChairman Arthur Levitt.\n  The only difference between the Senate Banking Committee pleading \nstandard and the standard the administration endorsed in June is three \nwords.\n  The Senate Banking Committee provision provided that the complaint \nmust specifically allege facts giving rise to a strong inference.\n  The conference report states that the complaint must ``state with \nparticularity fact . . .''\n  There is no difference between these two statements of the law. The \nchange was made at the request of the Judicial Conference.\n  The President objected to rule 11 attorney sanctions.\n  The sanctions provide greater protections to plaintiffs than \ndefendants.\n  First, a complaint must have substantially violated rule 11 before \nthe attorneys' fees sanctions would be imposed on plaintiffs. \nDefendants can be sanctioned for mere violations of rule 11.\n  Also, the bill gives courts discretion not to award fees in cases \nwhere an award would be unjust or would impose an unreasonable burden \non a party. Providing extraordinary protection to plaintiffs litigating \nagainst corporate defendants.\n  It is one of the only bipartisan attempts at enacting legislation \nthis Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that today's Washington Post editorial be \nprinted in the Record as well as the letter from the National \nAssociation of Investors Corporation representing 360,000 investors \ncalling for veto override. I also ask that a summary of the bill also \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 22, 1995]\n\n                   Override the Securities Bill Veto\n\n       President Clinton was wrong to veto the securities bill. He \n     caved to the trial lawyers lobby, big contributors to the \n     Democratic Party, in a dark-of-night action. Congress should \n     override him. The House of Representatives voted the other \n     day to do just that, with 89 Democrats joining the \n     Republicans. Now it's up to the Senate.\n       This bill would correct important flaws in the securities \n     laws that are being systematically exploited by lawyers in \n     ways that have nothing to do with fairness. When the price of \n     a company's stock drops sharply, the present law invites \n     suits on the questionable grounds that the company's past \n     expressions of hope for its future misled innocent \n     stockholders.\n       This kind of suit has turned out to be a special danger to \n     new companies, particularly high-technology ventures with \n     volatile stock prices. The country has a strong interest in \n     encouraging these companies and shielding them from a style \n     of legal assault that is not far from extortion. The bill \n     would protect companies' forecasts as long as they did not \n     omit significant facts.\n       Under present law, the first lawyer to file one of these \n     strike suits controls the litigation regardless of who else \n     might sue on the same grounds later. Frequently the lawyers \n     who specialize in this work settle their suits on terms that \n     bring trivial benefits to the shareholders but fat fees to \n     the lawyers themselves. The bill that Mr. Clinton vetoed \n     would instead give the judge the authority to pick the lead \n     plaintiff--usually the plaintiff with the biggest stake in \n     the outcome. Plaintiffs would then choose their own lawyers \n     and make their own decisions on whether and how to settle. \n     That is clearly a desirable reform and a major improvement in \n     shareholders' rights.\n       Mr. Clinton vetoed the bill because, he said, it would make \n     too many difficulties for shareholders with legitimate \n     grievances. There bill has been under intense debate and \n     negotiation between the two parties for nearly a year, and if \n     these defects are as significant as the president suggests, \n     it's strange that the administration did not make an issue of \n     them earlier.\n       More broadly, Mr. Clinton speaks of future injustices that \n     he believes this bill might create but has little to say \n     about the real and substantial injustices that the present \n     law is creating. Overriding his veto will end an egregious \n     misuse of securities laws in ways that harm both companies \n     and shareholders.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                              Investors Corp.,\n\n                                 Royal Oak, MI, December 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the more than 360,000 \n     individual members and 18,000 investment clubs belonging to \n     the National Association of Investors Corporation, I am \n     writing to commend your efforts to override the misguided \n     presidential veto of H.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation \n     Reform Bill of 1995. Founded in 1951, NAIC is by far the \n     largest membership organization of investors in the United \n     States.\n       H.R. 1058 is an investor protection bill. It strengthens \n     the government's tools for fighting corporate securities \n     fraud, while it imposes long-awaited curbs on ``strike \n     suits''--fraudulent lawsuits that cheat investors while \n     pretending to help them. We urge you to work your hardest to \n     override the veto and give investors relief from meritless \n     litigation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth S. Janke,\n     President & CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Selected Bill Provisions of the Conference Report to H.R. 1058/S. 240\n\n       The federal securities laws provide a comprehensive legal \n     framework designed to protect investors in the securities \n     markets, to provide ground rules for companies seeking to \n     raise money in our capital markets and to encourage \n     disclosure of more, and accurate information about publicly \n     traded companies. This bill updates our securities laws to \n     better achieve these objectives in a balanced way. It \n     restores integrity to securities class action litigation by \n     filtering out abusive, frivolous class action lawsuits that \n     harm investors and only benefit class action attorneys.\n       Adequate plaintiff standard.--Same as Senate-passed bill, \n     with minor technical changes.\n       The objective: To provide a mechanism for ``plaintiff \n     empowerment.'' To diminish the likelihood that these cases \n     will be class action attorney-driven in the future. To allow \n     real clients with real financial interests to be \n     appropriately in charge of the lawsuit. To restore to real \n     clients traditional control over their entrepreneurial \n     counsel.\n       Under the private rights of action provisions of our \n     securities laws, investors may sue to recover damages they \n     incur as a result of the actions of corporations and other \n     firms who violate the federal securities laws. These private \n     lawsuits should serve a dual role. First, they should provide \n     a means for investors to obtain recovery for damages caused \n     by fraudulent activity. Second, they should serve as an \n     important adjunct to the SEC's enforcement efforts.\n       Class actions should protect the public and compensate the \n     injured. Increasingly, however, private securities class \n     action litigation has become dominated by entrepreneurial \n     attorneys who decide which companies to sue, when to sue and \n     when and for how much to settle. Investors play an \n     insignificant role in these multi-million dollar lawsuits. \n     The situation is best illustrated by one prominent securities \n     class action lawyer declaring: ``I have the best practice of \n     law in the world: \n\n[[Page S19151]]\n     I have no clients.'' This provision reasserts plaintiffs' role by: \n     allowing any party who receives notice of the suit to come \n     forward within 60 days of the filing of the suit to petition \n     the court to act as lead plaintiff; creating a presumption \n     that the ``most adequate plaintiff'' is the party with the \n     greatest financial interest in the outcome of the litigation; \n     allowing the ``most adequate plaintiff'' to exercise \n     traditional plaintiff functions, including selecting lead \n     counsel and negotiating counsel's fees; allowing ``most \n     adequate plaintiff'' to make decisions regarding settlements; \n     replacing the ``plaintiff steering committee'' and ``guardian \n     ad litem'' provisions in the original S. 240.\n       Second circuit pleading standard becomes the uniform \n     rule.--Same as Senate-passed bill; Senator Specter's \n     amendment deleted from conference report.\n       The objective: To provide a filter at the earliest stage \n     (the pleading stage) to screen out lawsuits that have no \n     factual basis. To provide a clearer statement of plaintiffs' \n     claims and scope of the case. To encourage attorneys to use \n     greater care in drafting their complaints. To make it easier \n     for innocent defendants to get cases against them dismissed \n     early in the process. To eliminate the split among circuits \n     dealing with pleading requirements for scienter. To codify \n     the requirements in the 2nd Circuit.\n       A complaint should outline the facts supporting the \n     lawsuit. Too often, complaints consist of boilerplate \n     legalese and conclusions. An alleged Rule 10(b) or 10b-5 \n     violation is a very serious charge. Asserting simply that \n     ``the defendant acted with intent to defraud'' is a \n     conclusion that should be insufficient to start a multi-\n     million dollar lawsuit. Under the Conference Agreement, the \n     complaint must set forth the facts supporting each of the \n     alleged misstatements or omissions and must include facts \n     that give rise to a ``strong inference'' of scienter or \n     intent. If the complaint does not meet these requirements, \n     the lawsuit will be terminated. This is a codification of the \n     2nd Circuit rule.\n       Too often, securities class action suits are characterized \n     by the ``sue them all and let the judge sort it out'' \n     mentality. But before the judge can sort it out, innocent \n     defendants are required to spend a great deal of time and \n     money to defend against specious claims. This bill corrects \n     that problem by requiring plaintiffs to specify the \n     statements alleged to have been misleading. This conforms \n     securities actions with Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure.\n       Safe harbor for predictive statements.--New provision; \n     Changes address concerns raised by the SEC and during the \n     floor debate.\n       The objective: To encourage disclosure of information by \n     companies. To provide a procedural mechanism for responsibly-\n     acting companies who make predictive statements to be \n     protected from frivolous litigation if their prediction does \n     not materialize. To provide judges with additional procedural \n     tools to deal with frivolous cases involving predictive \n     statements.\n       A central principle underlying our securities laws is that \n     investors should receive accurate and timely information \n     about publicly traded companies. By its definition, a \n     forward-looking statement is a prediction about the future. \n     Earnings projections, growth rate projections, dividend \n     projections, and expected order rates are examples of \n     forward-looking statements.\n       Forward-looking information is of significant value to \n     investors in making informed investment decisions. It is this \n     forward-looking information that allows efficient allocation \n     of resources, ensuring that the market prices of publicly \n     traded securities best reflect their intrinsic value. The SEC \n     Rule 175 permits issuers to make forward looking statements \n     about certain categories of information provided that the \n     prediction is made in ``good faith'' with a ``reasonable \n     basis.'' Currently, this SEC ``safe harbor'' rule actually \n     discourages issuers from voluntary disclosing this \n     information. To quote the SEC:\n       ``Some have suggested that companies that makes voluntary \n     disclosure of forward-looking information subject themselves \n     to a significantly increased risk of securities antifraud \n     class actions.'' As such, ``contrary to the Commission's \n     original intent, the safe harbor is currently invoked on a \n     very limited basis in the litigation context.'' Critics state \n     that the safe harbor is ineffective in ensuring quick and \n     inexpensive dismissal of frivolous private lawsuits.'' (SEC \n     Securities Act of 1993 Release No. 7101, October 1994)\n       An American Stock Exchange survey supports that conclusion. \n     It found that 75 percent of corporate CEOs limit the \n     information disclosed to investors out of fear that greater \n     disclosure would lead to an abusive lawsuit.\n       As the SEC has realized, forward-looking statements are \n     predictions--not promises. This Conference Report creates a \n     statutory ``safe harbor'' which:\n       Provides a clear definition of ``forward looking \n     statement'' for both the `33 and `34 Acts.\n       Permits greater flexibity by creating a bifurcated safe \n     harbor.\n       The safe harbor's first prong expands upon the judicially \n     created ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine. This safe harbor:\n       1. Protects a written or oral statement that is identified \n     as forward-looking.\n       2. Requires that the predictive statement contain a \n     meaningful cautionary statement which identifies business \n     factors describing why the prediction may not come true.\n       3. Focuses on the statement and how it was made.\n       4. Does not allow an inquiry into the state of mind of the \n     speaker.\n       The safe harbor's second prong provides an alternative \n     analysis if the statement is not made in a way consistent \n     with the warning requirements of the bespeaks caution test. \n     This prong:\n       1. Applies to written and oral statements.\n       2. Focuses on the speaker's state of mind.\n       3. Protects companies from liability unless the prediction \n     was made with actual knowledge that it was false.\n       4. Protects companies from liability unless the prediction \n     was made or ratified by an executive officer with actual \n     knowledge that it was false.\n       5. Gives no safe harbor protection for ``knowingly false or \n     misleading'' statements. This addresses Senator Sarbanes \n     concern that the safe harbor would permit corporate \n     executives to mislead investors. There is no so-called \n     ``license to lie''.\n       The Conference Report also creates a new safe harbor for \n     oral statements which requires that the oral statement warn \n     listeners that the statement is a prediction, that the \n     prediction may not come true, and tell investors where they \n     can find additional information about the prediction in SEC \n     filings or press releases.\n       Both safe harbors protect statements made by issuers, \n     persons acting on their behalf such as officers, directors, \n     employees, outside reviewers retained by the issuer and \n     underwriters with respect to information they receive from \n     issuers. Accounting and law firms are eligible for the safe \n     harbor, brokers and dealers are not.\n       The safe harbor provides no protection for certain \n     transactions and parties, like initial public offerings \n     (IPOs), penny stocks, roll-up transactions, going private \n     transactions, tender offers, partnerships, limited liability \n     corporations or direct participation investments and issuers \n     who have violated the securities laws. Also, the safe harbor \n     does not protect forward-looking statements included in \n     financial statements.\n       Conference report drops the provision authorizing the SEC \n     to sue for damages on behalf of investors in predictive \n     statement cases. (Senate-passed bill provision).\n       Encourages SEC to review the need for additional safe \n     harbors.\n       Litigation cost containment provisions--Discovery Stay.--\n     Same as Senate-passed bill.\n       The objective: To limit the in terrorem nature of defending \n     a frivolous class action securities lawsuit. To require the \n     judge to determine whether the case has any merit prior to \n     subjecting the defendants to the time and expense of turning \n     over the company's records. To provide for a ``stay of \n     discovery'' pending a motion to dismiss. This ``stay'' \n     provides the defendants with the opportunity to have a motion \n     for a dismissal considered prior to the plaintiffs' lawyers \n     beginning ``discovery.'' This discovery usually consists of \n     requests for voluminous documents and time consuming \n     depositions of company CEOs and other key employees.\n       A typical tactic of plaintiff lawyers is to request an \n     extensive list of documents and to schedule an ambitious \n     agenda of depositions that often distract the company CEO and \n     other key officers and directors. Discovery costs comprise \n     eighty percent of the expense of defending a securities class \n     action lawsuit. To minimize the in terroem impact of the \n     frivolous cases, the Conference Report:\n       Requires the court to suspend discovery during the pendency \n     of any motion to dismiss unless discovery is needed to \n     preserve evidence or prevent undue prejudice. A stay of \n     discovery puts such requests for documents and deposition \n     schedules on hold until the judge rules on whether the case \n     should be kicked out of court.\n       Prohibits parties in securities fraud cases to destroy or \n     alter documents.\n       Attorney sanctions for filing frivolous securities fraud \n     suits--enhanced rule 11.--Same as Senate-passed bill, with \n     technical changes.\n       The objective: To deter plaintiffs' attorneys from filing \n     meritless securities class actions. To make attorneys, not \n     investors, bear responsibility of filing frivolous cases. To \n     require judges to review the conduct of attorneys and to \n     discipline those who file frivolous law suits and abuse our \n     judicial system. To encourage attorneys to use greater care \n     in drafting complaints and create a speed bump to slow the \n     ``race to the courthouse.''\n       Frivolous securities suits filed with little or no research \n     into their merits can cost companies hundreds of thousands of \n     dollars in legal fees and company time. According to a sample \n     of cases provided by the National Association of Securities \n     and Commercial Law Attorneys (NASCAT), 21 percent of the \n     class action securities cases were filed within 48 hours of a \n     triggering event such as a missed earnings projection \n     announcement.\n       Innocent companies pay millions of dollars defending these \n     frivolous cases. Even when firms are exonerated they have \n     large defense attorney's bills to pay. Our current system is \n     a ``winner pays'' system.\n       Attorneys should be required to exercise due diligence \n     before they file these expensive lawsuits and they should be \n     sanctioned if they fail to exercise proper care. Accordingly, \n     this Conference Agreement:\n       Requires the judge, upon final disposition of the case, to \n     make specific findings regarding whether the complaint, \n     responsive pleadings and dispositive motions complied with \n     the requirements of Rule 11(b) of the Federal \n\n[[Page S19152]]\n     Rules of Civil Procedures. Rule 11 provides sanctions for filing \n     frivolous lawsuits. (This differs from the Senate-passed \n     bill, which required judges to review the entire record; \n     judges felt that this was too burdensome given the voluminous \n     record in these class actions.)\n       Requires the judge to discipline lawyers if the judge finds \n     that the lawyer violated the rule. Under the Conference \n     Agreement, the judge would require an offending attorney to \n     pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the innocent \n     party as the punishment for filing a frivolous lawsuit. This \n     is a rebuttable presumption.\n       A party may rebut the presumption with proof that the award \n     of fees and costs will impose an undue burden on the \n     violator, provided that the failure to impose fees and costs \n     does not impose a greater burden on the victim of the \n     violation. Also, may rebut the presumption with proof that \n     the Rule 11 violation was de minimis.\n       Does not create a ``loser pays'' rule. It merely adds teeth \n     to existing Rule 11.\n       Attorney fee reform: Limits the use of the lodestar method \n     of calculating attorneys' fees, and replaces it with a more \n     easily understood disclosure of attorneys' fees.--Same as \n     Senate-passed bill.\n       The objective: To closer align the interests of the \n     plaintiffs with their entrepreneurial lawyers. To make it \n     easier for the class to understand how the lawyers are being \n     compensated and to challenge attorneys' fees. To ensure that \n     attorneys' fees do not unnecessarily conflict with the \n     interests of the plaintiffs.\n       Plaintiffs' attorneys fees are often calculate by the \n     ``lodestar method.'' Under this calculation, a lodestar \n     amount is determined by multiplying the attorney's hours \n     worked by a reasonable hourly fee, adjusted by a multiplier \n     to reflect the risk of litigation and other factors. It \n     encourages abuses, (like performance of unjustified work), \n     which protracts the litigation. From the judiciary's point of \n     view, lodestar adds inefficiency to the process. From the \n     investors' point of view, it is difficult to figure out what \n     the lawyer did and how much they are getting paid for doing \n     it.\n       This Conference Report limits attorney's fees in a class \n     action to an easy to understand percentage of the amount \n     actually recovered as a result of the attorney's efforts--\n     rather than allowing attorneys to recover their fees without \n     regard to how well the class does. This gives lawyers an \n     incentive to get higher recoveries for investors, not just \n     bill more hours. This is extremely important in ensuring that \n     the attorneys' incentives coincide with those of the class. \n     This bill also provides the class members with the \n     information they need to make an informed judgment on \n     attorneys' fees and settlement offers. The provision provides \n     better disclosure to the injured parties so they can \n     determined whether they may want to challenge their \n     attorneys' claim to the settlement fund.\n       Disclosure of settlement terms.--Same as Senate-passed \n     bill.\n       The objective: to replace meaningless legalese and \n     boilerplate conclusions with meaningful information about the \n     per share amount a proposed settlement would provide. To \n     provide information about the fairness of the settlement and \n     an evaluation of whether more could be obtained if the case \n     went to trial.\n       The Conference Agreement would provide class members with \n     information about the proposed settlement, including the \n     total amount of the settlement, and the total amount of \n     attorneys' fees sought from the settlement fund. If the \n     parties cannot agree upon the amount of damages which would \n     be recoverable, the disclosure of the settlement offer must \n     state the reasons why the parties disagree.\n       Proportionate liability.--Same as Senate-passed bill, with \n     technical changes.\n       The objective: To reduce the pressure to settle frivolous \n     claims. To provide a two-tier liability system which retains \n     joint and several liability for those participants who \n     ``knowingly'' engage in a fraudulent scheme and proportionate \n     liability for those participants who are only incidentally \n     involved (those who are ``less than knowing in their \n     conduct.'')\n       The Conference Agreement ensures that those primarily \n     responsible for the plaintiffs' loss bear the primary burden \n     in making the plaintiffs whole. Under current law, co-\n     defendants each have ``joint and several'' liability for 100 \n     percent of the damages--irrespective of their role in a \n     fraudulent scheme. This has caused ``deep pockets'' such as \n     law firms, accounting firms, and securities firms to be named \n     as defendants merely to extract a settlement from them.\n       The Conference Report requires that each co-defendant pay \n     for his share of the damages caused. Provisions protect \n     investors in the event a co-defendant is insolvent. The \n     National Association of Securities and Commercial Law \n     Attorneys (NASCAT) submission suggested that of the 66 cases \n     they provided us with information on, 25 percent had an \n     insolvent co-defendant. The bill contains provisions to \n     ensure that investors are compensated in cases where there is \n     an insolvent co-defendant. Specifically, the Conference \n     Report--\n       Requires the courts to determine who has committed a \n     ``knowing securities violation'', and holds them jointly and \n     severally liable for the plaintiff's damages. All others are \n     held proportionately liable.\n       Protects plaintiffs from insolvent co-defendants. Provides \n     that when plaintiffs are unable to collect a portion of their \n     damages from an invovlent co-defendant, the proportionately \n     liable defendants would chip in additional funds. \n     Proportionally liable co-defandants could be required to pay \n     up to 150% of their share of the damages.\n       Provides special protection for small investors by holdings \n     all defendants jointly and severally liable for the \n     uncollectible shares of insolvent co-defendants for certain \n     plaintiffs whose damages are more than 10% of their net \n     worth, and if their net worth is less than $200,000.\n       Contribution reform.--Same as Senate-passed bill, with \n     minor change involving indemnification agreements.\n       The objective: To provide uniformity among the circuits. To \n     ensure that defendants are not unfairly required to pay more \n     than their fair share of damages.\n       If a plaintiff is unable to recover damages from a \n     defendant, the Conference Report requires the remaining \n     defendants to make up at least a portion of that difference. \n     Those co-defendants may then recover contributions from any \n     other person who would have been liable for the same damages. \n     Contribution claims will be based upon the percentage of \n     responsibility of the claimant and the parties against whom \n     contribution is sought. Further, the Conference Report:\n       Encourages settlement by discharging from liability any \n     defendant who enters into a good faith settlement with the \n     plaintiff before a verdict or judgment.\n       Allows parties to take advantage of indemnification \n     agreements with issuers and recover fees and costs associated \n     with the action as long as the defendant prevails at trial.\n       Fraud detection and disclosure.--Same as Senate-passed \n     bill.\n       The objective: To exposure fraud before investors lose \n     money.\n       The Conference Agreement establishes a clear and immediate \n     duty on the part of auditors to inform company management of \n     any material illegal acts they uncover in their audit. If the \n     auditors fail to take appropriate action promptly they are \n     subject to a civil penalty.\n       This is a Kerry-Wyden bill and the conferees believe it \n     belongs in the package or reforms. It is very important for \n     the accounting profession to be vigilant in their public \n     watchdog role.\n       Other provisions retained in the conference agreement.--\n     Same as Senate-passed bill, except for minor change to RICO \n     provision.\n       Makes sure all shareholders are treated equally by greatly \n     restricting lawyers' ability to negotiate bonus payments for \n     their ``pet plaintiffs'' or ``professional plaintiffs'' who \n     let the lawyers use their names to file lawsuits.\n       Prohibits brokers and dealers from receiving referral fees \n     for giving names of clients to class action attorneys.\n       Requires a court to determine whether an attorney who own \n     stock in the company he is suing constitutes a conflict of \n     interest that should disqualify him from action as counsel.\n       Prohibits the payment of SEC disgorgement funds to \n     plaintiffs' lawyers.\n       Prohibits keeping settlement terms a secret by greatly \n     limiting the use of settlements under seal.\n       Eliminates private actions for securities fraud under the \n     ``civil RICO'' (the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n     Organization Act), except against those previously criminally \n     convicted of securities fraud. (this is the minor change).\n       Requires the court to submit to the jury a written \n     interrogatory (question) on the issue of each defendant's \n     state of mind at the time of the alleged violation to make it \n     less likely that individuals only accidentally involved in \n     the scheme are held liable.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I was very surprised and disappointed \nyesterday when I heard that President Clinton had vetoed the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Two weeks ago the Senate \npassed this bill by a bipartisan vote of 65 to 30 and until 30 minutes \nbefore the deadline Tuesday night, President Clinton indicated that he \nwould support this bill.\n  As I pointed out when the Senate was debating the conference report \nto this bill, President Clinton had a clear choice. If he supported \nthis bill, he supported creating jobs for Americans by reducing \nfrivolous, costly lawsuits on businesses. If he opposed it, he only \nsupported enriching the pockets of wealthy trial lawyers at the expense \nof consumers and investors. It's too bad he chose the latter.\n  President Clinton talks a lot about being concerned about middle-\nclass Americans. It is my understanding that he invited some wealthy \ntrial lawyers over for dinner the other night to thank them for a \nmillion dollar contribution. It's unfortunate that he decided to come \ndown on their side, instead of the side of ordinary working Americans \nand small investors.\n  These wealthy trial lawyers devote their professional lives to gaming \nthe system by filing ``strike'' suits alleging violations of the \nFederal securities laws--all in the hope that the defendant will settle \nquickly in order to avoid the expense of drawn-out litigation. \n\n[[Page S19153]]\n\n  Of course, these strike suits are often baseless. If a stock price \nfalls, these lawyers will file a class-action suit claiming that the \ncompany was too optimistic in their projections. If the stock price \nsoars, these same lawyers will file suit saying that the company \nwithheld information that caused shareholders to sell too early. In \neffect, the lawsuits act as a litigation tax that raises the cost of \ncapital and chills disclosure of important corporate information to \nshareholders.\n  The high-tech, high-growth companies of Silicon Valley, CA are \nparticularly vulnerable to these fraudulent and abusive lawsuits \nbecause of the volatility of their stock prices. Over 50 percent of the \ntop 100 businesses in Silicon Valley have been sued at least once. And \nthe $500 million in so-called damages, the majority of which goes to \nthe wealthy trial lawyers, is money that could have been used to create \njobs and pay higher salaries to the working-class in the high-tech \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has been working for years in a bipartisan \nmanner to pass legislation on this issue. Yesterday, the House, in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, voted 319 to 100 to override \nPresident Clinton's veto. This is a good and fair bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to do likewise and support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. Let me \nstart where I did yesterday, Mr. President. It is no great pleasure \nthat I stand here this morning urging my colleagues to override \nPresident Clinton's veto of this bill. This is not something that I \nsought or welcome at all. I regret that it has come to this, \nparticularly since about 98 percent of this legislation the President \nendorsed. It is on about 2 percent, on technical points, over 11 \nwords--there are 12,000 words, roughly, in this legislation, and 11 \nwords out of the 12,000, we were informed after all the negotiations, \nwould be a problem.\n  Therefore, I regret deeply that we are in this situation, after 4 \nyears, 12 congressional hearings, over 100 witnesses, 5,000 pages of \ntestimony, and committee reports, and truly a bipartisan effort, going \nback to 1991. It has come down to a pleading standards disappointment \nand a disagreement over rule 11. Consider all of the other things that \nhave been accomplished with this legislation dealing with proportionate \nliability and safe harbor, the lead plaintiff issues--they were all \nmajor, major efforts that involved a tremendous amount of work.\n  I will point out, as my colleague from New York has, this morning's \nlead editorial in the Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 22, 1995]\n\n                   Override the Securities Bill Veto\n\n       President Clinton was wrong to veto the securities bill. He \n     caved to the trial lawyers' lobby, big contributors to the \n     Democratic Party, in a dark-of-night action. Congress should \n     override him. The House of Representatives voted the other \n     day to do just that, with 89 Democrats joining the \n     Republicans. Now it's up to the Senate.\n       This bill would correct important flaws in the securities \n     laws that are being systematically exploited by lawyers in \n     ways that have nothing to do with fairness. When the price of \n     a company's stock drops sharply, the present law invites \n     suits on the questionable grounds that the company's past \n     expressions of hope for its future misled innocent \n     stockholders.\n       This kind of suit has turned out to be a special danger to \n     new companies, particularly high-technology ventures with \n     volatile stock prices. The country has a strong interest in \n     encouraging these companies and shielding them from a style \n     of legal assault that is not far from extortion. The bill \n     would protect companies' forecasts as long as they did not \n     omit significant facts.\n       Under present law, the first lawyer to file one of these \n     strike suits controls the litigation regardless of who else \n     might sue on the same grounds later. Frequently the lawyers \n     who specialize in this work settle their suits on terms that \n     bring trivial benefits to the shareholders but fat fees to \n     the lawyers themselves. The bill that Mr. Clinton vetoed \n     would instead give the judge the authority to pick the lead \n     plaintiff--usually the plaintiff with the biggest stake in \n     the outcome. Plaintiffs would then choose their own lawyers \n     and make their own decisions on whether and how to settle. \n     That is clearly a desirable reform and a major improvement in \n     shareholders' rights.\n       Mr. Clinton vetoed the bill because, he said, it would make \n     too many difficulties for shareholders with legitimate \n     grievances. There are two things to be said about that. This \n     bill has been under intense debate and negotiation between \n     the two parties for nearly a year, and if these defects are \n     as significant as the president suggests, it's strange that \n     the administration did not make an issue of them earlier.\n       More broadly, Mr. Clinton speaks of future injustices that \n     he believes this bill might create but has little to say \n     about the real and substantial injustices that the present \n     law is creating. Overriding his veto will end an egregious \n     misuse of securities laws in ways that harm both companies \n     and shareholders.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just reading the last paragraph:\n\n       More broadly, Mr. Clinton speaks of future injustices that \n     he believes the bill might create but has little to say about \n     the real and substantial injustices that present law is \n     creating. Overriding his veto will end an egregious misuse of \n     securities laws in ways that harm both companies and \n     shareholders.\n\n  That is the thrust of all of this. The present system is fatally \nflawed and broken. It is costing billions of dollars each year to \nmaintain the present system. That we all know.\n  As I said yesterday, if in the pleading standards--which we adopted, \nby the way, and the administration last June endorsed the language in \nthe bill, calling them sensible and workable--we adopted the language \nas recommended by the Judicial Conference, not proponents or opponents \nof the legislation, but the Judicial Conference, who represents the \nFederal judiciary, the judges in this country. They recommended the \nlanguage we included in the bill.\n  Therefore, I am mystified why one would object to the language that \nthe judges who sit and preside over these matters have recommended. \nRule 11 is a very simple matter. Rule 11 exists in order to penalize \nthe attorneys who bring frivolous lawsuits. We put some teeth in it. If \nyou bring a frivolous lawsuit and you cause a defendant tremendous \neconomic harm through attorney's fees, as we saw in one case where a \n$15,000 contract that one company entered into cost them $7 million in \nlegal fees, that the case was thrown out of court. The people who pay \nthat $7 million are usually not the chief executive officers of those \ncompanies, but the employees, shareholders, investors, and others who \nbear the financial burden. It is estimated that some $32 billion each \nyear is put in play as a result of these strike suits. We hoped that we \nwould be able to have a Presidential signature confirming the \nbipartisan effort in this area.\n  Mr. President, it is with a deep sense of regret that I am on the \nopposite side of my President on this issue. But I believe that the \noverride is the proper course to follow here. For those reasons, I urge \nmy colleagues to continue to support this legislation, as many have \nover the last 4 years, in committee votes, votes here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate and, of course, in the conference report, as well, that \nhas come back from the House and the Senate after the negotiations.\n  This is a very important issue, Mr. President. It sends a very \nimportant signal. We have these new startup, high-technology companies \nthat represent, I think, the future of employment for this country for \nthe 21st century. These companies where a stock fluctuates a few points \nand there is complaint filed against them, covering millions of dollars \nin settlement fees, is something that ought to be changed.\n\n  We have put together a good, strong bill that I think addresses the \nmajor concerns that people raised over the years about this issue. I am \npleased so many of my colleagues--almost 70 of them here, as well as in \nexcess of 300 in the House--have supported this effort. I regret, \nagain, that the President decided to veto the legislation. We can \ncorrect that this morning by overriding this veto, adopting this \nlegislation, and getting about the other business of this body.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. President, this vote is on an important piece of legislation, but \nit also \n\n[[Page S19154]]\nsends a message about what this Congress is all about and what its \nMembers stand for. First, I would like to compliment the proponents of \nthis legislation. They have done an artful and a masterful job in \nframing the issue in the context of the lawyers, and this is lawyer \nbashing. No one loves lawyers, and no would fails to acknowledge that \nthere is clearly some abuse on the part of some lawyers, but if we \nlisten to the arguments the proponents have advanced this morning, you \nwould think that a relatively small group of lawyers, who specialize in \nrepresenting consumers and small investors in class actions, who have \nbeen swindled as a result of investor fraud, would be responsible for \nall of the ills that confront modern civilization, from the Federal \ndeficit that we wrestle with today, to the spread of communism in the \n1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's.\n  At the same time, the proponents of this legislation have obscured \nthe fact that troubles me most, and that is that this legislation will \naffect a lot of innocent people who have lost money as a result of \ninvestor fraud.\n  Somehow, the voices of seniors and consumers, small investors, \nfirefighters, policemen, attorneys general, mayors and securities \nregulators, State treasurers, local government treasurers, treasurers \ninvolved with universities and colleges, somehow their concerns which \nhave been advanced and articulated have been ignored.\n  If I impart nothing else to my colleagues today, I would like \neveryone who is listening to this debate to know that this bill will, \nin fact, adversely affect meritorious lawsuits and small investors who \nfind it much more difficult to recover their savings. There is no doubt \nthat this bill will address frivolous lawsuits. But that could have \nbeen done, Mr. President--nobody disagrees with the need to correct \nthose abuses. We could have crafted a narrow piece of legislation that \nwould have addressed that issue and yet, at the same time, protected \nsmall investors.\n  What will the impact be of precluding countless meritorious suits \nbeing filed? Nobody knows, but it is safe to say crooks will be \nemboldened, investor confidence in our markets will go down, and \ndefrauded investors will not be compensated. The integrity of America's \nsecurity markets, the envy of the world, will suffer as a consequence.\n  As some indication as to how overreaching this piece of legislation \nis, how one-sided it is, can anyone tell me what the logic is to say if \na plaintiff's lawyer files a frivolous motion the attorney pays the \ncost of the entire lawsuit, but if a defense lawyer files a frivolous \nmotion, he or she pays only the cost of that motion? It seems to me \nwhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There ought to be \nequal sanctions both as to plaintiff's lawyers and defendant's lawyers \nwho act in an irresponsible, frivolous fashion.\n  I have yet to hear an argument advanced on the floor as to why we do \nnot extend the statute of limitations as has been requested. Why should \na crook who disguises his fraud for 3 years be able to avoid the class \naction penalty? I know of no reason why we should not correct a \nsituation which currently exists that those who aid and abet fraud \ncurrently face no liability. What is the logic of that? What does that \nhave to do with frivolous lawsuits?\n  That, Mr. President, is why I am so deeply troubled by the message \nthat we send today. President Clinton has said he is prepared to sign a \ngood bill. Senator Sarbanes, Senator Boxer, and others who have taken \nthe floor to express concerns, we are prepared to support legislation \nthat deals with frivolous lawsuits. But what we have is a piece of \nlegislation that moves to the floor and apparently will now move to be \nenacted that is not designed solely for frivolous lawsuits but goes \nmuch further.\n  What happens if the President's veto is sustained? The sponsors can \ncome back with a bill that fixes the excesses.\n  We are going to have securities litigation reform legislation this \nCongress. President Clinton has said he is prepared to sign a good \nbill, and there is unanimity that measures to curb abuses should be \nenacted.\n  What we are in disagreement over is will we enact balanced, \nreasonable reforms or will we go overboard in our zeal.\n  What message are we sending by overrriding the President's veto \ntoday? We are saying forget about balance, forget about reasonableness. \nIf you got the votes to crush small investors and consumers, go for it.\n  I can honestly say this bill is the most one-sided, anticonsumer bill \nI have seen.\n  This will be a sad day if we fail to sustain the President's veto. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this override and let us come back \nand send the President a balanced bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think we have said everything that has \nto be said. I know we want to commence voting at 11:15, so I yield \nback. Unless any of my colleagues on the other side want to use the \nbalance of the time, I yield back our time so we can take up the other \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19146-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19154-S19178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes for closing remarks on the conference report accompanying H.R. \n4, to be divided in the usual form.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 4 to restore the \n     American family, reduce illegitimacy, control welfare \n     spending and reduce welfare dependence.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, to begin, I ask there be printed in the \nRecord an editorial in this morning's Washington Post entitled ``Hard \nHearts, Soft Heads.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 22, 1995]\n\n                        Hard Hearts, Soft Heads\n\n       President Clinton earlier this year gave way too much \n     ground in endorsing one bad welfare bill. Yesterday, he \n     finally took the right stance in announcing that he would \n     veto a successor bill that is even worse. Better late than \n     never, and not a moment too soon.\n       His announcement came as the House passed this terrible \n     piece of legislation and the Senate prepared to take it up. \n     This time, Mr. Clinton should stick to his position, and the \n     bill's opponent should have the political will to sustain any \n     veto. That would provide the one chance of passing welfare \n     reform that does what it claims--or, failing that, of at \n     least avoiding a dangerous step toward something worse even \n     than the current system.\n       Advocates of this bill's deep cuts in programs for the poor \n     and its ending of welfare's ``entitlement'' status like to \n     cast themselves as true friends of the poor and foes of \n     ``dependency.'' Their hardheadedness, they insist, grows from \n     warm-heartedness and a desire to promote work.\n       But the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human \n     resources heard a very different analysis from Lawrence M. \n     Mead, a welfare expert much respected by Republicans and \n     conservatives. Prof. Mead was not at all confident that \n     Congress's welfare proposal would do much to promote work. On \n     the contrary, he said, it imposes theoretical ``work \n     requirements'' that states will have great trouble meeting. \n     He suggested that the states might just dump work \n     requirements entirely and take the modest 5 percent cut in \n     federal aid that the bill proposes. This is ``workfare''?\n       But hear out Mr. Mead's argument. ``To promote serious \n     reform, it is crucial that Congress manifest that work \n     requirements are serious, and also that it is possible to \n     meet them,'' he said. ``I fear that the new stipulations are \n     not credible as they stand. They call for participation rates \n     never before realized except in a few localities, yet they \n     provide no specific funding or program comparable to JOBS \n     [the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program] to realize \n     them. The demands made look excessive, but it is also \n     doubtful whether Congress really means to enforce them.'' \n     Imagine that: a bill that claims to be historic whose work \n     requirements are essentially rhetorical.\n       If Congress wants a welfare ``reform'' that will do little \n     to encourage work while endangering the basic systems of \n     support for poor children, this bill is just the ticket. But \n     that's a strange place for a ``revolutionary'' Congress to \n     end up.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last evening, I had occasion to remark \nthat persons most specifically critical of the welfare measure before \nthe Senate have been conservative social scientists who understand the \nextent of the problem we face and the resources needed if we are going \nto achieve anything.\n  I mentioned Prof. Lawrence Mead. It turns out he prepared a report \nfor the Republican Caucus in the House saying ``Your bill is a \ndisaster, can't you see that?'' and readers will do so.\n  Several of those of us who voted against this measure in September \nare \n\n[[Page S19155]]\non the floor. My friend from Minnesota, may I yield him 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from New York. Mr. President, I \nvoted for this piece of legislation when it first came to the Senate. I \nasked the question, will this bill called ``reform'' lead to more \nchildren who are impoverished and more hunger among children? I said, \nif so, I would vote ``no.'' I voted ``no.''\n  Two studies have come out since that time that said that is exactly \nwhat would happen. Now we have a conference report even more harsh, \neven more punitive, without basic medical assistance, guarantees of \nmedical assistance coverage, with even more drastic cuts in nutrition \nprograms for children.\n  Mr. President, this is too harsh. It is too extreme. It is beyond the \ngoodness of America. It is punitive toward children. We should not vote \nfor a piece of legislation that will mean there will be more \nimpoverished children and more hungry children and more children \nwithout health care. That is not what we are about. That is not what \nAmerica is about. I urge my colleagues to vote against this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from New York. Mr. President, this \nbill represents a lost opportunity. Democrats and Republicans share the \nview that the current welfare system needs to be reformed. We recognize \nthat the current system does not work. It does not enable people to \nbecome self-sufficient. It does not contain the resources to put people \nto work. It is not flexible enough for the States. It sends mixed \nmessages to welfare recipients.\n  Welfare can become a trap, that work does not pay. In short, most \nrecognize that welfare should not be a way of life. We also recognize \nthe twin goals of creating incentives to work, to provide the \nopportunity for welfare offices to truly become employment offices. \nThat is No. 1--giving people a chance to work, people who want to work, \nwho have no skills to work, who need to work. They want that \nopportunity, Mr. President, and that ought to be the goal of welfare \nreform.\n  Our second goal ought to be to protect children, to provide them the \nnutrition, to provide them the housing, and most importantly, if we are \ngoing to ensure that parents have the confidence that they can leave \ntheir homes and go to work, that their children will be cared for while \nthey are gone.\n  There is no perfect solution, no easy solution, but Democrats in a \nunanimous demonstration of support proposed what we called the Work \nFirst bill. The Senate-passed bill was passed with the support of many \nof us and we recognized it as really, just a first step--a minimal bill \nin many respects, minimally acceptable in the view of many of us, but \ncertainly a bill that represented an improvement over the current \nsystem.\n  The pending conference report, Mr. President, has fallen way below \nthat minimum standard of acceptability. It will move more children into \npoverty, not less. It provides virtually no protections for children. \nIt particularly targets disabled children.\n  The pending bill falls far short of real welfare reform. It fails to \nachieve the goals. It punishes children and it does not move people to \nwork. It does not provide the resources necessary to move people from \nwelfare to work. It does not provide sufficient child care funds. It \nslashes assistance for disabled children and abused and neglected \nchildren.\n  So the conference bill in our view is a deep disappointment. It is \nnot only a lost opportunity for millions of men and women and children, \nit may also do real harm to the very people that it is supposed to \nhelp. It reduces or terminates benefits for 1 million disabled children \nreceiving supplemental security income. It endangers the lives of \nmillions of abused and neglected children. Most importantly, it \nterminates Medicaid coverage for the poor, and begs the question, where \ndo we expect them to go?\n  It is a lost opportunity as well for the working poor. While \nsimultaneously threatening real harm for them, too, by slashing food \nstamp funding important to millions of low-income working families and \nthe elderly, it slashes the earned income tax credit, the most \neffective effort to move low-income people into the work force and \nretain them in the work force that we have today.\n  It underfunds child care assistance, which we know is the linchpin \nbetween welfare and work. It dismantles the current health and safety \nstandards contained in the child care development block grant. So the \nconference bill falls far short of the minimum standard of \nacceptability which many of us supported in the Senate-passed bill. It \nreneges on nearly every improvement Democrats made to the bill before \nit passed in the Senate.\n  Let there be no mistake. Democrats strongly support welfare reform, \nbut this legislation threatens single women and children, the disabled, \nand the working poor. This is not primarily a debate about spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the leader has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to use 3 minutes of \nmy leader time to complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Democrats proposed over $20 billion in welfare savings \nas part of a Democratic alternative, debated in September. Earlier this \nweek we proposed over $40 billion in welfare savings as part of an \noverall budget being negotiated. So, this is a debate about policy, \nabout changes in funding with a serious regard for reform. It is about \na real effort to move people from welfare to work.\n  In the name of reform, this bill boxes up the current system and \nshifts it off to the States. It says, ``You do it. We do not care if \nyou have the resources or not, you, Governors, you fix it.'' It is \nironic that in the same session we passed legislation to prohibit \nunfunded mandates, some now propose we pass the biggest one of all.\n  So it is with deep regret we cannot support this attempt at welfare \nreform. We had hoped to work with conferees to improve the Senate bill. \nWe had hoped we could continue to work in a bipartisan manner. We \nregret the political process led to this political document that falls \nfar short of real reform. We regret that this bill is not about work, \nthat it does not protect children. At best, it is a recognition of a \nvexing national problem which must be addressed. At worst, it is an \nexperiment set up for failure.\n  A defeat of this conference report is the first step to a bipartisan \neffort to create real welfare reform, just as we did with the Senate-\npassed bill. This bill is going nowhere. The President will veto it if \nwe fail to defeat it now. So let us get down to business. Let us work \nin a bipartisan fashion to draft a real welfare reform bill.\n  It should not take a veto to achieve that objective. This \nopportunity, this lost opportunity, is not our last chance. Together, \nas Republicans and Democrats determined to solve a real problem, we can \nseize the opportunity to make welfare work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I stated on repeated occasions in \nlast evening's debate, this is not welfare reform; this is welfare \nrepeal. It is repeal of title IV(A) of the Social Security Act, \nsomething never done, never contemplated in this Congress in 60 years.\n  I am happy to yield a minute and a half to my valiant comrade in this \nregard, the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] is \nrecognized for a minute and a half.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I do not ordinarily mention religion on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, but in 3 days we will celebrate the birth of \nJesus, and the majority of Americans claim affiliation with his \nreligion. And he said, in the Biblical account in Matthew 25, whatever \nyou do for poor people you do to me. That is the judgment day scene \nthat he describes. We, in the U.S. Congress, are going to celebrate \nChristmas by trashing poor people. What a record: Reducing food stamps, \nabused children, foster care children, cutting them by 23 percent when \nthe numbers are going up, disabled children, 160,000--sorry, you are \noff of SSI. For 750,000 disabled children, cutting it by 25 percent.\n  Real welfare reform, not just public relations, will have to deal \nwith jobs for people of limited ability. It will have to deal with \nproblems of poverty. \n\n[[Page S19156]]\nBut we are going to celebrate Christmas by trashing poor people.\n  It is not a record we can be proud of. I am going to vote no, and be \nproud to vote no.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The people of Illinois can be proud of you, sir.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Roth] is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, 3 months ago the Senate passed H.R. 4 by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 87 to 12. Republicans and Democrats \nworked together on the floor of the Senate to forge an agreement to \ndeliver a comprehensive, bipartisan welfare reform package which has \nbeen promised for so long.\n  In a few minutes we will vote on a final conference report on H.R. 4, \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995. There has \nbeen a great deal of misinformation about this conference report, as \nPresident Clinton has issued his unfortunate veto threat against this \nlegislation. Instead of ending welfare as we know it, it seems he \nprefers to continue business as usual.\n  Let me say to each of the 87 Members who voted for authentic welfare \nreform last September, you should not hesitate to vote for this \nconference agreement. Overall, you will find H.R. 4 remains true to the \ngoals we share and to the most important agreements we made.\n  Members know that from the early days of his administration, the \nPresident has outlined principles for welfare reform. H.R. 4 meets \nthese principles.\n  I invite Members to go back through the record of this past year. You \nwill find there were substantial differences between the House and \nSenate versions of welfare reform. Those who examine the conference \nreport in all its details will surely agree it more closely reflects \nthe Senate positions on the major issues at stake.\n  We have, in fact, added more money for the block grants for temporary \nassistance for needy families. We have, in fact, increased funding for \nchild care. We have retained the Senate position on requiring the \nStates' maintenance of effort. We rejected House provisions which would \nhave converted SSI assistance to children into a block grant. We have \nimproved child support enforcement provisions. We have preserved the \ncurrent law entitlements to foster care and adoption assistance \nmaintenance payments. We are keeping our commitment to children in the \nfoster care system. Contrary to some disinformation, they will continue \nto be eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n  So I hope all Members will objectively examine the conference report \nand compare it to the House and Senate version passed earlier this \nyear. But more important, I invite Members to open their minds to what \nthe States are doing when they get the opportunity to design \nmodifications to the current welfare system. Look at what is being done \nin Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin, Delaware, Virginia, and Iowa \nwhen the States are allowed at least some measure of control over the \nwelfare system.\n  For a reassuring glimpse of the future, I recommend an article by \nMassachusetts Gov. William Weld entitled, ``Release Us From Federal \nNonsense,'' which appeared in the Wall Street Journal last week.\n  As for me, I have greater confidence in the Governor and State \nlegislature in Delaware than I do in the careerists in the Hubert \nHumphrey building. We know why the number of people in poverty has \ncontinued to increase despite the best efforts and intentions. But \nafter 30 years of failed experimentation, it is clear the Washington \nbureaucracy cannot tell us how to break the vicious cycle of \ndependency. Complex human behavior cannot be reduced to a mathematical \ndiagram. We have not found the wisdom of Solomon in the Federal \nRegister.\n  President Clinton has stated he will veto H.R. 4. Last night, a \nnumber of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stated that we \nshould wait for a bipartisan bill. Mr. President, we have a bipartisan \nbill. The Senate bill passed 87 to 12. President Clinton promised \nwelfare reform 34 months ago. Today, we are delivering welfare reform \nto the American people. There is no need to wait any longer. Welfare \nreform is here.\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, according to the latest figures I have, \nthere are 92,160 unemployed individuals in Kentucky. Eight counties in \nmy State still have double-digit unemployment rates.\n  There is widespread support for putting welfare recipients to work. \nBut one of the questions I frequently get when I talk to constituents \nabout welfare reform is ``Where will the jobs come from?'' I still do \nnot know the answer. I do not think we have thought through that simple \nquestion very well.\n  I also get asked two conflicting questions about welfare. One is \n``Why don't you cut spending on welfare?'', and ``What are you going to \ndo to enable those on welfare to find jobs?''\n  These are legitimate questions. I hear about three common barriers to \nthose on welfare who truly want to work:\n  First, fear of losing health care for their kids--and that is \nMedicaid;\n  Second, lack of affordable child care; and\n  Third, inadequate educational or job training opportunities.\n  I supported the earlier version of welfare reform because I thought \nit was a good faith attempt to address these competing priorities. It \ndid reduce overall spending on welfare programs, and it also attempted \nto address some of the obstacles to finding jobs--particularly child \ncare.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report before us today, in my opinion, \nhas shifted entirely toward cutting spending. It cuts spending far more \nthan the Senate-passed bill, and it retreats from putting people to \nwork.\n  When you combine this with the impact of the Republican budget \nproposal, you see even further that this conference report just simply \nwill not work:\n  First, the proposed Republican budget cuts in Medicaid will be \ndevastating for those trying to get off of welfare and go to work.\n  Second, the proposed Republican tax increases on low-income families \nwill hurt many just as they try to get off welfare.\n  Third, the revised, pessimistic CBO numbers on the unemployment rate \nassume that unemployment will remain virtually unchanged at 6 percent \nover the next 7 years even if we pass a balanced budget plan. This \nmeans jobs will be at least as scarce as they are today for those \ntrying to go from welfare to work.\n  Mr. President, I do believe this welfare conference report will \nsucceed in reducing Federal spending on welfare programs. But I believe \nit will--\n  First, fail to put people to work;\n  Second, underfund child care; and\n  Third, increase poverty among our children.\n  For these and other reasons, I cannot support this conference report, \nbecause I simply do not believe it will work.\n\n                                                                  WELFARE SIDE BY SIDE                                                                  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Senate-passed bill                                         Conference report                   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWork...............................  measures work                                              measures work.                                          \n                                     work bonus                                                 no bonus;

Mr. President, last September I voted for a tough welfare \nreform bill. I supported--and I still strongly support--a comprehensive \noverhaul of the welfare system.\n  Too many welfare recipients spend far too long on welfare and do far \ntoo little in exchange for their benefits. Many of those who manage to \nget off the welfare rolls only end up back on them after a short period \nof time. And, for some, generations have made welfare their way of \nlife.\n  This is unacceptable. And, the American people rightly are demanding \nreform.\n  Last September, I outlined how I think we should reform the welfare \nsystem. Welfare recipients would be required to work in exchange for \ntheir benefits. The time a person could spend on welfare would be \nlimited. Child care would be provided so that children would not be \nleft home alone. A safety net would be retained for the innocent \nchildren. And, we would be as tough on the deadbeat dads who did not \npay child support as we would be on the welfare mothers who did not \nwork.\n  That is what I supported last September. And, that is what I voted \nfor last September.\n  But, Mr. President, I did not vote to dismantle the child protection \nsystem. I did not vote to cut foster care. I did not vote to gut the \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. I did not vote to end the \nFederal Government's effort to help States prevent child abuse. I did \nnot vote to cut the school lunch program. I did not vote to cut child \nnutrition programs. I did not vote to take away health care for \npregnant women and children. And, I did not vote to eliminate the \nhealth and safety protections for kids in day care.\n  I voted for welfare reform. I did not vote for this bill.\n  I am reminded of the children's fable where the lesson was: beware of \nthe wolf in sheep's clothing.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing. This bill \nuses welfare reform as a mask for an all-out assault on the most \nvulnerable of America's children--many of whom are not on welfare. This \nbill uses welfare reform as a cover for the extreme, mean-spirited \npolicies emanating from the House.\n  Look behind the so-called welfare reform. Strip away the wool of the \nsheep, Mr. President, and you are left with an awfully extreme wolf.\n  It did not have to be this way.\n  When I voted for the original welfare bill last September, I noted at \nthe time that I had some reservations. But, the final product was a \ngood-faith effort at a bipartisan compromise. And, despite the fact \nthat I thought it could have been both tougher on work and more \ncompassionate toward innocent children, I was not going to undermine \nthe bipartisan compromise. Working out differences and coming to an \nagreement is what the American people sent us here to do.\n  But, what happened? The Senator from New York has pointed out that \nthe House-Senate conference met once--for opening statements. \nEverything else was done behind closed doors without any participation \nby Democrats. The bipartisan compromise left the Senate and became the \nvictim of House Speaker Gingrich's extremism.\n  So, Mr. President, while I was willing to overlook a few reservations \nlast September for the sake of a bipartisan compromise on welfare \nreform, I am not willing to sacrifice my principles for the sake of one \nparty's extremists--just because they call it welfare reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report and demand that \nwe take up and pass real welfare reform.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I must oppose the conference report on \nwelfare reform despite my support for the original version of this \nbill, which previously passed the Senate.\n  The conference report on welfare reform goes far beyond the bill \npassed by the Senate and consequently, Republican efforts to reduce the \nbudget fall heavily on working poor families, unemployed workers, the \nelderly and the disabled.\n  Welfare reform, in my mind, is about moving people from welfare to \nwork. This conference report undermines that goal. The bill's apparent \nemphasis on transforming the welfare system to a work system is \nundermined by the failure to provide States with adequate resources for \nwork programs and child care while maintaining a basic safety net of \npoor children and the elderly.\n  The bill combines cash assistance and work programs into a single \nblock grant. According to CBO estimates, block grant funding, combined \nwith State spending, would fall $5.5 billion short of what will be \nneeded to fund the work program in 2002 alone, assuming States maintain \ntheir safety net for poor children and the elderly. Over the 7-year \nperiod, funding for the work program would fall about $14 billion short \nof what the CBO projects will be needed. Furthermore, this bill also \ncontains provisions which allow States to escape the work requirements \nthe bill seeks to impose by cutting needy families off the rolls \ninstead.\n  This bill also makes deep cuts in basic benefits for the elderly \npoor. The conference report would likely deepen poverty among the \nelderly due to a series of provisions that would reduce or eliminate \nSSI, food stamps, and Medicaid for various groups of elderly people \nliving below the poverty line.\n  The conference agreement would raise from 65 to 67 the age at which \nimpoverished elderly people can qualify for SSI, thus effectively \neliminating SSI to eligible people 65 and 66 years old. Not be \ncoincidence, the change in the age requirement for SSI eligibility \nwould be raised in tandem with the scheduled increase to 67 at which \nretirees may receive full Social Security benefits. If the Social \nSecurity retirement age is raised in the future, the SSI eligibility \nwould automatically raise as well. In addition, since receiving SSI is \na qualification for Medicaid, persons denied SSI would most likely lose \nMedicaid coverage as well.\n  This conference agreement also falls seriously short in that the \nprovision of current law which assures that AFDC families receive \nMedicaid coverage would be repealed. Roughly 1.5 million children and \nat least 4 million mothers could lose Medicaid coverage as a result and \njoin the ranks of the uninsured. Also, changes made in eligibility \nrules would mean a reduction in benefits for most disabled children by \n25 percent. This Medicaid provision was in neither the House nor the \nSenate bills.\n\n  The school lunch and other child nutrition programs are programs that \nI have long supported and strongly believe that they have made \nconsiderable contributions to the overall improving health of our \nschool-aged children. These programs must be maintained as they provide \nan important safety net for young children and establish a solid \nfoundation for future development.\n  However, the welfare conference report contains provisions that could \nundermine the school lunch program. The conference report would allow \nfor seven States to block grant the school lunch program. In these \nStates, sufficient funds would no longer be available in the event of \nan economic recession. States that have a history of budget reductions \nthrough proration, like Alabama, will be hard hit. In times of an \n\n[[Page S19158]]\neconomic downturn, the fixed amount going to these States would not be \nsufficient to provide adequate assistance to the rolls of the needy \nthat would expand as a result of the recession. This could ultimately \nlead to the serving of lower quality meals in an effort to cut corners. \nThis is absolutely not in the best interest of our young children for \nwhom we are responsible.\n  The bill also includes more than $32 billion in food stamp benefit \ncuts affecting the working poor, the elderly and disabled poor, and all \nothers receiving food stamp assistance. There has been much talk about \nreducing the waste, fraud and abuse associated with this program. \nActually, less than three percent of the bill's food stamp savings come \nfrom cutting administrative costs, reducing fraud or imposing tougher \nsanctions on people who fail to follow program requirements. Instead, \nthese cuts would hit families with low incomes.\n  Also, for no reason that I can see, food stamp benefits would be cut \nfor those receiving low-income energy assistance.\n  For the many reasons stated, and for many more that have gone \nunmentioned, I must oppose the conference report. This bill does little \nto encourage people to move from welfare to work by removing the safety \nnet for individuals as they make that transition. Basic assistance for \nthe elderly and child nutrition programs are cut without must \nconsideration of the impacts that they will have on those that are \nleast able to support themselves. We should not punish people for being \nyoung, or old or poor. We should, instead, provide for the necessary \nsafeguards for people who want to move from welfare to work. This does \nnot preclude our efforts to identify and deal with those taking \nadvantage of the system, it simply signals our willingness to help \nthose that are trying to help themselves and not punishing those that \nneed our help.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the \nconferees refused to follow the path of the bipartisan welfare reform \nbill that was passed by the Senate by a wide margin last September.\n  Instead of following the bipartisan framework set out in the Senate \nbill, the conferees produced a bill that is punitive in nature and is \nlikely to hurt innocent children, rather than help their families move \noff welfare into the work force. I will vote against it.\n  Mr. President, when I voted for the Senate-passed welfare reform \nbill, I expressed my hope that the conferees would return a bill that \ntracked the Senate measure and avoided the kind of mean-spirited, \ndestructive provisions proposed by the House.\n  Instead, we have a final product that slashes funding for the child \ncare that is essential if we want to avoid leaving young children \nunsupervised and unattended while their parents are at work, that \nallows States to immediately reduce their contributions by 25 percent, \nthereby rewarding States which already spend low levels of their own \nfunds for families while States like Wisconsin which make substantial \ninvestments will bear the burden of potential welfare migration, and \nimposes punitive provisions denying benefits for newborn infants. It \nalso adds harsh new provisions slashing assistance for families with \ndisabled children and an important safety net for impoverished elderly.\n  This is not meaningful welfare reform. It is an abandonment of the \nbipartisan agreement reached in the Senate-passed bill that has focused \nupon helping families escape the welfare cycle and gain self-\nsufficiency.\n  I think the current system is broken and is badly in need of reform, \nbut this is not the way to reform.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference \nreport on welfare reform, H.R. 4. I would like to briefly explain my \nreasons for doing so.\n  First of all, I regret that we are planning to vote on this \nlegislation at this time. It is my understanding that the conference \nreport we are considering was released on Wednesday. Two days later, we \nare voting on this important piece of legislation that would dismantle \nthe social safety net we have known for decades, and replace it with \nblock grants to the States loaded with numerous requirements limiting \nthe amount of assistance to some of our society's most vulnerable \nmembers. Although I voted for the Senate-passed version of this \nlegislation to send a message that our current system can certainly \nstand some improvement, I would be reluctant to support any conference \nreport on such a complex issue without having an adequate opportunity \nto review it, and to get the best information on its likely impact on \nmy State. I regret that we have not had adequate opportunity to do that \nsort of analysis on the legislation before us.\n  Nevertheless, I have had an opportunity to review the broad \nprovisions of this agreement, and I do not believe that is likely to \nresult in a better system for welfare recipients, or the States and \ncommunities involved in the current system.\n\n\n                           welfare recipients\n\n  Mr. President, the current system is not serving its clients as well \nas it should. In too many cases, welfare and other public assistance \nhas become a way of life, not a brief interlude of assistance. We have \nchildren growing up in a welfare culture, always living at the margin, \nand sometimes shuffled through the foster care systems of our various \nStates. Their parents never seem to get the skills or opportunities \nthat would enable them to support their families. Many of us have \nexpressed the concern that too often, these parents are single parents \ntrying to raise their families alone.\n  Our current system, which knits together Aid for Families With \nDependent Children [AFDC], Medicaid, food stamps, school lunch \nprograms, and child protection moneys, seeks to provide a basic safety \nnet. It seeks to ensure that in America, even the poorest of poor have \nfood, shelter, basic clothing, safe homes for children, and an \nopportunity for something better. The main problem welfare reformers \nhave sought to address this year is making sure that the safety net is \nnot the primary means of support for families, and that people use this \nsafety net for a short time before finding a means to become self-\nsufficient. Again, I share these goals.\n  But what have the conferees returned to us to meet these goals? They \nhave given us a system that will limit the time a person may receive \nbenefits to 5 years in a lifetime, and imposed unrealistic requirements \nto work. They have limited the amount of time a recipient can spend \ntraining to get the skills that will enable them to find work that will \nmake them self-sufficient.\n\n  Let me talk for just a minute about what this bill does not do for \nrecipients. Every credible expert agrees that the work requirements \nwill be very difficult to meet without additional child care dollars. \nWe are asking States to ensure that the number of working single \nparents go from about 20 percent now to 50 percent by 2002. These \nparents are not going to leave young children alone, so they will need \nday care. Still, while we are expecting to increase the work force \nparticipation of single parents by 150 percent, we are only increasing \nthe core child care money in this bill by a little more than 20 \npercent--$1.9 billion over a baseline of $9.3 billion. This \njuxtaposition will prove to be totally unworkable.\n  Another issue that has not been given adequate thought is why we \nassume merely taking an entry-level job will lead to economic \nindependence for welfare recipients. I recently came across a \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for research on poverty study \non welfare recipients which reported that to replace the benefits \nreceived on welfare, the average mother will need a job providing at \nleast $8 to $9 an hour. The average job available to a person with the \nskills of the average working mother is only about $5.15 per hour, with \nlittle hope of real advanement. Obviously, this leaves a huge gap in \nincome if the family this mother heads is going to be able to keep its \nmembers fed, clothed, and sheltered. I want to emphasize that we are \nnot talking about the wage needed to live the middle class dream of \nhome ownership in a nice suburb and a vacation every year. We are \ntalking here about maintaining a subsistence standard of living. If we \nadopt the provisions included in this conference report it is likely \nthat many families that are somehow surviving now are going to find \nthemselves making choices between shelter, food, and clothing. In all \nlikelihood, as my colleague Senator \n\n[[Page S19159]]\nMoynihan pointed out on this floor last week, we are going to see a \nsurge in the number of homeless families within a few years.\n  The obvious solution here is to ensure that recipients have the \nskills they need to get better jobs, and that economy produces high \nwage jobs that they can fill. This bill unreasonably limits the amount \nof time recipients can take to upgrade their skills.\n  Another issue I would like to address is the cuts to the food stamp \nprogram included in this legislation. I have heard some of colleagues \ntout that food stamps will remain an entitlement in most States. What \nthey fail to mention is that this legislation severely cuts that and \nother nutrition programs. Food stamps alone would be cut by $32 million \nunder the legislation before us.\n  Although there are many other concerns raised in how people currently \nserved by welfare will be affected by these provisions, the final point \nI want to raise concerns child protective services. The advocates of \nthis conference agreement have stated that funds for foster care \nsupport are not being block granted. They fail to note, however, that \nfunds for investigations, court procedures, quality \nassurance, professional training, and other services are block granted \nand capped by this conference report. Inevitably, these provisions will \nresult in less protection for children suffering from neglect and abuse \nin this Nation. In States like my own, where protective services are \nunder State supervision, the capped block grants will likely be unable \nto pay for the changes mandates in these services.\n\n\n                       the states and communities\n\n  Clearly, the welfare proposal will not work from the perspective of \nwelfare recipients. I doubt it will work from the perspective of the \nStates and communities these recipients live in, either.\n  I have not yet seen the final amount New Mexico will receive under \nthe conference agreement. I believe, however, that the number touted by \nproponents for New Mexico under the vetoed budget agreement was about \n$135 million for the TANF portion of this welfare reform package. \nAccording to Department of Health and Human Services figures, however, \nNew Mexico received $141.5 million in fiscal year 1995. Clearly, my \nState will not be getting a large increase in funding. Yet the mandate \nfor child care inherent in the work requirements imposed by this bill \nare huge. New Mexico, and other States, will face a shortfall at a time \nwhen many States, including my own, are under extreme budget \nconstraints already.\n  The picture gets worse when one considers the other Republican \nproposals being tossed around the Capitol. The Republican budget \ncontained significant reductions to the earned income tax credit. It \nalso proposed substantial cuts in homeless assistance. At a minimum the \nRepublican proposal cut homeless funding 32 percent. When eligibility \nfor welfare runs out, and families are on the streets, they are going \nto have even fewer resources to draw on to help.\n  I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve that private giving and State resources will take up the slack. \nThat is pure fantasy.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In short, Mr. President, I have yet to hear a coherent statement from \nthe proponents of this conference report regarding how communities will \nmeet the needs of poor children and their families that will be \ngenerated by this legislation. If it were to become law, we would be \ntrading in an admittedly imperfect system for one that is certainly not \nbetter, and perhaps is much worse.\n  It seems particularly ironic to me that we are considering this ill-\nconceived legislation right before Christmas. Indeed, it is difficult \nnot to think of Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol.'' I am particularly \nreminded of the statement of the ghost of Scrooge's business partner, \nexplaining why he is fated to be a miserable ghost: ``Business! Mankind \nwas my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, \nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my \ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my \nbusiness!''\n  Meaningful welfare reform is our business, Mr. President. It is my \nunderstanding that the President intends to veto this legislation. I \nhope that after that veto, we can get down to that business.\n  Until then, God bless us, every one.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on September 19, 1995, after 2 weeks of \nfloor debate and over 40 rollcall votes, the Senate passed welfare \nreform legislation by a vote of 87 to 12.\n  At that time, I voted for the welfare reforms measure. I did, \nhowever, make it clear in remarks here on the Senate floor, that I was \ndoing so with some reluctance. I was concerned that the legislation did \nnot go far enough in protecting our children and in providing adults \nwith the important tools needed to help them move off welfare and into \nmeaningful, long-term employment.\n  I voted for the measure because it included the Dole-Daschle \ncompromise amendment, providing additional protections for children and \nfamilies.\n  I said at that time that I would oppose the conference report if it \nwere to return from the conference committee without the moderating \nprovisions found in the Dole-Daschle amendment. This final bill erodes \nthe important protective safety net and it is punitive and harmful.\n  In particular, I am concerned that the conference report is weaker on \nwork requirements than the Senate-passed bill because of a $5 billion \nreduction of funds available to put people back to work. The report \nsignificantly reduces important child care protections, one of the \nmajor components of the Dole-Daschle compromise, and cuts food \nassistance guarantees to children by cutting almost $35 billion.\n  I will, therefore, oppose the conference report.\n  Mr. President, the current welfare system clearly needs to be \nreformed. I firmly believe that any system in place for 60 years needs \nupdating and rethinking. It remains my strong desire to see a welfare \nsystem that celebrates, not mocks, compassion. I continue to support \nthe provisions of the work first proposal put forth by Senator Daschle \nwhich emphasizes the significance of work for adults and the importance \nof protecting, not punishing, the children who have not chosen their \nparents or their circumstances.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 4. This bill is the most significant piece of welfare \nreform legislation to come before Congress in more than three decades. \nThe current welfare system is destroying the hopes and opportunities of \nthousands of Americans by trapping them in cycles of dependency. \nPresident Roosevelt, the hero of liberal welfare advocates, warned us \nwhat would happen if we structured our welfare system in a way that \nfostered reliance on the Government. Listen to what he said in his 1935 \nannual message to Congress:\n\n       The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence \n     immediately before me, show conclusively that continued \n     dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral \n     disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national \n     fiber. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a \n     narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what the architects of the modern \nwelfare state have done. They have created a welfare system that \nencourages people to view welfare as a way of life. The typical welfare \nfamily has already spent 6\\1/2\\ years on welfare, and will end up \nspending a total of 13 years on the rolls. Thirteen years, Mr. \nPresident. After 13 years on welfare, the average family has received \nat least $150,000 of taxpayers' money. No wonder President Roosevelt \nsaid this type of welfare was a narcotic that destroyed the human \nspirit.\n  The reason welfare has become so addictive is because it completely \ndestroys any incentive to work or become self-sufficient. The current \nsystem essentially says to its potential victims, if you do not want to \nwork, have a child you are not able to support. If you do this, the \nGovernment will send you a check every month, pay your food bills, give \nyou some free child care, pay all of your health care bills, your \nheating bills, your college bills, give you some WIC money, pay for \nyour children's breakfast and lunch at school, and possibly provide you \nwith your own apartment.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the message is the Government will \ntake care of you. You do not need to take \n\n[[Page S19160]]\ncare of yourself. You simply need to sit at home and do nothing. That \nis a very cruel form of assistance. It destroys the natural inclination \nin every human being to reach their full potential. No private charity \noperates in that manner. No private charity simply mails people checks \nfor having children they are not able to support.\n  The bill before us today will begin to repair the broken welfare \nState; it will restore healthy incentives in our welfare system. It \ndoes not abandon poor Americans or their children. Rather, it requires \nadult welfare recipients to work in exchange for their benefits. If \npassed, these work requirements will be the first serious work \nrequirements ever passed by Congress. This is not only healthy for the \nrecipients, but it is good for their children to be raised in an \nenvironment where they see their parents getting up and going to work \neveryday. Work will become the norm among those receiving welfare, not \nthe exception.\n  While I am very optimistic about the results of the strong work \nrequirements in this bill, I want to express my concerns with the lack \nof provisions to address the most serious problem facing our country \ntoday: the breakdown of the traditional family. Eighty percent of \nchildren in many low-income communities are born in fatherless homes \nand welfare is the dominant feature of these homes.\n  For many poor people, the current welfare system makes bearing \nchildren out of wedlock a very practical alternative to the traditional \nmethod of raising a family--getting a job, a work skill, and finding a \nspouse committed to raising a family before having a child. If a young \nwoman has a child before she has a work skill and a spouse, it will be \nalmost impossible for her to ever escape the welfare trap. Mr. \nPresident, I regret that this legislation does not replace cash \npayments to teenagers with services to care for the child. But, I am \nglad we were able to at least give States the option to do that. It is \nmy sincere hope that many States will pursue that option and will enact \nother policies to address the crisis of illegitimacy. I am glad that we \nwere able to include the national prohibition against increasing cash \npayments to welfare recipients who have additional children while on \nwelfare. Mr. President, if we do not contain the epidemic of \nillegitimacy, it will destroy the fabric of our society. America simply \ncannot survive without a strong family unit.\n  This legislation represents real reform. It is a carefully \nconstructed balance between those who would advocate a complete end to \npublic assistance and those who would seek to expand the current \nwelfare State. It is the boldest reform we could have taken in the \ncurrent political environment, and I hope for the sake of our Nation's \nfuture, that all of my colleagues will support this bill and the \nPresident will sign it into law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we stand here today to debate and vote on a \nvery important piece of legislation, one that could change the lives of \nAmerica's needy families.\n  Not since the Economic Opportunity Act was signed into law by \nPresident Lyndon Johnson on August 20, 1964, have we had such broad-\nsweeping and radical change in our welfare system.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the current war on poverty has not \nbeen successful. Since the war began, the number of children on the \nwelfare rolls has grown from 3.3 million to 9.6 million in 1993. This \nwas not the result of negligence, or a lack of trying. The combined \nFederal, State, and local spending on welfare in constant dollars \nincreased from $38.4 billion in 1965 to $324.3 billion in 1993.\n  The current system is not working. What was designed with good \nintent, has become a trap pulling the needy families of America into a \ncycle of dependency that eats at their self-esteem and their ability to \nbecome self-sufficient.\n  The legislation before us today would change all that. This \nlegislation moves the Federal Government out of the paper-pushing \nbureaucracy and moves it into a facilitator for families moving into \nself-sufficiency.\n  This legislation will help empower our families, not pull them into \nperpetual dependency. Gone will be the days of welfare checks for \nnothing. Beneficiaries will now have to engage in work activities in \norder to receive assistance.\n  This legislation retains the role of the Federal Government in \noverseeing the allocation of Federal money, but also gives the \nauthority for designing the systems to the States. The States are in \nthe best position to know the needs and environment of their unique \nconstituencies. This legislation will allow them to design programs \nthat coordinate resources and support families rather than just lead \nthem through the blind maze of bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that the current system must be changed. \nThis legislation turns the welfare programs of this country into a \ncohesive system flexible enough to meet the varying demands of \nindividual States and areas while protecting our families and our \nchildren. I urge my colleagues and the President to take the chance we \nhave today to make good on President Clinton's campaign promise to \n``change welfare as we know it.'' Let us pass this legislation and \nenable it to become public law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Indian \nprovisions contained in the conference report to H.R. 4, the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995. I commend the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, and the leaders of the \nSenate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means, \nfor their efforts to overhaul our Nation's welfare system and for \nincluding provisions which responsibly address the unique needs and \nrequirements of Indian country. They have taken great care to draft a \nwelfare plan that effects real change in a system that is greatly in \nneed of repair while ensuring that all citizens, including our Nation's \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native population, receive equitable access \nto necessary welfare assistance. The bill before us today honors in \nmany practical ways the special relationship that the United States has \nwith Native American tribal governments.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the so-called Great Society \nprograms of the past have failed American Indians as much or even more \nthan they have failed the rest of America's citizens. These programs \nhave failed Indians because they have largely ignored the existence of \nIndian tribal governments and the unique needs of the Indian \npopulation. Recent attempts to fix this problem have been like placing \na bandaid on a gaping wound. Under existing programs, Indians remain \nthe worst-off and yet benefit the least. If we are to truly reform \nwelfare then we cannot ignore Indians, who year-after-year rank the \nhighest in poverty and unemployment.\n  It is vital that we authorize Indian tribal governments to administer \na welfare block grant for two reasons. First, in fiscal year 1994, only \na fraction of the eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives received \nAFDC. But in States such as Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and South \nDakota, Arizona, and New Mexico, Indians and Alaska Natives are \ndisproportionately represented as AFDC recipients. It is my belief, and \nthat of many members of the Senate Indian Affairs and Senate Finance \nCommittee, that Native American tribal governments are best able to \naddress the needs of Indians and to provide accessible service to those \nwho must travel great distances for service. They are, after all, the \ngovernmental units closest in proximity, culture, and values, to those \nthey serve. Clearly, the impetus for the Congress to provide block \ngrants to States also applies to Indian tribal governments--Indian \ntribal governments, not the States, know the most about the real impact \nof welfare on their communities and how best to design programs to meet \ntheir needs.\n  If this bill is signed into law, for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, tribal governments will be able to receive block grant funds \nto design and administer Federally-funded welfare programs. Indian \ntribal governments have sought that authority throughout history. The \nblock grant approach in this bill is a practical way to implement the \nFederal trust obligation that we owe Indian tribes, a doctrine stated \nin the earliest United States Supreme Court decisions and grounded in \nthe United States Constitution.\n  The bill before us today promises greater hope for Indians because it \nallows their own tribal governments to \n\n[[Page S19161]]\nserve Indians now living in poverty. It empowers tribes themselves to \nassist in ending the welfare dependency often created by existing \nprograms by placing resources necessary to fight local welfare problems \ninto the hands of local tribal governments. Mr. President, I believe \nthis bill demonstrates a real commitment to ending welfare as Indians \nhave known it. As I have said on many occasions, our successes as a \nNation should be measured by the impact that we have made in the lives \nof our most vulnerable citizens--American Indians.\n  Early in the 104th Congress, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \nheld several hearings on the potential impact to Indians of various \nwelfare reform proposals such as block grants. During these hearings, \ntribal leaders spoke out in strong favor of direct Federal funding \nwhich would allow tribal governments flexibility in administering local \nwelfare assistance programs and stated their hopes of receiving no less \nauthority than the Congress chooses to give to State governments in \nthis regard. The Committee also received testimony from the Inspector \nGeneral of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who \ntestified to how poorly Indians fare under block grants as currently \nadministered by State governments. In response to the record adduced at \nthese hearings, the Indian Affairs Committee developed provisions for \ndirect, block grant funding to tribal governments which are now \ncontained in H.R. 4. These provisions reflect the efforts of many \nMembers on both the Indian Affairs and Finance Committees, and to them \nI express my gratitude.\n  Let me take several minutes to explain the Indian provisions related \nto temporary assistance for needy families contained in H.R. 4 and the \ngoals and purposes of those provisions. In general terms, the bill \nauthorizes Indian tribal governments, like State governments, to \nreceive direct Federal funding to design and administer local tribal \nwelfare programs. Let me be clear--an Indian tribe retains the complete \nfreedom to choose whether or not it will exercise this authority. If it \ndoes not, the State retains the authority and the funds it otherwise \nhas under H.R. 4. The following references are to new sections of law \nin Part A of title IV, which are set forth in Section 103 of the H.R. \n4.\n  Section 412 is the main Indian provision setting forth the basic \nauthority for tribal direct funding and the express requirements of \ntribal family assistance plans. It requires the Secretary to make \ndirect funding available to Indian tribes exercising this option in \norder to strengthen and enhance the control and flexibility of local \ngovernments over local programs, consistent with well-settled \nprinciples of Indian Self-Determination. Section 412(b) provides that \nin order to be eligible to receive direct funding, an Indian tribe must \nsubmit a 3-year tribal family assistance plan. Each approved plan must \noutline the tribe's approach to providing welfare-related services \nconsistent with the purposes of this section. Each plan must specify \nwhether the services provided by the tribe will be provided through \nagreements, contracts, or compacts with intertribal consortia, States, \nor other entities. This allows small tribes to join with other tribes \nin order to economize on administrative costs and pool their talents to \naddress their common problems. Each plan must identify with specificity \nthe population and service area or areas which the tribe will serve. \nThis requirement is designed to ensure that there is no overlap in \nservice administration and to provide a clear outline to affected State \nadministrations of the boundaries of their responsibilities under the \nAct. Each plan must also provide guarantees that tribal administration \nof the plan will not result in families receiving duplicative \nassistance from other State or tribal programs funded under this part. \nEach plan must identify employment opportunities in or near the service \narea of the tribe and the manner in which the tribe will cooperate and \nparticipate in enhancing such opportunities for recipients of \nassistance under the plan consistent with any applicable State \nstandards. And finally, each plan must apply fiscal accounting \nprinciples in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31, United States \nCode. This last requirement is consistent with other Federal authority \ngoverning the administration by tribes and tribal organizations of \nsimilar block grant programs under authority of the Indian Self-\nDetermination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as amended. Section \n412(c) requires the establishment of minimum work participation \nrequirements, time limits on receipt of welfare-related services, and \nindividual penalties consistent with the purposes of this section and \nthe economic conditions of a tribe's service area and the availability \nto a tribe of other employment-related resources. These restrictions \nmust be developed with the full participation of the tribes and tribal \norganizations, and must be similar to comparable provisions in Section \n407(d). The remaining provisions of Section 412 further ensure that \nfunding accountability will be maintained by tribes and tribal \norganizations in administering funds under an approved tribal family \nassistance plan.\n\n  Section 412(a) establishes the methodology for funding an approved \ntribal family assistance plan, including the use of data submitted by \nState and tribal governments. This provision anticipates that the data \ninvolved is already collected or the added burden of data collection \nrequired will be de minimus. The funds provided to a tribe under \nSection 412 are deducted from the State allocation. Tribal plans are \nfunded at levels that are based on the amounts attributable to the \nFederal funds spent by a State in fiscal year 1994 on Indian families \nresiding in the service area of an approved tribal plan. Under Section \n405(b), the State is notified of any reduction to its block grant that \nhas been made in order to fund a tribal plan. Having lost the Federal \nsupport for temporary assistance to needy Indian families in a tribal \nplan's service area, the State no longer has any responsibility under \nthe bill for those families.\n  The Indian Affairs Committee has been informed by various State \nrepresentatives that it is administratively more difficult and costly \nfor States to provide services to Indians who reside in remote \nlocations of their States. While these States acknowledge a \nresponsibility to provide services, circumstances such as geographic \nisolation make it more difficult to do so. States are, therefore, well-\nserved by these provisions, because if Indian families in a \ngeographical area are identified in an approved and funded tribal plan, \na State government no longer has the responsibility to serve those \nfamilies unless the tribe and the State agree otherwise.\n  Some tribal representatives have pointed out that some tribes may \nchoose not to exercise the option to administer a tribal plan, because \nthe bill does not require a State to provide State funding to \nsupplement the Federal funding provided to a tribe. As originally \ndrafted, the Indian provisions expressly permitted States to agree to \nprovide State funding or services to an Indian tribe with an approved \nplan in order to maintain equitable services. It is my understanding \nthat this language was deleted because other provisions in the bill \nprovide sufficient guarantees that States will ensure the delivery of \nequitable services. But under the bill's current provisions, a State is \nnot prohibited from entering into an agreement with a tribe for the \ntransfer of State funds or the provision of specific State services to \na tribe for the benefit of Indians within that State. Indeed, a State \ngovernment may choose to enter into an agreement with a tribal \ngovernment to induce the tribe to take over administration of these \nprograms, and one of the inducements could be a transfer of State funds \nto the tribe that would otherwise have been used by the State to serve \nthose who would now be served under the tribal plan. If State \nadministrators are sincere about making real progress on welfare \nreform, and I think they are, I expect they will act responsibly and \nsensitively with tribes that wish to join the State in administering \nprograms that end welfare dependency.\n  Mr. President, it is important to point out that these Indian \nprovisions are consistent with the overall purposes of H.R. 4. The \nIndian provisions do not seek to circumvent these purposes nor give \npreferable treatment to Indian tribal governments. The tribal plans \nremain subject to minimum requirements and penalties similar to those \napplied to State governments. \n\n[[Page S19162]]\n H.R. 4 also requires a tribe to comply with the fiscal accountability \nrequirements of chapter 75 of title 31, United States Code and the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, as \namended. I would also submit that giving tribal governments the \nauthority to administer a tribal welfare program is consistent with our \ngoal of empowering local government control over local programs. It \nonly stands to reason that, like States, Indian tribal governments are \nmost familiar with the problems that plague their local communities.\n  Section 402(a)(5) of the bill requires a State to certify, as it does \nwith several other important Federal priorities, that it will provide \nequitable access to Indians not covered by a tribal plan. This \nprovision expressly recognizes the Federal Government's trust \nresponsibility to, and government-to-government relationship with, \nIndian tribes.\n  Section 412(a)(2) provides that the Secretary shall continue to \nprovide direct funding, for fiscal years 1996 through 2000, to those 77 \nIndian tribes or tribal organizations who conducted a job opportunities \nand basic skills training program in fiscal year 1995, in an amount \nequal to the amount received by such tribal JOBS programs in fiscal \nyear 1995. These sums are in addition to the sums provided to State and \ntribal block grants for family assistance.\n  Section 418 provides standard definitions of the terms ``Indian'', \n``Indian tribe'', and ``tribal organization'' in order to clarify the \nrespective limits of State and tribal government responsibilities under \nthe bill.\n  Many of my colleagues in the Senate know that some Indian tribal \ngovernments may not have existing capacity or infrastructure to \nadminister complex welfare programs. Consequently, H.R. 4 includes \nprovisions authorizing tribes to enter into cooperative agreements with \nStates or other tribal governments for the provision of welfare \nassistance. This will allow small tribes to join with other tribes in \norder to economize on administrative costs and pool their talents and \nresources to address their common problems. However, I believe it is \nvery important to permit and encourage those Indian tribal governments \nthat do possess such capacity to participate in these new welfare \ninitiatives by addressing welfare issues at a local level.\n  It should go without saying that any State may enter into any \nagreement it chooses with a tribe for the transfer of State funds to \nthat tribe for the purpose of administering a welfare program that \nbenefits Indians within that State. In my view, it is in both a State \nand a tribe's best interest to work out supplemental agreements for \nfunding and services where necessary because to do otherwise could \nundermine the goals of the bill.\n\n  I know that many Members in this body are aware that Indian Country \nhas historically been plagued by high unemployment and therefore its \nresidents suffer from extremely high poverty rates. H.R. 4 enables \nIndian tribes that are currently administering tribal JOBS programs to \ncontinue to do so. Section 412(a)(2) requires the Secretary to provide \ndirect funding in an amount equal to the amount received by the \nexisting tribal JOBS programs in fiscal year 1995. By keeping the JOBS \nprograms in Indian Country intact, we will acknowledge the positive \nimpact it has made in the lives of thousands of Indians. The Indian \nJOBS program has had measureable success. For instance, in fiscal year \n1994, in just one quarter, over 2,000 American Indians and Alaska \nNatives participating in the JOBS program obtained job placements. \nIndians residing in communities where a tribal JOBS program is in \noperation have experienced a new sense of hope by developing basic job \nskills that have helped them to secure stable job opportunities both on \nand off the reservation. H.R. 4 also contains provisions in Titles VI \nand VIII which provide continuing resources for programs that have \nproven successful in Indian Country, such as the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Program as well as new programs that are critical to \nending the high Indian unemployment rates such as the proposed \nworkforce development and training activities. These provisions, along \nwith the JOBS component will greatly assist in helping Indian Country \ncontribute to the goals of welfare reform and the purposes of the Act.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to point out that with \npassage of these provisions in H.R. 4 the Congress will discharge some \nof its continuing responsibilities under the United States \nConstitution--the very foundation of our treaty, trust, and legal \nrelationship with the Nation's Indian tribes, and which vests the \nCongress with plenary power over Indian affairs. I was deeply troubled \nto learn that earlier this year, the House passed its version of H.R. 4 \nwithout addressing the unique status of Indian tribal governments or \nthe trust responsibility of the Federal Government to the Indian \ntribes. There was no House debate on the status of the ``welfare \nstate'' on many Indian reservations nor the impact that the proposed \nchanges to welfare programs would have on access to services already in \nexistence in Indian Country. Nor was there any mention made in the \nHouse welfare debate of the significant legal and trust responsibility \nthat the Federal Government has to the Indian tribes. I am pleased that \nthe House conferees agreed to adopt much of the Senate approach on \nIndians.\n  As the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I feel it is my \nresponsibility to take a moment to briefly expand my remarks to a \ndiscussion of the responsibilities of the Congress toward Indians under \nthe United States Constitution. The Constitution provides that the \nCongress has plenary power to prescribe Federal Indian policy. These \npowers are provided for pursuant to the Commerce and the Treaty Power \nclauses. Sadly, over the last two centuries, the Congress has poorly \nexercised its power and responsibility--subjecting Indian tribal \ngovernments to inconsistent or contradictory policies--policies of \ntermination and assimilation. These policies have served to weaken well \nestablished Indian systems of government and, in my view, have greatly \ncontributed to the welfare state that exists today on most Indian \nreservations.\n  I know that time and time again, I have stood on this floor to recite \ngrim statistics revealing that Indians are, and consistently remain--\neven in 1995--the poorest of the poor and always the last to benefit. \nToday, I will withhold from reciting that data because I believe that \nthis bill begins to turn the tide in this Nation's treatment of Indians \nand their tribal governments. Similar to the unfunded mandates bill we \nenacted into law earlier this year, H.R. 4 will treat tribal \ngovernments like State governments by allowing them the flexibility and \nauthority to directly administer their own programs free of Federal \nbureaucratic intrusion and control. Due in large part to the leadership \nof the late President Nixon, the Congress for more than two decades has \nresponsibly exercised its plenary authority by replacing the distorted \nand dismal policy of termination of Indian tribal governments with \nempowering policies of Tribal Self-Determination and Self-Governance--\npolicies that respect and honor the government-to-government \nrelationship between the Federal government and the Indian tribes--\npolicies that are consistent with the Federal trust responsibility and \nthat set a new course of fairness in the Federal Government's dealings \nwith Indian tribal governments.\n  Given the renewed commitment by Congress to deal fairly with the \nIndian tribes, I fully understood why many tribal leaders became \nconcerned when the Congress earlier this year began moving toward a \nsystem of block grants to States. The concerns were that if the \nCongress did not revise the block grant model to reflect its \nresponsibility to Indian tribal governments, the government-to-\ngovernment relationship between the tribes and the United States would \nbe soon eroded and the Federal trust responsibility held sacred in our \nConstitution and the decisions of our Supreme Court would be relegated \nto the States.\n  These tribal concerns are likewise valid in a practical sense. A \nFederal Inspector General's report issued in August 1994 found that \nFederal block grants to States, in some instances have not resulted in \nequitable services being provided to Indians. That report found that in \n15 of the 24 States with the largest Indian populations, eligible \nIndian tribes did not receive funds even though Indian population \nfigures were used to justify the State's receipt of \n\n[[Page S19163]]\nFederal funding. In addition, findings of the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs revealed that even when States were attempting to serve \nIndians, the programmatic and administrative costs of providing welfare \nservices to Indians are often greater than providing local services to \nothers. What these findings revealed to me is that when either the \nFederal or State governments have administered programs for Indians, \nIndians have not received an equitable share of services.\n  Mr. President, the whole purpose of welfare reform is to provide the \ntools to State governments to design and administer local welfare \nprograms. After all, we have come to understand that local governments \nwant and have the ability to create local solutions to address what \nare, in essence, local problems. I would suggest that this policy is no \ndifferent that the Federal Indian policies of Tribal Self-Determination \nand Self-Governance. I also know that elected tribal officials have a \ngreat love of country and an incredible desire to contribute to the \nNation's goal of elevating members of their communities out of the \ndepths of poverty. Given the tools to do so, I believe that \nIndian tribes will make a great contribution to the Nation's war on \npoverty.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge a group of Senators that I \nbelieve have demonstrated a great level of understanding and commitment \nto the importance of addressing the needs of Indian tribes in the \nNation's welfare reform movement. Senators Hatch, Dole, Roth, Inouye, \nDomenici, Simon, Murkowski, Pressler, Campbell, Baucus, and Kassebaum \nhave contributed to the efforts to ensure that Indian tribes are not \noverlooked and abandoned in the current welfare reform efforts.\n  Two members of the Indian Affairs Committee deserve particular \nrecognition: my good friend from Kansas, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum \nand my good friend from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Kassebaum, \nas chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, worked \nclosely with the Indian Affairs Committee and Senator Simon to ensure \nthat provisions for direct Federal funding would be available to Indian \ntribes in her Committee's employment consolidation bill and that tribes \nwould continue to receive funding through the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant program. Senator Kassebaum's leadership has \ngreatly contributed to the fairness with which Indian tribes are \ntreated under H.R. 4 and the progress that has been made by the \nCongress in its treatment of Indian tribes. While there is still some \nquestion about the impact of the bill's overall reductions on the \ncurrent level of child-related funding made to Indian tribal \ngovernments, I am pleased by the Conference Committee's action, taken \nat the urging of Senator Kassebaum, to make all child care funds \nthroughout the bill available to Indian tribal governments.\n  Although there are many Indian tribal provisions that I strongly \nsupport in the bill, I was extremely disappointed that it does not \ninclude a provision to address the concern of State Child Support \nAdministrators and Indian tribal governments that tribes have been left \nout of efforts to provide uniform child support enforcement. The \namendment offered by myself and several others, including the vice \nchairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Inouye, and \nthe Senate minority leader, Senator Daschle, was unanimously agreed to \nby the Senate but it was not adopted by the Conference Committee. \nNonetheless, I am pleased to know that the National Council of State \nChild Support Administrators has agreed to continue to work with me to \naddress our mutual concern. Unless something is done to include tribes \nin these efforts, we will deprive Indian children of necessary child \nsupport services and funding, and we will perpetuate a uniform child \nsupport system that truly does not provide uniformity in Federal \nfunding or services.\n  In addition, I am concerned that no provisions were made to provide \ndirect funding to Indian tribes for Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption \nAssistance funds. The Congress had abundant evidence of the great need \nin Indian Country for these funds. One stark example is the 1994 Office \nof the Inspector General's report that documented that Indian children \nare disproportionately represented in substitute care. However, Indian \ntribes must rely on State governments to share Federal funding for \nTitle IV-E funds; yet the OIG report found that most Indian tribal \ngovernments have received little or no Title IV-E funding. It is my \nhope that States with Indian tribes within their boundaries will make a \ngood faith effort to share these funds equitably in order to improve \nthe Nation's overall rate of children in substitute-care.\n  Finally, I want to give particular thanks to my good friend from \nUtah, Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has worked tirelessly with me \nover the last several months to shape and enhance tribal welfare \nprovisions that could be acceptable in any welfare reform plan. Senator \nHatch is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and he is a new \nmember of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. He has demonstrated a \ngreat level of understanding and commitment to the betterment of the \nlives of Indian people, and I commend Senator Hatch for his steadfast \nleadership in ensuring that Indian tribal governments are fairly \ntreated in the welfare reform debate.\n  Overall, I support the bill. It contains many important advances in \nthe way our Nation treats tribal governments. Several months ago when \nthe bill passed the Senate with these Indian provisions, many Democrats \njoined with Republicans in supporting this measure. While we may \ndisagree on many things, I was glad to see that the Indian provisions \ngained broad, bipartisan support. That reflects a principle I believe \nshould guide the Congress in all matters affecting Indian affairs: \nIndian issues are neither Republican nor Democratic. They are not even \nbipartisan issues--they are nonpartisan issues. They are day-to-day \nhuman issues which require understanding and support from both sides of \nthe aisle. Whatever new form this Nation's welfare system takes, \nproviding equal access to the Nation's Indian population through tribal \nblock grants is not only the right thing to do, it honorably discharges \nsome of our continuing responsibilities under the United States \nConstitution. I urge my colleagues, and the officials in the Clinton \nAdministration, to ensure that this approach is maintained as we reform \nwelfare.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, despite some concerns, I voted to support \nthe welfare reform bill which passed the Senate with overwhelmingly \nbipartisan support on September 19. I did so because I believe our \ncurrent welfare system needs to be reformed and because substantive \nimprovements were made to the bill on the Senate floor. I also wanted \nto advance the bill to a conference with the House where I hoped \nadditional improvements would be made. Before the vote, however, I \nstated that I could not support a final bill unless it guaranteed that \ninnocent children were protected. Regrettably, the bill which has \nemerged from the Senate-House conference fails to meet that test.\n  I am disappointed that the conference committee did not build on the \nbipartisan legislation which passed the Senate. Instead, we have before \nus a bill which, in my view, abdicates our moral responsibility to \nensure that children are not punished for the mistakes of their \nparents. There ought to be a safety net to protect children. This bill \nshreds the safety net and instead gambles with the lives of poor \nchildren by failing to guarantee their security.\n  On September 19, I stated that there were several improvements \ncontained in the Senate bill which would have to be retained or \nimproved upon in conference or I would oppose final passage. \nUnfortunately, many of these provisions were substantially weakened or \nremoved altogether from the bill by the conference committee. I would \nlike to point out just a few of the fatal flaws in the bill before us \ntoday.\n\n\n                               Child Care\n\n  Every expert will tell you that the biggest obstacle in moving people \nfrom welfare to work in this country is the lack of adequate child \ncare. Child care is the linchpin for successful welfare reform.\n  While the bill proposed in the Senate added more money for child \ncare, it fell significantly short of the amount that the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated would be needed in order for the States to meet \nthe stringent requirements in the bill for moving welfare recipients \ninto the work force quickly. \n\n[[Page S19164]]\n To address this shortage of child care funding, the Senate added an \nadditional $3 billion just prior to final passage. While that amount \nwas still well below the amount needed for child care, it was a small \nstep in the right direction. Yet the small amount of money added by the \nSenate for child care was reduced $1.2 billion in conference. The \nCongressional Budget Office tells us that the shortfall for child care \nover the next seven years will be almost $12 billion. That just doesn't \nmake sense. If we want to move welfare recipients into the work force, \nwe must provide for their child care needs. The bill before us is \nwoefully inadequate in meeting those needs.\n  To make matters worse, the conference agreement lets States off the \nhook. As adopted by the Senate, this extra pot of child care funding \nwas made available only to States which agreed to spend in future years \n100 percent of what they spent for child care in 1994. The conference \ncommittee slashed that State requirement to 75 percent, thereby further \nreducing the amount of money available for child care. Again, this just \ndoesn't make sense.\n\n\n                       Mothers of Small Children\n\n  The Senate bill, wisely in my view, allowed States to reduce the work \nrequirements for mothers with children under age six to 20 hour per \nweek instead of the 35 hours per week required of other recipients. \nUnfortunately, the conference agreement deletes this crucial Senate \nprovision. Giving mothers the ability to spend more time at home to \nnurture their children during their most formative years of development \nis the right thing to do. It also meets the test of common sense. The \nSenate-passed bill required these mothers to work, but allowed them to \nbalance work responsibilities with family obligations. The bill before \nus does not, and families will suffer because of this.\n\n\n                         Fiscal Accountability\n\n  Welfare has always been a Federal-State partnership. Under current \nlaw, States contribute about 45 percent of total welfare expenditures. \nWithout States continuing to contribute their share, the pot of money \ncurrently available for welfare could be reduced by almost half \novernight. To make sure that this did not happen, the Senate bill \nrequired States to contribute at least 80 percent of the money they \nspent on welfare in 1994 in order to be eligible for their block grant \nmoney. That requirement was reduced to 75 percent by the conference \ncommittee. What this means is that States will be able to cut their \nfunding by approximately $17 billion over the next 5 years. The end \nresult is that cash assistance could be denied to as many as 1 million \nneedy children. I am simply not willing to gamble with the life of one \nchild. We can and should do better than what is being proposed here.\n\n\n                            Child Protection\n\n  The conference committee also rejected the Senate bill's protections \nfor extremely vulnerable children. While the conference agreement \nmaintains the entitlement status of room and board costs for foster \ncare and adoption, it establishes block grants for all other funding \ncritical to ensuring that children are safe, including removing abused \nand neglected children from unsafe homes and placing them in licensed \nfacilities and permanent homes, and training for foster parents.\n  The conference bill also ends the Federal entitlement responsibility \nfor all other child protection programs, which the Senate had \nmaintained in its bill. Instead, they are combined into two block \ngrants--which will undoubtedly pit preventative services against crisis \nand treatment programs in a battle for limited funding. I find these \ntwo provisions unconscionable. I have no doubt in my mind that they \nwill result in more children living in abusive homes and in danger.\n  The current welfare system serves no one well--not recipients, not \ntheir children, not American taxpayers. The current system has trapped \ntoo many people in a cycle of lifetime dependency. Any meaningful \nwelfare reform must be grounded on the basic premise that government \nassistance is a way ``up and out''--not a ``way of life.'' It must be \nviewed as a temporary assistance program for people who are down and \nout on their luck and need a helping hand to get them back on their \nfeet and back to work.\n  In crafting meaningful welfare reform, however, protecting the \nchildren of poor mothers must be a priority. Let's not forget that 9 \nmillion children will be affected by this legislation. Let's not forget \nthat more than 20 percent of America's children live in poverty. And \nlet's not forget that the Office of Management and Budget estimates \nthat an additional 1.5 million children will fall into poverty if this \nconference agreement is enacted. Protecting innocent children is and \nought remain a Federal responsibility and a national priority. \nUnfortunately, the conference committee has failed to meet this \nresponsibility. There is simply no safety net for poor, innocent \nchildren in this bill. For this reason, it is with great disappointment \nthat I simply cannot support this conference agreement. Having said \nthat, I remain optimistic that a responsible welfare bill which puts \npeople to work but protects innocent children can be crafted during \nthis session of Congress. I remain committed to that goal.\n\n\n                  The Milking of Our Children's Future\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America is waking up to what the Contract \nWith America is really about. But that has not stopped the Republican \nCongress from forging ahead with their ideological war, that in the end \nwill hurt not just low-income children and families, but our country as \na whole.\n  The bill before us is rhetorically called ``welfare reform''. Its \nsupporters claim they want to get people off welfare and into a job, \nbut this is undermined by the fact that the bill does not give States \nthe resources to follow through on this claim.\n  What this bill does do is provide billions less than what is \nnecessary for States to provide child care and meet work requirements. \nThis bill cuts assistance for the poor, disabled children and the \nelderly, and cuts funds that are needed to rescue children from abusive \nhomes. It cuts over $30 billion from the food stamp program and \nprovides for optional block grants that will not allow States to \nrespond to increased need during periods of higher unemployment--over \n80 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children.\n  Vermont initiated its own welfare reform plan a year ago, aimed at \ngetting people off welfare and into the work force. Vermont's program \nis working--because the State lowered the rhetoric, left off the sound \nbites, and got the job done. The cuts included in this bill will be a \nstep backward and could dismantle the programs that have been working \nin Vermont. It will also be a step backward for the work accomplished \nby Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger and other Vermont \nchildren's advocacy groups.\n  To highlight what this bill is really all about I want to talk about \njust one--perhaps seemingly minor--aspect of the agreement reached on \nthe school lunch program. A few years ago, the Reagan administration \ntried to block-grant the school lunch program. They also tried to say \nthat ketchup was a vegetable. Americans resented people in Washington \nplaying politics with school lunches.\n  Now the Republicans in the House of Representatives, and a few here \nin the Senate, are playing the same kinds of political games. Their \nblock grants would end the 50-year-old requirement that schools provide \na carton of milk with every school lunch.\n  Milk has been required in the National School Lunch Program ever \nsince the program began in 1946. The law could not be clearer on this \nsubject: ``Lunches served by schools participating in the school lunch \nprogram under this act shall offer students fluid milk.''\n  Milk is essential to a child's healthy development. It builds strong \nbones and healthy bodies. Serving every child a carton of milk every \nday teaches children a crucial lesson about eating healthy meals.\n  Schools now serve about 40 million half-pints of milk per day in the \nschool lunch and school breakfast program. Children in the school lunch \nprogram drink 454 million gallons of milk per year. By comparison, all \nthe dairy farmers in the State of Vermont produce 279 million gallons \nof milk per year. The milk provided through school lunches accounts for \nover 7 percent of all fluid milk consumed in the United States.\n  In my 8 years as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, during two \nfull \n\n[[Page S19165]]\nrewrites of the child nutrition law, I never once heard anyone complain \nthat the school lunch program was serving too much milk.\n  Yet this bill sets up block grants, and then provides them with \ninsufficient funds to provide a healthy meal, including milk, to every \nchild who needs one.\n  When the financial crunch hits, States are likely to stop serving \nmilk to children--they will replace it with cheaper and less healthy \nsubstitutes like soda.\n  By the way, under this Republican welfare bill, any State--not just a \nblock-grant State--can obtain a waiver to serve junk food and soda in \nschool cafeterias. I fought for 8 years to keep junk food out of the \nschool lunch program.\n  I want to read from a letter that the Senator from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, and myself sent to the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, on December 6 supporting his stance against \nschool lunch block grants. The letter was also signed by 9 other \nRepublicans and 11 other Democrats.\n\n       We oppose mandatory or optional block grants for the child \n     nutrition programs. The school lunch program provides healthy \n     meals every day for 25 million American children. Block \n     grants could undermine the nutritional value of those meals, \n     threaten the guarantee of free meals for needy children, and \n     provide inadequate funding for the program during recessions \n     and other times of need.\n\n  The National School Lunch Program is a program that works. \nAmericans--both Democrats and Republicans--support it. It answers a \nvital need. So why do we need to end the Federal commitment to feeding \nchildren and replace it with a block grant? The American School Food \nService Association believes that school block grants are a step in the \nwrong direction and has urged members to vote against this bill.\n  Underfunded block grants, whether for school lunch, food stamps, \nchild protection, Medicaid or aid to families with children do not give \nStates the tools they need to respond to increased needs during periods \nof higher unemployment. State taxpayers will be the ones to pick up the \ntab.\n  This bill needs to be vetoed so we can start working on a real \nwelfare reform bill in a bipartisan fashion. We must come together and \nwe must agree on the basic principles that can guide our efforts. In my \nview, the only way to begin this discussion is for President Clinton to \nveto this bill.\n  I trust that the President will do so in the interest of American's \nchildren and America's future.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, 3 months ago, the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to bring about fundamental change to welfare in this \ncountry.\n  The entitlement status of cash welfare is ended in this bill. This is \nthe most important step we can take if we want to successfully end the \ncycle of dependency. As Marvin Olasky noted in his recent book, ``The \nTragedy of American Compassion,'' effective welfare requires the \nability to distinguish those who have fallen on hard times and need a \nhelping hand from those who simply refuse to act in a disciplined and \nresponsible manner. When welfare is a Federal entitlement, it is very \ndifficult to make these distinctions.\n  However, ending the entitlement must be accompanied by the support \nnecessary to get welfare recipients into jobs. In considering our \nwelfare system, I think it is useful to distinguish beneficiaries by \nthree major groups.\n  First, there are those in need of temporary assistance. People who, \nwhile they are generally able to support themselves and their families, \nthey have fallen on hard times. Food stamps and other assistance must \nbe there to provide temporary help when unforeseen economic crises \noccur.\n  The second group includes those whom most of us would agree cannot \nwork. These individuals--through no fault of their own, are simply not \nable to economically provide for themselves. They have disabilities \nthat warrant our compassion not our scorn. The welfare system should be \nthere for them.\n  The third group consists of people who fall somewhere in between the \nfirst and second groups. They have been on and off the welfare rolls \nfor years, yet they don't seem to fit the profile of someone whom most \nwould agree cannot work.\n  It is this third group that should be the focus of the current \nwelfare debate. The debate has often been extremely polarized. Many on \nthe left are reluctant to vest any sense of personal responsibility in \nwelfare recipients. They view them as unwitting victims of societal \ninjustices, refusing to acknowledge the role that personal behavior may \nplay.\n  On the other hand, many on the right are reluctant to acknowledge \nthat no person is an island--that each of us thrives or fails to \nthrive, to some extent, as a result of our environment. Some on the \nright naively believe that we all have the same opportunities and that \na failure to succeed is simply evidence of laziness.\n  For many beneficiaries in this third group, one of the most essential \ningredients for self-sufficiency is the availability of child care. I \nam of the opinion that we cannot mandate strict work requirements \nwithout providing States with a reasonable amount of child care \nfunding.\n  During Senate debate on welfare, I worked on a bipartisan basis with \nother Members to increase funding for child care. Even under the \ncurrent system of entitlement, there are more than 3,000 children of \nworking parents already waiting to receive child care assistance in \nMaine. While the conference agreement decreases the Senate funding \nlevel by about $200 million, that decrease in funds is balanced by a \nreduction in the work requirements in the early years of \nimplementation. Rather than the 25 percent level called for in the \nSenate bill, States will be required to place 15 percent of their \ncaseload in work activities.\n  In addition, the conference agreement will add $1.6 billion in \nfunding for the social services block grant. This block grant has been \nused in many States to fund additional child care services for low-\nincome families and this funding will allow States to furnish \nadditional services for child care and to promote economic self-\nsufficiency.\n  The provision for child care services in the agreement continues to \nprovide protections for children who are not yet in school by \nprohibiting States from penalizing mothers who cannot work because \nthere simply is no child care available.\n  We have been criticized on all sides for providing too much and \nproviding too little in this legislation. We do not know how States \nwill react to this new flexibility and independence in setting policy. \nThis legislation reflects the philosophy that Washington does not have \nall the answers. We should no longer assume that one-size-fits-all \nFederal solutions offer better hope than granting more freedom to \nStates to design approaches that address a State's unique set of \ncircumstances.\n  Having said that, I believe we have a common and national interest in \nassuring an effective social safety net for all Americans, regardless \nof where citizens may reside. So I would not support any effort to \ncompletely remove the Federal Government from the welfare system.\n  Through Government, we have an obligation to try to counter the \nnegative influences which impact some of the poorest members of our \nsociety. Many Americans are born into environments of drugs, crime and \nsevere poverty. And regrettably, too many of our young people are \ngrowing up without two parents involved in their lives. The correlation \nbetween single parenthood and welfare dependency is overwhelming. \nNinety-two percent of AFDC families have no father in the home.\n  Society must also acknowledge the correlation between crime and \nfatherlessness. Three-quarters of all long-term prisoners grew up \nwithout fathers in their homes or active in their lives. When 24 \npercent of children born today are born to unwed mothers, we cannot \navoid this issue if we hope to break the cycle of poverty and crime \nthat permeate some of our communities.\n  Unfortunately, no one really knows how to stop that cycle. For this \nreason, I do not support efforts to attach a lot of strings to the \nwelfare block grants, including provisions ostensibly designed to curb \nillegitimacy. It is clear that welfare reform cannot disregard the \ngrowing incidence of out-of-wedlock births, teen pregnancy, and absent \n\n[[Page S19166]]\nfathers, but it is also clear that we don't know what will counter this \ntrend. Accordingly, we ought not prescribe a Federal solution that \nwould hamstring the ability of States to try different approaches.\n  This legislation does bring a new national presence to the collection \nof child support and establishing paternity for children born out-of-\nwedlock. By taking a tougher stand to establish and then enforce child \nsupport orders, some of the families currently tied to the welfare \nsystem may be able to get loose. Financial support cannot replace the \npresence of a good father in a household but it will relieve some of \nthe burdens placed on single mothers.\n  I support the general thrust of the pending welfare legislation to \nturn more decisionmaking authority over to the States. Consistency \nwould suggest that we not at the same time put a lot of requirements on \nStates on how and who to spend Federal welfare dollars. I do think that \nit is important to ensure that States share responsibility with the \nFederal Government by investing dollars at the State level in welfare \nprograms. For this reason, I supported a strong maintenance of effort \nrequirement which remains largely intact in the conference report.\n  Block-granting AFDC to the States is not a panacea. A welfare system \nthat has clearer lines of responsibility and accountability will be \nmore effective. But this is not the end of the welfare debate. \nHopefully, we will enact legislation this year that will make \nmeaningful improvements in the current system. But turning these \nprograms over to the States will not itself fix the problems. Congress \nand the President must continue to work with States to improve the \nwelfare system to make sure that a safety net is there for those who \nneed it but is denied to those who abuse it.\n  I intend to support the conference agreement, but I do have \nreservations regarding some of the changes that were included in the \nfinal agreement. We have been put on notice that this legislation will \nbe vetoed by President Clinton. If the President follows through on his \npromise, it is my hope that we can revisit those important issues when \nthe legislation returns to Congress.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the welfare reform conference report \nbefore us today should be defeated. It should be defeated because it \ndoes not adequately address our Nation's needs and particularly the \nneeds of my State; it endangers the Nation's children; it does not help \npeople move from welfare to work.\n\n\n              Inadequate Attention to Unemployment, Growth\n\n  Compared to the bill we previously passed, this bill gives short \nshrift to my State's needs.\n  First, the Senate bill created a contingency fund of $1 billion to \nhelp States with high unemployment. This conference agreement reduces \nthis fund to $800 million. California had an unemployment rate stood of \n8.8 percent in November, while the national rate was 5.6 percent. In \nthe last 5 years, my State's unemployment rate has never dropped below \n7 percent, reaching 10 percent in 1994.\n  Second, the bill's underlying funding formula fails to recognize high \ngrowth rates in poverty. I offered an amendment to redistribute funds \nby the change in poverty population each year. The conference agreement \ndoes not rectify this problem. California's population is expected to \ngrow from 30 million in 1990 to 42 million in 2010 and 49 million by \n2020.\n  Third, under this bill, States will contribute less. The Senate bill \nrequired States to maintain 80 percent of their 1994 funding of cash \nassistance [AFDC]. Under this bill, States can drop their funding to 75 \npercent. Thus, they can reduce their funding by 25 percent. This would \nallow States to reduce State spending by $5 billion.\n\n\n                Protecting Neglected and Abused Children\n\n  Programs providing services to neglected and abused children are an \nimportant part of this bill. These are services that have removed \nchildren from unsafe homes, placed them in protective settings, \nprovided periodic reviews of their status, and trained child protection \nstaff.\n  Child protection services are included in a block grant and cut by \n$1.3 billion over 7 years. These are services like training for foster \nparents, child abuse emergency response, and other services that try to \nkeep families together and protect children in foster homes.\n  There are at least half a million of these children in California.\n  From 1988 to 1993, nationally, the rate of reported child abuse and \nneglect rose 25 percent. The foster care caseload grew 50 percent. From \n1983 to 1993, the number of children in child protection grew by two-\nthirds. Los Angeles last year responded to more than 165,000 reports of \nabused and neglected children.\n  This bill will weaken support for these, our most vulnerable \nchildren.\n\n\n                     Not Helping Mothers Be Mothers\n\n  The Senate bill allowed States to limit the work requirement to 20 \nhours a week for mother with children under age 6. This bill requires \nmothers of small children to work at least 35 hours a week.\n  While work requirements are appropriate for many people, mothers are \nthe most important influence in a young child's life. Work requirements \nshould be compatible with raising a family and guiding young children. \nI believe a 20-hour work week requirement for mothers with young \nchildren, rejected by this bill, is reasonable.\n\n\n                           No Health Coverage\n\n  The conference version, unlike the previous Senate bill, ends the \nguarantee of health insurance or Medicaid for women on AFDC and their \nchildren over age 13.\n  In California, 290,000 children and 750,000 parents would lose \ncoverage, according to the Children's Defense Fund. This represents 18 \npercent of all children in the United States losing coverage.\n  By ending this health insurance, we will add to our State's uninsured \npopulation which is already the third highest in the Nation at 22 \npercent. Without health insurance or the ability to purchase it, sick \npeople end up in hospital emergency rooms and we all pay through tax \ndollars or our private policies.\n\n\n                   Work Requirements, Resources Weak\n\n  The bill's goal, a goal I endorse, is to move welfare recipients from \ndependency to work. The bill requires States to have 50 percent of \nrecipients participating in work by 2002. But the bill falls short in \nseveral ways.\n  First, the conference agreement, unlike the Senate bill, does not \nrequire personal responsibility contracts, agreements that obligate the \nrecipient and move him or her toward self-sufficiency.\n  Second, the conference agreement deletes the Senate provision giving \nbonuses to States for job placements.\n  And third, and most importantly, the bill does not provide adequate \nfunds for child care programs to support the requirements that States \nput welfare recipients into work.\n\n\n                               Child Care\n\n  Child care is the linchpin to self-sufficiency for mothers on \nwelfare. The fact is that mothers cannot go to work without child care \nprograms for their children. There are two serious problems in this \nbill, the first is funding and the second is standards.\n  Currently in California, 80 percent of eligible AFDC children are \nunserved. The bill before us exacerbates this already dire situation. \nTo support the work requirements of the bill, the bill falls short from \n$6 billion to $13 billion.\n  Child care experts in California tell me that this means our State \nwould be $1.3 billion short of what is needed to meet the increased \ndemand caused by the work requirements of the bill.\n  Under current law, to qualify for Federal child care funds, States \nmust set quality standards that address things like caregiver to child \nratios, sprinkler systems, plumbing standards, hygiene.\n  The Senate bill retained this requirement, but the conference \nagreement before us eliminates it. This means that there is no \nguarantee that young children will be in safe and healthy environments.\n\n\n                          Innovative Programs\n\n  California has some of the most innovative welfare programs in the \ncountry.\n  We have the GAIN program--Greater Avenues for Independence--in \nRiverside, that has returned $2.84 to the taxpayers for every $1 spent.\n  In Los Angeles, the GAIN program has a job placement rate of 34 \npercent. \n\n[[Page S19167]]\n\n  San Mateo and San Diego Counties have successful job-search programs.\n  San Mateo, last year, put 85 percent of the people in the program to \nwork.\n  The Senate adopted my amendment to allow HHS to negotiate directly \nwith large counties to establish innovative programs. Unfortunately, \nthe conferees deleted this provision.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  No one has a right to welfare. Welfare was never intended to be a \npermanent way of life. It was intended to be a lifeboat for people in \ntemporary emergency situations. In my State, there are almost 2.6 \nmillion people receiving welfare or 18 percent of the U.S. caseload in \na State that has 12 percent of the population. I want to reform \nwelfare. I want families to be secure and self-sufficient. But this \nbill does not do it. I cannot support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nconference report for the Personal Responsibility Act of 1995.\n  I gave my qualified support to the Senate welfare reform bill, the \nWork Opportunity Act of 1995, because I believed it contained important \nimprovements from the draconian House welfare reform measure.\n  Without the Senate-passed protections, I can no longer support the \nwelfare reform efforts of this Republican Congress. This bill simply \ngoes too far toward what I believe will be a dark development for poor \nfamilies as spending for needy families with children will be reduced \nby approximately 18 percent.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to further explain why this \nconference agreement is unacceptable to me and should not be passed by \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                             CHILD WELFARE\n\n  Mr. President, abused and neglected children have no place in efforts \nto reform welfare. To try to squeeze out savings from programs which \nprotect the most vulnerable in our society is not only wrongheaded, but \nmean-spirited as well.\n  The House bill would create two child protection block grants to \nStates--ending the total Federal guarantee of foster care and adoption \nassistance to the children who are the most desperately need of our \nhelp. The Senate-passed bill left current law on these programs \nunchanged.\n  It has been demonstrated that in times of economic downturns, the \nneed for child protective services rises commensurately. When there was \na 6 percent decrease in AFDC California in 1992, there was a 10 percent \nincrease of children into the welfare system and a 20 percent increase \nin child abuse reports in Los Angeles County. However, this conference \nagreement takes a short-sighted approach by capping spending on child \nwelfare programs at a time when the need for them could increase \ndramatically.\n  The conferees wisely retained the Federal guarantee for title IV-E \nfoster care and adoption assistance maintenance payments for abused and \nneglected children who qualify. But the conference agreement caps the \ncosts to administer the foster care and adoption assistance program, \nregardless of additional burdens which may be placed on the system. \nThis will mean $1.3 billion over 7 years will be slashed from serving \nabused and neglected children. That is a disgrace.\n  Mr. President, I want to explain what constitutes ``administrative \ncosts'' under the foster care and adoption assistance program. I think \nwe can all agree that where needless paperwork and red tape can be \neliminated, we should encourage it. But in the case of the title IV-E \nfoster care and adoption assistance program, administrative costs are \nused for activities such as the training of foster care and adoptive \nparents, investigations, referrals, and appropriate child placements.\n  Title IV-E administrative costs would be folded into a Child \nProtection Block Grant, and capped, together with the Family \nPreservation and Independent Living Programs.\n  Mr. President, the Family Preservation Program is having a positive \neffect in the State of California. In Los Angeles County, the Family \nPreservation Program has served 10,000 children in 3 years. Through \nmore extensive supervision by law enforcement and social workers and \nviolence prevention, the Los Angeles County Preservation Program can \nclaim an approximate 50 percent decrease in child abuse deaths in 3 \nyears and serves more at-risk families with less money than the \ntraditional foster care program.\n  This welfare bill will hurt innovative programs such as Los Angeles \nCounty Family Preservation Program by capping it arbitrarily.\n  The story of 6 year-old Elisa Izquierdo in New York is the kind most \nof us hope to never have to read. Young Elisa fell through the cracks \nof the New York City child welfare system--one of the largest in the \ncountry. Her story is a tragic example of what can happen in an \noverburdened child welfare program.\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to ensure that every child is \nprotected from an unsafe household. The conference agreement will \nseriously undermine the ability of child welfare agencies to meet this \nobligation. To endanger the lives of vulnerable children is not worth \nthe few savings these provisions will bring.\n\n\n                                  WORK\n\n  This bill is weak on work. The conference agreement strips out \nprovisions added to the Senate bill which would get serious about \nputting welfare recipients into the workforce. This legislation gives a \nperson 2 years before they have to work--not 3 months, as in the Senate \nbill.\n  The conference agreement also does not contain the bonus to States \nfor exceeding the targeted work participation rates as provided under \nthe Senate bill.\n  The debate on welfare has centered around ``personal \nresponsibility.'' Yet the conference agreement fails to require welfare \nrecipients to sign a personal responsibility contract in order to \nreceive their benefits.\n  On the other hand, the conference agreement removes some of the most \nimportant protections for welfare families transitioning to work. I \nsupported the provisions in the Senate bill which would have recipients \nto go to work after 3 months of receiving benefits. However, where a \nwoman's safety could be threatened, the Senate bill would permit an \nexemption for battered women from the overall work requirement.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, which I introduced and passed last \nCongress, went a long way toward assisting battered women who were in \nunsafe households. Removal of this important exemption demonstrates the \nfailure to understand the dangers many battered women face and the \ncircumstances which keep them from leaving their abusers.\n  In addition, the final bill forces 35 hours of work per week for \nparents with young children without sufficiently funding child care.\n  And where a family is subjected to circumstances of extreme hardship, \nI support a more generous exemption for such families from the time \nlimit on benefits. While the Senate bill would have permitted States to \nexempt up to 20 percent of their welfare caseload under a hardship \nexemption, the conference agreement only permits the exemption of 15 \npercent of the caseload. Based on HHS estimates, this could mean up to \n500,000 more children than the Senate bill will be denied benefits due \nto the expiration of time limits under the lower 15 percent exemption.\n\n\n                               CHILD CARE\n\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement is inadequate in meeting the \nchild care needs of welfare families. CBO estimates that this bill \ncontains $6 billion less than what is needed by families to meet the \nbill's own work requirements. HHS estimates that the funding level is \n$13.6 billion less than what will be needed to meet the work \nrequirements.\n  The agreement does not contain the important provision in the Senate \nbill which would allow States to require mothers with children under \nthe age of 6 to participate in work programs for 20 hours per week \ninstead of 35 hours per week. Removal of this exception will mean \nsignificantly greater demands will be placed on the child care funds \ncontained in the bill, hindering the efforts of parents trying to get \noff of welfare.\n  In addition, child care health and safety protections contained in \ncurrent law and retained in the Senate bill would be eliminated.\n  The quality set-aside, used by States to promote and assure the \navailability of safe and affordable child care, is less than half the \namount passed in the \n\n[[Page S19168]]\nSenate bill. Without safe and affordable child care, parents are faced \nwith terrible alternatives: leaving their young children with siblings \ntoo young for the responsibility, or worse yet, allowing their young \nchildren to stay at home unsupervised. No responsible parent wants to \nbe faced with that decision. In some cases, such decisions could meet \nwith dire consequences.\n  Mr. President, simply put, child care is the absolute linchpin to any \nsuccessful welfare reform effort. Without adequate child care, there is \nlittle reason to believe that welfare families have any real hope of \nworking their way off of welfare and staying off. Working families with \nchildren today understand this need better than anyone else.\n  California already has a serious shortage of safe and affordable \nchild care. Today, 30,454 children in California are served under \nFederal child care programs. But thousands more sit on waiting lists. \nIn fact, only about 14 percent of eligible children are currently being \nserved by child care programs in California.\n  Combined with the title XX Social Services Block Grant funding cut of \n10 percent in the budget reconciliation measure--which many states use \nto fund child care activities--the severe underfunding of child care in \nthe conference bill will further exacerbate the problem of underserved \nfamilies in California.\n\n\n                            LEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n  California is home to the approximately 38 percent of the total \nnumber of all immigrants in the United States. Legal immigrants \ncomprise more than 12 percent of the total population of California for \nan estimated 4 million total number of legal immigrants. Legal \nimmigrants make up approximately one-sixth of the total Los Angeles \nCounty population.\n  The conference agreement will cut off a variety of benefits to legal \nimmigrants. The California legislative analyst's office estimated that \nthe legal immigrant provisions of the House and Senate-passed welfare \nbills would reduce Federal funds to the State of California by $6.6 to \n$8.3 billion over 5 years. The restrictions on benefits to legal \nimmigrants would comprise more than half of the total loss of Federal \nwelfare funds to the State ($3.6 to $5.3 billion).\n  The loss of these funds will result in a tremendous cost shift to the \nState of California and its local governments. Under California State \nlaw, counties are mandated to provide cash and medical assistance to \nlow-income persons who are otherwise ineligible for Federal assistance.\n  In sum, the conference agreement goes too far in restricting benefit \neligibility for legal immigrants, many of whom have been in the country \nfor years and paid taxes. It will also transfer billions of dollars in \ncosts to the already overburdened local governments of California.\n\n\n                          MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY\n\n  The conference agreement quietly severs the link between AFDC and \nMedicaid eligibility. Under this bill, women and children over age 13 \nreceiving cash assistance would no longer be guaranteed Medicaid \ncoverage. Neither the Senate nor the House-passed welfare bills would \nhave gone so far as to eliminate the longstanding guarantee of Medicaid \ncoverage for needy citizens.\n  Elimination of this link, combined with ending the entitlement to \ncash assistance and shrinking spending for other services for our \nneedy, will render the safety net for the most vulnerable in our \ncountry virtually non-existent.\n\n\n                            CHILD NUTRITION\n\n  House Republican efforts to end Federal School Lunch and School \nBreakfast Programs and replace them with capped funding to States are \nboth ill-advised and unpopular. Again, the Senate approach wisely \nmaintained the Federal child nutrition programs.\n  For nearly 50 years, the School Lunch Program has fed hungry \nchildren. School-based feeding programs are sound investments in \nchildrens' health and their education. Studies show that children who \ngo to school hungry tire easily. They have trouble concentrating, do \nworse on standardized tests and are more likely to miss class due to \nillness. Every day, 25 million school children in America get a well-\nbalanced, nutritious meal through the Federal school lunch program--2 \nmillion of these children are in California.\n  Despite widespread public support for the National School Lunch and \nSchool Breakfast Programs, the conference agreement would permit 7 \nStates to receive funding for their programs in the form of a block \ngrant. Children in those 7 States would no longer receive a Federal \nguarantee to a nutritious meal which may be the only one they eat all \nday.\n  The Los Angeles Times published a series of articles on hunger in \nsouthern California late last year. One of the most moving pieces told \nthe stories of the many hungry children at Edgewood Middle School in \nthe city of West Covina. The piece recounted the problems of serious \nhunger and malnutrition among students in what is considered to be a \nmiddle-class bedroom community.\n  After the story was printed, there was a huge outpouring of public \nsupport for feeding the hungry students at Edgewood. Citizens donated \nboxes of food, and money, and the West Covina Unified School District \nvoted for the first time to sign up for the School Breakfast Program. \nShortly thereafter, 60 California school districts followed suit and \napplied for the Federal School Breakfast Program.\n  The conferees' decision to open the door to ending National School \nLunch and School Breakfast Programs flies in the face of widespread \npublic support for child nutrition programs, as evidenced by the \nEdgewood Middle School example.\n\n\n                            SSI FOR CHILDREN\n\n  The conference agreement goes beyond the Senate-passed bill to reduce \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits by 25 percent for 65 \npercent of the children who are on SSI. The agreement would create a \ntwo-tier benefit structure, cutting the SSI program for disabled \nchildren by $3 billion over 7 years more than under the Senate bill. \nThis cut will have a dramatic impact on low-income families who use SSI \nto help pay for their disabled childrens' needs.\n\n\n                         MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT\n\n  The Senate passed a requirement that States must spend at least 80 \npercent of their previous fiscal year's spending in order to receive \ntheir full block grant allocation. The conference agreement lowers the \nrequirement to 75 percent. In effect, this will permit States to reduce \ntheir welfare spending by $5 billion over the next 7 years more than \nunder the Senate-passed bill.\n\n\n                               FAMILY CAP\n\n  Real welfare reform makes work pay and provides incentives for \nfamilies to transition out of the system. This bill takes the reverse \ntack of punishing welfare families for being poor. Take for instance, \nprovisions to impose mandatory family caps. Family caps prohibit States \nfrom providing additional cash assistance to families who have more \nchildren while on welfare.\n  The Senate spoke on this issue by voting to remove a mandatory family \ncap provision. The conference agreement subverts the Senate vote by \nrequiring States to impose family caps unless the State legislature \nexplicitly votes otherwise--making it extremely difficult to provide \nadditional assistance to affected children.\n  The family cap has not sufficiently proven itself to be a successful \nway to drive down the number of births to women already on welfare. A \npreliminary study done by Rutgers University of the New Jersey State \nfamily cap revealed that the policy did not reduce births to women on \nAFDC, but did drive children in such families even further below the \npoverty line.\n\n\n                             CHILD SUPPORT\n\n  The conference agreement does not contain the amendment which passed \nunanimously in the Senate which would eliminate benefits to deadbeat \nparents. The amendment, which I offered, would make noncustodial \nparents who are more than 2 months behind in their child support \nineligible for federally means-tested benefits unless they enter into a \nschedule of repayment for arrears owed. This provision would have sent \na message to get tough with parents who do not take their child support \nobligations seriously. \n\n[[Page S19169]]\n\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Combined with proposals to severely cut back the Earned Income Tax \nCredit, Medicaid, and Head Start, this welfare reform bill will not \nreform the flawed welfare system, but create more serious barriers for \nfamilies trying to work their way out of welfare.\n  This conference agreement extracts approximately $60 billion from \nprograms serving the poorest among us at a time where the Republicans \nwant to give tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. I do not agree with \nthese priorities. Moreover, the bill's dramatic underfunding is unfair \nto both States and poor families.\n  And while I support welfare reform that gets tough on work, this one \nfails even that test.\n  In summary, I cannot support legislation which will throw countless \nchildren into poverty. No one expects us to solve the welfare problem \nby punishing children for being poor.\n  The President has pledged to veto this welfare bill. And for the \nreasons I have stated, I must vote against the final welfare reform \nbill as well. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Dole Work Opportunities Act and am proud to have worked with the \ncurrent occupant of the chair, the Senator from Pennsylvania. I do \nbelieve that this welfare reform act will, as the President said months \nago, ``end welfare as we know it.''\n  As early as 1935, President Roosevelt recognized that the welfare \nsystem was not working. At that time he said:\n\n       The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence \n     immediately before me, show conclusively that continued \n     dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral \n     disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national \n     fiber. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a \n     narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. It is \n     inimical to the dictates of sound policy. It is a violation \n     of the traditions of America.\n\n  Unfortunately we find ourselves, today, some 60 years later, with \nmillions of Americans on welfare. In my State, 39,000 Alaskans are on \nwelfare sometime during the year. That includes many foreign citizens, \nwho are residents of our State.\n  What is worse, once people go on welfare they seem to stay on it. The \naverage person is on welfare for a mind-boggling 13 years, once he or \nshe gets on welfare.\n  Teenage girls get welfare checks, but only if they become pregnant. \nInstead of discouraging teen pregnancy, our Government actually rewards \nit with a cash bonus.\n  Today, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is a startling 33 percent. Half \nof the teenagers who have babies end up on welfare before their babies \nare a year old.\n  The current welfare system rewards idleness instead of work, rewards \nteenagers who have babies out of wedlock instead of those who practice \nabstinence, and rewards foreigners who illegally enter the country.\n  The war on poverty's chief casualty has been the American taxpayer. \nOver $5 trillion, in constant 1993 dollars, has been spent on welfare \nprograms in the 30 years since its inception.\n  I supported some of those activities under that program, but I am \nconvinced now that the American people are fed up with this Federal \nwelfare system that contradicts values: It discourages marriages, \npenalizes work, and encourages illegitimacy. Its results speak for \nthemselves.\n  In Detroit, in 1993, 50 percent of all children in that city received \nAFDC benefits at some time during the year. And an astounding 67 \npercent of all the people of that city received AFDC payments during \nthe year. Mr. President, 50 percent of all children in the city were \nreceiving benefits at a given point of time, and 67 percent received \nthem at some point during that year. I am quoting from the statistics \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  The current welfare system is not a temporary way station for many. \nInstead, it has become a multigenerational way of life. According to a \n1986 study by David Ellwood, currently an Assistant Secretary at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 82 percent of AFDC recipients \non the rolls at a given time had been there for more than 5 years, and \n65 percent for 8 years or more.\n  The breakdown of the family, the glue that has traditionally held our \nAmerican society together, is another casualty of this welfare system. \nTeenagers, too young to have a driver's license, are having babies and \nmoving into apartments of their own, financed by the taxpayers, and \nhaving more babies. And children born out of wedlock are three times \nmore likely to be on welfare when they grow up.\n\n  The existing system breeds discontent and idleness. It is a fertile \nground for abandoning personal responsibility for one's life, one's \nchildren, our society, or our way of life.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in the Depression when everyone had to work \nto survive. We had to work hard. From the time, literally, we were 6 or \n7, my brothers and sister and I worked at odd jobs to keep our family \ngoing. Things were tough, but my grandmother taught us that the way for \nus to get ahead and stay ahead was through hard work.\n  I think it is time to put my Grandma Stevens' horse sense back into \nour public policy.\n  The bill Bob Dole and I, and the occupant of the Chair, cosponsored \ncharts a bold new course designed to reverse decades of perverse \nincentives and failed policies. Our bill will restore a sense of ethics \nto our social fabric, especially the ethics of work, responsibility, \nand family integrity.\n  This bill will end welfare as an entitlement. The bill will return to \nthe concept of a helping hand to those truly in need, temporarily, \nuntil that person has a chance to get back on his or her own two feet.\n  It will impose a 5-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare benefits, \nrequire welfare recipients to work as soon as they are trained, \nprovides $18 billion for child care to enable welfare mothers to work, \nterminates benefits to those who refuse to work, requires teenagers who \nhave babies to stay in school and live under adult supervision to \nqualify for benefits, denies welfare payments to drug addicts and \nalcoholics, reduces the Federal bureaucracy by transferring the \nprograms to the States to run.\n  This measure provides the flexibility to allow States to address the \nneeds of those truly in need. We will all agree, I hope, that the \ndisabled veteran, the elderly widow, or the learning-disabled child \nshould continue to receive our help, and will under this bill.\n  Nothing in this bill prevents States from exempting recipients from \nthe work requirement if they are physically or mentally unable to do \nthe work. This bill also gives the States the option to cut off \nbenefits to mothers who have more children while on welfare to \ndiscourage illegitimate births. As harsh as that sounds, it was the \nrecommendation that came to me personally from school nurses in my \nState.\n  This is the family cap concept. Some folks in the media, I think, \nhave misconstrued this section of our bill. Our bill does not say the \nStates cannot institute a family cap--it says let the States decide \nwhether to institute it or not. That is what this debate is all about.\n  For too long, Washington has dictated welfare policy to individual \nStates. My State is a good example of the flexibility that is needed in \nadministering laws such as this.\n  States have the right to experiment and decide the best way to \ndiscourage welfare abuse and yet meet the needs of their citizens. By \nmandating caps, we would go down the failed road of ``Congress knows \nbest.''\n  This bill is not a Congress knows best bill. It is a ``States know \nbest'' bill. And that is what the 10th amendment is all about. It is \nsimple. It says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The 10th amendment is fulfilled by this bill that we have before us, \nthe Work Opportunities Act. It leaves to the States the powers reserved \nto them, and I am proud to support it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this year, I have consistently argued \nfor reform of the welfare system. Today, I voted against legislation \nthat misuses the label ``welfare reform'' and deserves to be soundly \nrejected.\n  I am extremely disappointed that an extremist faction of Congress \nmanaged to turn a historic chance for enacting welfare reform into \nanother way to \n\n[[Page S19170]]\npursue an agenda that will hurt children, weaken families, and cripple \nState budgets. To pursue this mean-spirited program so close to \nChristmas makes it all the sadder and more shameful.\n  I am determined to press on for real welfare reform that promotes \nwork, reduces dependency, and protects innocent children. I have \npersonally worked to promote welfare reform for many years as Governor \nof West Virginia and in the U.S. Senate, and I will not give up.\n  In 1982, as Governor, I helped establish one of the first workfare \nprograms in the country, which continues in West Virginia today. In \n1988, I was a conferee who helped forge a bipartisan agreement to \npromote work in the Family Support Act. This year, I have been eager to \nwork in a bipartisan manner to promote even bolder initiatives for \nwelfare reform that could build on the innovations started by the \nFamily Support Act, and state-led experimentation.\n  My fundamental principles for reform are that parents should accept \npersonal responsibility and work, but that children must be protected, \nnot punished. We should never forget that two-thirds of the people on \nwelfare are children, and 70,000 of them live in my State of West \nVirginia. They are the innocent ones, and they should not be punished \nbecause of their birth.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the Work First plan, sponsored by \nSenators Daschle, Mikulski, and Breaux, because I strongly felt that \nthis program was the best initiative to promote work and still protect \nthe millions of children who depend on welfare for basic needs of food, \nclothing, and shelter. When our Democratic alternative was not adopted, \nI was willing to work in a bipartisan manner in the Senate to try and \nforge an agreement. I voted for the Dole-Daschle leadership amendment \nand the bipartisan Senate welfare bill. It was not perfect, and no \ncomprehensive bill can be. It was a sincere effort to reform our \nwelfare system and retain some fundamental safety net programs for \nchildren, especially child welfare and foster care.\n  Unfortunately, the bipartisan approach taken in the Senate was not \nadopted by the conference committee. As Senator Moynihan, the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee said in his statement, the conferees \nwere not consulted. In fact, one of the Senate Republican conferees did \nnot even sign the conference report. Several Republican Senators have \nexpressed serious concerns about disturbing policy changes tucked into \nthe conference report that do not belong in a welfare reform bill.\n  Having served on the conference committee in 1988 for the Family \nSupport Act, which passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote of \n96 to 1, I am disappointed that this was not the model for negotiations \non this legislation. The conference committee for the Family Support \nAct included hard work and tough decisions, but it was a sincere, \nbipartisan effort and it produced modest success, and the framework for \ninnovation that led to this debate.\n  There are many issues involved in this debate and the conference \nreport. Many of the cuts are in programs beyond our current general \nwelfare program, called Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \n[AFDC]. Personally, it is the cuts and drastic changes to the other \nprograms that trouble me greatly.\n  For example, this conference report eliminates assured Medicaid \neligibility for poor children over 13 years old, and poor mothers. As \nsomeone who has fought to expand health care coverage for families, \nthis is too much of a step backwards. This report cuts child nutrition \nin general and allows for block grants of the successful school lunch \nprogram in seven States as a demonstration. What happens in those seven \nStates when a recession hits and more children qualify and need school \nlunches, but Federal funding doesn't increase? The harsher cuts in \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] for disabled children and the two-\ntier benefit structure that reduces benefits by 25 percent for the \nmajority of disabled children are disappointing, given the bipartisan \nSenate position on SSI for disabled children.\n  Throughout this year and the general debate on welfare reform, I have \nfocused much on my time and energy on the Federal programs for abused \nand neglected children--child welfare services, foster care, and \nadoption assistance for children with special needs. Children served by \nthese programs are among the most vulnerable in our society. They are \nchildren at risk of abuse and neglect, often in their own homes by \ntheir parents, and I deeply believe that we have a moral obligation to \nprotect these children.\n  But this conference report does not adequately protect such \nvulnerable children, and I do not believe that it reflects the \nbipartisan approach to child welfare programs strongly endorsed in the \nFinance Committee and on the Senate floor. In this Chamber, a strong, \nbipartisan coalition supported retaining current law for child welfare \nand foster care in recognition of the special needs of these children.\n  The conference report on child welfare and foster care falls woefully \nshort of the needs of abused and neglected children. A broad range of \nchild advocates and bipartisan groups oppose the block grants suggested \nin the conference report. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent \nthat a list of these advocates be printed in the Record.\n  Having served as chairman of the National Commission on Children, my \ngoal is to improve services to abused and neglected children as \nsuggested our unanimous, bipartisan report, not work to dismantle, \neffective programs. For example, the conference report would eliminate \nthe Independent Living program, a small but effective program offering \nan alternative to foster care of teens. The conference report would \neliminate the promising Family Preservation and Family Support Program \nwhich I helped to create in 1993, and this program has received good \ninitial reviews from the Government Accounting Office [GAO]. \nAdditionally, the conference report would block grant and cap vital \nFederal funding for foster care placement services, including \nrecruiting foster care parents and other essential services. This is \nthe wrong direction for child welfare, and it is the wrong time to \nundercut these program if we are to move ahead on bold reform of \ngeneral welfare, known as AFDC.\n  For West Virginia, the stakes in this debate are high. My State is \neager to promote work and has already been approved by the Clinton \nadministration for a waiver to create the Joint Opportunities for \nIndependence [JOIN] to encourage private employers to hire welfare \nrecipients. Having personally met with the top officials in the \nDepartment of Human Resources, I know of their interest to reform \nwelfare. West Virginia also has regions of high unemployment and \ndifficult transportation issues. My State is struggling to cope for a \nMedicaid funding crunch and can ill afford to lose hundreds of millions \nof dollars in social service programs and at the same time be slapped \nwith higher work requirements for welfare families. West Virginia wants \nto, and is already, moving families from welfare to work, but my State \nneeds continuing Federal investments in child care and support services \nto run effective programs. Even the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], \nacknowledges that this conference report is $6 billion short on the \nfunding needed to child care to move parents into work.\n  Let me reiterate. I want to enact meaningful welfare reform that \nmoves parents from welfare to work. Since the President has already \nsaid he will veto this bill, it is time to make a New Year's resolution \nfor 1996 that Congress will revive the bipartisan cooperation and \neffort needed to accomplish the kind of welfare reform that Americans \nhave every right to expect.\n  Mr. President, I now ask that the aforementioned list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  List of Organizations Who Have Written Letters in Opposition to the \nConference Report Provisions on Child Welfare Services and Foster Care:\n\n       American Bar Association.\n       National Conference of State Legislatures.\n       American Public Welfare Association.\n       Adoption Exchange Association.\n       Adoptive Families of America.\n       Alabama Council on Child Abuse (Montgomery, AL).\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children.\n       \n[[Page S19171]]\n\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       American Ethical Union, Washington Ethical Action Office.\n       American Humane Association, Children's Division.\n       American Jewish Congress.\n       American Jewish Congress Commission for Women's Equality.\n       American Jewish Committee.\n       American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       American Red Cross.\n       The Arc.\n       Arkansas Advocates for Children (Little Rock, AR).\n       Asistencia para Latinos (Glenwood Springs, CO).\n       Association of Children's Services Agencies.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Beech Brook (Cleveland, OH).\n       Behavior Sciences Institute/Home Builders (Federal Way, \n     WA).\n       Bienvenidos Children's Center, Inc.

Mr. President, today, on the Friday before Christmas, the \nSenate will vote on dramatic, sweeping changes in our welfare system.\n  Unfortunately, in a pre-holiday perversion of the legislative \nprocess, the U. S. Senate will vote on this major conference report \nwithout the opportunity for thoughtful review. As of last evening, \nMembers of the Senate did not even have printed copies of the \nlegislation.\n  So, for starters, we yearn for more information about exactly what is \ncontained in this major piece of legislation, touted as a centerpiece \nof the majority's legislative package for 1995.\n  But, as we prepare to vote under these challenging circumstances, I \nwant to state clearly my objections, based on what I do know about this \nill-advised so-called reform.\n  Some have made the curious claim that this welfare reform conference \nreport is a marked improvement from that which came before the Senate \nbefore the Thanksgiving recess.\n  However, it is clear to me that the product that has come from the \nconference committee is a step backwards, and therefore, I will oppose \nthe legislation as reported from conference.\n  Much of what I will say today, I relayed earlier in my statement on \nthe reconciliation conference report. Further, I make this statement \nknowing that the President has made clear his opposition to this \nlegislation, and has issued a statement announcing his intention to \nveto the measure in its present form.\n  I support welfare reform. I want to see Congress pass a welfare \nreform measure, and I want the President to sign welfare reform \nlegislation into law.\n  My support for sweeping change in our Nation's welfare system is a \nmatter of record. As recently as September 19, 1995, I joined 86 of my \ncolleagues in supporting the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. I voted in \nsupport of this bill, even though I had reservations, to keep the \nwelfare reform effort alive in this Congress. Unfortunately, the \nconference agreement is worse than the Senate version of the bill we \nconsidered 3 months ago.\n  My consideration of the conference report focuses on three concerns. \nFirst, will it work? Welfare reform, when it is executed well, works. \nFlorida is proud of two successful welfare pilot projects, the largest \nin America in instituting a ``time limited benefit.'' Florida, in fact, \nhas been one of the pioneers in the ``two-years-and-you-are-out'' \napproach.\n  I visited Pensacola to observe one of Florida's pilot programs. \nEarlier this year, President Clinton met with some of the participants, \nand he touted the program.\n  These pilots are succeeding because there is a front-end investment \nin the lives of those affected by the program change. Whether it is day \ncare, job training, temporary transportation assistance, or health \ncare, the welfare recipient is given a hand up instead of a hand out. \nOne of the lessons learned from these pilot projects is that \ntransitional support is needed to move people from welfare to work. My \nconcern is that the legislation before us would jeopardize these \nsuccessful experimental efforts, and would fail to provide adequate \ntransitional support to meet the goals of the legislation.\n  Second, is this conference report fair to States? The formula to \nallocate funds to the States continues welfare as we knew it. It treats \npoor children differently, depending upon which State they reside in. \nThe conference formula says that if your State spent a lot in the old \ndays, and thus built incentives to keep people on welfare, you will be \ngiven a leg up on every other State under welfare block grants in the \nfuture.\n  The formula, titled against growth States, is flawed if not rigged. \nHigh-growth States like Florida would be set up to fail.\n  Third, how would the reform proposal treat legal immigrants and what \neffect would the immigrant provisions have on States with large \nimmigrant populations? The city of Miami had more legal immigrants \nadmitted last year than 20 States combined. Thus, the prohibitions and \ntimetable on certain benefits would shift to Miami costs that once were \nshared by the Federal Government.\n  The State of Florida does not set America's foreign policy, nor its \nimmigration policy. The State of Florida did not negotiate with Cuba to \naccept 20,000 legal immigrants per year. But the State is now being \ntold the following: we are going to stick you with hundreds of millions \nof dollars in costs for legal and illegal immigration, even though you \nhave no control over these foreign policy decisions that affect \nimmigration.\n  Today, I join the President in his commitment to pass welfare \nlegislation. We should be honest with the American people and not call \nsomething reform which is in reality is an abdication of our \nresponsibility for providing a sensible framework for moving people \nfrom welfare to work.\n  It is my hope that when the President vetoes the welfare conference \nreport and the question of welfare reform is reopened, that the \nconcerns I have outlined today will be addressed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our welfare system is broken. It is \nfailing the taxpayers and those who are on welfare. It must be \nreformed. And I have been working hard to bring about bipartisan \nreforms that will work. I worked to enable innovative reforms in my \nState of Iowa. I introduced, along with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, \nthe first bipartisan welfare reform bill 2 years ago based on successes \nin our states. And I worked to support and improve the comprehensive \nreform bill that we passed in the Senate earlier this year by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 87 to 12.\n  Unfortunately, all of the hard work done by the Senate to design \nbipartisan common sense reforms has been lost in the conference \nagreement before us. Not only will this bill fail to move people from \nwelfare to work and self-sufficiency, it is filled with provisions that \nhave nothing to do with welfare reform.\n  How does raising the retirement age for individuals to receive SSI \nfrom 65 to 67 get welfare recipients off the dole and into jobs? Or is \nit a foot in the door for Newt Gingrich and his followers to raise the \nSocial Security retirement age?\n  How does cutting school lunch assistance to children reform the \nwelfare system?\n  How does gutting protections for abused and neglected children and \nmajor revisions to programs to assist in the adoption of abandoned \nchildren fix welfare?\n  Well, the answer is clear. Those provisions do not do anything to \nreform welfare. Nor do many of the other provisions of the pending \nlegislation.\n  And I said, this bill will not move people from welfare to self-\nsufficiency and it will not require responsibility from day one. \nCentral to this is the failure to include the Senate bill provision \nadded by an amendment I offered to condition the receipt of welfare \nbenefits on the signing of a strong personal responsibility contract. \nAs we require in Iowa, welfare recipients would have been required to \naccept responsibility from the first day on welfare by signing a \nbinding contract stating what they must do to get off of welfare and a \ndate by which welfare benefits will end. Responsibility would begin on \nday one, not year two. Failure to abide by the terms of the contract \nwould mean termination from the welfare rolls--immediately.\n  Each individual starting a new job is given a job description which \noutlines precisely what is expected to receive a paycheck. At the \npresent time, an individual on welfare is simply sent a check without \nrequiring anything in return.\n  We need to fundamentally change welfare as we know it. Welfare is \nnot \n\n[[Page S19173]]\n\nabout getting something for nothing. It is about responsibility and \naccountability.\n  But not this bill. There is no contract. There is no accountability. \nMy amendment corrected that situation, but my provision requiring a \npersonal responsibility contract is gone.\n  For the past several weeks we have been told by Newt Gingrich that we \nneed to listen to the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] because they \nare the experts. There analysis is accurate and should be trusted.\n  Well, the CBO tells us that this new Republican welfare bill will not \nwork. Their analysis indicates that most welfare recipients won't be \nput to work. They say that states would be forced to cough up a whole \nlot more of their money to meet the mandates in the legislation and \nthat this won't happen.\n  CBO says that the bill falls $7 billion short of what would be \nrequired to put welfare recipients to work. Further, work programs will \nalso cost more money than is provided by the legislation.\n  So in spite of a lot of nice sounding rhetoric by Newt Gingrich and \nhis supporters, if we pass this bill, welfare will not be reformed in \nmost states. Taxpayers and welfare recipients will not see the promised \nchanges in the system and local communities will be left paying the \nbills.\n  Iowans pay taxes that go to support those on welfare in New York, \nTexas, California, and other states. This bill shirks our \nresponsibility to insist that those tax dollars aren't just wasted \naway. That is not acceptable.\n  This conference report makes deep cuts in essential safety-net \nprograms for children. It provides deeper cuts in food stamps and child \nnutrition programs than were proposed by the Senate bill. It also \nunfairly cuts assistance to fully 65 percent of children with \ndisabilities. In addition, changes to the foster care and adoption \nprograms will place abused and neglected children at greater risk of \nharm. Ronald Reagan advocated the maintenance of a safety net for \nchildren. This bill shreds that safety net.\n  I have always thought that things worked best when we all worked \ntogether. For months, in fact for several years, I urged my colleagues \nto work together in a bipartisan manner to reform welfare. That's the \nway we did it in Iowa, and it is working. We had bipartisan cooperation \nfor a brief time in September. And working together outside of partisan \npolitics we put together a good, commonsense plan.\n  But that sentiment quickly deteriorated and the pending legislation \nwas negotiated behind closed doors without any significant bipartisan \ncooperation. We we are left with a phony, partisan bill.\n  The President has said he will veto this legislation and has called \nfor bipartisan cooperation on welfare reform. Again, I implore my \ncolleagues to heed his words.\n  Let us make a New Year's resolution to stop the partisan sniping and \nwork together in a bipartisan manner on this issue as well as the many \nother items on our agenda in the second session of the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the House and Senate conferees have \nreported from conference a welfare reform proposal which ends the \nwelfare program as we know it. I agree with the Republican agenda which \ntakes on the difficult issues in welfare reform, but I differ on some \nof the finer points included in this agreement. Welfare has become a \nterrible cycle which engulfs impoverished parents who raise children in \npoverty. Those children who do not have adequate access to quality \neducation, which would break the cycle of dependency, continue to be \nchained in poverty, languishing there, thus continuing this vicious \ncycle.\n  Mr. President, my generation grew up in era where there was no \ngovernment safety net, instead there was family and community. We \nrelied upon each other for help and we took any job we could find. We \nmay have gone hungry for a short period of time until the next paycheck \narrived, however, nobody starved. Today, that sense of community has \nchanged, largely because of our Federal welfare efforts. All people \nhave a smidgen of pride implanted in their being and it burns as a fire \nwithin. We are fueled by this fire to become better people. We educate \nourselves, we move forward above and beyond what we are today and \nstrive to become even better tomorrow. Unfortunately, through our \nwelfare program, we have only succeeded in taking away incentive for \npeople to work by dousing that fire-in-the-belly that drives us all.\n  We must first address the root problems of poverty before we can \ndiscuss the cure for poverty; lack of education, lack of affordable and \nadequate child care, and access to upward social and economic mobility \nand stability. A successful society allows its citizens the opportunity \nto educate themselves, to increase their opportunities and knowledge. \nIt is of no benefit to society to remove welfare recipients and place \nthem into jobs with no upward mobility. Without the prospects of \nadvancement they can only maintain the status quo at best and as \nhistory has taught us the cycle possesses a powerful habituation to \nwelfare.\n  This bill takes a step in the right direction by requiring those who \ncan work to work. This is a policy goal I have long supported and \nadvanced. I believe this will make a difference in our welfare system \nand that States should be rewarded for their efforts at matching \nindividuals with jobs. My own State of Oregon has chosen to link public \nassistance functions with welfare-to-work services, providing a \nseamless link amongst the differing human resource agencies. The \nmeasurement of their success is declining welfare rolls and increasing \nplacement of former welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment.\n  I also support limiting welfare as an entitlement program. As \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee I know all too well the \ndire consequences of continuing our spending levels on entitlement \nprograms that we do not and cannot control. We can no longer keep \nspending until all needs are met. Yet, in our effort to reform programs \nfrom entitlement spending to other forms of financing, we cannot cut \nindiscriminately. I am concerned that some aspects of this conference \nreport are inconsistent with our policy goals.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed this report and found \nthat, over the next 7 years, funding levels would fall far short of \nwhat would be needed to cover the child care costs associated with the \nwork requirements of the bill. In my view, adequate funding for child \ncare is a necessity, in order for parents to work.\n  In addition, I am concerned that the conference agreement does not \nreflect the Senate's position of requiring States to continue Medicaid \ncoverage for families who would have received AFDC if it still existed \non March of this year. The agreement before us repeals current law and \ndoes not require States to provide Medicaid coverage for those in AFDC \nfamilies who do not otherwise qualify--those children over the age of \n12 and women who are not pregnant. While I understand the conferees' \nattempt to delink Medicaid from welfare, to be dealt with later, I am \nnot confident that this basic safety net will be preserved.\n  Finally, I have received a letter from the Oregon Department of Adult \nand Family Services raising several concerns with this conference \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am told the President intends to veto \nthis bill, which will bring it back before us. I expect we will have an \nopportunity to work further on some of the finer points of this \nagreement. I am committed to do so. Our obligation to bettering the \nstandard of living for those in poverty must not waiver. The Federal \nGovernment should encourage, not impede innovation and creativity in \nthe States and private sector.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                        Oregon, Department of Human Resources,\n\n                                     Salem, OR, December 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I am writing to you out of concern \n     over the most recent language in the Welfare Reform Bill, HR \n     4. As you may know, Oregon is a leader in Welfare Reform, and \n     this State's Legislature, with my support, recently passed a \n     sweeping Welfare Reform Bill that is very much in keeping \n     with the thrust of HR 4. However, there are several technical \n     areas of the Bill in which language should be clarified to \n     allow \n     \n[[Page S19174]]\n\n     States full latitude in implementation, including:\n\n\n                         maintenance of effort\n\n       While I am supportive of a Maintenance of Effort provision, \n     any State expenditure which directly supports the achievement \n     of self-sufficiency or temporary assistance to low-income \n     families should be counted in the calculation of that \n     maintenance of effort. To do otherwise directly imposes a \n     special Welfare Reform design on States that significantly \n     impedes their flexibility.\n\n\n                 Federal Restrictions on State Spending\n\n       States must be free to spend State dollars on their self-\n     sufficiency programs as they deem appropriate. There are many \n     provisions of HR 4 which appear to restrict not only the \n     State expenditure of federal funds but the expenditure of \n     State funds as well. Surely this is not the intent of \n     Congress.\n\n\n         work participation credit for unsubsidized employment\n\n       One of the hallmarks of the Oregon program is the number of \n     placements into unsubsidized employment that not only move \n     families off of welfare but also move them out of poverty. \n     What was six months of participation credit for such families \n     in earlier versions of HR 4 appear to be deleted in the \n     Conference version. Since employment is the best way to \n     accomplish Welfare Reform, states should be given proper \n     credit for helping low-income families accomplish that goal.\n\n\n        child care necessary for participation in work programs\n\n       We work very hard with our low-income families to obtain \n     safe child care. If such care is not available, we do not \n     require their participation in our JOBS program. However, the \n     current wording of HR 4 suggests that if any particular type \n     of care is not available or convenient then no participation \n     can be required. In fact, even if the type of care that is \n     not available is not one that the participant ordinarily \n     uses, it remains grounds to refuse to participate in \n     employment and training programs. Wording should indicate the \n     participation is required if any safe (under State law) child \n     care can be arranged.\n       Again, while these are technical areas, they remain \n     important to States that will be charged with implementing \n     the most sweeping changes in welfare since the advent of the \n     Social Security Act. With your continued help, we can produce \n     Welfare Reform that works, allowing states to assist low-\n     income families to escape poverty through self-sufficiency. \n     If you or your staff members have any questions regarding our \n     concerns in these areas, please feel free to contact Jean \n     Thorne of the Governor's Office or Jim Neely, Assistant \n     Administrator of Adult and Family Services Division. Thank \n     You.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Stephen D. Minnich,\n     Administrator, Adult and Family Services Division, Assistant \n                          Director, Department of Human Resources.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we spent many months negotiating the \ncontents of the Senate welfare bill, which was approved 87-12, with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. I believe that measure, which the \nPresident indicated he would sign, was a tremendous victory for all \nparties.\n  Regrettably, the final conference agreement strays in several \nrespects from the Senate-passed welfare reform bill. As a consequence, \nPresident Clinton has indicated he will veto this legislation.\n  Today I voted to send the conference report to the President because, \nwhile far from perfect, this legislation is still better than current \nlaw, which only encourages and perpetuates dependency. For example, \nthis bill provide for time-limited benefits, so that individuals know \nthey must make every effort to become self-sufficient by a date \ncertain. It also includes much stronger child support enforcement \nmechanisms to require parents to assume financial responsibility for \nthe children they bring into this world. Importantly, it also gives the \nStates needed flexibility to develop innovative programs to help their \ncitizens break the cycle of dependency associated with the present \nwelfare system.\n  However, I am still not satisfied with this legislation, and continue \nto believe it can be improved, and intend to work toward that end \nfollowing the President's veto. The areas in which I will seek \nimprovement are as follows:\n\n\n                     afdc eligibility for medicaid\n\n  The conference agreement severs the link between AFDC eligibility and \nMedicaid. Under this provision, which was not included in either the \nHouse or Senate version of the legislation, States would no longer be \nrequired to provide Medicaid coverage to millions of AFDC eligible \nwomen and their children over the age of 13. Only those women who are \npregnant and on AFDC, and children under the age of 13, would be \nguaranteed Medicaid coverage.\n  While I am pleased that the conference report retains Medicaid \neligibility for foster care and adoption assistance children, \neliminating mandatory Medicaid coverage for other AFDC beneficiaries is \ncounterproductive. This provision is troubling and should be dropped.\n\n\n             children's supplemental security income (ssi)\n\n  This program took a big bite in the Senate bill. A more restrictive \ndefinition of disability was adopted to ensure that only those children \nwho are truly disabled qualify for cash assistance. On top of this, the \nconference agreement adds a new two-tiered system of eligibility which \nwill result in a 25-percent reduction in SSI benefits for 65 percent of \nthe children on the program. The distinctions in this two-tiered \nprogram are arbitrary and make no practical difference to a family \nwhere one parent must give up his or her job to remain at home with a \nseverely disabled child. This provision should be modified.\n\n\n                              foster care\n\n  While I am pleased that the conference agreement maintains the \nFederal entitlement for foster children and adoption assistance--a \nposition which I strongly supported--this bill would block grant and \ncut funding for the administrative and preplacement costs associated \nwith these programs. These costs, which represent nearly half the cost \nof the overall program, are far from purely administrative. They cover \nsuch critical services as licensing and recruitment of foster homes and \nfoster parents, services needed to remove children from abusive and \nunsafe homes, monitoring children in out-of-home placements, and court \nexpenses to qualify special-needs children for adoption. These \nprovisions need to be improved.\n\n\n                               child care\n\n  The final conference agreement provides reduced funding for child \ncare and drops Federal health and safety standards in the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant [CCDBG]--two significant and troubling \nchanges from the Senate-passed bill. Given the enormous importance of \nchild care to the success of welfare reform, these provisions should be \nreexamined.\n\n\n                            legal immigrants\n\n  While I was able to secure some improvements on the treatment of \nlegal immigrants in the conference report, the final bill still goes \nwell beyond the Senate-passed bill. The tough new eligibility \nrestrictions for Federal programs that this legislation would impose \nupon legal immigrants are excessive and should be further modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just a few months ago I stood with a \nbipartisan group of my colleagues in the Senate in passing, 87 to 12, a \ncompromise welfare reform bill which I believed represented a \nconstructive effort at achieving meaningful change in the current \nwelfare system. I voted for the bill because I believe the current \nsystem is broken and needs to be fixed. It needs to be fixed in a way \nthat does at least two things: requires able-bodied persons to work and \nprotects children in the process.\n  Mr. President, the Senate compromise bill met this challenge. It \nwould fundamentally change the current system by replacing a system of \nunconditional, unlimited aid with a system providing conditional \nbenefits for a limited time. It would do so without abandoning the \nnational goal of preserving the important safety net for poor children. \nIt moves able-bodied people into work, tightens child support \nenforcement laws, and provides adequate child care resources for \nchildren of parents making the transition into work and to low-wage \nworking families that seek to remain off of welfare.\n  I was particularly pleased that the compromise bill contained an \nimportant work provision I've been promoting, cosponsored by the \nmajority leader, requiring that unless an able-bodied person is in a \nprivate sector job, school or job training, the State must offer, and \nthe recipient must accept, community service employment within 3 months \nof receipt of benefits, not the 2 years contained in the original \nlegislation proposed by majority leader.\n  Mr. President, I had great hopes that the bipartisan achievements in \nthe Senate compromise proposal could be sustained through the \nconference with the House. Regrettably, this conference report is weak \non work and it does not \n\n[[Page S19175]]\n\nadequately protect children. I cannot support it.\n  The American taxpayers want people who are on welfare and are able-\nbodied to work. So it is quite perplexing to me that despite House \nRepublicans continuing claims of being ``tough on work,'' the \nconference dropped the Levin-Dole work requirement from the bill. If we \nare serious about work, Mr. President, we must have the kind of \nprovision that requires it: not 2 years down the road, not 1 year down \nthe road, but 3 months from receipt of benefits for those persons who \nare not in school or job training or in an exempt category.\n  And, Mr. President, the punitive proposal before us cuts $14 billion \nmore our of programs for poor children and their families than the \nbipartisan compromise Senate bill, causing millions of children to lose \ntheir eligibility for important safety-net programs.\n  The changes in eligibility rules would reduce benefits for most \ndisabled children by 25 percent, sets lower levels of funding for \nchild-care programs than the Senate proposal, and eliminates important \nhealth and safety standards. Many of the more than 300,000 children \ncovered by Medicaid, because they receive foster care or adoption \nassistance, also would be placed in jeopardy.\n  It also significantly reduces the benefits to children and families \nwho receive support from the food stamp and child nutrition programs, \nwhich could have serious consequences for the health and well-being of \nmillions of children, working families, and elderly.\n  The optional block grants undermine the basic framework of the lunch \nand breakfast programs by eliminating low-income children's guarantee \nof access to free meals, weakening nutrition standards, and removing \nthe programs' ability to respond to changing economic circumstances.\n  For some reason, totally unrelated to welfare reform, House \nRepublicans are jeopardizing programs that for decades have fed \nmillions of children in schools and child care centers in America. Do \nwe want to erode the safety net for the 5 million poor children who are \nserved nutritious breakfasts at school? What about the 24 million \nchildren who receive nutritious school lunches? Nearly half of theses \nlunches are provided to poor children free of charge, and nearly 2 \nmillion lunches to low-income children at reduced prices.\n  Mr. President, the answer is ``No.''\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I strongly believe that we must reform our \nwelfare system. I have devoted a great deal of time and energy to \nexamining the broken welfare system and developing meaningful solutions \nto address the deficiencies. I presented a welfare reform proposal, the \nWork and Gainful Employment Act, and worked with my Senate colleagues \nto improve and strengthen the Senate version of H.R. 4.\n  Central to each of the welfare reform proposals I've supported were \nthe basic principles of work, responsibility, and family. The proposals \nwere built in a framework of increased State flexibility while not \nplacing the health and safety of our Nation's children at risk. They \nhad tough work requirements, and promoted personal responsibility while \nprotecting children and the disabled.\n  Because of my sincere interest in reforming the welfare system, I \nlook upon the welfare reform conference agreement with great \ndisappointment. The conference agreement on H.R. 4 falls far short of \nupholding these core principles and meeting these goals. It is weak on \nwork and places abused and neglected children in danger. Additionally, \nthe conference agreement on H.R. 4 cuts too deeply into the programs \nthat provide the lifeline for the most vulnerable in our society. \nYesterday, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to develop a plan \nto reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. The conference agreement, \nhowever, proposes far greater cuts than the bipartisan group of \nSenators deemed reasonable. It is for these reasons that I oppose this \nseverely flawed approach to reforming the welfare system.\n  I firmly believe that among the most critical issues facing our \nNation is the future of our children. It is of crucial importance that \nfamilies and communities equip children with the skills necessary to \nface the increasing challenges of the 21st century. Children must be \ntaught the value of work.\n  The conference agreement on welfare reform is weak on work. The \nsupporters of this legislation claim it will move welfare recipients \ninto work without providing resources sufficient to make it happen. In \nfact, instead of strengthening the work and child care provisions of \nthe Senate-passed welfare bill, the conference agreement reduces \nfunding in these areas.\n  Additionally, both my WAGE Act and the Senate-passed welfare reform \nproposal included a personal responsibility contract that welfare \nrecipients had to sign as a condition of receiving welfare benefits. \nThe personal responsibility contract was a binding agreement that the \nrecipient would make meaningful steps to move off of welfare and take \nresponsibility for his or her actions and well-being. I ask you, why \nwould the conferees remove the contract between the welfare recipient \nand the Government to move the recipient off of welfare? The conference \nagreement is weak on work and does nothing to develop personal \nresponsibility.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing and mean-spirited provisions of this \nproposal are the ones that place the most vulnerable and helpless \nchildren in our society at risk. On top of providing inadequate \nresources for child care services, this legislation eliminates Federal \nhealth and safety standards for child care facilities. It slashes \nfunding by $1.3 billion for child protection services for abused, \nneglected, and abandoned children and children in foster and adoptive \nservices. Additionally, it proposes draconian reductions in the SSI \nprogram for low-income children with disabilities. HHS has estimated \nthat by the year 2002, 750,000 low-income disabled children who are \neligible for SSI benefits will have their benefits cut by 25 percent. \nFinally, the conference agreement eliminates the requirement for States \nto provide Medicaid benefits to children whose families are eligible \nfor cash assistance. This extreme provision was not in either the \nSenate- or House-passed bills and threatens the health and future \nproductivity of our poorest children. These program changes are cruel \nand rip the safety net from under the most vulnerable children in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, I want to reemphasize my commitment to balanced and \nreasonable welfare reform. The welfare system should be tough on work \nand personal responsibility, should promote families and family values, \nand should maintain basic health and safety protections for our \nNation's children. I say to my colleagues in the House and the Senate: \nLet us reform the welfare system; however, let us target the programs \nand not the children.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my colleague on the \nFinance Committee, and good friend, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. In 1 \nminute I will try to say eloquent things about why this bill should not \nbe adopted.\n  Mr. President, put me down as being conservative when it comes to \nwelfare reform. The current system, in my opinion, has not worked very \nwell for the people who are on it, nor has it worked well for the \npeople who are paying for it. It has to be changed.\n  But the goal of welfare reform has to be to put able-bodied people to \nwork and at the same time protect innocent children. This bill does not \ndo that. It fails in a couple of fundamental manners.\n  No. 1, the bill cuts benefits for disabled children on SSI by 25 \npercent. That is not reform. It is a step backwards.\n  Second, the bill, in changing the rules for abused and neglected \nchildren, is contrary to every bipartisan recommendation that this \nCongress received from the Governors and from the State legislative \nbodies. This is a step in the wrong direction.\n  Finally, this is the wrong bill at the wrong time. It should be in \nthe context of the budget negotiations. There is more money going to be \navailable in that context. We know what we are doing with the EITC, the \ntax cuts, and other changes that are being made to fundamental policy. \nThis welfare bill today should be turned down and come back, and we \nshould do it in the context of the budget negotiations. \n\n[[Page S19176]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply respectfully suggest that \nthe budget negotiations are much too narrowly based with five or six \npersons in one room for the kind of bipartisan effort on welfare which \nPresident Clinton called for when he said he would veto this bill. We \nachieved consensus through such effort when we passed the Family \nSupport Act of 1988 by a vote of 96 to 1.\n  I am happy to yield 1 minute to my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thank you.\n  First, let me commend the Senator from New York for his tremendous \nleadership on behalf of the children in the welfare reform bill.\n\n\n                     welfare: reform; don't renege\n\n  Mr. President, it is with sadness today I must tell the American \npeople their Congress has failed them in its attempts to reform public \nassistance in this country. Welfare reform is important, but the bill \nbefore us today was written with so little compassion it must be \nstopped.\n  The American people know we must change welfare. They know welfare \nmust give a hand-up, not a hand-out. But no one I have talked to, not \nthe most conservative welfare-basher, would stand where I am standing \nand vote to hurt children like this bill will.\n  You have heard the estimates: this bill will throw an additional 1.5 \nmillion children into poverty in this country. It will eliminate the \nguarantee to basic services to children at a time when we should be \nimproving the safety net. Children need the guarantee to assistance. \nChildren need the safety net.\n  I supported a welfare bill out of this Senate, a bill I had \nfundamental disagreement with, because we were able to make some \nimprovements before it left the floor. I fought hard for child care \nfunding, for money for job training, for domestic violence language. \nWhen these improvements had been made, I held my nose and voted for the \nbill, knowing some people would think I had done something horrible, \nbecause I naively thought the majority might be listening.\n  I thought after all our fighting, the majority party might get a hint \nabout what kinds of things we thought were important in a bill to \nactually reform welfare. I said at the time--if this bill got worse in \nnegotiations with the House, if the majority did not improve this bill \ndramatically, then it would not have my support. And it will not. This \nbill is a slap in the face of every person in this country trying to \nget off public assistance, and I will vote ``no.''\n  The conference report is so lacking, if I pick out just one thing to \nfocus on, there won't be time to tell you about any others. But let us \nlook at what the conference report proposes to do about child care:\n  First, remember that child care faces major problems today, before \nthis welfare bill sends many new people into the work force. Child care \nis not always easy to find, you cannot always depend on the quality, \nyou cannot always afford quality when you find it, and sometimes you \ncannot afford to pay at all, so a relative or friend takes care of your \nkids. But that's all today. Here's what the conference report will do \ntomorrow:\n  Over the next 7 years, the work requirements in this conference \nreport will create the need for an additional $14.9 billion worth of \nchild care. But, the report only funds $1.9 billion of new money, \nleaving a $13 billion shortfall, according to HHS. The result is many \npeople will have no place to leave their child when they go to work.\n  If you are lucky enough to get your child into child care, the \nconference report cuts funding for child care quality standards more \nthan 50 percent from the Senate bill. This money pays for improvements \nin quality and access to child care: training providers, inspecting and \nmonitoring facilities, helping parents to find child care, providing \ngrants to buy cribs and other equipment to start child care businesses, \nand beginning school-age programs.\n  The result is, you as a parent will have to worry about whether your \nchild care worker is well-trained, and whether your child is healthy \nand safe when you return from work.\n  This conference report also allows welfare recipients to count \nproviding unpaid child care toward meeting the work requirements, \nessentially, to babysit other people's children without meeting any of \nthe standards of a child care facility or home day care business. There \nis no money for training or certification for people setting up home \nchild care under this provision.\n  What is worse, the conference report repeals a state's ability to \nregulate health and safety in child care, including these small in-home \nchild care situations, which is where most of the abuse problems in my \nstate occur.\n  If you are unlucky enough to be a child in a child care situation \nwhere there is a problem, this conference report cuts the abuse \nenforcement that might protect you. It block grants child protection \nand foster care, and cuts the very functions that allow States to help \nchildren who need foster care, to recruit and train parents, to place \nchildren, and to monitor quality. The $3.7 billion reduction over seven \nyears will cut Child Protective Services, family preservation money for \npreventing problems, and money for older youth.\n  Finally, the conference report significantly cuts the child and adult \ncare food program, by as much as $3 billion over seven years. Providers \nin my state tell me these cuts will effectively close the doors of many \nsmall day care businesses, and lead to cost cutting that will affect \nchild nutrition. We will have more people competing for less child \ncare, and nutrition declining in the centers which stay in business.\n  Who here on the floor of the Senate can honestly say they speak for \nchildren? We have lobbyists for every issue, but infants and children \ndo not get to vote. If you cut child protection, what constituency will \nrise up in protest? Not the children themselves; I will guarantee it.\n  This conference report has many problems. One of them is the assault \non child care. I will be voting against this report.\n  Mr. President, I speak against the welfare conference report, and I \ndo so as someone who voted for the Senate welfare reform bill, but I \ndid so because I thought the majority would understand that our yes \nvote meant that we strongly supported child care funding language for \ndomestic violence and job training funds. Those are not in the final \nbill. It is $13 billion short in child care money. That is not just \nmoney; that is children who will be out there on the streets with no \none to take care of them.\n  Mr. President, this Congress will not be remembered for passing \nwelfare reform. They will be remembered for endangering the lives of \nthousands of American children.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this conference report.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I do not know where to begin. Last night I spoke at \nlength about the difference between the Senate bill that passed and the \nbill that is now before us. I think I laid out the points, but I will \ntry to be consistent and lay them out today.\n  The bill that is before us actually moves more toward the Democratic \nside than the bill that we passed here. I am somewhat at a loss as to \nwhy we see all these objections raised here when if you go down the \nchanges that were made in the conference, we actually move toward the \nDemocratic side of the aisle than the bill that passed the Senate. I \nwill go through them.\n  If you look at child care, so much is being talked about in child \ncare. The child care funding in this bill is more than the child care \nfunding that passed under the original Senate bill. In fact, over the \nfirst 5 years in the Senate bill that passed child care funding was \n$15.8 billion. Under this bill, it is $16.3 billion. Over 7 years we \nspend $1 billion more in child care under the conference report than we \ndid in the Senate bill.\n  I do not understand the concerns that somehow we are now \nshortchanging child care when before we had adequate child care \ndollars. We have more money in child care.\n  Second, maintenance of effort. We heard so much concern and \nconsternation about the maintenance-of-effort provision. There was a 75 \npercent maintenance-of-effort provision in here, which is exactly what \nboth sides agreed \n\n[[Page S19177]]\n\nwas an adequate level for State support in the Senate bill. Again, I do \nnot understand the concerns. We kept the Senate proposal.\n\n  Third, funding. We talked about this welfare program being slashed. I \nrefer you to this chart. Here is welfare funding today. Under current \nlaw, it will go up by 58 percent. Under our bill, it goes up 34 \npercent. That is 4 percent a year. That is almost twice the rate of \ninflation.\n  Welfare spending will go up under this bill. If anyone is concerned, \nyes, welfare spending will go up, but we have more people in the \nsystem. No. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has said that \nunder our bill, the number of people in the system will be maintained \nat a constant level. There will not be an increase. Therefore, spending \nper person in welfare will go up over the next 7 years. We will have \nmore child care. We will have a maintenance of effort. Spending will go \nup under this bill. You would think that I am describing the Democratic \nproposal. But, no, we are describing the conference report.\n  The work requirements that so many people on both sides of the aisle \nwanted are the same in the Senate bill. We kept the entitlement to \nschool lunches. We kept the entitlement to family-based nutrition \nprograms, something desperately wanted by the other side of the aisle \nthat was not in the House bill. The House conceded to us on that.\n  We kept title requirements. In fact, we put in title requirements for \nfood stamp block grant eligibility. In the Senate bill we passed a \nblock grant option for food stamps given to all States. Under the \nconference report, we make it much tougher to get a block grant of food \nstamps, and we put very tough error rate standards in there, so many \nStates will not, in fact, be able to qualify, something many Members on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle wanted to see.\n  We kept the population growth fund intact, which many Members on the \nother side wanted.\n  Contingency funds for employment--the same as in the Senate bill.\n  We kept ``no transferring out'' of the child care block grant, \nsomething that was very important to Members on the other side of the \naisle. Every dollar in child care must be spent in child care. And, in \nfact, there can be a transfer of money but only into child care, not \nout of child care.\n  I heard a concern about SSI and about throwing children off SSI. I \nwould remind Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle that the same \nprovisions that are in this bill were in the Democratic substitute on \nthis floor and voted for by every Member on the other side of the \naisle. Those same children not being cut off was something that every \nMember on the other side of the aisle voted for in their substitute and \nthe 87 Members of this body voted for in the Senate bill--the same \nprovision. The only difference in the children portion of the SSI bill \nis that for children who do not need round-the-clock care to be able to \nstay at home, we reduce the amount of benefit by 25 percent.\n\n  I would remind Members that the adult benefit for SSI, which is \nsupposed to be an income supplement to maintain someone who is an adult \nso they can live independently, is the same amount that a child gets \nwhen living at home. So what we said is that, if you are a child living \nat home which does not need 24-hour care but is still considered \ndisabled, we are going to reduce your benefit somewhat versus a child \nthat needs 24-hour child care. We think that is a reasonable thing to \ndo, and certainly it is not going to be hurting children.\n  A lot has been made about the child protection portion of this bill. \nWe do some tremendous things. First of all, we spend more money on \nchild protection in this bill than in the Senate bill. The Senate bill \nthat passed that got 87 votes cut $1.3 billion out of this program. The \nconference report cuts $0.4 billion.\n  We spend more money on child protection services. We allow in this \nagreement so much that has been talked about.\n  I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  As I said before, we spend more money on child protection services, \nNo. 1. No. 2, we allow so much. So much has been made about the Elisa \ncase in New York, a tragic case. But one of the reasons that case \nhappened is because police agencies and social agencies cannot share \ninformation about abuse. In this bill you can. And it was not even in \nthe Senate bill, an improvement over the Senate provisions.\n\n  We gave a concession from the conference report that appeared in the \nreconciliation bill to current law standards for child protection and \ncitizen review panels, again another concession to the other side.\n  We gave again greater flexibility to use administrative funds on \nservices, something that cannot be done today. Fifty percent of all the \nmoney spent in child protection is spent on administrative and overhead \ncosts--50 percent. No wonder a lot of people do not want to change it \nbecause a lot of people make a lot of money off child protection \nservices in this country. Fifty percent is spent on staffing. What we \ndo is we give a block grant and allow that money to be used for \nservices, allow that money to be used to help direct payments to people \nwho need assistance, again a dramatic departure, something I know many \npeople on the other side of the aisle want to see done.\n  We think this bill not only is a better bill than passed the House--\nmuch better--a better bill than passed the Senate but moves more in the \ndirection of Members on the other side of the aisle. I am absolutely \nastounded to hear Members get up and talk about how this bill is worse \nthan what passed the Senate. It is not. It moves much more toward the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, and I urge their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \njunior Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act \nof 1995 represents a turning point in how this country will respond to \nthe needs of poor children and their families. For far too long, \nwelfare has failed--failed the families dependent upon Government \nassistance to give them a new start in life and failed the American \ntaxpayers who have been asked to help those in need. Welfare reform \ndoes not need to be mean spirited, and the welfare reform provisions of \nthis bill are not. Change is always difficult and this legislation will \nproduce tremendous changes in how government helps those in need.\n  This legislation shifts primary responsibility for welfare to the \nStates, a move I wholeheartedly endorse. The need for welfare \nassistance and the solutions to moving people off welfare and into work \nare closely tied to the economic conditions, opportunities, and \nresources in a community. That has been one of the biggest problems \nwith the one-size-fits-all approach to welfare necessitated by a \nheavily mandated Federal program. I believe that States are in the best \nposition to make decisions about how best to help families in poverty \ngain economic self sufficiency. We do not know what works--what types \nof programs are the most effective in moving people off of welfare. I \nbelieve over the next few years we will see many diverse solutions to \nthe problems of welfare and poverty. Some of these solutions will work, \nsome will not--but much will be gained through the experience. Since \nthe current welfare system has failed so miserably, it is worth the \nrisks involved.\n  The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act is a \ncomprehensive bill which changes not only welfare cash assistance, but \nmany other Federal programs as well. As is the case with any major \nbill, no member is completely satisfied with every single provision. \nUltimately, a decision is based on one's judgment that the positives \noutweigh the negatives. Clearly, in my mind, the fundamental reform \noffered by this legislation makes it worthy of support.\n  It is my understanding that President Clinton has made a different \ncalculation regarding the merits and demerits of this legislation and \nhas indicated he will veto it. In that event, we will be back at the \ndrawing board. Given a second opportunity to put together a bill, I \nwould hope that several concerns could be addressed. \n\n[[Page S19178]]\n\n  My first concern lies in the area of child protection. The \nlegislation significantly reduces the funds available for recruiting \nand licensing foster homes, monitoring children in foster care and \nother alternative placements, completing the court processes needed to \nfree children for adoption, training and recruiting child protection \ncaseworkers, and other activities necessary to maintain an adequate \nprogram for abused and neglected children. The cap on child protection \nfunds will put further strain on our already overburdened child \nprotection system and could seriously inhibit states' ability to \nrespond when a child is abused or neglected.\n  I am also concerned about whether the funds available for child care \nassistance are adequate to meet the needs of families as they move off \nwelfare and into work. The availability of safe, affordable child care \nis essential to successful welfare reform. At the same time, we need to \nensure that low income working families have access to child care \nassistance.\n  My third concern is about the extent of the changes in the \nSupplemental Security Income [SSI] program. The legislation will \neliminate SSI eligibility for an estimated 21 percent of the children \ncurrently receiving benefits and reduce benefits for about 75 percent \nof the remaining children. While the creation of a two-tiered benefit \nsystem distinguishes between the most disabled children who require a \nhigher level of services and those who are moderately and mildly \ndisabled, the legislation places an overwhelming emphasis on physical \ndisabilities. I believe the criteria used to differentiate between \nthose receiving full benefits and those receiving reduced benefits \nshould be reexamined.\n  I am relieved that the effective date for the cash assistance \nprovisions in the bill has been changed to the 1996 fiscal year. This \nshould give States adequate time to make the legislative and \nadministrative changes needed to adjust to the block grant. Successful \nwelfare reform will require careful consideration and planning, and \nStates must be provided the opportunity for a thoughtful, deliberative \nprocess regarding how they want to proceed.\n  I believe that these concerns can be effectively addressed. The \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act is a bold move to \nchange the way in which government responds to people in need of \nassistance--a move that needs to be taken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19154-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LONGEST TERM RECORD\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield to my gallant friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a profound and important debate about welfare \nreform that tests our resolve to change a system that is in need of \nchange, but it is a debate which also tests our commitment to community \nto the sick and the hurting--to the elderly and the thousands of people \nwho are looking for a helping hand from a government that will help \nthem help themselves\n  Every Senator here today knows the importance of helping families get \nback to work--get on the job and off the dole; but they also know the \ndevastation of poverty--the lack of hope and the despair and \nfrustrations that all of use see in our States.\n  Unfortunately the bill which we passed to reform welfare has turned \nfor the worse in conference and threatens to injure children and people \nwith disabilities.\n  Mr. President, this conference bill will increase poverty--not \ndecrease it. It will increase despair and destroy hope among some of \nthe poorest, sickest, and weakest Americans.\n  I cannot in good conscience--and I will not--vote for such an ill \nadvised retreat from real reform--no matter how well intended it may \nbe--no matter how deeply some or the other side of the aisle might feel \nabout it.\n  This bill eats away at the strength of America because the strength \nof America is not found in its willingness to separate the rich from \nthe poor.\n  No, the strength of America, as Hubert Humphrey said:\n\n       Lies with its people. Not people on the dole but on the \n     job. Not people in despair but people filled with hope. Not \n     people without education but people with skill and knowledge. \n     Not people turned away but people welcomed by their neighbors \n     as full and equal partners in our American adventure.\n\n  This is our strength, but this bill we are asked to vote on today \ndoes not play to that strength.\n  Mr. President, we all want to move people from welfare to work. But \nthe conference report reduces the ability to put people back to work.\n  This conference bill is wrong because it's too harsh and it will \ninjure children and families in significant ways.\n  It reduces SSI benefits for a large majority of disabled children by \n25 percent. These are kids, Mr. President, with cerebral palsy, kids \nwith Down's syndrome, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis and AIDS.\n  I'm told that by the year 2002, some 650,000 low income children \nwould be affected by this cut. In real numbers that means that the \nbenefits to seriously disabled children would be cut from 74 percent of \nthe poverty line to 55 percent of the poverty line; and with all due \nrespect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that cut was \nnot in the Senate bill.\n  The current law ensures that AFDC families receive Medicare coverage. \nUnder this bill that provision of the law would be repealed, leaving \n1.5 million children at risk--and at least 4 million mothers would lose \nhealth coverage.\n  This conference bill undermines the school lunch program. It denies \nschool lunches to certain categories of immigrant school children, \nincluding legal immigrants, and it would create an entire bureaucracy \nto determine the status of the children.\n  It would deny SSI and food stamps to immigrants who are legal \npermanent residents of the United States.\n  The bill includes $32 billion in food stamp benefit cuts to the \nelderly and working poor--which means about a 20-percent cut to those \nfamilies who are already working, who are struggling to make ends meet \non a minimum wage job or with a Social Security check struggling to pay \nfor basics to keep them from losing their apartments and ending up \nhomeless and on the street.\n  When fully in effect the food stamp cuts will lower the average \nbenefit level from 78 cents per person per meal to 62 cents--62 cents a \nmeal.\n  Mr. President, what are we doing? Is this the kind of nation we have \nbecome?\n  The whole point of welfare reform was to identify the people who are \non welfare but who are capable of working, and getting them off welfare \nand into jobs.\n  This conference bill does not accomplish that goal in the way we did \nin the Senate passed bill.\n  This bill hurts children, the sick and the elderly.\n  It hurts dependent children, more than half of whom live below the \npoverty line. It hurts disabled children, sick children, hungry \nchildren, children without a chance and often without a prayer for \nsurvival.\n  It hurts disabled elderly people, who deserve more in their old age, \nwho seek only a little dignity and a little respect.\n  This bill raises the age at which impoverished elderly people could \nqualify for SSI, from 65 to 67 or even higher--and who does this \naffect? It is aimed \n\n[[Page S19179]]\nprimarily at poor elderly women--widows with limited work experience \noutside the home. These poor women, already on the edge, would have the \nprincipal component of their small safety net ripped away. They could \nlose their Medicaid. And many of them will be forced into severe \npoverty and bouts of homelessness.\n  Does this sound like welfare reform? Is this what the American people \nhad in mind when they think of welfare reform?\n  In other words, Mr. President, this bill goes for the easy targets. \nIt hurts the people who can't fight back. In the end it hurts America.\n  There is not enough in this bill about helping people find work, but \nthere are plenty of sweeping cuts to impress constituents with hollow, \nvicious attacks on people that anyone can attack.\n  This bill raises the suffering level and lowers the promise of hope \nand of jobs.\n  The bill simply does not provide adequate resources for work \nprograms.\n  According to CBO estimates, funding will fall $5.5 billion short of \nwhat is needed to fund the work program in 2002 alone, and that's \nassuming that the States maintain their safety net for poor children.\n  Over a 7-year period, funding for the work program will fall about \n$14 billion short of what is needed.\n  Is this a job program?\n  The original Contract With America recognized this problem and \nprovided $10 billion for work programs--but that money is not in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I am voting against this legislation because it steps \nback from important safeguards that were contained in the Senate bill--\nsafeguards for children, for elderly, for work--that are the true heart \nof welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, I voted for the bill that left the Senate. I will not \nvote for this conference report today. And I will not vote for it \nbecause there are some dramatic differences between this conference \nreport and what we voted for. Most importantly, this conference report \ntakes away a fundamental guarantee in this country that children will \nhave health care.\n  It takes away a fundamental guarantee about standards in this country \nwith respect to health and safety for child care.\n  In addition to that, it reduces the most important lifeline that we \nguaranteed in the Senate bill, that those who are required to go to \nwork who have children will be able to find the proper care for their \nchildren. And that has been reduced in this bill. In addition to that, \nit takes away the personal responsibility contract and it reduces the \nchild nutrition program.\n  This bill will hurt children, and for that reason, Mr. President, as \na conference bill I cannot vote for it. I hope we will return to the \nSenate with a more appropriate conference at some point in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Massachusetts. It is truly hard \nto conceive that we might be for such business 3 days before Christmas.\n  Mr. President, if the majority leader does not wish to speak at this \nmoment, the Senator from Connecticut will do. I yield 1 minute to my \nable friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he has 45 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut may have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. President, let me just address the Senate on the children's \nissues and the child care issues and try to put this in perspective. As \nmost of my colleagues know, I have spent a lot of time, along with many \nothers, on the issue of child care, and I just want to put it straight. \nWhen we passed out the Senate version of this bill on child care, we \nhad provided $8 billion for child care over 5 years. This conference \nreport has $7 billion for child care over 5 years. It is a $1 billion \nreduction over that 5-year period. And so it is a cut in the child care \nfunds.\n  But almost as egregious as the cut in the child care funds is the \nelimination of the health and safety standards, something that we \nfought very hard on over these years. Now, to eliminate health and \nsafety standards where young children are being cared for, whatever \nother views you have, you do not do it. You do not take away the basic \nhealth and safety standards for child care in this country. So the \nmoney is one thing. That is a cut of $1 billion. But to put these \nchildren all day long in a situation where they are not safe and they \nare not healthy, getting the proper kind of care is just wrong-headed \nand for that reason alone this bill ought to be rejected.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, \nwhich does not exist, with a plea that this legislation not be \napproved.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think this is a good bill and pretty much \nlike the bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 87 to 12 with 1 \nabsentee.\n  We have heard many times that the President is going to end welfare \nas we know it. This is an opportunity the President has. Everybody \nought to ask the question--and I know it has been addressed on the \nother side--does this conference report have the core principles and \nneeded reforms that were in the Senate-passed welfare bill? The answer \nin my view is yes. We supported that bill in September, the Work \nOpportunity Act, as I said, by a vote of 87 to 12. We stood behind it \nin a bipartisan way.\n  During this time before our vote, I also ask that we once again \nremember two overriding facts. First, our current welfare system has \nfailed; and, second, it is our duty to fix it.\n\n\n           Common Sense, Core Principles For Dramatic Reform\n\n  The Senate bill and the conference report both take a commonsense \napproach. Both bills establish core principles: strong work \nrequirements; strengthening families and requiring personal \nresponsibility; providing protection for children; giving States the \nflexibility they need to design programs that best meet the needs of \nthe people, and that can best reduce our alarming illegitimacy rate; \nand assuring States receive necessary Federal support.\n  Let me take a moment to review the similarities in the commonsense \npolicies in the Senate bill and the conference report.\n  They both require able-bodied welfare recipients to work for their \nassistance as soon as the State determines they are ``work ready'' or \nwithin 2 years, whichever is earlier.\n  They both put a 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits, so that \nwelfare does not become a way of life.\n  They both require single teenage parents who have children out of \nwedlock to stay in school and live under adult supervision in order to \nreceive benefits.\n  They both provide $75 million to States for abstinence education \nprograms.\n  They both grant our States the ability to try and reduce America's \nalarming illegitimacy rate.\n  They both give States the option of exempting families with a child \nunder age 1 from the work-participation rates.\n  They both prevent States from sanctioning a single custodial parent \nfor failure to work if the parent shows a demonstrated need for child \ncare.\n  They both include important provisions on locating and tracking \nabsent parents, establishing paternity and enforcing support orders.\n  They both give our States the flexibility to devise programs that \nmeet the specific needs of their citizens.\n  They both provide a $1.7 billion supplemental loan fund. States may \nborrow from it up to 10 percent of their welfare block grant amount.\n  They both provide a $1 billion contingency grant fund for States over \n7 years.\n  They both put a cap on spending, because no program with an unlimited \nbudget will ever be made to work effectively and efficiently.\n\n\n               Child Care and State Maintenance of Effort\n\n  During the Senate debate and establishment of these policies, two \nmajor issues emerged as central to the bipartisan support that emerged: \nfirst, access to child care and second, requiring \n\n[[Page S19180]]\nStates to maintain some level of their spending effort.\n  The child care provisions in the conference report provide $1.8 \nbillion more than current law and $1 billion more than the Senate-\npassed bill. Specifically, a child care block grant is established that \nincludes $11 billion in mandatory spending for welfare recipients and \n$7 billion in discretionary spending for low income families. Spending \non child care increases from $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 to over \n$2 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n  In the conference report, States are required to maintain their \nspending effort for the life of the new cash block grant at 75 percent \nof what they spent in fiscal year 1994 for the programs that are in \nthis block grant. This seems to represent the objective of the majority \nof Members in the Senate.\n\n\n                    Conference Report Modifications\n\n  Now let me touch on some of the areas that have been modified since \nthe Senate first passed welfare reform. No doubt about it, there has \nbeen much speculation over the savings that will come out of this \nreform. I can tell you this: The savings realized from the conference \nreport are about the same as those realized from the Senate bill.\n  The conference report does require States to deny more cash to \nmothers who have more children while receiving welfare. However States \nhave the flexibility to opt-out. As Senator Santorum said last night, \nthis provision asks State legislatures to make a decision.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, the conference report does establish \na child protection block grant that combines mandatory funding for \nexisting child welfare programs while maintaining current law \nprotections. However foster care and adoption maintenance payments \nremain open entitlement and the enactment of the block grant is delayed \nto fiscal year 1997. Funding for these programs are $1 billion more \nthan the Senate passed Balanced Budget Act.\n\n\n                             New Provisions\n\n  Let me list a few additions to the Senate-passed bill now in the \nconference report before us.\n  The effective date of the new cash welfare block grant is delayed to \nfiscal year 1997 yet allows States to opt-in during fiscal year 1996.\n  We have also included a 10-percent reduction in the social services \nblock grant which was proposed by President Clinton. This will provide \n$1.6 billion in savings over 7 years.\n  The eligibility for States to receive food stamp block grants is \ntightened up. States which have implemented electronic benefit transfer \nstatewide will be eligible. States with an error rate of less than 6 \npercent are also eligible.\n  The controversy surrounding block grants for child nutrition programs \nis settled by allowing a pilot project for seven States to participate \nin an optional block grant program. Authority expires in 2000. Block \ngrants could then be revisited.\n\n\n                GOP Governors Back Conference Agreement\n\n  Thirty Republican Governors sent a letter to President Clinton on \nDecember 20 urging him to support this conference agreement. They \nwrite:\n\n       While each State will have its own reform strategy, this \n     legislation helps to accomplish those goals by setting forth \n     these guidelines:\n       Families must work for benefits and States that get \n     families working are rewarded.\n       No family can stay on welfare after 2 years without \n     working.\n       The total time a family can collect cash benefits is \n     limited to 5 years unless States, because of their own unique \n     circumstances, opt out of this limit.\n       And States will have the option to pay cash benefits to \n     teen parents, but they must live at home and stay in school \n     to receive those benefits.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report to H.R. 4. The \ncore principles and policies necessary for dramatic reform contained in \nit are consistent with the Senate-passed bill and consistent with the \nneeds of Americans.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems to me we have been able to retain nearly \nevery provision that was in the Senate-passed bill. I know for some of \nmy colleagues, because the President says he is going to veto it, maybe \nfor that reason they feel compelled to support the President. But my \nview is we have a good bill. We ought to vote for it. We ought to send \nit to the President, and then try to persuade the President that this \nis a bill he should sign.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19178-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT--VETO\n\n  The Senate continued with the reconsideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He began his service as leader of the \nRepublican Party in the Senate on January 3, 1985, and the record, up \nuntil today, for having held the position of leadership on the \nRepublican side of the aisle was held by the late Charles McNary of \nOregon, who was leader 10 years, 11 months, 18 days. Now, Bob Dole has \nnot been leader as long as Robinson Crusoe was marooned on that island. \nCrusoe was marooned 28 years, 2 months, and 19 days. But Bob Dole has \nbeen the leader of the Republican Party, as of today, 10 years, 11 \nmonths, and 19 days!\n  Mr. President, I served with Bob Dole when he was minority leader and \nI was majority leader. I served with him when he was majority leader \nand I was minority leader. I always found him to be a man of his word. \nWe had some exchanges from time to time, as leaders will have, but I \nfound him to be an honorable man. I shall always look back upon my \nservice with him, when we were leaders together, with a great deal of \npleasure.\n  I have a fondness for Bob Dole, and I am glad today to salute him as \na great leader of his party. I commend him on his service not only to \nhis party but also to his country, and for his service to the Senate.\n\n  May God's richest blessings follow him and his loved ones always.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to say that the Senate is well \nserved with Bob Dole as majority leader. He has broken the record now \nfor the all-time service. He is a man of integrity, ability, and \ndedication, and we are fortunate to have had him serve here.\n  Back in his home State, he was a member of the legislature and a \nprosecuting attorney. He went into World War II, was seriously injured, \nalmost killed, and one arm is still deficient.\n  I say to you, I hope he will serve continuously until he becomes the \nnext President of the United States.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19180-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

In his \nstatement yesterday he said he will veto this bill. But, he said, ``I \nam determined to work with Congress to achieve real bipartisan welfare \nreform.'' I just this moment was speaking with my friend from New \nMexico, who made very serious proposals in that regard. Let us do it.\n  But, sir, it has to be done here in the Congress--in cooperation with \nthe Executive.

This must not come back to us in a proposal put \ntogether in 3 days in a room with four people. This is a task for the \nCongress. We look forward to it. We welcome it. But we put the \nPresident respectfully on notice that we must be involved.\n  Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for allowing me to use \nthis time in morning business, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19181-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 134\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So, on their \nbehalf, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, of course, understand the objection on \nthe part of the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  I point out that we have been on this issue now for many years. It \nhas been through the Finance Committee.\n  It is an outrage and an insult to the seniors of this country when we \nknow--and they know--that their Medicare premiums, among other \nexpenses, are going up, and we will not give them this simple relief.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that I have not \nquit on this issue in 9 years. I am not quitting on it. From now on, \nevery single bill that is before this body is going to have it as an \namendment, unless we take it up as freestanding.\n  This is a terrible disservice to the seniors of this Nation not to \nlift this \n\n[[Page S19182]]\nearnings test. It is an anachronism left over from the Depression era.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Roth, and I want to thank \nSenator Moynihan for his efforts. I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for his efforts.\n  This issue is not going away. We owe it to the seniors of this \ncountry. It is a terrible disservice not to pass this legislation at \nthis time, although I certainly understand why the other side might \nobject.\n  We could have passed this long ago. I hope that we can do it as soon \nas possible beginning next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19181-6", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I want to \nmention one other issue.\n  Many of us, including the Senator from Indiana, who is here, have \nworked long and hard on the line-item veto. We worked on the line-item \nveto irrespective of who the President of the United States was.\n  I would like to express my deep disappointment that the conference \nhas not acted since February when we passed the line-item veto and we \nhave come to a great impasse on the line-item veto and have not given \nit to the President of the United States.\n  Again, I am going to sound obstructionist, but this issue will have \nto be brought up also as an amendment and for debate if we are not \nwilling to have a conference meet and the conference decide to pass \nthis. It was passed by over 70 votes when we passed it through the \nSenate, with a far higher majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n  When we ran on this side of the aisle in 1994, we made a commitment \nto pass a line-item veto and to give it to the President of the United \nStates irrespective of the party affiliation of that President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19182-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to begin consideration of the START II \ntreaty.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think the Democratic leader and I want to \nbe in a position to announce that there probably will be no more votes \ntoday.\n  I think on the START II Treaty, which is now pending under an \nagreement, I promised the Senator from New Mexico a couple of weeks ago \nthat we would try to do this before we left.\n  It is my understanding--in fact, the Presiding Officer is one of the \nprincipal players--the bill will be managed on this side by the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and he advises me \nthat it may not be necessary to have a rollcall. There may be one \namendment in the process of being resolved.\n  Senator Thurmond has suggested that we go only as far as presentation \nof the resolution of ratification--that would be satisfactory with me \nif it is satisfactory with the Democratic leader--because he would like \nto have the President sign the Defense authorization bill and not \nfinally dispose of the START II until the President has made a \ndetermination.\n  But I think, based on what I have been able to find out in the last \nfew minutes, if it is satisfactory with the Democratic leader, I think \nwe could announce that there will no more votes today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \ncooperation on this issue.\n  It appears that there is one outstanding issue that may or may not be \nresolved with a rollcall vote. If we could make it in order that the \namendment and presentation of the resolution of ratification be the \nonly matters pending relating to START and the return, I think we can \naccommodate the schedule and it will please all of those involved in \nthe negotiations.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I believe we can also dispose of nearly all \nof the nominations on the Executive Calendar. Of course, anything that \nwe can do by unanimous consent--I think the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from Utah have a bill that will take 1 hour, and it will \nnot require a rollcall vote, on victims' restitution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Perhaps that can be disposed of today, and any other \nmatters that we can dispose of on a consent basis--obviously, we will \nbe here later today.\n  So, based on that comment from the Democratic leader, I think we will \nannounce there will be no more votes today, no votes tomorrow, no votes \non Sunday, no votes on Monday, and no votes on Tuesday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope we will have a rollcall vote on the treaty. So, we \ncan be assured of that at some point.\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think it is a very important treaty. We should have a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. May I make inquiry? As I understand, there will be no \nvotes before Christmas, final vote on this treaty? Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct, according by the wishes of the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Does that give the President a chance to sign the \ndefense bill?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think once he recognizes the merit of it, certainly he \nwill be disposed to sign it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. It is to his advantage and to the advantage of the \ntroops and to the advantage of the defense for him to sign it.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion, I just wanted to ask about the House resolution that will \ncover veterans.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are working on that. The two leaders have discussed not \nonly that provision, but the District of Columbia, foster care, and \nAFDC. It is our hope that before we leave here today, we can reach some \naccommodation.\n\n  I have also discussed that with the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith, who is very interested particularly in the \nveterans part having had a phone call this morning from a veteran \nfriend of his.\n  So, hopefully, we can resolve that. The Senator from Massachusetts \nhas an interest in that, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19182-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTREATY WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION \n           OF STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS (THE START II TREATY)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But it is on a \nmatter which I think needs addressing.\n\n[[Page S19183]]\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN DISINFORMATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican campaign of disinformation \non their unfair Medicare cuts continues in full swing. Now it has \nreached a new low with a gross distortion of the views on Medicare of \nPresident Clinton and the First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. A \ntelevision advertisement, sponsored by the Republican National \nCommittee, purports to show Mrs. Clinton endorsing the deep Medicare \ncuts in the Republican budget plan.\n\n  The advertisement is a good example of the depths to which the \nRepublican Party is willing to sink in order to defend its unfair and \ndestructive plan to slash Medicare. The ad transposes a statement from \n1993 about the Clinton plan and tries to make it appear that it is an \nendorsement of the Republican program. It ignores three central facts. \nThe Republican plan slashes Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the \nwealthy, but every dollar of Medicare savings in the Clinton plan was \nput back into expanded health benefits for the elderly. The Republican \nplan is rigged to force senior citizens to give up their family doctor \nand join private insurance plans, but the Clinton plan strengthened \nMedicare and preserved the right to choose ones own doctor. The \nRepublican plan actually raises costs for working families and will \nincrease the number of the uninsured, but the Clinton plan controlled \ncosts throughout the health system and guaranteed coverage for all.\n  The first grave distortion is that the advertisement seems to show \nMrs. Clinton endorsing the Republican plan. But, in fact, the clip came \nfrom 1993 and showed Mrs. Clinton discussing the administration's own \nhealth care program.\n  Equating the Medicare cuts in the Clinton 1993 health reform plan \nwith the cuts in the current Republican budget plan ignores several \nfundamental facts.\n  Every dollar cut from Medicare under the Clinton plan was reinvested \nin expanded health services for the elderly. The Clinton plan provided \nlong overdue new coverage in key areas of Medicare where the greatest \ngaps now exist--prescription drugs and long-term care.\n  Under the Clinton plan, senior citizens would have been vastly better \noff. Under the current Republican plan, they will be vastly worse off. \nEvery senior citizen will pay an additional $1,200 in premiums over the \nnext 7 years. Every elderly couple will pay $2,400 more. Senior \ncitizens already pay 21 percent of their limited incomes for health \ncare. Their median income is only $17,000 a year. They are already \nfacing increases in their private Medigap insurance that will average \n30 percent next year. The Medicare cuts and Medicare premium increase \nunder the Republican plan will only make their plight worse.\n  The Republican plan slashes $117 billion out of Medicaid as well, \neven though two-thirds of all Medicaid spending is for senior citizens \nand the disabled, including essential nursing home care.\n  The Republican plan is also rigged to force senior citizens to give \nup their family doctor, leave Medicare, and join private insurance \nplans. The Clinton health reform plan preserved Medicare. It preserved \nsenior citizens' right to keep their family doctors. It did not slash \nMedicare to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  Equally important, the Clinton health care reform was not limited to \nMedicare or Medicaid. It assured health care for every American. By \ncontrast, the Republican budget plan ignores the need for overall \nreform. In fact, it endangers the quality of care for all those on \nMedicare and Medicaid, and many others as well.\n  It is estimated that one-quarter of all hospitals will have to \nsubstantially curtail services or will even have to close. The total \nnumber of the uninsured could soar to 60 million by 2002.\n  The respected consulting firm of Lewin-VHI has estimated that the \nRepublican Medicare and Medicaid cuts could add $70 billion to the \nhealth care costs of businesses and workers. Every worker could pay \n$1,000 more over the next 7 years as a result of this Republican \nproposal. This is a program for higher costs and greater health \ninsecurity for every working family--not lower costs and greater health \ncare security.\n  A final important point is that the Clinton plan would have reduced \nhealth care costs throughout the entire health care system. The \nRepublican plan would cut costs only in Medicare and Medicaid. It would \ntherefore perpetuate the current trend toward two health care systems, \nseparate and unequal--a first class system for the affluent who can \nafford it, and an unfair system for everyone else--especially senior \ncitizens and the needy.\n  What the Republican plan has in mind for Medicare and Medicaid today \nis vastly different from what the President and Mrs. Clinton had in \nmind in their 1993 plan. Republican tactics of obstruction prevented \nCongress from acting on that plan. The current Republican plan would go \nfurther in the wrong direction.\n  No one has fought harder for health care for all Americans than \nPresident Clinton and the First Lady. The Republican TV ad is a cynical \nattempt to manipulate the public. It deserves to be repudiated for what \nit is--a devious and descriptive distortion. If this is a harbinger of \nthings to come, the country is in for a long winter's night of \nRepublican dirty tricks.\n  Mr. President, over the past few days, there have been television \nadvertisements which have inaccurately portrayed Mrs. Clinton in her \ntestimony, I believe it was before the Ways and Means Committee. From \nthese advertisements, one could gather that the President of the United \nStates and Mrs. Clinton were basically at odds in terms of amounts of \ncuts on Medicare spending.\n  What has been left out of the ad is that Mrs. Clinton's testimony, \nabout 2 years ago, was given in support of the President's health care \nreform program. During the time of the President's program, there were \ngoing to be reductions in the escalation of overall spending, but all \nof the savings that were going to be achieved under the Medicare \nProgram were going to be plowed back into the Medicare system with \nrelief for our senior citizens on prescription drugs and also on long-\nterm care.\n  So the characterization that Mrs. Clinton is for cutting back \nMedicare and therefore is in basic agreement with the Republican \nposition is a complete distortion and serious misrepresentation. It is \nparticularly harsh when you look at the totality of the spending cuts \nnot only in the Medicare provision under the Republican plan but also \nin the Medicaid Program which affects so many of our seniors, \nparticularly those in nursing homes.\n  Then if you look at the increase in Medicare premiums and also the \npolicy implications of the Republican Medicare proposal, I think these \nwould dampen the opportunities for our seniors to choose their own \nfamily physician or remain in the kind of Medicare system that we \ncurrently know in this country. No one who followed the health care \nreform debate and discussion over the last 2 years and listened to Mrs. \nClinton could come to any other conclusion than that these Republican \nads are a clear distortion and misrepresentation.\n  I find it particularly troublesome when the final representations are \nmade on that ad that suggest there is a duplicitousness between the \nPresident's position and Mrs. Clinton. There is nothing further from \nthe truth. And to portray that ad out there as being the real truth in \nconflict with the representations that Mrs. Clinton has stood for in \nterms of Medicare reform and our own health care reform initiatives, I \nthink is a real gross distortion.\n  I finally say, Mr. President, as anyone who followed that debate \nunderstood, Mrs. Clinton was talking about the totality of savings that \nwere to be achieved under a comprehensive reform program which is \nreally the only way we are going to be able to proceed if we are going \nto have effective kinds of cost containment and control.\n  So I just wanted to take a moment of the Senate's time to give, \ncertainly, my impression of that ad and to make my colleagues keenly \naware of exactly what Mrs. Clinton was testifying to and what her \nposition was in 1993. It has been distorted. It has been \nmisrepresented. I think it is a serious disservice.\n  I see in the Chamber my friend and colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller, who is a real leader in the battle for \ncomprehensive reform, and I inquire of him whether his view \n\n[[Page S19184]]\nabout that ad is similar to the one that I have just represented?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In responding to the Senator from Massachusetts, it \nis really a matter, I think, of fundamental shock as well as distortion \nof truth that these ads are portraying. What we have been doing in the \ncourse of this particular year 1995 is looking at Medicare and Medicaid \nall by themselves without any sort of thought about comprehensive \nhealth care reform at all, which means it is like you are trying to \ntake a gigantic system and just reorganize one part of it.\n  What Mrs. Clinton was talking about a year or more ago in this \ntelevision ad, she was in the process of leading an effort, along with \nthe President and the rest of us, which did not succeed, to try to \nreform health care as a whole and to really give a chance for Medicare \nand Medicaid to take their proper role within a reformed total health \ncare system in the private sector.\n  So to the Senator from Massachusetts, I would say he is absolutely \nright. All of those cuts she was talking about were being plowed right \nback into Medicare, into senior citizens in the form of prescription \ndrugs and long-term care. Because there were tremendous efforts being \nmade to control costs in the private sector, there was not any of the \ncost-shifting involved that we are seeing in the debate this year \nbecause it was comprehensive health care, cost control within the \nprivate sector, plus the fact that you were not going to have, back \nthen, the situation of doctors refusing to see patients, Medicare \npatients because perhaps the fee would not be adequate, or you \ncertainly would not have seniors being forced into HMO's and other \nthings. So the choosing of the doctor, the fact that the money was all \nbeing put back into Medicare really makes the perpetrators of this ad a \nrather shameful lot, and it is a tremendous disservice to Mrs. Clinton, \nwho did everything that a human could possibly do to try to make health \ncare better for all Americans.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I particularly \nwish to thank my friends and colleagues, the floor managers, Senator \nLugar and Senator Pell. This matter which is before the Senate now is \nextremely important, and I am grateful to them for their courtesy in \nletting us address the Senate briefly on this matter.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as \nif in morning business for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19182-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKABLE GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are now in the seventh day of the \nsecond Government shutdown of the year. This is the longest partial \nshutdown of our Government in the almost 207 years of our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The commonly held view is that the shutdown results from differences \nin policy between the Republican-controlled Congress and the President. \nThe Republicans want their economic projections used to calculate the \ndeficit reduction needed to get to a balanced budget. The President \nwants to ensure that reasonable funding levels are maintained for \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, environmental enforcement, and so on.\n  This commonly held view is wrong.\n  In fact, this crisis in government is not caused by differences \nbetween the President and Congress on policy matters. It is caused by \nthe new and radical view that Republican congressional leaders have \ntaken about Congress' constitutional duties and prerogatives.\n  For the first time in our Nation's history, the congressional the \ngovernment and keep it closed in order to extort concessions from the \nPresident on policy issues. House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, \nthis week, announced that the House will not send President Clinton a \nbill reopening the full Government--even temporarily--until there is \n``a bill for him to sign'' that balances the budget in 7 years.\n  This decision by Congress to shut down the Government until it gets \nits way is new. No previous Congress has interpreted the Constitution \nas granting it that right. In a recent interview with the Wall Street \nJournal, Mr. Gingrich referred to this newfound right as ``the key \nstrategic decision made on election night a year ago.'' Mr. Gingrich \nstated;\n\n       If you are going to operate with his [the President's] veto \n     being the ultimate trump, you have to operate within a very \n     narrow range of change. * * * You had to find a trump to \n     match his trump. And the right not to pass money bills is the \n     only trump that is equally strong.\n\n  So, for the first time in our national life we have congressional \nleadership that believes it has the constitutional right to close the \nGovernment and keep it closed until Congress prevails. The immediate \ndisagreement is about a whole tangle of budgetary issues, but if \nCongress has the right to close the Government in this disagreement, \npresumably it has that right whenever the President has the temerity to \nstand his ground on any issue. If the closing of Government is an \ninherent right of the Congress, then all powers of the President are \nnecessarily subordinated.\n  Those who wrote our Constitution never intended that the Congress \nhave any such right as is now claimed. They set out a system of checks \nand balances among the branches of government and provided a method of \nresolving differences including a right of the President to veto \nlegislation and the right of Congress to override that veto.\n  But underlying all these checks and balances between the branches of \ngovernment, those who wrote the Constitution assumed an obligation and \ndesire on the part of all to maintain what Justice Jackson referred to \nas a ``workable government.'' (343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952)).\n\n  When our Founders embarked upon the task of bringing to life the \nconstitutional system devised in Philadelphia in 1787 and approved by \nthe State ratifying conventions, it was the legislative branch of our \nnew Government which they called on to commence proceedings under the \nConstitution.\n  Pursuant to that call, the Congress met in New York in 1789, \norganized itself, and provided for the counting of the Presidential \nelectoral votes and the inauguration of the President. The Congress \nthen passed legislation to establish the great departments of the \nexecutive branch, to provide for the organization of the judicial \nbranch, and to furnish appropriations to enable all the branches of our \nnew National Government to perform their constitutional functions.\n  It would be, Mr. President, frankly unimaginable to our Nation's \nFounders that our branch, the first branch of government, whose duty it \nwas to bring to life the Framer's plan, would ever think that it was \nwithin its purview to disable that plan by refusing to perform the \nCongress' primary constitutional responsibilities.\n  But the Republican leaders of Congress today are doing just that--\nrefusing to perform the Congress' primary constitutional \nresponsibilities. They believe they have ``the right not to pass money \nbills'' and can use that so-called right as the ``ultimate trump,'' as \nMr. Gingrich puts it, in their disagreements with the President.\n  Mere policy differences, no matter how important, are not at the core \nof the present Government crisis. There have been many times in our \nhistory when policy differences between Congress and the President were \ngreat and were strongly held. The real cause of this crisis is the \ninflated and radical view taken by Republican congressional leaders \nconcerning the rights of the Congress under the Constitution. What they \nclaim as a right is instead an unprecedented abuse of power. Until a \nmajority of each House of Congress recognizes this, the ``workable \ngovernment'' which the Founding Fathers contemplated will remain at \nrisk.\n  Thank you Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19184-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19184-S19185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FUNDING FOR MEDICAID\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I hold in my hand today a letter to \nPresident Clinton that is signed by all 46 members of the Democratic \nCaucus. This \n\n[[Page S19185]]\nletter urges him to hold firm to our commitment to basic health care \nfor children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the disabled in this \ncountry. This letter supports a per capita cap approach to finding \nsavings in the Medicaid Program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this letter shows unity and \nit demonstrates support for President Clinton in his negotiations on \nthis vital matter. As you heard the eloquent Senator from West Virginia \ndescribe yesterday, sometimes we have to look beyond partisanship and \ndo what needs doing as Americans. As you heard our respected colleague \nsay, we need to look beyond partisanship, toward compromise if we want \nto succeed in creating a balanced budget.\n\n  This letter is partisan in that it is signed by all Democrats. But it \nis my feeling that as Americans every Member of the Senate should have \nan opportunity to endorse the position described in this document. As \nAmericans we all must do our very best for our children in this Nation, \nand that is what this letter is about.\n  As the Senators from Nebraska and North Dakota discussed yesterday \nwith the release of the Senate Democratic budget, we can balance the \nbudget in 7 years using the most conservative CBO estimates without \nhurting our children.\n  This letter I hold in my hand reflects just one part of that \ncommitment. I do not think my colleagues across the aisle are \nadvocating the block grants so that we will intentionally hurt children \nin this country. I will simply tell you the reaction of people at the \nState and local level who actually provide Medicaid services to \nchildren is overwhelmingly negative.\n  They can see from the grassroots level what it will mean to design a \nMedicaid program, and they do not want drastic funding cuts, and they \ndo not want a block grant, because it fundamentally will not work.\n  Groups representing almost every decisionmaker and provider in this \ncountry have come out against the Medicaid block grant proposal. The \nConference of Mayors, the National Association of County Officials, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the Democratic Governors \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, and most other medical \nprovider organizations, and all child advocacy groups, all have rallied \nin opposition to this bad idea.\n\n  I heard yesterday from Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle and the Mayors \nAssociation, who are sending a letter of their own to the President. \nThe block grant has been condemned by anyone who has thought about how \nit will affect this country's children and other vulnerable \npopulations. Tonight there will be a child within a few blocks from \nthis building who will need the help of a caring health care \nprofessional, and Medicaid will pay for the care.\n  Marion Wright Edelman uses a phrase that sums up what we are talking \nabout when it comes to Medicaid and children, ``protection of last \nresort.'' We have to guarantee that protection. It is a moral \ncommitment, and it is within our grasp. We can balance the budget but \nwe can do it without giving in to mindless partisanship and we can do \nit without sacrificing our basic commitments.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington DC, December 13, 1995.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our strong \n     support for the Medicaid per-capita cap structure in your \n     seven-year budget. We have fought against Medicaid block \n     grants and cuts in the Senate, and we are glad you \n     acknowledge the importance of our position.\n       We support a balanced budget. We are glad you agree with us \n     that we can balance the budget without undermining the health \n     of children, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly.\n       The savings level of $54 billion over seven years included \n     in your budget will require rigorous efficiencies and \n     economies in the program. However, after consulting with many \n     Medicaid Directors and service providers across the country, \n     we believe a reduction of this level is possible to achieve \n     without dramatic limits on eligibility or cuts to essential \n     services. States will need flexibility to achieve these \n     savings, and you have taken steps toward granting it in your \n     bill.\n       We were encouraged that your Medicaid proposal does not pit \n     Medicaid populations against one another in a fight over a \n     limited pot of federal resources.\n       We were further encouraged to hear Chief of Staff Panetta \n     relay your commitment to veto any budget not containing a \n     fundamental guarantee to Medicaid for eligible Americans.\n       We commend you on the courage you have exercised in making \n     these commitments to Americans eligible for Medicaid. There \n     is a bottom line when it comes to people's health; do not \n     allow the current Congressional leadership to further reduce \n     our commitment to Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       Your current proposal is fair and reasonable, and is \n     consistent with what we have advocated on the Senate floor. \n     We urge you in the strongest possible terms to hold fast to \n     these commitments in further negotiations. We are prepared to \n     offer any assistance you may need in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bob Graham; John Breaux; Jay Rockefeller; Herb Kohl; \n           Patrick Leahy; Frank R.

Let me first of all express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Massachusetts and the Senator from West Virginia who just \nspoke about the advertisement that I also saw this morning with regard \nto Mrs. Clinton and her health care financing proposals as opposed to \nthose of the leadership in the Congress of this session.\n  To suggest that the President's proposal last year was in any way the \nsame in terms of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid is truly absurd. In \nfact, I want to emphasize that one of the very significant things that \nthe President's plan would have done is provide for the first time a \nnational home- and community-based long-term care program, to help \npeople stay in the community, and I think save the country a lot of \nmoney in both the Medicare and Medicaid budget.\n  To suggest that somehow Mrs. Clinton's proposal was in any way, shape \nor form like what we are seeing today with the slash-and-burn approach \nto Medicaid and Medicare is, to me, very unfortunate and very \ndistorting and, again, suggests that there is no limit in reference to \nthe actual facts in these situations.\n  I don't know how the American people are supposed to know who to \nbelieve. That is the comment I get most often now at home. ``Who do you \nbelieve?'' And when you are willing to put an ad on the television that \nsuggests that a program that was proposed by the President last year is \nessentially the same as the Medicare and Medicaid cuts proposed today, \nI just get the feeling that people will not have any idea who is \ntelling the truth in Washington. I think we all suffer because of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19185-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19185-S19195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFEREES HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF INTERNET USERS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on another matter, 2 weeks ago I came to \nthe Senate floor to urge my colleagues who are telecommunications \nconferees not to adopt potentially unconstitutional legislation in our \nefforts to protect children on the Internet. I was concerned about the \nsubstantial chilling effect this legislation would have on \nconstitutionally protected speech. The media had just reported recently \nan online service provider's censorship of the word ``breast'' because \nit was vulgar, supposedly, despite the fact that that term merely \nrefers to a part of the anatomy. \n\n[[Page S19186]]\n\n  I was and remain concerned that this is the first word of many that \nwill ultimately be censored if legislation criminalizing indecent \nspeech is passed as part of the telecommunications legislation. It \nseems the conferees have agreed upon a variation of the Communications \nDecency Act for inclusion in the conference report for the \ntelecommunications legislation.\n  Mr. President, the language very simply would criminalize indecent \nspeech via the Internet that is already today protected in other forms \nof the media. Vagueness associated with the definition of indecency \nundoubtedly, Mr. President, will lead to far more censorship than \nsimply the word ``breast.''\n  Mr. President, these measures, although perhaps well-intended, are \npoorly targeted to the stated problem. And they will do very little to \nprotect children. If signed into law however, it is very clear that \nthis legislation will be very effective at censoring constitutionally \nprotected speech on the Internet.\n  As I pointed out before, I am extremely concerned about recent \ncongressional focus on ``indecent speech.'' The promoters of this \nlegislation contend they are trying to protect children from \nobscenity--not indecency but obscenity. The transmission of obscenity \nis already a violation of criminal law. Use of the word or definition \nfor ``indecency'' makes this legislation overly broad, capturing speech \nthat I do not think many Senators intend or wish to prohibit.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example. The World Wide Web Page for \nHotWired, the online version of Wired magazine contains a strongly \nworded editorial about congressional action on the pending indecency \nlegislation. The opinion piece contained at least three ``indecent'' \nwords, based on FCC's current definition, and potentially more \ndepending on the definition used by others.\n  I am not going to say these words on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nMr. President, but this editorial is a political speech, with Members \nof Congress and Senators as its target.\n  Are the words of this piece harsh? Yes, they are. Will some adults \nconsider the words offensive? Yes, they will. Does the text contain \nwords many of us would not want our children to read? Yes, it does.\n  But does the text contain words that most children have not heard \nbefore in the school yard? No, it does not. It does not contain \nanything unusual in that regard.\n  Is the language in this piece, this alleged profanity in this piece, \nprotected by the first amendment? Yes, it is. You bet it is. But would \nthe writers or transmitters of these words on the Internet be subject \nto criminal sanctions if the pending legislation passes?\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, the answer is probably yes.\n  Because even though the words do not fall under the definition of \n``obscenity,'' and even though you may express these words in any other \nmedia and probably be safe from criminal prosecution, under this \nproposal in the telecommunications bill, these words would probably be \ndefined as indecent and the person who communicates them may be subject \nto severe criminal penalties.\n  I give this example to point out that the legislation considered by \nthe telecommunications conference committee in its most recent \nincarnation is overly broad. It will result in censorship, either self-\ncensorship driven out of the fear of criminal prosecution, or \ncensorship by online providers themselves who must protect themselves \nfrom criminal liability.\n  America Online's censorship of the word ``breast'', an anatomical \nreference, was only the beginning. Mr. President, either type of \ncensorship is completely unacceptable and totally unnecessary.\n  The Internet indecency legislation currently under consideration is \noverly broad, not just in the material covered by the proposed \nlanguage, but also in the way that such materials are covered. The \nlanguage would subject anyone who ``displays in a manner available'' to \nminors so-called indecent materials to criminal penalties.\n  While the proponents of the language are intending to target those \nwho directly provide such materials to minors, it captures a much \nlarger group of people, Mr. President. The term ``available'' has an \nentirely different meaning in cyberspace than it does in other forms of \nmedia. That is because online communications are entirely different \nthan communications over other media.\n  The words ``displays in a manner available'' captures speech over \npublic bulletin boards, USENET groups or World Wide Web Pages that are \naccessible to anyone with a modem, an Internet connection and the right \nsoftware. There is no way to know, Mr. President, who will read the \nmessage you have posted on these forums or how old that person is, just \nlike there is no way for HotWired to know who on my staff accessed the \neditorial on their Home Page or the age of that staff person.\n  Simply posting a message which contains profanity on free public \naccess Internet forums expose Internet users to criminal liability if a \nminor accesses those forums--even if the sender had no intention at all \nof providing these materials to minors.\n  Let me provide my colleagues with some other examples of some of the \nsocially valuable public forums that one can access on the Internet \nthat may contain indecent speech under the definition in the \ntelecommunications bill.\n  One news group called ``news.newusers.questions'' had the following \nmessage posted by an individual:\n\n       I need urgent information on the prevention of teenage \n     pregnancy. Could someone please help me?\n\n  There was no indication the sender of this message was a minor. The \nsender could be an educator, a parent or a social service provider. One \nreader responded electronically and suggested this individual access a \nnews group called ``alt.parenting.solutions'' and \n``alt.parents.teens,'' both of which address the issue in responsible \nways. Another reader responded simply with the advice that teens should \nabstain from sex.\n  Presumably, there will ultimately be a response from a reader that \ngives explicit rather than general advice. That advice could contain \nindecent language or explicit words describing preventive measures. \nUnder this proposal in the telecommunications bill, that advice could \nland the giver of the advice in jail if a minor happens to read the \nmessage.\n  Another news group called ``misc.kids.pregnancy'' contained a \ndiscussion about breastfeeding, pregnancy, and other adult topics \nrelating to childbirth. Again, some of the language in these \ndiscussions was explicit but in no way irresponsible.\n  There is a World Wide Web Page called ``Go Ask Alice'' which is a \nforum wherein participants ask questions about sexuality, including \npregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, birth control, breast \nimplants, rape, menopause and reproductive health. Many of these topics \nand questions are sexually explicit and contain graphic, but \nconstitutionally protected, language.\n  Another Web page is called ``Truth or Dare: Sex in the 90's.'' This \nWeb page was a forum devoted almost entirely to the topic of ``safe \nsex.'' One topic discussed was the relationship between some sexually \ntransmitted diseases and cervical cancer in women. Some of the \ninformation on this Web page, while it may be distasteful and offensive \nto some, it is important to many users of this forum.\n  There is also a Web page devoted to prostate cancer--its symptoms, \ndetection, and treatment. There is language on this page, Mr. \nPresident, that could be considered indecent. Recall that America \nOnline censored the word ``breast'' because it was on a list of vulgar \nwords, even though the word was used in the scientific context of \nbreast cancer survivors forum.\n  There are Web pages devoted to the detection and prevention of child \nabuse, including sexual assault. For example, the Sexual Assault \nInformation Page includes a variety of information about abuse as well \nas access to other Web pages and Internet services dealing with child \nabuse and assault recovery, such as the Survivors and Victims Empowered \nWeb Page. The SAVE Page is an online support service for victims of \nabuse, or the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network. There is also a \nUSENET group, accessible to anyone, called ``alt.sexual.abuse'' which \nis a recovery support forum for those who were abused as children or \nadults. \n\n[[Page S19187]]\n\n  There may be so-called indecent speech in all of these forums which \nminors can access. Make no mistake about it, many of these forums \ncontain adult topics of a mature nature. Some of the language is \noffensive. However, these forums do serve a valuable social function \nfrom the standpoint of public health and safety.\n  Mr. President, the material on these forums is not what the \ncongressional proponents of the indecency legislation are targeting, or \nat least I assume they are not. Proponents are targeting obscenity and \npornography. Unfortunately, the legislation will capture speech on all \nthe forums I have mentioned and thousands more like them. If the \npending legislation passes, these forums may cease to exist because the \nusers will fear criminal prosecution.\n\n\n        Less Restrictive Means are Available to Protect Children\n\n  There is a better way to protect children, Mr. President, that will \nnot criminalize constitutionally protected speech. Currently there are \nmany software programs available to parents, sometimes for no charge, \nwhich allow them to screen out or block their children's access to \nforums where explicit language is used, including profanity. ``Net \nNanny'' prevents children from accessing areas on the Internet that the \nparents deem inappropriate, and also prevents kids from giving out \ntheir names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers or other \ninformation that could put them in harms way.\n  Parents can screen out not only indecency but also Websites that \ninclude rap music, violent topics, hate speech, political topics, or \nother types of information that they don't want their children to see. \nParents have the option of screening as much or as little as they want.\n  ``Cybersitter'' allows parents to monitor what their children are \naccessing on the Internet and prevents children from downloading \npictures or other graphic images. Mr. President, there are many other \ntypes of software available to parents that allow them to decide what \nis appropriate for their children, based on the characteristics of \ntheir family and the maturity of their children. That is the role of \nthe parent, not of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken in opposition to unconstitutional \nrestrictions on speech via the Internet. I have argued that the pending \nlegislation is likely unconstitutional. I have argued that the \nlegislation is impractical. I have argued that the legislation will not \nachieve its objective. And I have argued that the legislation will \nstifle the growth of online communications technology.\n  But, Mr. President, I have received a lot of electronic mail on the \nlegislation being considered by the conference committee in recent \nweeks from Wisconsinites, who do use the Internet daily. Rather than \nrestate my arguments, I want to let my constituents speak for \nthemselves on this issue. Here is what some of them have said:\n  A photographer, historian and writer in Madison, WI, says:\n\n       . . . I am deeply concerned that this legislation will \n     overreach its intended purpose. Instead of simply protecting \n     children, this legislation will be so restrictive of \n     communication via e-mail, list service, the World Wide Web, \n     etc, that it will prevent adults from conducting perfectly \n     legitimate exchanges of information. . . . I conduct a great \n     deal of business communication via the Internet and I am \n     fearful about what this latest ill-conceived legislation will \n     do.\n\n  A father from Madison, WI writes:\n\n       It concerns me that certain politicians may take advantage \n     of fears held by the public to enact laws that limit our \n     freedom of speech. I myself am a parent and am concerned \n     about some of the trashier content that can be found on the \n     internet. However, I feel that each of us has the right and \n     the responsibility to discern good from bad in our own minds. \n     I raise my son to make good choices in his life . . . I \n     desire to protect him for harm but I would not insulate him \n     from the world and lock him in ignorance . . . the government \n     should never limit his access to the truth.\n\n  An e-mail from a Milwaukee constituent stated:\n\n       I strongly urge you to consider other less restrictive \n     means for regulating access to objectionable material by \n     minors such as placing the responsibility in the hands of the \n     parents, where it belongs, not by forcing unconstitutional \n     censorship on the medium.\n\n  From Shorewood, WI, a parent writes:\n       I am a voting, tax-paying adult U.S. citizen. I am also a \n     church going parent. I feel that it is unacceptable that I \n     could be convicted of a felony for sending a love-letter to \n     my wife. I feel it equally unacceptable that an unenforceable \n     legal regulation of morality infringes upon my right to \n     govern what my daughter may or may not see based on some \n     narrow-minded and likely unconstitutional definition of \n     indecency, especially when technological means of controlling \n     her access are available to me now.\n\n  From Appleton, WI, an Internet-using constituent says:\n\n       We all know that the best parental censor to TV is the on-\n     off button. Well, I and many others have installed our own \n     button on the computer. My choice is a program called \n     KidSafe. This program identifies and shows how to lock out \n     adult sites. Indeed a parent can lock out almost anything. . \n     . . I want to tell you that this program is free. And there \n     are all kinds of links to it all over the Web. The cost? A \n     few minutes to download and install it. I count myself among \n     the more conservative citizens. However, I believe some of my \n     co-believers have gone too far.\n       The attempt by any governmental or quasi-governmental body \n     to come into the newsroom and rule on what shall and what \n     shall not be printed in the paper would be shouted down by \n     the populace as naked aggressive censorship. In this case, \n     the computer replaces newsprint, ink and delivery system. \n     Fundamentally though, it's no different.\n\n  From Reedsburg, WI, an employee of an Internet access provider \nwrites:\n\n       To enact a law such as the one that just passed the House \n     is paramount to going after manufacturers of baseball bats \n     because someone decided to beat his next door neighbor . . . \n     with one.\n       The farmers in our community use the Internet to access the \n     University of Wisconsin Ag Department . . . Many of our small \n     businesses use it to communicate with customers around the \n     world. Grocery stores and vendors are using the Web to e-mail \n     product orders to vendors. The uses are growing. Please don't \n     stifle growth.\n\n  An Appleton resident suggested that:\n\n       The pending legislation is akin to asking telephone \n     companies to monitor all of their phone traffic in order to \n     prevent obscene calls.\n\n  From Fox Point WI, a constituent writes that:\n\n       We are all familiar with government intervention and \n     unintended consequences. In this instance, the consequences \n     are clear and devastating to a free and open exchange.\n\n  A university professor in Wausau, WI, e-mailed:\n\n       Although the intent [of the computer indecency legislation] \n     is a noble one, the consequences of the bill, if passed, \n     could have a disastrous effect on the Internet as a viable \n     medium for expression, education and commerce. Libraries will \n     not be able to put their entire collections on line and \n     people like me will risk massive fines and prison sentences \n     for public discussions someone might consider indecent.\n\n  A Hudson, WI, parent shared this advice for Congress and other \nparents:\n\n       I've always believed that people should take responsibility \n     for what their children view. This is why my children cannot \n     access the Internet without my consent. They don't have the \n     password. It's that simple.\n\n  From Plymouth, WI, a pastor in a United Church of Christ Congregation \nwrites:\n\n       I am concerned about pornography and ``cybersex'' but this \n     [legislation] isn't the direction we should be heading. \n     Personal responsibility needs to be taken and how can that be \n     legislated?\n\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of wisdom coming from our constituents \non this matter. These are people who are using the technology to \ncontact their Senators and Representatives instead of pencil and paper. \nUnlike many of us here, they rely on cybercommunications in their daily \nlives. I think my colleagues would do well to listen to their advice.\n  While, I recognize it is unlikely in these late stages of the \ntelecommunications conference that conferees will change their \ndirection on regulating cyberspace, I urge my colleagues to think \ncarefully about this legislation.\n  Including this language in a bill that purports to deregulate \ntelecommunications markets is exactly the wrong direction to take.\n  Mr. President, constituents in my State, parents and others are very \nconcerned about the overbreadth of these provisions, the fact that it \nmay inhibit their ability to communicate in their work or in their own \nprivate lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, will the Chair please state the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the START II treaty.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nstaff members be accorded the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration by the Senate of the START II treaty: Kenneth A. Myers \nIII, Linton Brooks, a CNA fellow in my office and K. A. Myers, Jr., a \nprofessional staff member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and \nRonald Marks, legislative fellow on the majority leader's staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join once again with my \ncolleague, Senator Claiborne Pell, in bringing before the Senate a \nstrategic arms reduction agreement negotiated between the Russian \nFederation and the United States--the START II Treaty. Senator Pell and \nI collaborated on the ratification process attendant to the START I \nTreaty, and it is only fitting that Senator Pell will be handling the \nmanager's task for the Democratic side on the START II Treaty.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, has \nasked me to manage these treaty deliberations on the Republican side, \nand I am pleased to do so.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues who may be curious as to the \nschedule on a Friday afternoon before Christmas, let me outline how we \nwill proceed in these deliberations on the START II Treaty.\n  Following opening statements by the two managers, we will entertain \nsimilar statements by other Members.\n  We will then move to consideration of any amendments to the text of \nthe treaty itself. Senator Pell and I are aware of no proposed \namendments to alter the treaty text.\n  Then the Senate will move to consideration of the resolution of \nratification that will reflect the terms by which the Senate is \nproviding its advice and its decision to the President regarding \nratification of the START II Treaty. In reporting the START II Treaty \nto the full Senate by a unanimous vote of 18-0, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee approved a resolution of ratification that \ncontained a number of conditions and declarations.\n  Subsequent to the filing of the Committee's report on the START II \nTreaty, interested Senators from other committees came together in a \nbipartisan spirit to try to develop some consensus on other conditions \nand declarations that would either modify or be added to the resolution \nof ratification approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. That \neffort at consensus-building has been successful, and I want to thank \nSenator Stevens, Senator Kyl, Senator Cochran, Senator Pell, Senator \nLevin, and Senator Nunn for the constructive manner in which they \napproached the resolution of ratification. As a result of their \nefforts, we have arrived at a package of amendments that enjoys the \nsupport of Members participating in those negotiations. That package \nwill be offered in the form of manager's amendments as modifications or \nadditions to the original resolution reported by the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  That resolution of ratification, as amended, will then be open to \nfurther debate and amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have elaborated somewhat on the process we will \nemploy in considering this treaty so that Members might plan their \nschedules accordingly. Unfortunately, we have not been able to arrive \nat a time agreement for considering the treaty, but I hope these \nremarks will give Members some sense as to how the Senate will proceed \nin carrying out its duties in the treaty-making process.\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty has been awaiting action by the \nSenate for over 2 years. The opportunity has now arrived for the Senate \nto play its role in the treaty-making process, and I am grateful to \nthose of my colleagues who have worked so diligently to provide the \nconditions under which the Senate can consent to the ratification of \nthis treaty.\n  The START I Treaty was the first arms control agreement that actually \nreduced the number of strategic offensive weapons. It mandated an \noverall strategic nuclear force reduction of about one-third, and a \nreduction of up to 50 percent in one of the most dangerous and \ndestabilizing categories of nuclear weapons--heavy ICBM's. START I also \nbroke new ground in establishing effective verification regimes by \nproviding levels of visibility and confidence that exceeded any \nprevious nuclear arms control effort. Thus, the START I Treaty was a \nvigorous step toward a more stable nuclear balance because it resulted \nin a reduction in the numbers of destabilizing first strike systems; it \nfostered greater reliance on more survivable nuclear systems; and it \nprovided increased certainty about the other side's strategic posture. \nIn December 1994, these gains were formalized with the entry into force \nof the START I Treaty.\n  The disintegration of the Soviet Union offered the opportunity to \nbuild on the gains of START I and to go even further in reducing the \nnuclear dangers to our Nation. The START II Treaty accomplishes just \nthis purpose. When enacted, this treaty will dramatically reduce the \nnumbers of weapons in the two most destabilizing and dangerous \ncategories of nuclear arsenals--ICBM's with multiple independently \ntargeted reentry vehicles [MIRV's] and the last of the heavy ICBM's, \nthe SS-18's; and it will enable each party to reduce its strategic \narsenal on the basis of an effective verification regime built upon \nboth confidence building measures and intrusive inspections. Both \nparties will be left at rough equivalence in strategic forces, but the \nresult will be smaller, more stable strategic nuclear forces for both \nthe United States and Russia.\n  The START I Treaty was signed as a bilateral agreement between the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union on July 31, 1991, after 9 years of \nnegotiation. The treaty was transmitted to the Senate for its advice \nand consent to ratification on November 25, 1991, but the Soviet Union \ndissolved formally on December 25, 1991, before the Senate could take \naction or the treaty could enter into force.\n  The breakup of the Soviet Union created a number of complex state \nsuccession issues with respect to the treaty. The most important of \nthese issues was that strategic offensive nuclear weapons were left \ndeployed in four former Soviet republics.\n  In order to resolve this key succession problem, the START I Treaty \nwas converted into a multilateral treaty among the United States, \nRussia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan by means of the May 23, 1992, \nLisbon Protocol (Treaty Doc. 102-32).\n  The Protocol constituted an amendment to, and integral part of, the \nSTART I Treaty. It provided that the four former Soviet republics would \ntogether assume the legal obligations of the U.S.S.R. for the START I \nTreaty. It further obligated the four states to make arrangements among \nthemselves as necessary to implement the treaty's limitations, to \npermit verification of the treaty's provisions on their territory, and \nto allocate costs. The Lisbon Protocol also obligated Belarus, Ukraine, \nand Kazakhstan to accede to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \nNPT as nonnuclear weapons states as soon as possible.\n  In letters submitted with the Protocol, Belarus, Ukraine, and \nKazakhstan pledged to eliminate all nuclear weapons and strategic \noffensive arms on their respective territory within 7 years after entry \ninto force of the START I Treaty. To date, all tactical nuclear weapons \nhave been removed from the three states and transferred to Russia. \nWhile Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were under no legal obligation \nto transfer any nuclear weapons to Russia, and could have, at least in \ntheory, eliminated such weapons on their own territories, those \nremaining strategic nuclear weapons are, in fact, being transferred and \neliminated in Russia.\n  Based on the clarifications and obligations associated with the \nLisbon Protocol, the Senate provided its advice and consent to \nratification of the START I Treaty in a 93 to 6 vote on October 1, \n1992. \n\n[[Page S19189]]\n\n  The treaty between the United States of America and the Russian \nFederation on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive \nArms, or the START II Treaty, was signed by the United States and the \nRussian Federation on January 3, 1993, and was transmitted by President \nBush to the Senate on January 15, 1993.\n  The START II Treaty builds upon and goes even further than the START \nI Treaty. START II's central limits require the parties to reduce their \nstrategic offensive arms so that specified limits are reached by the \nyear 2003. The START II Treaty, together with the START I Treaty, will \nreduce both nations' deployed strategic offensive arms by more than \ntwo-thirds, and will completely eliminate land-based intercontinental \nballistic missiles [ICBM's] deployed with multiple warheads. Strict, \nlower limits will be imposed on all deployed strategic offensive arms, \nincluding warheads carried on ICBM's, submarine-launched ballistic \nmissiles [SLBM's], and heavy bombers. Stabilized sea-based forces will \nbe retained but will carry significantly lower numbers of warheads. In \ncontrast to the START I Treaty, all heavy bombers will be attributed \nwith warheads based on the number of nuclear weapons for which they are \nactually equipped.\n  There are five parties to the START I Treaty; in contrast, the START \nII Treaty is bilateral: the United States and the Russian Federation \nare its only parties. According to the Lisbon Protocol, no nuclear \nwarheads or deployed strategic offensive arms will be located on former \nSoviet territories other than Russia, at the time the first phase of \nthe reductions in this treaty are required to be completed. \nNevertheless, the START II Treaty draws upon the START I Treaty for \ndefinitions, counting rules, prohibitions, and verification provisions \nand only modifies those as necessary to meet unique requirements of the \nSTART II Treaty.\n  The terms of the START II Treaty are based on the joint understanding \nsigned between the United States and Russia on June 17, 1992. Its \nimpetus was the desire to strengthen stability by eliminating the most \ndestabilizing systems remaining under the START I Treaty. The joint \nunderstanding established the START II Treaty guidelines.\n  The START II Treaty, unlike START I, is relatively brief and \nstraightforward. The START II Treaty calls for reductions, in two \nphases, in ICBM's, ICBM launchers, ICBM warheads, SLBM's, SLBM \nlaunchers, SLBM warheads, heavy bombers, and heavy bomber nuclear \narmaments. Seven years after entry into force of the START I Treaty, \nthe aggregate number for each party shall not exceed 4,250 deployed \nstrategic warheads. By the same date the following sublimits are to be \nreached as well: between 3,800 and 4,250, for the aggregate number of \nwarheads on deployed ICBM's, deployed SLBM's, and deployed heavy \nbombers; 2,160, for warheads on deployed SLBM's; 1,200, for warheads on \ndeployed multiple-warhead ICBM's; and 650, for warheads on deployed \nRussian heavy ICBM's (SS-18s).\n  Upon the completion of the above reductions during the second and \nfinal phase, the parties shall further reduce their strategic offensive \narms so that no later than January 1, 2003, and thereafter, the \naggregate number for each party shall not exceed 3,500 deployed \nstrategic warheads. By the same date the following sublimits would also \napply: between 3,000 and 3,500, for the aggregate number of warheads on \ndeployed ICBMs, deployed SLBM's, and deployed heavy bombers; between \n1,700 and 1,750, for warheads on deployed SLBM's; Zero, for warheads on \ndeployed multiple-warhead ICBM's; and Zero, for warheads on deployed \nheavy ICBM's.\n  The START II Treaty provides that after January 1, 2003, neither \nparty may deploy land-based missiles with more than one warhead and all \nheavy ICBM's must be destroyed. Specifically, all launchers of ICBM's \nto which more than one warhead is attributed under article III of this \nTreaty, including test and training launchers, must either by destroyed \nor be converted to launchers of ICBM's to which no more than one \nwarhead is attributed. This will require the United States to eliminate \nor convert Peacekeeper ICBM's and their launchers. The Russians will \nhave to eliminate or convert SS-19 and SS-24 ICBM launchers, except \nthose that contain the permitted number of SS-19's downloaded to a \nsingle-warhead configuration. Also exempt from this provision are \nlaunchers of non-heavy ICBM's located at space launch facilities that \nare permitted under the START I Treaty. For the United States, this \nmeans the Peacekeeper can be used as a vehicle for space launch. All \nSS-18 ICBM launchers, including all those at space launch facilities, \nmust be physically destroyed. There is one exception--90 deployed \nlaunchers may be converted, under agreed provisions, to single-warhead \nSS-25 type ICBM launchers with canisters no more than 2.5 meters in \ndiameter, such that rapid reconversion is effectively precluded.\n  All United States Minuteman III ICBM's, and 105 of the 170 Russian \nSS-19 ICBM's, may be retained and downloaded to one warhead pursuant to \narticle III of this Treaty. Any number of SLBM's with multiple warheads \nmay also be downloaded by up to four warheads per missile. Thus, the \nUnited States could theoretically meet the numerical constraints of the \nSTART II Treaty on SLBM warheads by downloading and retaining up to 18 \nTrident submarines with missile warhead loads reduced from eight \nwarheads to four.\n  The START I Treaty requires that 154 of the 308 former Soviet heavy \nICBM launchers must be destroyed by the end of the 7-year reduction \nperiod. The START II Treaty goes further and requires the elimination \nor physical conversion of all heavy ICBM launchers. The Russian \nFederation will be allowed to convert, under agreed constraints and \nsubject to inspection, 90 of these deployed missile launchers within \nwhich only SS-25 single-warhead ICBM's may be deployed. The remaining \n64 heavy ICBM launchers must be destroyed by the end of the second \nphase of reductions in accordance with START II Treaty procedures. The \nconstraints on SS-18 silo conversion require that the Russians pour \nconcrete to a height of five meters above the silo base and mount in \nthe upper portion of the silo a restrictive ring that is smaller in \ndiameter than the diameter of the SS-18. These modifications preclude \nan SS-18 from being launched from these silos, and would be extremely \ndifficult and time-consuming to reverse. The constraints also require \nthe destruction of all deployed and nondeployed SS-18 missiles and \ntheir launch canisters.\n  In the START II Treaty, all deployed heavy bomber nuclear armaments \nwill be counted according to how the bombers are actually equipped. \nEach deployed heavy bomber--except for 100 bombers reoriented to a \nconventional role--will be attributed with the aggregate number of \nlong-range nuclear air-launched cruise missiles, nuclear-armed air-to-\nsurface missiles with ranges of less than 600 kilometers, and nuclear \ngravity bombs for which it is actually equipped. Under this agreement, \nheavy bombers will be attributed with a realistic number of warheads \nthat reflects operational considerations; in many cases, this number \nmay be lower than the maximum number of weapons that could be \nphysically loaded on the aircraft using all available attachment \npoints. In addition, each party may reorient 100 of its heavy bombers \nto a conventional role; these bombers were never accountable under the \nSTART I Treaty as heavy bombers equipped for long-range nuclear ALCM's. \nSuch bombers would not count toward START II warhead ceilings, but \nwould continue to count against the START I Treaty limits.\n  Each party may, on a one-time basis, return such bombers back to a \nnuclear role, if it wishes. If some, but not all, bombers within a \nspecific type or variant, under the START I Treaty, are reoriented to a \nconventional role, they must be given a difference observable by \nnational technical means from the bombers within that type or variant \nthat remain in a nuclear role. Likewise, if a bomber that has been \nreoriented to a conventional role is subsequently returned to a nuclear \nrole, it must receive an observable difference from other heavy bombers \nof the same type and variant.\n  The START I Treaty provisions will be used to verify the START II \nTreaty's limits, except as otherwise provided. The START II Treaty \nprovides for additional inspections to confirm the elimination of heavy \nICBM's and \n\n[[Page S19190]]\ntheir launch canisters, as well as additional inspections to confirm \nthe conversions of heavy ICBM silo launchers. In addition, the START II \nTreaty provides for exhibitions and inspections to observe the number \nof nuclear weapons for which heavy bombers are actually equipped and \ntheir relevant observable differences.\n  The START II Treaty requires the elimination or conversion of \nlaunchers of deployed ICBM's with multiple warheads. To reinforce this \nlimitation, the acquisition of such weapons from another state is \nprohibited after the second phase of reductions. After that date, the \nSTART II Treaty also prohibits the production, flight-testing--except \nfrom space launch facilities--or deployment of ICBM's to which more \nthan one warhead is attributed. The parties are obligated under the \ntreaty not to produce, flight-test, or deploy an ICBM or SLBM with more \nwarheads than it has been attributed under the START II Treaty. Also, \nthe parties are obligated not to transfer heavy ICBM's to any other \nstate, including any other party to the START I Treaty. The START II \nTreaty provides that this last prohibition is to be applied \nprovisionally from the date of signature of the START II Treaty. This \nhas no effect on the United States since there are no U.S. heavy \nICBM's.\n  To provide a forum for discussion of implementation of the START II \nTreaty, the treaty establishes the bilateral implementation commission \n[BIC]. Through the BIC, the parties can resolve questions of compliance \nand agree upon additional measures to improve the viability and \neffectiveness of the treaty.\n\n  The START II Treaty will enter into force upon the exchange of \ninstruments or ratification by the parties. However, since the START II \nTreaty is built upon the START I Treaty, it could not have entered into \nforce prior to the START I Treaty's entry into force in December 1994. \nIt will remain in force as long as the START I Treaty remains in force.\n  The START II Treaty consists of the main treaty text and three \ndocuments which are integral parts thereof:\n\n       The Protocol on Procedures Governing Elimination of Heavy \n     ICBM's and on Procedures Governing Conversion of Silo \n     Launchers of Heavy ICBM's Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive \n     Arms--the Elimination and Conversion Protocol;\n       The Protocol on Exhibitions and Inspections of Heavy \n     Bombers Relating to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms--the Exhibitions and \n     Inspections Protocol; and\n       The Memorandum of Understanding on Warhead Attribution and \n     Heavy Bomber Data Relating to the Treaty Between the United \n     States of America and the Russian Federation on Further \n     Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms--the \n     Memorandum on Attribution.\n\n  Also submitted to the Senate for its information are documents that \nare associated with, but not integral parts of, the START II Treaty. \nThese include three exchanges of letters by the sides addressing SS-18 \nmissiles on the territory of Kazakhstan, heavy bomber armaments, and \nheavy ICBM silo conversion. Although not submitted for the advice and \nconsent of the Senate to ratification, these documents are relevant to \nthe consideration of the START II Treaty.\n  The first exchange of letters relates to the negotiation of an \nagreement between Russia and Kazakhstan regarding SS-18 missiles and \nlaunchers on the territory of Kazakhstan. In his December 29, 1992, \nresponse to Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's commitment of December \n29, 1992, to spare no effort to conclude such an agreement, Secretary \nof State Eagleburger confirmed that the START II Treaty would be \nsubmitted to the United States Senate for its advice and consent on the \nunderstanding that the agreement referred to by Minister Kozyrev--\nproviding for the movement to Russia and elimination of heavy ICBM's \nfrom Kazakhstan--would be signed and implemented, and that, not later \nthan 7 years after entry into force of the START I Treaty, all deployed \nand nondeployed heavy ICBM's now located on the territory of Kazakhstan \nwill have been moved to Russia where they and their launch canisters \nwill have been destroyed.\n  The second exchange of letters of December 29, 1992, and December 31, \n1992, between Secretary of State Eagleburger and Russian Foreign \nMinister Kozyrev relates to heavy bombers, and constitutes the \nassurance of the United States, during the duration of the START II \nTreaty, never to have more nuclear weapons deployed on any heavy bomber \nthan the number specified in the memorandum on attribution for that \ntype or variant. This letter creates no new legal obligation for the \nUnited States but merely reiterates the obligation already assumed \nunder paragraph 3 of article IV of the START II Treaty.\n  The third exchange of letters of December 29, 1992, and January 3, \n1993, between Russian Minister of Defense Grachev and Secretary of \nDefense Cheney, sets forth a number of assurances on Russian intent \nregarding the conversion and retention of 90 silo launchers of RS-20--\nreferred to by the U.S. as SS-18--heavy ICBM's. In his letter, which is \npolitically binding on Russia, Minister Grachev reaffirms the steps \nthat Russia will take to convert these silos and assures the Secretary \nof Defense that missiles of the SS-25 type will be deployed in these \nconverted silos.\n  In January 1992, President Bush proposed to ban land-based MIRVed \nICBM's and to cap actual warheads at 4,700, while cutting U.S. Trident \nwarheads by one-third. President Yeltsin agreed with the ban, but \nwanted deeper cuts to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads. President Yeltsin \nconsidered the Bush proposal too inequitable because it cut the \nRussians where they were the strongest, the land-based MIRVed systems, \nwhile letting the U.S. retain its supremacy in bombers and submarines. \nIn addition, the Russians would lose considerable forces in \nBelarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The breakthrough came when the United \nStates agreed to reductions in its submarine-based ballistic missile \nwarheads. On June 17, 1992, Presidents Bush and Yeltsin signed a joint \nunderstanding in Washington that called for a treaty on deep cuts. The \njoint understanding paved the way for the conclusion of the START II \nTreaty.\n\n\n                ASSESSMENT OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF\n\n  The U.S. START II negotiating position was based on a Joint Chiefs of \nStaff assessment of how many and what kind of nuclear forces were \nnecessary to retain a credible deterrent force beyond the year 2003. \nThe logic at the time, and during the negotiations, was to reduce the \nnumbers of warheads but to preserve a balanced force--a mix of ICBM's, \nSLBM's, and bombers sufficient in size and capability to meet future \nU.S. deterrent requirements. It was the JCS view, that with the 3,500 \nwarheads allowed under this treaty, the United States would remain \ncapable of holding at risk a broad enough range of high value political \nand military targets to deter any rational adversary from launching a \nnuclear attack against the United States or against its allies.\n  In September 1994, the United States completed the nuclear posture \nreview [NPR]--an effort chartered to determine what roles its nuclear \nforces must meet to protect against future challenges to U.S. national \nsecurity interests. The NPR assumed the post-START II nuclear force \nlevels and its analysis reconfirmed the calculations that were done \nbefore and during the negotiations for START II. The review reaffirmed \nboth that the United States must maintain a viable nuclear deterrent in \nthe post-cold war world and that 3,500 warheads will be sufficient to \nhold at risk those assets which any foreseeable enemy would most \nvalue--the core determinant of effective deterrence.\n  More specifically, the JCS concluded that the START II/NPR force is \nsufficient to prevent any foreseeable enemy from achieving his war aims \nagainst the United States or its allies, no matter how a nuclear attack \nagainst the United States is designed. In practice, this means that \nU.S. nuclear forces must be robust enough to sustain the ability to \nsupport an appropriate targeting strategy and a suitable range of \nresponse options, even in the event of a powerful first strike that \nattempts to disarm U.S. nuclear forces. The JCS analysis shows that, \neven under the worst conditions, the START II force levels provide \nenough survivable \n\n[[Page S19191]]\nforces, and survivable, sustained command and control to accomplish \nU.S. targeting objectives.\n  This force will consist of 14 Trident submarines equipped with the D-\n5 missile system, 66 B-52 bombers, 20 B-2 bombers, and 450-500 \nMinuteman III missiles. When the START II reductions are completed, \nUnited States strategic forces will be roughly equivalent to those of \nRussia and will be sufficient to meet our deterrent requirements.\n\n\n                            Crisis Stability\n\n  The START II Treaty builds upon the accomplishments of START I by \nfurther reducing strategic arms in a way that increases crisis \nstability. START II does this by eliminating the most destabilizing \nnuclear weapons--land based MIRVed ICBM's and heavy ICBM's.\n  In the past, with MIRVed ICBM's a significant part of the forces of \nboth sides, there was much greater incentive to shoot first during a \ncrisis. The inherent vulnerability of land-based missiles to a first \nstrike, compounded by the consideration of losing the multiple warheads \non MIRVed missiles, argued for launching these weapons before they \ncould be disabled by an enemy strike. Thus, according to the JCS \nanalysis, eliminating this entire category of nuclear weapons relieves \nthe incentive to launch first, adding greatly to crisis stability. \nSTART II also eliminates the last of the heavy ICBM's--the remaining \nRussian SS-18's--which are hostage to the same logic and are therefore \nequally destabilizing in a crisis.\n  In addition to eliminating these two kinds of systems, the JCS \nconcluded that the restructuring of the U.S. triad made under the terms \nof this treaty will improve stability in its own right. The U.S. START \nII ICBM leg will be a less attractive target than has been the case in \nthe past. All remaining ICBM's will have single warheads; making them \nless valuable targets than MIRVed missiles. But, in addition, the \ncombined calculus of rough equivalency in overall warheads between the \nUnited States and Russia, and the fact that all remaining ICBM's will \nbe equipped with single warheads, will make it highly unlikely that \nRussia will consider launching an effective first strike to disarm \nUnited States ICBM's. According to the JCS analysis, under the warhead \ncalculus of this treaty, to achieve the levels of confidence needed to \ndisarm this one leg of the United States triad would require such a \nhigh proportion of Russia's overall warheads that this course would \nleave the attacker at a serious disadvantage. By any rational \ncalculation, the costs would greatly outweigh any potential gains. The \nsecond leg of the U.S. triad will consist of SLBM's, which have long \nbeen, and will remain the most secure and survivable part of the U.S. \nnuclear force. The third leg will be manned bombers, which have the \ninherent advantage that they can be recalled up to the last minute. The \nJCS concluded that in combination, these systems provide a redundant \nmix of mutually supporting capabilities--in short, a viable, effective \ntriad that provides stability during a crisis. This improved crisis \nstability, even as the United States maintains an effective deterrent \nthat is militarily sufficient, is the hallmark of the START II Treaty--\nit is, in fact, an even more noteworthy goal than the warhead \nreductions themselves.\n\n\n               Verification and Methods of Restructuring\n\n  The third element of the treaty that the JCS analyzed is compliance \nverification. The JCS analyzed the verification procedures from two \nstandpoints: do the verification procedures offer the United States \nconfidence that it can effectively verify compliance and detect \nsignificant violations of the treaty; and do the verification \nprocedures provide adequate safeguards for protecting U.S. national \nsecurity against unnecessary or unwarranted intrusion.\n  START II builds upon the interlocking and mutually reinforcing \nverification provisions established in START I. Unless otherwise \nspecified, the counting rules, notifications, verification, conversion, \nand elimination procedures from START I are used for START II. The \nbreakup of the former Soviet Union has not undermined the confidence of \nthe members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in these procedures. In fact, \nthe increased openness of Russian society, and the capabilities of \nAmerica's own national technical means [NTM] are additional factors \nthat add to JCS confidence in the United States ability to effectively \nverify. The JCS believe that the verification procedures are adequate \nto ensure that the United States will be able to detect any significant \nviolations. Conversely, the JCS also believes that the verification \nprovisions are sufficiently restrictive to protect the United States \nagainst unnecessary intrusion.\n\n\n                    Reductions through Restructuring\n\n  One notable aspect of the treaty is that it breaks new ground by \npermitting both Russia and the United States to achieve the stipulated \nnuclear reductions by restructuring their current forces. This is an \nimprovement over START I because it allows the parties to reduce their \nforces more cost effectively and quickly through a combination of \nhardware elimination, conversions, and downloading. The key to making \nthis restructuring possible is the inclusion of some specially designed \nverification procedures that will allow the United States to monitor \nand check compliance.\n\n\n                              Downloading\n\n  The START II Treaty differs from START I in its provisions for \nreducing nuclear warheads by downloading. In START I, either side could \nremove up to four warheads from a missile, but could only get credit \nfor the reduced warhead number if the warhead mounting platform was \ndestroyed and replaced--an expensive option. There was also a limit on \nthe aggregate number of downloaded warheads permitted for each party. \nSTART II encourages each side to take greater advantage of downloading. \nFor economic reasons, and at United States insistence the warhead \nmounting platforms do not have to be destroyed under START II. The \nadvantage for the United States is that this permits Trident sea-based \nmissiles to be downloaded cost effectively without the need to replace \nall of their mounting platforms. The treaty also goes beyond the START \nI limit of only crediting the downloading of up to 4 warheads per \nmissile, as it permits the downloading of 5 warheads from each of 105 \nRussian SS-19 ICBM's as these missiles are converted to a single \nwarhead configuration. When both parties are done downloading, all \nremaining missiles will have a single warhead. However, these \ndownloading procedures will not be applied to Russia's SS-18 force \nbecause all SS-18's will be completely eliminated under START II.\n  United States confidence in the actual warhead numbers deployed on \nfuture ICBM's will be based on existing provisions for reentry vehicle \nonsite inspections [RVOSI], coupled with national technical means \n[NTM]. The JCS is confident that the combination of RVOSI and United \nStates NTM will provide the means to detect any significant violations \nshould the Russians at some time in the future attempt to return their \nmissiles to a MIRVed configuration.\n\n\n                            Silo Conversion\n\n  The treaty also permits the Russians to convert 90 of their SS-18 \nsilo launchers into launchers for SS-25 single warhead ICBM's. The \nRussians agreed to convert the silos under procedures that preclude \ntheir later use for SS-18's. The procedures for conversion are \nspecifically designed to be both time consuming and difficult to \nreverse. Once the conversions are completed, any attempt to reconvert \nthe silos back to a configuration capable of housing heavy ICBM's would \nbe readily detected by visual inspections and U.S. NTM. To verify these \nsilo conversions, the Russians agreed to more extensive verification \nprocedures that the START I Treaty allowed. Additionally, they agreed \nto destroy the SS-18's themselves, including those in Kazakhstan as \nthey are returned to Russia. U.S. inspectors will get to observe both \nthe silo conversion procedures and the missile eliminations.\n\n\n                              Heavy Bomber\n\n  The third provision for restructuring is delineated in the details \nfor heavy bomber counting and conversion. Under the terms of the \ntreaty, the number of warheads attributed to heavy bombers with nuclear \nroles, including those equipped with long-range nuclear air-launched \ncruise missiles [ALCMs], will be determined by totaling the number of \nnuclear weapons with which each type of bomber can be \n\n[[Page S19192]]\n\nequipped. To make this counting determination, each side will have to \ndemonstrate to the other side the nuclear weapons configuration of each \ntype of bomber that is designated to retain a nuclear mission. In \naddition, the United States obtained Russian agreement that up to 100 \nheavy bombers never attributed with long-range nuclear ALCM's may be \nreoriented to conventional missions without having to undergo the \nconversion procedures that applied under START I. These reoriented \nheavy bombers will not be counted under the warhead limits of the START \nII Treaty nor will they be deemed part of the United States nuclear \nforce under START II and can be used for nonnuclear, conventional \nmissions only. As defined by the treaty, the reoriented bombers will \nhave to be based separately from heavy bombers with nuclear roles; they \nwill be used only for nonnuclear missions; they will not be used in \nexercises for nuclear missions; and their aircrews will not train or \nexercise for nuclear missions. Currently, the United States plans to \nreorient its B-1's to a conventional role using these START II \nprocedures.\n\n\n                      Force Structure Implications\n\n  START II will require the United States to eliminate its Peacekeeper-\nMX MIRVed ICBM force. However, the treaty will not require the United \nStates to eliminate any Minuteman MIRVed ICBM's, because they may be \ndownloaded from three warheads to one warhead in accordance with \narticle III. Similarly, the United States will not have to eliminate \nany Trident submarines or SLBM's that could have been deployed under \nSTART I. Once again, reduction of SLBM warheads may be accomplished by \ndownloading. On the other hand, START II will cause substantial changes \nin the U.S. heavy bomber force. The executive branch concluded in its \nrecent nuclear posture review that all B-1B's would be reoriented to a \nconventional role. In addition, B-52 bombers may be equipped with \neither 8 or 12 air-launched cruise missiles, rather than the current 20 \ncruise missiles.\n  Russian strategic forces will be dramatically affected under the \nSTART II Treaty. Russia will have to eliminate approximately 250 \nstrategic ballistic missiles carrying 2,500 warheads. Much of these \nreductions will be achieved by the total elimination of the SS-18 \nMIRVed heavy ICBM force--the most potent hard-target kill-capable force \nin the Russian strategic arsenal. Furthermore, because of the MIRV ban \nand the limitations on downloading, Russia will also have to eliminate \nits capable and mobile SS-24 ICBM force--the Russian equivalent of the \nMX.\n  The JCS has testified that the START II Treaty offers a significant \ncontribution to U.S. national security. Under its provisions, the \nUnited States achieves the longstanding goal of eliminating both heavy \nICBM's and the practice of MIRVing ICBM's, thereby significantly \nreducing the incentive for a first strike.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have carefully assessed the adequacy of \nU.S. strategic forces under START II, and have testified that, with the \nbalanced triad of 3,500 warheads that will remain once this treaty is \nimplemented, the size and mix of the remaining U.S. nuclear forces will \nsupport the deterrent and targeting requirements against any known \nadversary and under the worst assumptions. Both American and Russian \nstrategic nuclear forces will be suspended at levels of rough \nequivalence; a balance with greatly reduced incentive for a first \nstrike. The JCS stated that, by every military measure, START II is a \nsound agreement that will make our Nation more secure. Under its terms, \nU.S. forces will remain militarily sufficient, crisis stability will be \ngreatly improved, and the United States can be confident in the ability \nto effectively verify its implementation. This treaty is clearly in the \nbest interests of the United States.\n\n\n                      VERIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE\n\n  The bottom line of the intelligence community's assessment about the \nprospects for monitoring the START II Treaty is that they will be able \nto monitor many--and the most significant--provisions of START II with \nhigh confidence. In some areas, though, they will have some \nuncertainty.\n  The intelligence community was deeply involved in the senior-level \ninteragency process that led to the development of U.S. positions \nduring the START II negotiations. The intelligence community helped \ndesign specific Treaty provisions that were included in the treaty to \ncomplement U.S. monitoring capabilities and thereby inhibit cheating. \nInformation resulting from these provisions interacts synergistically \nwith data from U.S. national intelligence means to enhance monitoring \ncapabilities. For instance, the procedures for converting SS-18 silos \nfor use by smaller, single warhead missiles make undetected \nreconversion to SS-18 launchers virtually impossible. The process would \nbe time consuming, difficult, expensive, and easily observed. Moreover, \nonsite inspections permit the United States to visit a sample of silos \nof its choosing.\n\n\n                    Ratification and Implementation\n\n  The steps Russia has taken toward implementing the deep reductions of \nthe START I Treaty are significant. Since the Senate last considered \nthe START II Treaty in 1993, Russia and Ukraine have largely been able \nto bridge their differences over the control and ultimate disposition \nof the strategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Moreover, Belarus, \nKazakhstan, and Ukraine have ratified START I and acceded to the \nnonproliferation treaty as nonnuclear states, setting the stage for \nSTART I entry into force on December 5, 1994. Russia is well on the way \nto meeting the reductions of START I and significant progress has been \nmade in deactivating missiles in Ukraine and Kazakhstan and \nconsolidating strategic nuclear weapons on Russian territory. Russia \nalso has completed the destruction of substantial numbers of launchers \nfor older missiles, well in advance of the reduction required by START \nI.\n\n\n                 Monitoring Tasks: General Conclusions\n\n  Under START II the intelligence community will be expected to monitor \nthe activities associated with the reduction of Russian strategic \noffensive nuclear forces through January 1, 2003, as well as Russia's \nsubsequent adherence to the numerical limits in the treaty. These tasks \nwill be in addition to the requirements to monitor activities relative \nto qualitative restrictions on the technical characteristics and \ncapabilities of the weapon systems involved, and location restrictions \ncontained in the START I Treaty. Finally, the intelligence community is \ncharged to detect and correctly interpret any activities that are \nprohibited by either treaty.\n\n  Specific new monitoring tasks under START II include the requirements \nto:\n  Monitor warhead reductions to between 3,000 and 3,500, including a \n1,700 and 1,750 sublimit on SLBM warheads.\n  Monitor the ban on production, flight-testing, acquisition, and \ndeployment of MIRVed ICBM's after January 1, 2003.\n  Monitor the conversion of up to 90 SS-18 silos for smaller, SS-25-\ntype single-warhead ICBM's.\n  Monitor the elimination of the remaining SS-18 heavy ICBM silos, and \nof all SS-18 missiles and canisters.\n  Monitor up to 105 SS-19 ICBM's that are downloaded to carry only a \nsingle warhead.\n  Monitor the number of nuclear weapons with which Russian heavy \nbombers are actually equipped.\n  Determine that heavy bombers reoriented for conventional roles do not \ncarry nuclear weapons or train for nuclear missions.\n\n\n                          Monitoring Judgments\n\n  The intelligence community's monitoring judgments are based on three \ndecades of experience collecting against and analyzing Soviet strategic \nforces as well as in monitoring other arms control agreements. More \nspecifically, the monitoring judgments are based on:\n  Analyses of testing, production, deployment, and operational \npractices as well as engineering assessments of strategic weapon \nsystems characteristics.\n  The strengths and weaknesses of current and programmed collection \nsystems.\n  The potential contribution of verification measures contained in the \ntwo START treaties.\n  With regard to monitoring specific limitations in the START II \nTreaty, the intelligence community's confidence will be highest when \nmonitoring the mandated restrictions, including the elimination of SS-\n18 ICBM's, as well as accounting for the number of deployed strategic \nweapons systems--single-warhead ICBM's, submarine- \n\n[[Page S19193]]\n\nlaunched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers--that remain in the \nforce.\n  As all MIRVed ICBM systems are eliminated, the intelligence community \nexpects the single-warhead SS-25 road-mobile force to expand and a \nsilo-based variant of this missile to be deployed. With the help of \nnotification requirements, the intelligence community believes it will \nbe able to track the growth of this force.\n  The intelligence community will be able to monitor the ban on MIRVed \nICBM's after 2003 both by tracking the elimination of launchers for \nMIRVed ICBM's and by analyzing the data from flight tests of new \nmissiles.\n  Since the START I Treaty was signed, Russia and the United States \nhave demonstrated telemetry tapes, as called for by the treaty, and \ninstalled telemetry playback equipment on each other's territory. With \nSTART I entry into force, the intelligence community is now receiving \ntelemetry tapes and associated interpretive data as required under \ntreaty provisions.\n  Based on the information and equipment provided by Russia, \nintelligence community experts have high confidence that the agreed \nprocedures will enable them to process, interpret, and analyze data \ncontained in the Russian tapes.\n  For some START II monitoring tasks the intelligence community's \nuncertainties will be greater. As it stated in 1992, during the START I \nratification hearings, monitoring missile production activity is more \ndifficult than monitoring reductions and deployed forces.\n  At facilities where continuous portal perimeter monitoring is \nconducted, the uncertainties in monitoring future production will be \nlow.\n  Estimates of missile production at facilities not subject to \ncontinuous monitoring or onsite inspection, however, will continue to \nbe more uncertain.\n  An outgrowth of the historical difficulty in monitoring missile \nproduction is that estimates of the nondeployed missile inventory are \nless certain. Nevertheless, the intelligence community stands by the \njudgment it made in 1992: It does not believe the Russians have \nmaintained a large-scale program to store several hundred or more \nundeclared, nondeployed strategic ballistic missiles. It acknowledges, \nhowever, that it is possible that some undeclared missiles have been \nstored at unidentified facilities.\n\n\n                       The Potential for Cheating\n\n  With regard to detecting and correctly interpreting prohibited \nactivity, the intelligence community examined nearly 40 cheating \nscenarios in 1991 when analyzing their ability to monitor START I. In \nlight of START II limitations and bans, they examined additional \nscenarios. In both cases the intelligence community sought to devise \nscenarios that theoretically would be the most feasible and potentially \ninteresting to the Russians as well as most challenging to United \nStates intelligence capabilities. They consulted with the Office of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and other experts to make certain that they had \nincluded those scenarios that would have the most military significance \nto our strategic military planners.\n  The cheating scenarios that continue to be the most potentially \ntroublesome are those that would involve the covert production and \nstorage of mobile missiles and their launchers. START II has neither \nincreased nor reduced these concerns.\n\n  The intelligence community continues to doubt that Russia will be \nable to initiate and successfully execute a significant cheating \nprogram. This confidence is due to United States national technical \nmeans, verification provisions in the treaty, and to some extent, the \nincreased difficulty of keeping Russian Government activities secret.\n  Although an effort to hide a small number of weapon systems would be \nalmost impossible to detect, the intelligence community judges that it \nwould also be of little interest or value to Russia.\n\n\n                Treaty Provisions to Enhance Monitoring\n\n  Although open-source information is now more abundant and relevant \nthan in the past and the intelligence community has an impressive array \nof technical collection systems, it was clear during the negotiations \nof both START treaties that they would encounter significant \nuncertainties in monitoring some provisions if they had to rely only on \nnational intelligence means. All START I provisions designed to enhance \nverification, including those that guarantee access to telemetry data \nfrom ballistic missile flight tests, will continue to apply under START \nII. In addition, START II provides for supplementary onsite inspections \nthat will aid United States ability to monitor its unique provisions.\n  The value of these treaty provisions for monitoring varies, depending \non the task. In some cases provisions--particularly those for onsite \ninspections--provide unique opportunities for directly monitoring \ntreaty-required activities. In other cases the Russians provide \ndetailed information on their forces so that the intelligence community \nneed only find an individual discrepancy to identify an ambiguous, or \nperhaps illegal situation. In any case, onsite inspections, \nnotifications, and regular data exchanges will facilitate our ability \nto optimize the employment of intelligence collection systems.\n  In addition to the START I Treaty's 13 types of inspections, START \nII's new onsite inspection provisions would assist in monitoring \nspecific activities:\n\n       The intelligence community would have the right to observe \n     the elimination of all declared SS-18 missile airframes that \n     are not eliminated through launches, as well as all \n     associated launch canisters.\n       The intelligence community would have the right to confirm \n     by direct measurement that 5 meters of concrete have been \n     poured into converted SS-18 silos, as well as to observe the \n     entire process of concrete pouring, and to measure the inner \n     diameter of the restrictive ring installed in the upper \n     portion of each silo.\n       The intelligence community would have the right to conduct \n     four additional RV inspections per year at converted SS-18 \n     silos to confirm the single-RV load of the SS-25-type \n     missile, observe the upper portion of its canister for \n     identification purposes, and confirm the continued presence \n     of the restrictive ring.\n       During special heavy bomber exhibitions and all short-\n     notice inspections of heavy bombers after the START I \n     baseline period, the intelligence community would have the \n     right to inspect the interiors of weapons bays and external \n     weapons attachment points.\n\n  As the intelligence community stated during the START I hearings, for \nsome monitoring tasks it will continue to rely most heavily on \ninformation acquired from their independent technical sensors. For \nexample, neither START treaty requires the exchange of telemetry tapes \nfrom the flight tests of bombers and cruise missiles, nor do they \nprohibit the encryption of such test data. Moreover, START provisions \nwill provide little assistance in detecting prohibited activity at \nlocations the Russians do not declare.\n\n\n  Verification Concepts, Capabilities, and Concerns for Major Treaty \n                                Elements\n\n  Verification of START II will be based largely upon the capabilities \nand provisions designed to verify START I, and generally reflect the \nsame assumptions and considerations. The two central elements of START \nII are the elimination of MIRVed ICBM's--including all heavy ICBM's--by \nthe year 2003, and deeper reductions in the same basic categories of \nstrategic offensive arms as START I. Accordingly, the conceptual basis \nfor verification of START II is the same as that for START I. The same \ncapabilities and measures that provide for effective verification of \nSTART I limits on launchers, missiles, and attributable warheads will \nbe effective in verifying the lower aggregate limits in START II.\n\n\n           THE STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING FOR START II\n\n  The START I Treaty entered into force on December 5, 1994. The \nDepartment of Defense was ready for entry into force and has been able \nto implement and comply with the extensive START I Treaty. The Military \nServices and Defense Agencies which must implement START II are getting \ninvaluable experience right now in implementing the even more complex \nSTART I Treaty.\n  Planning for START II Treaty implementation within the Department of \nDefense began prior to the signature of the treaty in order to ensure \nthat the United States will be in compliance at entry into force. In \nNovember 1992, the USD(A) issued DOD guidance which directed all \nMilitary Services and Defense Agencies to begin planning for START II \nand assigned specific START II implementation guidance with DOD's \noverall approach to implementation planning--centralized oversight and \ndecentralized execution--which \n\n[[Page S19194]]\n\nproved so successful and cost effective during implementation of the \nINF Treaty. The Department of Defense is in the process of updating \nthis guidance to the Military Services and Defense Agencies.\n  Because of the inherent relationships between START I and START II, \nthe DOD START I implementation working group [SIWG] will be used to \naddress implementation issues for START II. The SIWG consists of \nrepresentatives of the Military Services and Defense Agencies. The \nSIWG, which first met in August of 1991, meets monthly to review the \nstatus of preparations within each Military Service and Defense Agency \nto issue planning guidance, assign additional responsibilities, conduct \nreviews, and resolve questions which may arise during planning for, and \nactual implementation of, START I and START II. To date, no major \nissues for START II have been identified which would impact United \nStates ability to successfully implement the treaty.\n  In addition, the mechanisms for ensuring long-term compliance within \nthe Department of Defense will be similar to those used to ensure DOD \ncompliance with other arms control treaties. Specifically, the START I \nDOD compliance review group [CRG] will also be the forum for resolving \nany START II DOD compliance issues. The CRG is composed of \nrepresentatives of the USD(A), the Under Secretary for Policy \n[USD(P)], the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] and the DOD General Counsel. \nThe CRG meets as required to ensure DOD compliance with START I and, \npending entry into force, START II Treaty compliance.\n\n\n                POTENTIAL START II IMPLEMENTATION COSTS\n\n  DOD has provided some preliminary estimates of the cost of START II \nimplementation. The following assumptions were used in developing these \nestimated implementation costs: The United States will draw down to the \naggregate limit of no more than 3,500 warheads by January 1, 2003. This \nreduction will include the elimination of all Peacekeeper launchers. \nThe costs associated with reducing the number of SLBM warheads assumes \nthat the United States will retain 14 Trident submarines but download \neach deployed SLBM to 5 reentry vehicles. The assumptions are based on \nthe results of the nuclear posture review [NPR] and do not reflect NPR \nprogrammatic costs.\n  These estimates also assume that the United States will exercise all \nof the START II onsite inspection rights, including those for the \nelimination of all SS-18 missiles and their launch canisters, the \nconversion of 90 SS-18 silos and the four additional reentry vehicle \nonsite inspections [RVSOI] allowed annually at converted SS-18 silos. \nHeavy bomber inspection and protection are included in these figures.\n  A preliminary estimate for START II shows that the total costs could \namount to approximately $201.9 million between 1995 and the end of the \nsecond treaty reduction phase in 2003. These costs break down as \nfollows:\n\nElimination of MIRVed ICBMs.....................................    42.5\nReduction of deployed SLBM warheads.............................   110.0\nICBM launcher elimination.......................................    14.5\nBomber exhibitions..............................................     1.3\nData reporting..................................................     2.0\nBomber conversion...............................................    10.5\nVerification of SS-18 silo conversion...........................    12.6\nVerification of missile and launch canister elimination.........     2.8\nVerification of rail-mobile ICBM launcher elimination...........     2.9\nAdditional reentry vehicle inspectors...........................     2.8\n                                                                 -------\n                                                                        \n    Total.......................................................   201.9\n                                                                        \n\n  The figures show that the total estimated cost of United States \ncompliance activities will be approximately $180.8 million with the \nmajority of that--about 61 percent--to be dedicated to deployed SLBM \nwarhead reductions. Total START II Treaty verification costs are \napproximately $21.1 million, with the verification of silo conversions \nrepresenting about 60 percent of that total estimate.\n  It is important to contrast these relatively small, 8-year costs for \nSTART II with the START I implementation costs for just fiscal year \n1994 and fiscal year 1995. For this period, the Department of Defense \nbudgeted approximately $180 million for the implementation of the START \nI Treaty. This investment is paying off because START I preparations \nformed the basis for START II requirements and will allow the even \ndeeper reductions at a relatively moderate cost.\n  Two additional inspection and security issues are worthy of mention. \nFirst, START II does not add any new inspectable facilities in the \nUnited States--although the portion of Whiteman AFB where B-2s are \nbeing deployed will be subject to inspection under START II only. This \nwill help minimize costs and security concerns. Second, U.S. heavy \nbombers, particularly the B-2, will be subject to more intrusive \nexhibitions and inspections than under the START I Treaty. The START II \nTreaty requires inspections to verify that heavy bombers are not \nactually equipped for more nuclear weapons than declared but also \nallows portions of the heavy bomber not related to making this \ndetermination to be shrouded, covered. The U.S. Air Force is developing \nan inspection implementation plan that will ensure protection of \nsensitive-classified information during the inspection-exhibition but \nwhich also will ensure that our treaty obligations are met. The \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for C3I is responsible for providing \nsecurity policy guidance to the DOD components.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  In conclusion, the START II Treaty is the result of a bipartisan \neffort. Negotiated by a Republican administration and submitted by a \ndemocratic one. Three Secretaries of State and Defense have supported \nit. START II represents a substantial step forward in attempting to \ncodify strategic stability at greatly reduced levels of armaments. \nFinal reductions must be completed by January 1, 2003--namely, to \nlevels of 3,000 to 3,500 total warheads, 1,750 of those based on \nsubmarines. It was the Joint Chiefs of Staff view, that with the 3,500 \nwarheads allowed under this treaty, the United States would remain \ncapable of holding at risk a broad enough range of high value political \nand military targets to deter any rational adversary from launching a \nnuclear attack against the United States or against its allies. START \nII removes the most destabilizing segment of nuclear inventories, \nnamely MIRV warheads and heavy ICBM's. Elimination also includes all \ndeployed heavy ICBM silos and all test and training launchers. The \nJoint Chiefs of Staff believe that the verification procedures are \nadequate to ensure that the United States will be able to detect any \nsignificant violations. Conversely, the Joint Chiefs of Staff also \nbelieve that the verification provisions are sufficiently restrictive \nto protect the United States against unnecessary intrusion. It is my \nbelief that on balance the START II Treaty is in the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to consent to its ratification, subject to the \nconditions and declaration contained in the modified resolution of \nratification.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I support ratification of the START II \nTreaty because it will serve America's national security interests in \nat least three critical respects. First, when fully implemented, START \nII will ban the deployment of all intercontinental ballistic missiles \nwith more than one warhead--traditionally these missiles have been the \nmainstay of Russia's nuclear forces. Second, this treaty rectifies a \ndangerous deficiency of the START I Treaty by completely eliminating \nall of Russia's heavy ICBM's. Third, START II creates a managed process \nfor nuclear arms reductions. While no one will deny that much of \nRussia's motivation to engage in deeper cuts stems from its economic \nwoes, I cannot in good conscience rely solely upon economic forces for \nreassurance that Russia's nuclear arms reductions will be undertaken in \na sustained or stabilizing fashion.\n  START II ensures that Russia will eliminate those weapons of greatest \nconcern to the United States, leaving nothing to chance.\n  Now of course, Mr. President, there is a quid pro quo for these \nbenefits. The effect of the START II Treaty for the United States will \nbe the elimination of our MX missile, significant reductions in our \nnuclear bomber fleet, and limits on the number of warheads we can \ndeploy on submarine launched ballistic missiles. However, these changes \ndo not fundamentally alter the deterrence value of our nuclear forces. \nIn \n\n[[Page S19195]]\n\nfact, reductions under START II will result in a more survivable U.S. \nforce structure than what we would have with just the START I Treaty.\n  Furthermore, START II preserves the triad of U.S. strategic offensive \nforces. We will continue to rely upon this combination of ICBM's, \nSLBM's, and heavy bombers to complicate any would-be aggressor's attack \nand to offer flexibility in any U.S. nuclear response. In fact, START \nII will improve the viability of the triad by eliminating those \nelements of the Russian force which directly threatened its integrity \nthroughout the cod war--namely all of its SS-18 heavy ICBM's and its \nnewer, mobile SS-24 ICBM's.\n  We should recall that in 1983, the Scowcroft Commission declared: \n``The Soviets now probably possess the necessary combination of ICBM \nnumbers, reliability, accuracy, and warhead yield to destroy almost all \nof the 1,047 U.S. ICBM silos, using only a portion of their own ICBM \nforce.'' One of the problems with the START I Treaty was that it did \nlittle to alleviate this concern. Although it reduced the number of \ndeployed SS-18's by one-half, it also reduced the number of U.S. silo-\nbased ICBM's by roughly half. Thus the ratio of SS-18 warheads to U.S. \nsilos remained virtually unchanged. START II fixes this problem.\n  Now I would be remiss not to mention several areas where I continue \nto have misgivings. For example, I am concerned that Russia--at some \npoint--might upload warheads on its SS-19 missiles, and that they might \ndeploy their bombers with more warheads than the treaty allows. I also \nam concerned over the inherent difficulty of tracking mobile missiles. \nYet even in the most serious cheating scenarios, Russia would be hard-\npressed to achieve a military significant advantage over the United \nStates.\n  However, we should not enter into this arrangement starry eyed. To \nthose who say Russian cheating is implausible, or that Russia lacks the \nmotivation to engage in such activities, I only need ask: ``What arms \ncontrol agreement have they not cheated on?'' If the Senate decides to \nratify START II, we must demand that Russia break with its lackluster \nrecord of treaty compliance. We should not agree to a new arms control \nmeasure while at the same time tolerating Russia's ongoing biological \nweapons program, its refusal to implement the bilateral destruction \nagreement for its chemical weapons program, its failure to comply with \nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, or its persistent \nviolation of the ABM Treaty. The burden of proof is upon Russia to \ndemonstrate that it is capable of breaking with the arms control \nlegacies of the cold war.\n  We also must realize the limitations of this arms control treaty. \nSTART II is bilateral in nature, and does not address the growing \nstrategic arsenals of other countries such as China. Neither have we \nheard hide nor hair from this administration regarding United States-\nRussia cooperation on ballistic missile defenses as a stabilizing \ncomplement to the well-structured reductions under START II. I \ntherefore will resist any further efforts to reduce U.S. strategic \nnuclear arms to the point where the equilibrium between our strategic \ncapability and our targeting requirements is disrupted, or to the point \nwhere the coherency of any leg of the U.S. nuclear triad is threatened.\n  Finally, I am concerned over the reckless abandon with which this \nadministration raced to fully implement the START Treaty before it even \nhad entered into force. That exuberance created a serious imbalance in \nthe sizes of the United States and Russian nuclear arsenals. Given the \ndeep levels of reductions contemplated under START II, we must proceed \nvery cautiously with implementation.\n  That said, even with these concerns, START II will enhance \nsignificantly our national security. The resolution of ratification \ntransmitted to the Senate from the Foreign Relations Committee contains \nsix conditions and seven declarations that go to the heart of the \nissues I have mentioned here. And even in the event of serious Russian \nnoncompliance, the United States will retain a mix of survivable \nnuclear forces more than sufficient to deter Russia. For all of these \nreasons, Mr. President, I reiterate my support for ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the distinguished \nacting chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee a question or two.\n  As you know, the group working with Senator Stevens--and I am part of \nthat group--has proposed certain amendments. I want to ask first, \nprocedurally, at what time during the course of our deliberations does \nthe Senate take up those amendments?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to answer the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia that after the opening statements by the managers \nand others, then the resolution of ratification that came from the \nForeign Relations Committee will be the pending business, and \namendments will be in order at that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. I thank the distinguished Senator, Mr. President, \nbecause I have worked with Senator Stevens and others, and the acting \nchairman recounted those Senators who have been a part of that.\n  I think it is very important that those amendments be included in \nthis treaty, and, frankly, I think it is wise that we are trying to act \ntoday so that those amendments and the treaty itself may once again be \nthe subject of public comment until such time as we have the \nopportunity to vote on final passage.\n  I wish to, Mr. President, commend Senator Stevens for leading this \ngroup. I just inquired, I say to my colleague from Alaska, about the \ntiming of his presentation which I anticipate.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments and his question. I simply indicate that I share his \nenthusiasm for the package of amendments.\n  Senator Stevens has been our leader on the arms control observation \ngroup in which the distinguished Senator from Virginia and others have \nparticipated, and it will be my hope that in the event there is no \ncontroversy surrounding those amendments, they might all be adopted as \na managers amendment. That would be the procedure that we hope to \nfollow. But as soon as the resolution of ratification is before us, \nthose amendments will be in order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I observe the \npresence on the floor of the distinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield in just a moment. \nI want to yield first to my distinguished colleague, Senator Pell, for \nhis opening statement.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I simply wanted to add a comment to what the \nSenator was speaking of. I just came from the room in which the staff \nhad put together the final language. Representatives of the \nadministration had signed off on it as well as the representatives from \nSenator Levin's office, and I signed off on it as well.\n  I anticipate that at the point when it is agreeable with all of the \nSenators, that it represents the final piece in the agreement. As far \nas I know, there has been agreement reached, in other words, on all of \nthose provisions.\n  I thank both Senator Lugar and Senator Stevens for their leadership \nin bringing this group together to allow the creation of these \nadditional declarations and one addition to be added for the treaty.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank especially the Senator from Arizona \nwho has had many concerns about the treaty and has expressed those in a \nvery articulate, constructive way. And his views, I believe, are \nrepresented substantially in the amendments that will be offered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19185-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19195-S19197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if I could ask the indulgence \nof the Members of the Senate. I know how important this legislation is, \nbut Senator Brown and I would ask unanimous consent that we be allowed \nto go to morning business for an extremely short period of time to \nintroduce legislation. We will make our statements part of the Record.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to go to morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S19196]]\n\n\n                          BOARD OF TEA EXPERTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will be extremely brief.\n  Earlier this year, on the agricultural appropriations bill, Senator \nReid and I offered legislation that would defund the Tea Tasting Board, \nand I offered an amendment that would eliminate the underlying \nlegislation that passed in 1879.\n  Literally, we spend a quarter million dollars a year of taxpayers' \nmoney on tasting tea, a practice that is designed to restrict \ncompetition.\n  Tragically, when that measure got to conference, the conferees were \nadvised that the Food and Drug Administration would lose their ability \nto stop poisonous substances coming into the country in the form of tea \nif we did not have a Tea Tasting Board. That information is incorrect. \nThe advice they gave the conferees is incorrect.\n  So we intend to, at the appropriate point when the continuing \nresolution comes forward, to offer an amendment that does what the \nSenate did earlier, and that is eliminate the Tea Tasting Board.\n  Mr. President, it is important because this is a clear waste and a \nclear obstruction of competition in this country. It is a drag upon our \nefficiency, and it is the signpost of the kind of changes we need to \nmake to get our country back on track.\n  That is the reason we think it is appropriate to offer it on the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 2 years ago I stood on this floor and \noffered an amendment to the 1993 Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  My efforts were successful and the measure passed. The intent of my \nmeasure was to eliminate the Board of Tea Experts. To my chagrin, in \nrecent months I discovered that the tea experts were still in business. \nIn mid-September of this year I returned to the floor with Senator \nBrown to once again eliminate the Tea Board and abolish the Tea Import \nAct. Well, here we are again. Why?, because it seems that the \nAgriculture appropriation conferees did not see their way clear and \nabolish the act.\n  That is why Senator Brown and I have returned to the floor to offer \nthis amendment calling for an end to the Tea Importation Act. Why, I \nhave been told that the Department of Agriculture informed the \nconference committee that the act was needed to ensure safe, healthy \ntea. What this program has is somewhat akin to the fictional creature, \nCount Dracula. I have come here with Senator Brown to once again \nattempt to rid this Government of this scourge. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record this article from the December 15 \nbusiness section of the Washington Post that clearly outlines this \nproblem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               (From the Washington Post, Feb. 15, 1995)\n\n             The FDA's Tea Party Lives On. And On. And On.\n\n                          (By Cindy Skrzycki)\n\n       The tempest in the teapot still brews. Despite the efforts \n     of Sens. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Hank Brown (R-Colo.) to \n     dump a government-sponsored tea-tasting program, last-minute \n     lobbying and legislative maneuvering has kept the Food and \n     Drug Administration in the business of fine tea and good \n     china.\n       Just when it looked like the FDA could wash its hands of \n     the 98-year-old Tea Importation Act and its Board of Tea \n     Experts, Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate \n     Agriculture Appropriations Committee, quietly decided to kill \n     the part of the Reid-Brown amendment that would have cut \n     FDA's involvement with the board.\n       The result is that the FDA, long-criticized for its tea-\n     tasting sessions, actually may have a more complicated role \n     to play as it figures out how to comply with the part of the \n     amendment that did pass.\n       As things now stand, the Tea Importation Act--which charges \n     the FDA with making sure imported tea meets a government-\n     endorsed standard of quality and purity--remains in force. \n     What changes is the FDA's involvement in setting the standard \n     since an FDA employee will no longer be allowed to sit on the \n     six-member Board of Tea Experts.\n       The problem is, the agency still has to figure out a way to \n     come up with the annual tea standard--without being \n     involved--so that its longtime employee (a man reknowned \n     for distinguishing fine tea from foul brews) can carry out \n     the day-to-day tasting of imported tea, making sure it \n     meets the standard.\n       Complicated? Yes, But, hey, this is the government.\n       So much for victory proclamation that Reid and Brown \n     happily offered in September when the Senate passed their \n     amendment. The conference on the legislation--and the \n     lobbying--wiped out Reid's wish ``to end this tea party.''\n       The tea leaves aren't clear on this, but the brew's lobby \n     apparently did a good job of preserving FDA's tea-tasting \n     role. The industry has maintained through numerous attempts \n     to abolish the board that it was necessary to have the \n     $200,000 government program to keep bad tea out of the \n     country.\n       Congress not long ago eliminated the board's modest travel \n     subsidies for its annual meeting at FDA offices in New York. \n     It also raised the tax on imported tea to pay for the \n     salaries of the FDA employees involved in setting the \n     standard and tasting the tea to make sure imports adhered to \n     the standard.\n       The current standard expires May 1, so the FDA has to come \n     up with a way to set a new measure. Like any good government \n     agency, it has convened a ``small working group'' to figure \n     this out.\n       Among the options the group is considering: disallowing tea \n     imports altogether, maintaining the current standard \n     indefinitely, turning the standard-setting over to some other \n     department within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. Or, the more likely scenario, proposing a standard \n     in the Federal Register and asking for comments on it.\n       ``You've now finding out what perpetual life is,'' said \n     Brown. ``It's such a disgrace.''\n       Anyone for tea?\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we do not have a coffee tasting board, why a \ntea testing board?\n  According to an FDA spokesman this Congress is sending mixed signals \nregarding tea tasting.\n  According to an FDA spokesman ``the law doesn't say we should not \nhave a tea taster at FDA.''\n  According to an article in the Review-Journal, the largest newspaper \nin Nevada, the Board of Tea Experts is funded by the tea industry. \nHowever, its members work closely with FDA chemist Robert H. Dick to \nset standards for imported tea.\n  Mr. Dick who has chaired the tea board for 56 years, is paid $68,000 \nper year. He also has two part-time assistants, all of whom are \ntaxpayer supported.\n  Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the \nAgriculture Appropriations Committee, has done a diservice to the \nAmerican people. It is no wonder the American people have lost faith in \ntheir government. I see no reason why those in this country who enjoy \ndrinking tea need someone else to tell them it tastes good. Once again \nI am back on the floor to complete the task that I originally set out \nto do.\n  Mr. President, once again let me give the Senate some background on \nthe Board of Tea Experts.\n  The Tea Expert Board was created as part of the Tea Import Act of \n1897. You heard me correctly, 1897, not 1987.\n  There are six outside experts and one from the Food and Drug \nAdministration [FDA] that comprise the Board. It is the Board of Tea \nExperts duty to set standards for imported tea. There is also others at \nthe FDA that also as part of their official duties, taste tea.\n  The cost of this program is approximately $200,000 per year; even \nthough there is an industry offset of approximately $70,000 per year.\n  Although, the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture appropriations bill \nwithholds funds to operate the Board of Tea Experts, it does not repeal \nthe act as the Senate unanimously agreed to do. Even so, the adventures \nof the Board of Tea Experts still cost the American taxpayer over \n$130,000 per year. That may not seem like much, but it is the kind of \nwaste that taxpayers detest.\n  We do not have a board of coffee experts, why then, do we need a \nBoard of Tea Experts. The Board of Tea Experts only serves industry. \nLet the industry serve itself, and pay for its own quality assurance \nout of its own pockets. It is not my intent to have the FDA to stop \ntesting imported agricultural products. These activities can continue \nwithout the Board of Tea Experts and without Mr. Dicks or the FDA's \ninvolvement.\n  As I have stated on the floor before, What we need is a congressional \ntea party. We must dump the Board of Tea Experts as well as the Tea \nImportation Act overboard.\n  It seems inappropriate, and some might say morally reprehensible, to \nexpend money from the Treasury for such a program.\n  How can this reform minded Congress allow the Tea Importation Act to \ncontinue? \n\n[[Page S19197]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of House Joint \nResolution 134, the continuing resolution with respect to the veterans, \nand that it be in order for me to amend the joint resolution to also \ninclude funding for AFDC, District of Columbia Government, foster care, \nadoption assistance, and Medicaid quarterly payments, all of which \nwould expire January 3, 1996, that the amendment be agreed to, the \njoint resolution be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I cannot go \nalong with that without an opportunity to offer an amendment with \nregard to the Tea Tasting Board.\n  So I object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from Colorado to \nwithhold his objection so we can at least discuss this a moment?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am glad to reserve my right to object. That would allow \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to his objection, first I \nwant to commend the Senator from Colorado for the work he has done in \nthis area, and Senator Reid from Nevada who has been working in this \narea. I am very sympathetic to what they are trying to do.\n  I know they are looking for an opportunity to do this on any vehicle \nthat might be available, and I certainly understand that. But let me \nagain emphasize that we are in a particularly difficult spot here.\n  The majority leader and the minority leader are now meeting with the \nPresident at the White House. They are working on the budget agreement. \nAnd it is very important that the UC be worked out with the House of \nRepresentatives, which is very anxiously waiting for this matter to \ncome over to them.\n  The former chairman of Veterans' Affairs Committee and some of the \nveterans committee members just came over and are very anxious for us \nto get this work done and sent back over. This agreement was worked out \nbetween the leaders, all of the interested staff, and Members on both \nsides of the aisle. It is very important that we get it done.\n  I urge my colleagues who are working on this particular tea issue to \nwithhold their objection so that we can move this continuing resolution \nthrough that the leaders are expecting us to get done.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I have time, I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate what the distinguished Senator \nhas said. All of his observations, which I agree with, are accurate.\n  Mr. President, this is a little unusual circumstance for two reasons. \nFirst, the amendment originally eliminating the Tea Tasting Board \npassed without a dissent in the Senate.\n  Second, it was dropped in conference because of misinformation \nprovided by an administrative spokesman who simply was wrong. They had \nindicated that the Government did not have any way to stop poisonous \ntea from coming into the country, when in reality they did and do. So \nit was only dropped from the conference report on agriculture because \nof inaccurate information.\n  It would be a tragedy to reward the conveyance of inaccurate \ninformation.\n  Last, Mr. President, let me assure Senators that I do not seek to \nslow down this bill at all. All I want is an opportunity to offer this \namendment. If the amendment loses, obviously Senator Reid and I are not \ngoing to interfere in any way with the passage of this continuing \nresolution. But we do think it is of sufficient importance to the \nintegrity of the process that this be included.\n  I have every reason to believe the House will go along with this, \nthat there will not be any objection of any kind from the House.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, I hope that the Senator from \nColorado would not interfere with, hopefully, the funding of AFDC, \nfoster care, adoption assistance, and, maybe if we can get to it, \nkeeping the Government open, for a tea tasting question that seems to \nbe paramount here to kids out there getting their AFDC checks.\n  Now, if you want to stop the veterans from getting their checks, AFDC \nfrom getting their checks, our Government staying open, then you get \nyour tea tasting amendment on this resolution or we just withdraw it, \nthen we will let your tea tasting amendment bring it down.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me simply observe, first of all, Senator Reid and I \nboth wrote to Senator Daschle and to Senator Dole advising them of this \nproblem early on and indicating some time ago we intended to offer this \non a continuing resolution as a way of get it through, so this is not a \nsurprise. This is something we have advised the leadership of a long \ntime ago.\n  Let me assure the Senator there is no intention on my part and I do \nnot believe--I am sure there is no intention on Senator Reid's part to \ninterfere with the fine things that are in this measure at all. All we \nwant is an opportunity to have it voted on. If it is voted down, we \nsimply are not going to interfere in any way.\n  Mr. FORD. May I regain my time here?\n  If the Senator wants to vote it down now, I think it can be done. I \ndo not think he wants that because it would be a voice vote, and I do \nnot believe he wants to ask for a rollcall vote. Then we would have to \npostpone it because the majority leader has already said there will be \nno more votes today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Be glad to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator be willing to accept a voice vote on this \nissue at this time? If he would, we could have a vote and proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that everyone in the Chamber stop and think about \nthis for a little bit. I think everyone understands, for lack of a \nbetter word, how resentful Senator Brown and I feel. We agreed on the \nmatter that came before the Senate this year not to have a vote on it. \nWe had already won the thing on a previous occasion. But the \nbureaucrats, you see, always figure a way to resurrect things. And even \nthough the funding has been stopped, there will still be two people \npaid for tea tasting.\n  I have expressed my dismay to the senior Senator from Mississippi and \nthe senior Senator from Arkansas, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee. We have in the Chamber now the minority whip and the \nmajority whip. We have the President pro tempore of the Senate and a \nnumber of very distinguished Senators. I am wondering if--for this \nSenator, I would be happy to withdraw my objection if I would have the \nword of the Senators that are now in the Chamber that the first thing \nmoving through here after we come back, that you would help Senator \nBrown and me affix this because in logic and good sense and good \ngovernment, there is no reason that the Tea Tasting Board is still in \nexistence.\n\n  So I personally would withdraw whatever reservations I have if I \ncould have the support of the people on this floor to get rid of the \nTea Tasting Board.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, and I have a lot of sympathy, \nfrankly, for what he is trying to do. He has already referred to the \nfact that the senior Senator from my State may have some knowledge that \nI am not aware of, and I certainly want to be sensitive to that. But I \nbelieve there is a lot of sympathy in the direction of the Senator from \nNevada \n\n[[Page S19198]]\n\nand the Senator from Colorado, and in order to move this very, very \nimportant agreement forward, I would certainly make a commitment on my \nbehalf to work with these two very fine Senators to see if we cannot \nfind an early opportunity to resolve this problem. I could not say much \nmore than that this morning. I really do not know the details of what \nis involved. But from what I have heard, I think I am in agreement with \nyou, and I would certainly work with you to see if we could not find a \nway to move this initiative forward.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. I personally do not want a voice vote because I have a \nstrong indication it would not pass, and I think it would be a shame \nbecause this is, while not of great consequence as far as dollar sums, \nas a signal to the American public I think it would be a shame that the \nSenate voted to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the Senate would rather not do that.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure that is what would happen. My friend from \nColorado and I worked very hard on this. I think he has the same \ndisappointment, rejection, and all the statements that would go to tell \nhow we feel we have been had, for lack of a better word, by the \nnameless, faceless bureaucrats that are someplace down there off the \nHill. But that is how I feel about it.\n  If I could have the commitment of the people in this Chamber, and I \nknow who is here now, I would withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Let me also add my voice to this. I think my colleague on \nthe other side of the aisle said he did not commit himself to a piece \nof legislation, but subject to consultation with his leadership, that \nat the best possible moment, first possible moment that would be an \nadequate or proper way to do it, that he would assist. I will do the \nsame.\n  I do not want to speak for my leader under the circumstances that I \nhave not asked him nor has he told me about a letter and advice here. I \nam sure it has been done. I do not try to impugn anyone's integrity \nhere. I understand what they are trying to do. I hope that this would \nbe held over until sometime soon.\n  I believe you could get a standing piece of legislation here that you \ncould just go right through the order right quick and we could maybe \nget it done quicker than with an amendment to a continuing resolution. \nSo you could offer a stand alone piece of legislation and we could go \nthrough the parliamentary procedures. I am sure the Parliamentarian \nwould advise us how to do that. We may get it passed this afternoon or \nJanuary 3 because we will back here doing something on the 3d because \nthat is when this resolution expires.\n\n  So I look forward to working with them. If you want to go ahead with \nit, that is fine. If you want to take a voice vote on this, fine. Then \nwe will voice vote some other things I am going to suggest here this \nafternoon. That might change your mind a little bit. But we will offer \nsome voice votes on other amendments to this resolution.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have enormous confidence in the integrity \nof the fine Senator from Kentucky and the fine Senator from \nMississippi, and I appreciate their consideration of this matter, and \nin light of that I will withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I \nunderstand it, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, the whip of the \nminority, has raised a question about an amendment that would reopen \nthe entire Government. Is that a question now pending before us?\n  Mr. FORD. No, it is not. I have not had a chance to reserve the right \nto object. Others quicker than I have on that side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I shall await the colloquy between the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Mississippi \nand renew my objection.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object to the motion that has been \nmade by the distinguished majority whip, I ask him this. The cost of \nGovernment being shut down I understand is somewhere around $40 million \na day, with the statements of the Speaker of the House and the majority \nleader of the Senate saying all those who have been furloughed would be \npaid. I do not think that includes the inconvenience to a lot of folks \nas it relates to the services of Government. Let me give you a couple \nof--well, just one. We have a band from Lexington, KY, that is going to \nparticipate in the Fiesta Bowl. They have worked their fingers to the \nbone and worked their little hearts out to raise enough money to go to \nthe Fiesta Bowl. There will be about 400 of them, members of the band, \nparents, chaperones, et cetera, and they have reservations in national \nparks next week, and the parks have notified them they are closed.\n  They cannot get in. So you have a large group of high school \nstudents, bands, their parents, chaperones, a real coup, by being \ninvited to where they will decide the national championship as it \nrelates to football, collegiate football in this country, and we are \nsaying to them, ``You can't get in because the Government's closed \nbecause we didn't get a balanced budget, or are even close to an \nagreement.''\n  So I ask my friend, would it be possible to have an amendment that \nwould open the entire Government?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this side of the aisle would not be in a \nposition to clear that amendment at this time. I would like to say and \nremind my colleagues that our leaders are, in fact, meeting with the \nPresident at this hour, and with the Vice President, I believe, and \nothers. They are working very seriously to try to reach an agreement on \na balanced budget over the next 7 years.\n  I think that they are acting in good faith. There have been \npreliminary meetings occurring with the chief of staff and our budget \nchairman, both yesterday and I believe earlier this morning, and the \nprocess is underway and we should allow that process to go forward.\n  What we are talking about is trying to get an agreement to control \nthe rate of Government spending, to reduce the tax burden on the \nworkers of America, and we perhaps are at the point where some progress \nwill be made in that area. I have talked to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, and he said, ``We're not going to get an \nagreement until the end.'' The question is, how do you get to the end?\n  I think maybe we are approaching that. And so while our leaders are \ndown there working to try to get an agreement to really come to a \nbalanced budget agreement, I think we should not be undermining that by \nmoving forward legislation at this point, particularly since, when the \nleaders discussed this issue, they understood what the unanimous-\nconsent request would be.\n  I am sympathetic to what the distinguished Senator from Kentucky said \nabout the band from Kentucky. I bet they are great. I wish their \nfootball team was going from the SEC to the Fiesta Bowl. If the \nPresident had in fact signed the Interior appropriations bill instead \nof vetoing it on the 18th, we would not have this problem.\n  So now it is a part of the overall budget negotiations. We need to \nhope for the best and wish them well, but we should not at this point \nchange the agreement. We are not able to agree to that amendment at \nthis point.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I just hate to see all these crocodile tears-- they are \njust dripping down everybody's cheeks and off their chin--that we \ncannot get a balanced budget. We have agreed to 7 years. We have agreed \nto CBO. You cannot put CBO to it until you have a final agreement.\n  What we are doing is costing taxpayers $40 million a day. Our \nemployees get half a check. They cannot make the payment on their \nmortgage and \n\n[[Page S19199]]\ncannot make their payment on their car. The contractors are laying \npeople off in droves. They are laying them off in droves because you \nare saying, ``We're going to shut the Government down until we get what \nwe want.''\n  You have the right to do that. You are in the majority. But I will \nsay one thing: I believe you will rue the day that you shut the \nGovernment down. I believe that you will rue the day that that widow \nwith two children could not make her mortgage payments. You cannot do \nthese things. I think that is a mistake.\n  But if that is the position of the majority, then I will further \nreserve the right to object and ask the Senator, would it be possible \nto have an amendment reinstating the military COLA that is included in \nthe DOD authorization bill which is going to go into effect in January?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would say to the Senator, this side of the aisle would \nnot be able to clear that amendment either at this time. Let me comment \non that, if I could.\n  First of all, I am concerned about $40 million a day, but I am more \nconcerned about $600 billion of the taxpayers' money being spent over \nthe next 7 years that is not necessary, that can be saved, that could \nbe used to reduce the deficit, could be used to allow the people to \nkeep a little bit of their money at home.\n  We did not shut down the State-Justice-Commerce, Interior, HUD, or \nVA. The President vetoed the legislation. He shut it down. And I am \ncrying alligator tears about the shipyard worker in my hometown that \ngets up every morning at 5 o'clock to be in that shipyard at 7 o'clock, \ntrying to make ends meet, while the Government is putting burdens on \nhim with regulations and taxes. That is who I really care about. That \nis the human face on this. We are worried about that shipyard worker \nand the tobacco farmer in Kentucky and the future of their children. \nThat is what our tears are about.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator says it is all the President's fault.\n  Mr. LOTT. No.\n  Mr. FORD. Yes, the Senator did. And the Senator said the President \nwould not sign it, would not sign it, would not sign it. That is fine. \nBut when I give you something you do not want, you are not going to \nswallow it. So you have given him something he does not want, and he \nvetoed it. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the strategy has been, and if you go back and read all the \nstatements that have been made, is to come to this point where the \nCongress would be equal to the President with shutting the Government \ndown versus the veto power. Now, quote after quote after quote.\n  So this is a premeditated shutdown. This is a premeditated shutdown. \nSo whatever you say, $40 million a day, people not being able to get \ntheir checks, not being able to pay their mortgages, and we could stop \nall this by a clean CR. And we cannot get a clean CR. You object to it. \nYou object to it.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Virginia wants to reserve \nthe right to object, and I will be glad to yield the floor at the \nmoment.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, the way to resolve all these problems \nis to get a budget agreement. Our leaders are trying to do that right \nnow, and we should give them that opportunity. When that budget \nagreement is reached, then there will be a continuing resolution and \ndebt ceiling. It will all come together. But it is at the supreme \nlevel, the President and the Vice President, the leaders of the \nCongress are there meeting. I wish them the very best.\n\n  With regard to the particular point of the military, once again the \nCongress passed a good Department of Defense authorization bill with \nmilitary retirees' pay, COLA's for our military personnel, the \nprocurement we need for our military.\n  Our troops are going into Bosnia right now. How are they getting \nthere? They are getting there by airlift, sealift, because we have good \nequipment across the board for all our military branches. We want to \nkeep that. So we would urge the President to sign the authorization \nbill.\n  This military COLA is not needed now. All we need is for the \nPresident to sign the Department of Defense authorization bill that has \nalready passed the Congress and the problem is taken care of, and for \nus to presuppose that he is going to veto this bill, making this action \nnecessary, I do not think is the proper thing to do. The President is \nconsidering the arguments that are being made by our distinguished \nPresident pro tempore and others for this legislation. I know the \nSecretary of Defense supports many, many of the features we have in \nthis Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Not all.\n  Mr. LOTT. So let us wait until we know what has happened, and then we \nwill work together, I am sure, in a bipartisan way, to make sure that \nour military personnel are taken care of with their COLA's.\n  With that, I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject because I prepared a draft of this very important measure on the \nmatter pending in the unanimous consent.\n  I wish to first associate myself with the remarks from the \ndistinguished acting majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi. I \nthink he has very carefully and accurately stated the case. I certainly \njoin with him in saying it is not the Congress that shut the Government \ndown, it is simply the veto of these bills, Mr. President.\n  Further, it is my fervent hope that the authorization bill will be \nsigned because it does cover the pay raises outlined in addition to \nmany other very important and badly needed--badly needed--legislative \nadditions to our armed forces.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that \ncorrespondence between myself and the distinguished majority leader, \nMr. Dole, relating to the guarantee of the Federal employees being paid \nbe printed in the Record along with a correspondence between myself and \nthe majority leader, Mr. Dole, and the Speaker of the House, Mr. \nGingrich.\n  There being no objection, the correspondence was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S.Senate,\n\n                                                December 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Thank you for the strong words of support \n     for the federal employee community in your Sunday, December \n     17 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press.\n       On behalf of the 280 thousand federal employees affected by \n     the shutdown in Virginia and across the nation, it was \n     gratifying to hear your commitment that they indeed will get \n     back pay.\n       As you said, Mr. Leader, ``. . . it's not their fault.'' \n     And you reiterated, ``Federal employees shouldn't be punished \n     because the Congress and the President are at odds.'' I \n     couldn't agree more.\n       I would also like to commend you for leading by example in \n     the donation of your own salary to the Department of the \n     Treasury for reducing the federal debt. A significant portion \n     of the government is in a state of budgetary emergency. The \n     Congress should be the first to share in the sacrifices which \n     have been required of our dedicated federal employees through \n     no fault of their own. I am doing likewise.\n       With best wishes, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John W. Warner.\n       Enclosures.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 1995.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Frank R. Wolf,\n     Hon. Constance A. Morella,\n     Hon. Tom Davis,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Colleagues: Because of your interest in the ongoing \n     budget negotiations and your strong support for federal \n     employees, we wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm our \n     letter of November 10, 1995, in which we made clear that \n     employees furloughed through no fault of their own should not \n     be punished.\n       It is unfortunate that President Clinton has chosen to veto \n     appropriations bills that would have funded the salaries of \n     federal employees at the Departments of Justice, State, \n     Commerce, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban \n     Development, as well as independent agencies such as the \n     Environmental Protection Agency. Similarly, procedural \n     objections by Democrats have prevented the funding of \n     salaries at the Department of Labor, HHS and Education.\n       The direct result of those actions is that furloughed \n     federal employees at those particular agencies cannot be \n     paid. However, we would like to reaffirm our commitment to \n\n[[Page S19200]]\n     restoring any lost wages for federal employees in a subsequent funding \n     bill.\n       Thank you for your continued and strong leadership on \n     behalf of federal workers.\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker of the House.\n     Bob Dole,\n       Senate Majority\n         Leader.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I too am very concerned about the $40 million a day, but \nit is not the fault of these innocent people. And every day I shall try \nand work, as I did during the last closure, to assure that they are \njustly compensated at the proper time.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw any objections I had.\n  Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas because together we have worked into \nthis particular CR at this time certain protections for the veterans. I \nagain commend my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  I appreciated his comments and all of his good work on the defense \nauthorization bill and all of his efforts to make sure that our \nveterans are taken care of and that they do receive their checks, but \nalso his continuing to urge that the leaders of Congress and the \nPresident come to an agreement on a balanced budget so, as a matter of \nfact, all of the Government can go back into operation.\n  We certainly are hoping for that. Our leader has stood in this very \nspot and said he wants that to be achieved. I believe that that is what \nhe is trying to do right now, and that will solve our problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. Senator Dole and I \nand the Senator did stand here not more than an hour and a half ago, \nand the majority leader reiterated his desire to put the Government \nback to work.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, just for my own information, is there a \nparliamentary situation here that a limited CR is about to be voted on \nby voice vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Before doing that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list of examples of reduced Government services that \nexist during this shutdown be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Examples of Reduced Government Services During a shutdown\n\n       A. National Park Services facilities are closed.\n       1. On an average December day, 383,000 people visit \n     National Park Services facilities.\n       2. Potential per day losses for businesses in communities \n     adjacent to National Parks could reach $14 million, due to \n     reduced recreational tourism.\n       B. The Smithsonian Museums, Kennedy Center, National Zoo, \n     and National Gallery of Art are closed.\n       1. On an average day, 80,000 people visit the Smithsonian \n     Museums on the Mall and the National Zoo.\n       2. On an average day, 12,400 people visit the National \n     Gallery of Art.\n       3. On an average day, 6,900 people visit the JFK Center for \n     Performing Arts. (This does not include individuals who pay \n     to attend performances, for which the Kennedy Center will \n     continue to be open.)\n       C. FHA mortgages are halted.\n       1. On an average day, the Federal Housing Administration \n     processes 2500 home purchase loans and refinancings totaling \n     $200 million worth of mortgage loans for moderate-and low-\n     income working families nationwide.\n       D. Applications for passports are not being processed and \n     foreign visitors are unable to obtain visas.\n       1. On an average day, the State Department receives 23,000 \n     applications for passports.\n       2. On an average day, the State Department issues 20,000 \n     visas to visitors who spend on average of $3,000 on their \n     trips for a total of $60 million.\n       E. Veterans will suffer because while claims applications \n     are being accepted and questions answered, processing of \n     claims and payment of benefits has ceased. In addition:\n       1. 3.3 million veterans and survivors will not receive \n     their January 1 benefit checks on time if an appropriation is \n     not available by next Thursday, December 21.\n       F. The most vulnerable in our country will lose vital \n     income support through AFDC. Specifically:\n       1. AFDC grants necessary for January 1 benefit checks will \n     delayed to 4.7 million families representing over 13 million \n     recipients if an appropriation is not available by December \n     22.\n       G. ``Deadbeat Dads'' are getting a holiday through the \n     shutdown.\n       1. The Federal Parent Locator Service, to which 20,000 \n     cases per day on average are referred, is closed.\n       H. Assistance to Small Businesses is interrupted.\n       1. On an average day, over 260 small businesses are not \n     receiving SBA guaranteed financing totaling over $40 million \n     of loans.\n       2. On an average day, over 90 small businesses are \n     prevented from bidding on government contracts because they \n     are unable to receive SBA guaranteed bid bonds which allow \n     them to bid on those contracts.\n       3. On an average day, 1,200 small business owners are not \n     receiving SBA-sponsored training and counseling normally \n     available to them.\n       4. Banks issuing federally-guaranteed loans from SBS, VA, \n     and HUD have stopped receiving default claim payments. In \n     addition to potential cashflow shortages to participating \n     banks, this will result in higher costs to the Government, \n     because the claims will accrue additional interest during the \n     furlough period.\n       5. No outyear payments for Advanced Technology Program \n     awards made in prior years to over 100 innovative, high-tech \n     companies are being made totalling $68 million.\n       I. Many protections for American workers are suspended due \n     to the shutdown of much of Labor Department. For each day of \n     the shutdown:\n       1. 1. 95 percent of workplace safety complaints are going \n     unanswered.\n       2. 170 workplace safety and health inspections are not \n     being performed.\n       3. 190 worker complaints of minimum wage and overtime \n     violations remain unresolved.\n       4. 500 requests for information and assistance from \n     pensioners participating in plans with $3 trillion in assets \n     are going unanswered.\n       J. Important environmental protections are curtailed due to \n     the shutdown. For each day of shutdown, on average:\n       1. All EPA non-Superfund civil environmental enforcement \n     actions have stopped. On an average day, $3 million of fines \n     or injunctive relief against polluters will be lost and 8 \n     Federal environmental compliance inspections of polluters' \n     facilities will not be conducted.\n       2. About 240 calls each day to EPA's ``hotline'' for \n     drinking water contamination outbreaks are going unanswered. \n     Five other ``hotlines'' receiving thousands of calls each \n     month are shut down, depriving the public of potentially \n     critical information on pesticides and toxic substances, \n     asbestos in schools, and other public health information.\n       3. EPA-issued permits for air, land, and water pollution \n     limits nationwide cannot be approved and necessary EPA \n     technical assistance to States for State-issued permits \n     cannot be provided. Approvals of some companies' activities \n     will be put on hold while their competitors with approved \n     permits are allowed to operate.\n       4. All emergency exemptions for farmers to use restricted \n     pesticides to fight pest outbreaks have stopped, potentially \n     resulting in severe crop damage and loss of income.\n       K. Vital Education programs are shutdown.\n       1. Middle and low income parents and students cannot get \n     Federal college aid. On an average day at this time of year, \n     20,000 students and parents apply for Federal Pell grants or \n     student loans. These applications cannot be processed because \n     verifications of Social Security numbers (at SSA) and \n     immigrant status (at INS) cannot be carried out. Without this \n     application processing, these students and families are \n     denied the aid without which they may not be able to pay for \n     college.\n       2. Civil rights violations in schools cannot be \n     investigated. In an average week, the Education Department's \n     Office for Civil Rights receives about 100 new complaints of \n     discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, \n     sex, age or disability. These complaints cannot be \n     investigated or remedies sought. Buildup of backlogs delays \n     justice for individuals.\n       3. Criminal investigations in education programs have been \n     suspended.\n       4. Help cannot be given to parents and teachers. During an \n     average week, the Department of Education answers 8,000 \n     inquiries from teachers, school administrators and concerned \n     parents, seeking help with education problems that cannot be \n     answered during the shutdown.\n       L. American exporting businesses are being disadvantaged \n     during a shutdown.\n       1. On an average day, over 30 export licenses with a value \n     of $30.5 million that would otherwise have been approved by \n     the Bureau of Export Administration will not be acted upon.\n       2. On an average day, over 2500 telephone calls and faxes \n     from U.S. businesses seeking export advice, information and \n     counseling are not being responded to by the Bureau of Export \n     Administration or the International Trade Administration due \n     to the shutdown.\n       M. Vital legal and law enforcement functions are shutdown \n     or will be delayed.\n       1. FBI training of state and local law enforcement officers \n     has ceased.\n       2. Investigations of employment discrimination on the basis \n     of race, sex, religion, or national origin are suspended.\n       3. Processing of prison grant applications has slowed down. \n     Appropriated funds to assist states in constructing and \n     bringing on line new prison facilities will be delayed. \n     \n[[Page S19201]]\n\n       4. Collection activities by Justice's Civil Division has \n     ceased. The cessation of collection activities means that the \n     Treasury receives less income and thus the deficit actually \n     grows. In addition, individuals who owe the government money \n     can withhold payment without any particular penalty.\n       N. Key statistical data are not being collected and \n     disseminated.\n       1. Important statistical releases will be delayed-most \n     importantly the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic \n     Product and Corporate Profits for the 3rd Quarter of 1995, \n     the October 1995 U.S. International Trade in Goods and \n     Services, and Personal Income and Outlays for October and \n     November.\n       2. On an average day, 2,000 people call the Census Bureau \n     and 4,000 people call the Bureau of Labor Statistics request \n     information on economic and demographic statistics. These \n     calls are going unanswered.\n       O. After expending carryover balances in one day, the \n     National Institute of Standards & Technology would shut down.\n       1. Companies, universities, hospitals, and defense and law \n     enforcement agencies depend upon NIST's laboratory-based \n     research and services. For example, NIST provides in excess \n     of 20,000 measurement samples and performs thousands of \n     calibration tests each year for more than 3,000 large and \n     small companies.\n       2. U.S. firms will be denied critical support in their \n     efforts to deal with international standards and testing \n     requirement that limit the sale of U.S. goods overseas.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. FORD. Are you going to reserve the right to object?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object, but I \nwill be happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nbut I did want to clarify with the distinguished majority whip to ask \nif this does, in fact, pass in the next few minutes, can the veterans \nof this country and those receiving AFDC, people who work for the \nDistrict of Columbia Government, people who are receiving foster care \nand adoption assistance and Medicaid be assured that they are going to, \nin fact, get their payments? Is that what this means?\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, that is absolutely what it \nmeans. I personally do not think it is absolutely necessary. I believe \nthe authority exists for this to occur, but we do not want to leave any \ndoubt. We want to make sure the authorization is there for our veterans \nand those dependent on funding of AFDC, D.C. Government, those \ndependent on the funds for foster care and adoption and Medicaid \nquarterly payments. Without question, they are authorized and will get \nthose checks.\n  Let me also say to the Senator from Texas, I am satisfied that if it \nhad not been for her persistence and efforts in support of the \nveterans, this legislation would not be here this minute. I commend her \nfor that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority whip for \nthose comments and just say that Senator Warner, Senator Simpson, and \nI, and many others, have been very concerned about many aspects of \nthis. Those veterans who have served our country cannot be left at the \ngate. We could not go through Christmas without making sure that these \npeople know they are covered, that they are not worried about it.\n  Let me just say that tonight, leaving from Fort Hood is a reserve \nunit on its way to Bosnia. For those people and the many others who are \ngoing to be veterans very quickly by serving in Bosnia, it is very \nimportant that they know that this body will always act responsibly \nwhen it comes to them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. FORD. Continuing reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand how we can \ntell the people out there how concerned we are about them when the \nGovernment is shut down and there is no reason for it except to force \nthe President into signing a budget with which he does not agree.\n  I do not agree with it. We have 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats who \nhave gotten together on a budget that does not agree with the budget \nthat the Republican majority has sent to the President. So you have 10 \nof your membership that do not like it, and we are trying to get \ntogether.\n  As we worked through--I have the papers, I wish I had them with me--\nwhere we had the first budget and then the second budget and then there \nwas a first agreement and a second agreement, we moved a little toward \nthe Republicans and they moved a little toward us. I thought that is \nwhat negotiation is all about. But it is just like ``If you don't play \nby my rules, Sam, I'm going to take the ball and go home,'' and that is \nexactly where we are left.\n\n  I can hear we want all these people to have their money, but you do \nnot want anybody else to have it. You do not want that family to have \nit. There is not a soul on this side that I know of who has any \nobjections to the veterans getting their money, AFDC, D.C. Government, \nfoster care, adoption assistance, particularly the Medicaid quarterly \npayments. States probably would not have enough money to take care of \nit if we did not do this.\n  There is not a Senator on this side of the aisle that objects to \nanything that is in this continuing resolution. The only thing we say \nis that you ought to treat everybody else the same. That individual \nthat is out there working every day, the honest worker, as you talked \nabout, and he needs, or she needs, to have a full check.\n  Second, if they do not get the money, then they are laid off. All you \nhave to do is read the paper every day, and I am sure most of you do \nbefore you come to work. Dad always told me, ``Never go to work without \ndrinking a cup of coffee and reading the newspaper.'' So I try to do \nthat.\n  I am very disappointed we are costing taxpayers--we want to try to \nprotect the taxpayers--we are costing them $40 million a day, giving \nthem half checks, they cannot meet their mortgage payments, contractors \nare laying off their employees. All we have to do is pass a clean CR. \nPeople are working around here and want to get it done, and you know \nyou will get it done but you are creating hurt, harming people rather \nthan trying to help them. So the harm is now greater than the help that \nthey will ever get.\n  So, Mr. President, I reluctantly remove my objections because I \ncannot get an agreement, and it has to be by unanimous consent. I \nreluctantly remove the objection from this side if we are not going to \nget help for the people in this country.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the majority whip yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the majority whip and \nthe position he has taken and the remarks he has made. We must not let \nthese veterans and others down. Now is the time to act. I commend the \nmajority whip for the position he has taken.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3110\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Arkansas withhold for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If the majority whip wants to offer an amendment, I \nwithhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Hatfield, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3110.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof:\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION \n                               ASSISTANCE\n\n       That the following sums are hereby appropriated, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of \n     applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, \n     for the several departments, agencies, corporations, and \n     other organizational units of Government for the fiscal year \n     1996, and for other purposes, namely:\n       Sec. 101.

Section 301 shall expire on January 3, 1996.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, can the majority whip tell us what this \namendment is?\n  Mr. LOTT. This is the amendment that the unanimous-consent agreement \nrelated to, and we are, I believe, ready to go to the vote on that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I hate to keep beating to death a dead horse, but I just \nwant to say to my friends and colleagues on the other side, this \nmorning the Senate did exactly what it is supposed to do, exactly what \nthe Constitution says we should do. It says that when the President \ndisapproves a bill and returns it to the Congress, we will either \nattempt to override his veto with a two-thirds constitutional majority, \nor maybe it is two-thirds of those present and voting, or we will not.\n  In this particular case, we were talking about securities \nlegislation, which I thought generally was a good idea, but I thought \nit was flawed in some ways. The point is the Congress has done exactly \nwhat the Founding Fathers intended us to do, and that is, if the \nPresident disagrees with us, we will either muster the votes, as the \nRepublicans did this morning with the help of some Democrats to \noverride the President's veto, or we will try to get with the President \nand work out our differences.\n  What we have seen here for too long, 3 or 4 weeks now, is we will \noverride the veto when we have the votes and we will say to the \nPresident, ``Any other time you veto a bill and we don't have the votes \nto override, we will shut the Government down until you sign.''\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. What I would like to inquire about is, what is regular \norder? I believe the Senator is speaking on another issue, and he is \nentitled to do that, but we need to complete action on the unanimous-\nconsent agreement and the amendment that has been worked out. So if we \ncan get that done.\n  Mr. KERRY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Am I not correct that this is an amendment and, therefore, \nit is subject to debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is the unanimous-consent agreement. It is \nnot debatable.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Mississippi?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I may not object, but I want to ask the Senator from \nMississippi a question.\n  Is it true that it is the stated intention of the leadership that \nthose people who are currently not working as a result of this shutdown \nare going to be paid?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could get the Senator to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my understanding from all the parties in key \npositions, including the leader and the Speaker and, I presume, the \nPresident, have indicated that is the case.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving, again, the right to object, could the Senator \ntell me how one explains to Americans, at a time when we are supposedly \ntrying to reduce the deficit and show common sense, that we are \nannouncing to people that people are not going to work, but they are \nalso going to be paid for not working? Now, what is the common sense in \nthat?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I would like to note that the House \nof Representatives is awaiting, very anxiously, this legislation, which \nhas been agreed to by our leadership on both sides, and I do see that \nwe have Veterans' Affairs Committee members who are anxious for this to \nbe done. I would like to respond at length to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and I will be glad to engage him in discussion later on \nthis. I have to say, very briefly, that it is very hard to explain \nthat. But we can talk about that and engage in a dialog.\n  I urge my colleagues here that we go ahead and complete this action \nand \n\n[[Page S19204]]\ntalk at a later point on the details of what he is asking about.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I ask my \ncolleague, then, if I may just answer the question myself and say a \ncouple of words, and then I will not object.\n  I know there are members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and \nothers waiting. I am a veteran and I am waiting. I am hearing from a \nlot of veterans, and they are not happy with the notion that some of \ntheir claims cannot be processed, but they are also not happy--some of \nthese veterans I have talked to in the spinal cord injury division of \nthe Brockton VA--that some of them are going to be thrown out after 18, \n20 years of living there with injuries suffered that they received \nserving their country.\n  Speaking as a veteran, but much more just as a citizen, not even as a \nSenator, it is incomprehensible to me that we are going to claim common \nsense and rectitude with respect to the reduction of this deficit, \nwhile telling our workers of this country they are going to be paid for \nnot working and not serving the country.\n  If this is the price we pay, this hostage-taking of an entire budget \nand Government for simply one group of people getting their way, this \nis a sad day in the democracy of this country.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am trying my very best to restrain myself. \nI will be glad to discuss this with the Senator and debate him later \non.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would just like to finish. I know----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi now has the floor \nand has made a unanimous-consent request. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask that I simply be permitted to say to the Senator \nfrom Mississippi that I share with the Senator what I know is his \ndevotion to balancing this budget. We have offered, again and again, 7 \nyears, CBO figures, a good-faith offering of several different budgets \nby our side--two of them, as a matter of fact--a moderate so-called \nbudget and another by the entire Democratic Caucus, both of which, by \nCBO figures, balance the budget.\n\n  This is unnecessary. Shutting down of the Government is unnecessary. \nThis hostage taking is unnecessary.\n  I simply will close by saying it is very regrettable--regrettable for \nthe country.\n  I will not object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object. I want to ask the Senator \na question or two, largely because of some comments he made a couple of \nminutes ago. I am trying to understand whether there is a way, later \ntoday, of having by unanimous consent, or whether there will be an \nopportunity later today by which we might consider a broader CR. The \nreason I ask the question is this: My understanding, at least at the \nstart of today, was that the Senate would probably be able to do two \nCR's, one narrower, which the Senator from Mississippi is now asking \nunanimous consent about, and the second, a broader one that would \nessentially restore people back to their jobs, and I do not know what \nperiod we were talking about.\n  My understanding was that it was a broader CR that would put people \nback to work. There are 270,000 Federal workers today who are not going \nto work but are going to be paid. That was true yesterday, the day \nbefore, and it is going to be true each day until we pass a broader CR. \nI would like to ask the Senator from Mississippi if he thinks or \nunderstands that there are conditions under which we might be able to \nentertain, later this afternoon, after the White House meeting, a \nbroader CR so that we can put all these folks back to work.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond. Again, I am trying to \nrestrain myself so that we can get this agreed to, this very important \nresolution. I will just say that I can conceive how that might happen. \nI know the leader has said he would like for us to get that done. I do \nnot know what will happen at the White House meeting this afternoon \nwhere the majority leader and Senator Daschle presently are.\n  I can envision maybe that they would meet and there would be some \nsort of immaculate conception, and out of these various bills that have \nbeen suggested, alternatives, they would come together and say, yes, \nhere is an agreement in principle; we agree on the numbers and policy. \nWe have an agreement in concept that is real, and we can rely on it. We \nwould put it in law and, lo and behold, it would all come together \ntonight. I hope and I pray that that is what is going to happen.\n  So I can write a scenario. In fact, I could write the numbers that we \ncould agree on. I hope that happens. But unless that happens, I do not \nsee how we can get it resolved this afternoon. I would like to leave it \nto the leaders. They are doing their best. I would rather not have the \ninfantry back here shooting the guys up there that are trying to fly to \na higher zone to get this done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Continuing my reservation. I am not saying anything that \nI think requires great restraint on the Senator's part. I am not \nalleging anything. I thought I heard him say that he expected there not \nto be a CR that would be clean or a broad CR until and unless there is \nan agreement. That suggests to some of us that we are talking about \nhaving these 270,000 Federal workers who are not working continue in \nthat circumstance for a week or 2 weeks. That is a much different \nscenario than some of us thought might be possible this morning.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not know when that agreement might come or how you \nwould define the agreement. I still think they can achieve it. I put my \nfaith in them. That is all we can do. If we will let them meet and work \nand if we can spare ourselves some of our comments in press \nconferences, I think they can come together. I am just going to have to \nassume that the President wants to get this done, and I know the \nleaders do. I hope they get it done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Under my reservation, one final question. Is the \nobjection to a clean CR at this moment an objection that persuades the \nSenator that that objection will continue to exist the rest of the day, \nor is it an objection that is based on a temporary situation because \nthe leaders are at the White House? I am trying to understand the \ncircumstances under which the Senator indicated there must be an \nagreement before we have a clean CR.\n  Mr. LOTT. Typically, in the Senate, I do not have any idea what is \ngoing to come out of that agreement or when the schedule will be \nprovided to us. The leaders are there. We are working in their stead on \nan agreement that they worked out. Let us let them do their job and \ncome back and see what happens.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not object. I hope that we will be able to \npropound a unanimous-consent request later this afternoon for a clean \nCR and that there would be no objection to it. I shall not object.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of House Joint \nResolution 134. This legislation will enable the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to make disability and pension payments to approximately 3.3 \nmillion veterans in the event a continuing resolution is not enacted \nsoon. It ensures that any time this fiscal year in which there is no \nappropriation authority, VA will be able to make benefit payments to \nveterans, including compensation and pensions, education and training, \nand also pay vendors in the Veterans Health Administration. The House \nshould be commended for their prompt action initially on this necessary \nlegislation and I urge expeditious consideration and enactment of this \nmeasure in the House.\n  This legislation is based on S. 1414, a bill introduced by Senators \nSimpson and Hutchison in November. Their concern over this vital matter \nand initiative in seeking prompt action has facilitated this \nlegislation.\n  In a recent letter to me, the Disabled American Veterans National \nCommander, Thomas McMasters III, said ``Many veterans rely on their VA \ndisability compensation payments for the necessities of life and any \ndelay, no matter how short, can have a devastating effect upon them and \ntheir families.'' This is precisely why House Joint Resolution 134 is \nso important, and I thank the DAV and other veterans service \norganizations for their advocacy of this critical legislation. \n\n[[Page S19205]]\n\n  I ask that the full text of this letter from the DAV be inserted into \nthe Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. In addition to being able to make benefits payments, the \nlegislation ensures that the VA's 173 hospitals will be able to pay \ntheir vendors and continue to provide high quality medical care. This \nwill prevent costly violations of the Federal Prompt Payment Act, and \navoid potential disruptions in the delivery of contracted services, \npharmaceuticals, or other necessary medical supplies in veterans \nhospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient clinics.\n  Mr. President, none of us finds any merit or advantage in this second \nlapse of funding authority to continue the operations of the \nGovernment. I agree with the Republican Leader that this budget impasse \ndoes none of us any credit . . . indeed, it is time for some adult \nsupervision to end this squabbling and finger-pointing. I can only hope \nwe soon will hear clearly the American people express their growing \ndisgust and contempt for all of this political posturing, and get on \nwith the business of running the Government.\n  I have been very critical of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Jesse \nBrown. He and I have very different views of the responsibilities of \nthe Secretary in charge of managing one of the largest Departments in \nthe Federal Government. He clearly sees his role as an extension of his \nprevious advocacy for more funding of veterans programs. By contrast, I \nbelieve he should be alarmed by the Federal deficit and aggressively \nlooking within his Department to improve operations as a means of \nbetter serving our Nation's veterans, a task made all the more critical \nby the budgetary constraints necessary to bring the budget back into \nbalance. But despite our differences, we do share a commitment to those \nserved by this Department. Although he didn't even bother to pick up \nthe phone to express his concern over the necessity of enacting this \nbill, there can be no doubt that he also supports this measure to \nprevent any disruption in the payment of veterans benefits.\n  Mr. President, as we look for means of resolving the budgetary \ngridlock which has caused this latest shutdown of the Government, I \nhope that we can draw upon these points of agreement. The growing \nfrustration and polarization still can be reversed if we build upon \nthese shared concerns. Agreement on a framework for a mutually binding \nprocess to achieve a balanced budget must be achieved without further \ndelay.\n  The appropriations bill vetoed by the President earlier this week \nwould have provided a $400 million increase for veterans medical care. \nDespite that veto, I am hopeful that this funding increase soon will be \nenacted into law. At that point, the full $37.7 billion proposed by the \nCongress for veteran services and benefits will be available to be \nadministered by the Department. This is an enormous responsibility. I \nhope to be able to work with Secretary Brown to assure that this large \ncommitment to our veterans will serve their needs in the most effective \nand beneficial manner possible. At some point he must turn his \nattention from politics to management. That massive task will provide \nample opportunity for a moving beyond our current differences.\n  Mr. President, we now have the responsibility for taking an important \nfirst step toward restoring a necessary governmental function. Let us \nnot hold America's veterans hostage to this budget impasse. For \nveterans January benefits checks to be on time, this legislation must \nbe enacted today. I strongly urge the adoption of this joint \nresolution.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       Disabled American Veterans,\n\n\n                                          807 Maine Ave., SW.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher (Kit) Bond,\n     Chairman, VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Subcommittee,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: As National Commander of the more than \n     one million members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), \n     I request your support for S. 1414, introduced by Senator Kay \n     Bailey Hutchison. This measure would allow the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) to pay compensation or pension awards, \n     notwithstanding the fact that an appropriations bill or \n     continuing resolution has not been enacted.\n       As you know Mr. Chairman, VA benefits payments will be \n     delayed if the impasse on the budget is not resolved by \n     December 21, 1995. Expeditious handling of S. 1414, which has \n     currently been referred to the Senate Veterans' Affairs \n     Committee, is necessary if veterans' benefits are to be paid \n     in a timely manner.\n       Many veterans rely on their VA disability compensation \n     payments for the necessities of life and, any delay, no \n     matter how short, can have a devastating effect upon them and \n     their families. It is extremely important that the men and \n     women who served their country with honor in its time of need \n     are not forgotten in their time of need.\n       Accordingly, I call upon you, Mr. Chairman, in your \n     position of leadership in the Senate, to take all action \n     necessary to expedite S. 1414.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, and I \n     look forward to your reply at your earliest possible \n     convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Thomas A. McMasters III,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3110) was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 134), as amended, was deemed read a \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think it is very important to note that \nthere is a lot of credit due to the managers, the whips, Senator Lott, \nSenator Ford for the passage of Hourse Joint Resolution 134. This \nlegislation enables the Department of Veterans Affairs to make \ndisability and pension payments to approximately 3.3 million veterans \nin the event a continuing resolution is not enacted. It ensures that \nany time this fiscal year in which there is no appropriations authority \nVA will be able to make benefits payments to veterans including \ncompensation, pensions, education and training, and also to pay vendors \nin the veterans health administration.\n  This measure was made necessary, let us be quite frank about it, \nbecause the President vetoed the VA-HUD bill. Last week, when we \nconsidered that bill, I pointed out that if the President vetoed it, we \nput all of these programs at risk.\n  The reason given was that there was not enough money in the bill. Mr. \nPresident, the money in the bill we passed was all of the money that \nwas allocated to us in the appropriations process under the budget. I \nsuggested at that time that they sign the bill so they could continue \nthese vital programs and if and when an agreement is reached more money \ncould be added. Unfortunately, they did not choose that path. I commend \nMembers on both sides for enabling us to go forward. I urge the House \nto move promptly. It is vitally important. We need to get on with the \nprocess, and I hope that we can continue to make progress in other \nareas.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for \n2 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19197-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19205-S19206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TEA-TASTING BOARD\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I was in my office a moment ago preparing \nsome notes to speak on the START II Treaty. I have since found we will \nhave more debate when we return, possibly next week, so I will forego \nuntil next week.\n  I heard the Senator from Colorado and the senior Senator from Nevada \ndiscussing the so-called tea-tasting provision of the agricultural \nappropriations bill, and the Senator from Nevada, the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada, said he had taken this up with the senior Senator from \nMississippi, chairman of the committee, and the senior Senator from \nArkansas, namely me, as ranking member of the committee about how did \nthe tea-tasting provision wind up in the bill.\n  The answer to that is, if it is in the bill, I certainly did not have \nanything to do with it. I thought we had killed that sucker once and \nfor all. But I just want to say I really resent the situation that \nsomehow or other I was in on it, some conspiracy to put the tea-tasting \nprovision back in the agricultural appropriations bill. I detest that \nprovision as much as the Senator from Nevada or anybody else does. \n\n[[Page S19206]]\n\n  I came over here to say that people ought to be very careful about \nhow they implicate other people and what happened to show up on a \nbill--as the Senator from Nevada knows, our side of the aisle is not in \ncontrol of these things. I am not speaking for the Senator from \nMississippi because he is capable of speaking for himself. When I get \nan opportunity, I will join the Senator from Nevada in trying to get \nrid of that provision once and for all.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues when the Senator from Nevada \nmentioned this to me the other day, I was as shocked as he was. I can \ntell you I certainly had nothing to do with it and will do everything I \ncan to take it out. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19205-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19206-S19223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTREATY WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION \n           OF STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS (THE START II TREATY)\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the treaty.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am very pleased--as all of my fellow \nMembers should be--that the Senate will now be considering whether to \ngive its consent to ratification of the START II Treaty.\n  We can anticipate that the floor debate will be relatively brief by \ncontrast with the time devoted to previous strategic offensive arms \naccords--the 1972 Interim Agreement and the 1991 START Treaty.\n  This treaty deserves the Senate's careful consideration, and \napproval. In the nearly 3 years since it was negotiated, the treaty has \nbeen carefully weighed, and I believe it to be clear now to almost all \nMembers that START II is a logical and significant successor to the \nfirst START Treaty, which is also assuredly in the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  The Russian legislature has started, but not finished, its work on \nthis treaty. The Russian Federation has just had elections, and the \nconsideration and approval process, if successful, will involve many \nnew members heretofore unfamiliar with START. I deeply believe that \nRussian legislators will carefully consider the present political, \neconomic and military situation of their nation, will weigh priorities, \nand will see that START is a significant achievement that is clearly in \ntheir national interests. I believe very strongly that our activities \nand action in committee and the consideration being taken in the Senate \ntoday will serve to reassure their legislature that we are a serious \nparty to this endeavor and will be of value as they consider their \napproach to the treaty.\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty, which builds upon START, was \nsigned by the United States and the Russian Federation on January 3, \n1993, and was transmitted by President Bush to the Senate on January \n15, 1993. The treaty builds upon the reductions of offensive strategic \nnuclear arms required by START.\n  The START Treaty, Members will recall, requires about a one-third \nreduction in the strategic offensive nuclear arms of the United States \nand, collectively, of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The \ntreaty specifically cuts the former Soviet Union's heavy ICBM totals in \nhalf.\n  In addition the START Treaty and the subsequent Lisbon protocol \nobligates Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to give up all of their \nnuclear weapons and to join the START II Treaty, which is a bilateral \ntreaty between the United States and the Russian Federation.\n  The START II Treaty has several critically important aspects:\n  First, it will reduce by 2003, Russian and American deployed \nstrategic warheads to a level at or below 3,500--a more than two-thirds \nreduction over pre-START levels.\n  Second, it bans deployment of multiple-warhead intercontinental \nballistic missiles [MIRVed ICBMs]. These missiles are generally \nconsidered to be the most threatening component of each nation's \nstrategic arsenal.\n  Third, it legally obligates Russia to destroy all 154 SS-18 heavy \nICBMs and to destroy or convert all silo launchers for such missiles. \nThe SS-18 missile is the largest and most destabilizing ICBM in the \nworld. Half of them were eliminated by START. This treaty will finish \nthe elimination process.\n  These are three very important accomplishments. All of them are \nimportant to strategic stability. The details make that evident.\n  The START II Treaty calls for reductions, in two phases, in ICBMs, \nICBM launchers, ICBM warheads, SLBMs, SLBM launchers, SLBM warheads, \nheavy bombers and nuclear armaments on heavy bombers.\n  The first phase of reductions is to be completed no later than seven \nyears after entry into force of the START Treaty.\n  The second reduction phase, to be completed no later than January 1, \n2003, requires each party to achieve the following final reduction \nlimits:\n  Between 3,000 and 3,500, for the aggregate number of warheads on \ndeployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers;\n  Between 1,700 and 1,750, for warheads on deployed SLBMs;\n  Zero, for warheads on deployed MIRVed ICBMs; and\n  Zero, for warheads on deployed Russian heavy ICBMs (SS-18s).\n  Mr. President, the START II Treaty was considered thoroughly in \nhearings that I chaired in May and June 1993, and that Senator Lugar, \nmy colleague from Indiana, chaired in January, February, and March \n1995. Witnesses included Secretary of State Warren Christopher; former \nSecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger; Secretary of Defense William \nPerry; General John Shalikashvili, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; \nJohn Holum, Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; \nAmbassador Linton Brooks, chief negotiator of the treaty; Thomas \nGraham, Jr., Acting Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency; Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. James Woolsey and Douglas \nMacEachin, Deputy Director for Intelligence, Central Intelligence \nAgency. Non-governmental witnesses included Steven Hadley, an attorney \nwith Shea and Gardner; Sven Kraemer, president, Global 2000; Michael \nKrepon, president, Henry L. Stimson Center, and Jack Mendelsohn, deputy \ndirector of the Arms Control Association.\n\n  Earlier this month, the committee considered and approved a \nresolution of ratification in an 18 to 0 vote. The resolution contains \nsix conditions and seven declarations, none of which will require any \nrenegotiation of the provisions or the further agreement of the Russian \nFederation. These are the key points of the conditions and \ndeclarations:\n  Condition 1, on noncompliance makes it clear that the Senate would \nview as a most serious matter actions by the parties to START or by the \nRussian Federation with regard to START II that are inconsistent with \nthe object and purpose of the treaties or in violation of the treaties. \nIn such an event, it specifies courses of action to be taken by the \nPresident with regard to the Senate and the noncompliant party.\n  Condition 2, makes it clear that the Senate, in approving START II, \nis not obligating the United States to accept any modification of the \n1972 ABM Treaty.\n  Condition 3, makes clear that Russian ratification and implementation \nof START II is not contingent upon a United States-Russian agreement \nfor financial aid.\n  Condition 4, makes clear that specified exchanges of letters are of \nthe same force and effect as treaty obligations.\n  Condition 5, recognizes that the administration has reached an \nagreement with the Russians under which there will be strict \naccountability for all ballistic missiles associated with START. The \nSenate reaffirms its view that space-launch vehicles containing items \nlimited by START are subject to the relevant treaty terms.\n  Condition 6, embraces the administration's view that the START and \nSTART II provisions on national technical means do not preclude the \nUnited States from pursuing options to urge the Russian Federation to \ndismantle its electronic eavesdropping facility at Lourdes, Cuba.\n  Declaration 1, deals with cooperative threat reduction. Vigorous \ncontinuation of the Safe and Secure Dismantlement talks is urged. The \nresolution makes clear the importance of confirming the irreversibility \nof the process of nuclear weapons reduction.\n  Declaration 2, urges the President to regulate reductions so as to \navoid any strategic imbalance endangering the national security.\n  Declaration 3, expressed the sense of the Senate that the President \nshould  \n\n[[Page S19207]]\n\nconsult with the Senate as to whether START II remains in the national \ninterest should any nation other that Russia expand its strategic \narsenal so as to jeopardize the United States'--security--interests.\n  Declaration 4, recalls earlier commitments to reduce armaments and \ncalls upon the United States and Russia to seek further strategic \noffensive arms reductions and calls upon the other three nuclear-weapon \nstates to give careful and early consideration to corresponding \nreductions.\n  Declaration 5, urges the President to insist that Belarus, \nKazakhstan, and the Ukraine abide by the guidelines of the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime.\n  Declaration 6, states that the Senate will consider agreements \nobligating the United States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or \narmaments in a militarily significant manner only pursuant to treaty \npower as set forth in the Constitution.\n  Declaration 7, affirms the applicability to all treaties of the \nconstitutionally based principles set forth in condition 1 of the \nresolution of ratification of the INF-Treaty.\n  The START and START II Treaties and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty limiting strategic defensive arms, truly represent a continuum \nof arms control that has already had considerable benefits to the \nnations involved and promise still more over the next 7 years.\n  There is no question that all of this effort, more than two decades-\nlong, characterized by new initiatives that build upon earlier \nachievements step-by-step, has been critically important in the effort \nto curb the costly and essentially pointless arms competition that \ncharacterized much of the postwar period prior to the collapse of the \nSoviet Union. While I, together with many others, am pleased that we \nfinally have reached a point at which we can anticipate the elimination \nof the most destabilizing weapons--land-based missiles with multiple \nwarheads, it also is saddening to realize that this Nation's leaders \nmight have been wiser earlier. The pointless and wasteful MIRV \ncompetition that has been central to the arms race well might have been \naverted.\n\n  It is useful to recall that the Committee and the Senate endeavored \nin 1970 to forestall the development of MIRVed systems.\n  Senate Resolution 211 stated in part:\n\n       Whereas development of multiple independently targetable \n     reentry vehicles by both the United States and the Soviet \n     Union represents a fundamental and radical challenge to such \n     stability;\n       Whereas the possibility of agreed controls over strategic \n     forces appears likely to diminish greatly if testing and \n     deployment of multiple independently targetable reentry \n     vehicles proceed;\n       Resolved further, That the President should propose to the \n     Government of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics an \n     immediate suspension . . . of the further development of all \n     offensive and defensive nuclear strategic weapons systems, \n     subject to national verification or such measures of \n     observation and inspection as may be appropriate.\n\n  Senate Resolution 211 was introduced by Senator Edward Brooke and 39 \ncosponsors with three later additions on June 17, 1969. The Foreign \nRelations Committee reported favorably Senate Resolution 211 on March \n24, 1970, and it passed the Senate on April 9, 1970, on a vote of 72 to \n6.\n  I remember well making the case to several senior administration \nofficials that we would do well to do our best to avoid a race in \nmultiple-warhead missiles. Nonetheless, the administration did not \nagree with the Senate on the matter, believing instead that the United \nStates enjoyed a technological lead over the Soviet Union, and would do \nbetter if MIRVs were allowed. Accordingly, the United States never \nproposed, in any serious way, that MIRV's be banned in SALT I. Two \ndecades later, Soviet MIRVs have become a matter of considerable \nconcern, and much effort in START and further effort in connection with \nthe de-MIRVing Treaty have been required to deal with the problem. Now, \n25 years later, it is clear how prescient the Senate was. Now that we \nare coming full circle, only five of Senate Resolution 211's \ncosponsors--Senators Dole, Hatfield, Inouye, Kennedy, and I--remain in \nthe Senate.\n  The achievements of SALT, START, and the ABM Treaty demonstrate that \nthe United States and the successors to the Soviet Union are fulfilling \npledges made repeatedly since the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty to \nreduce their nuclear arsenals. These pledges were seen as justification \nby other nations for decisions to refrain from nuclear weapons testing, \njoin the non-proliferation treaty as non-nuclear weapon states and, \nearlier this year, to agree upon the permanent extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\n  I hope very much that we will have the wisdom to understand what has \nbeen achieved, the resolve to preserve our achievements, and the \nforesight to build upon them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, yesterday I wrote to the majority leader \nto indicate that I intended to object to any time agreement or other \nagreement to conclude debate on the START II Treaty until the \nadministration is willing to support the defense authorization \nconference report. In my letter to the leader I made it clear that I do \nnot oppose the START II Treaty and will eventually support an agreement \nfor expedited consideration of the treaty.\n  I also indicated, however, that the administration and Senate \nDemocrats have linked START II to the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report. While I strongly reject such linkage, \ngiven the administration's insistence that linkage exists, I now have \nno choice but to clarify what I believe is a misleading assertion.\n  In order to clarify what the defense authorization conference report \nactually requires, and the fact that it contains nothing that could \ncause Russia to reject START II, I will require a significant amount of \ntime. I had not intended to offer any amendments or declarations to the \nSTART II resolution of ratification, but it now appears as if I will be \nforced to. I simply cannot stand by while the administration spreads \nmisleading information regarding the defense authorization conference \nreport.\n  Let us be clear about what does and does not threaten START II. START \nII will be ratified by the United States. The treaty enjoys \noverwhelming support in the Senate; there is no threat to it here. In \nRussia, however, there are many groups opposed to START II, including \nfactions in the military and many hard-line nationalists. These \nRussians who oppose START II do so for reasons having nothing to do \nwith anything in our conference report.\n  But these same Russian opponents of START II have found all kinds of \nconvenient excuses to justify their real objections, including \nopposition to the expansion of NATO and United States policy in Bosnia. \nWhat the administration has done by arguing that the ballistic missile \ndefense provisions in this conference report threaten START II is to \ncreate yet another excuse for Russian opponents of START II. Those who \nhave already decided to oppose START II will simply repeat the \nadministration's rhetoric.\n  If anything in the United States threatens START II in Russia it is \nthe administration's own rhetoric. False assertions about how the \ndefense authorization conference report violates the ABM Treaty are \nprepackaged Christmas presents for the Russian opponents of START II.\n  The day after the Senate passed the defense authorization conference \nreport, the chairman of the House National Security Committee and I \nwrote to the President to clarify that nothing in the conference report \nrequired or advocated a violation of the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of that letter written \nto the President, dated December 20, 1995, be printed at this point in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 1995.\n     The President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you know, the House and Senate have \n     now passed the fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization \n     Conference Report. Given the importance of this legislation \n     for our military men and women and their families, and for \n     the national security of the United States, we are disturbed \n     by the fact that your Statement of Administration Policy \n     (SAP) indicates that you intend to \n\n[[Page S19208]]\n     veto this conference report, primarily because of provisions regarding \n     ballistic missile defense.\n       We are writing to clarify misconceptions contained in your \n     SAP that the ballistic missile defense provisions in this \n     conference report either constitute a breach of, or establish \n     an intent to breach, the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. \n     In fact, there is nothing in the conference report that \n     advocates or requires any action by the United States to \n     breach its obligations under the ABM Treaty. Our conferees \n     went to great length to ensure that Administration concerns \n     in this regard were fully addressed.\n       Our conference report does require deployment of a national \n     missile defense (NMD) system by 2003, and it urges you to \n     enter into negotiations with the Russian Federation to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow for a multiple-site NMD deployment. \n     There is no requirement, explicit or implied, for the United \n     States to deploy a multiple-site NMD system by 2003. In fact, \n     the language in the conference report regarding ABM sites is \n     taken verbatim from the Senate-passed bill, which the \n     Administration has endorsed.\n       We urge you to join us in working with Russia to allow both \n     sides to eventually deploy a multiple-site NMD system. We \n     believe that it is in the interests of both countries to do \n     so. However, nowhere does this legislation mandate such a \n     deployment. Therefore, the concerns raised in your SAP \n     concerning Russian responses are not supported by the \n     legislation itself.\n       With the only operational ABM system in the world deployed \n     around Moscow, and since it is fully within our treaty rights \n     to deploy a single-site NMD system, we find it difficult to \n     understand your Administration's linking this conference \n     report to Russia's consideration of the START II Treaty. Such \n     linkage is highly questionable and extremely risky, both for \n     START II and for United States national security.\n       It is unclear to us whether or not your Administration \n     supports deployment of even the most limited NMD system. \n     However, to maintain that your objections concerning \n     ballistic missile defense provisions in this conference \n     report are based on a putative requirement to breach the ABM \n     Treaty is simply not consistent with the actual legislation.\n       We respectfully urge you to more carefully examine the \n     ballistic missile defense provisions in this conference \n     report. We believe that you will conclude that there is \n     nothing even approaching a commitment to violate the ABM \n     Treaty contained therein.\n       This conference report adequately addresses the ballistic \n     missile defense concerns raised by your Administration over \n     the last several months. Therefore, we urge you to sign the \n     conference report and thereby ensure that the men and women \n     of our armed forces receive the benefits and material support \n     that they so badly need and deserve.\n           Respectfully,\n     Floyd Spence,\n       Chairman, Committee on National Security, House of \n     Representatives.\n     Strom Thurmond,\n       Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Let me clarify some of the false assertions about the \ndefense authorization conference report. It has been asserted that the \nconference report requires the United States to deploy a multiple-site \nnational missile defense system and even a space-based system. Both of \nthese assertions are flat wrong.\n  The conference report does require the Secretary of Defense to deploy \na ground-based national missile defense system by the end of 2003. But \nnothing in the conference report requires the system to include \nmultiple-sites.\n  I continue to believe that the United States should ultimately deploy \na multiple-site system, but nothing in this conference report requires \nsuch a system. Nor does the conference report advocate, let alone \nrequire, a violation of the ABM Treaty.\n  The language in the conference report urges the President to \nundertake negotiations with Russia to amend the ABM Treaty to allow for \ndeployment of a multiple-site national missile defense system. This and \nother provisions in this conference report envision a cooperative \nprocess, not unilateral abrogation.\n  It has been asserted that there is no way to defend the territory of \nthe United States from a single site, and therefore this conference \nreport indirectly requires a multiple-site system. While I believe that \na multiple-site system should be our goal, I must point out that the \nArmy has concluded that it can defend all 50 States, including Alaska \nand Hawaii, from a single, ABM treaty-compliant, site. I would also \npoint out that the Army's report on this subject was prepared at the \nrequest of the ranking minority member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Unfortunately, despite all our efforts in conference to resolve \nconcerns related to the ABM Treaty, we continue to hear the artificial \nargument that this conference report constitutes an ``anticipatory \nbreach'' of the ABM Treaty. Since there is no requirement to deploy a \nmultiple-site national missile defense system in this conference \nreport, there can be no ``anticipatory-breach'' contained in it.\n  But even if there were a multiple-site requirement, this would still \nnot constitute an ``anticipatory breach''. Since there are treaty-\ncompliant ways to get to a multiple-site system, just having a policy \nthat points us in that direction cannot constitute an ``anticipatory \nbreach.'' To quote the senior Senator from Alabama, who was a \ndistinguished judge prior to coming to the Senate, ``While there are \nlegal methods to deploy multiple sites within the framework of the ABM \nTreaty, there can be no anticipatory breach.''\n  It has also been argued that this conference report requires a space-\nbased defense. The conference report does call on the Department of \nDefense to preserve the option of deploying a layered defense in the \nfuture. But there is no requirement to deploy any specific space-based \nsystem or to structure an acquisition program that includes space-based \nweapons. The conference report does increase funding for the space-\nbased laser program. But this increase is merely to keep a technology \nprogram alive. We have asked for a report to illustrate what a \ndeployment program would look like, but this is hardly a mandate to \ndeploy.\n  We can certainly debate the merits of what this conference report \nrequires. But let's be clear about what it actually contains. If \nSenators want to debate the need for deployment of a national missile \ndefense system by 2003, that is a legitimate debate. But to argue, as \nseveral Senators have, that this conference report requires deployment \nof space-based weapons and mandates a violation of the ABM Treaty is \nsimply an act of disinformation. Senators are entitled to their views, \nbut they owe the American people an honest statement of fact.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think we have come to a very auspicious \ntime in our United States history, the history of the Russian \nFederation, and probably the history of the world because we have the \nopportunity now to move forward and ratify START II and hopefully \nimplement it.\n  As the Senate knows, this is the second such treaty, following on the \nprecedent set by the first START Treaty. We are doing our best to \nfurther reduce the United States and Russian strategic offensive \nnuclear weapons.\n  I believe it is the result of President Reagan's vision. He certainly \nled the United States and the former Soviet Union to begin negotiations \non the first START Treaty back in 1982. President Reagan's initiatives \nwere carried on by President Bush, who, through his leadership \nconcluded this effort that resulted in the signing of the first START \nTreaty on July 31, 1991.\n  START mandates reductions in strategic offensive nuclear weapons, \nincluding intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBM's, and \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles, or SLBM's, and heavy bombers.\n  START also limits each country to 6,000 accountable warheads on 1,600 \nstrategic offensive nuclear weapons. These limits reduce the number of \nwarheads carried on ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons carried on \nheavy bombers by about 30 percent from the 1990 levels.\n  Just before the end of President Bush's term in office on January 3, \n1993, the United States and Russia signed the second effort to further \nreduce these nuclear weapons, and this is treaty before us now--START \nII.\n  For the record the START II Treaty is formally titled ``The Treaty \nBetween the United States of America and the Russian Federation on \nFurther Reductions and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.''\n  This second treaty limits each country to 3,500 accountable warheads \non strategic offensive nuclear weapons and reduces the number of \nwarheads on ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons on bombers in each \ncountry to about one-third of the 1990 levels.\n  I think that we have to really consider seriously where we are going \nwith \n\n[[Page S19209]]\nSTART II. It is I think the right direction for this country. It has \ncome about not only because of the administration's commitment--both \nthe prior administrations and this administration--to the reduction of \nthese systems. But, also, I think because of the members of the \ncommittees on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate and the staffs \nof those committees involved, the Senate Committees on Foreign \nRelations, Armed Services, Intelligence, and Appropriations, as well as \nthe staff of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group.\n  I want to have the Record show my deep appreciation for those who \nhave been so much involved in this process.\n  On this side of the aisle, certainly the floor manager of this bill, \nSenator Richard Lugar, deserves a great deal of credit; our \ndistinguished President pro tempore, Senator Thurmond; and I want to \nnote that Senator Cochran and our relatively new Senator, Senator Kyl, \nbrought a great deal of leadership and direction into this world-\nshaping issue. And I commend the counsel that has been given to us from \nthe other side of the aisle, particularly from my good friend, whom I \nsee returning to his seat right now, former chairman and now \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Pell. Senator Nunn, and Senator Levin have also been very much \ninvolved, and their counsel is likewise appreciated.\n  Let me also mention, Mr. President, the support and thoughtful \ninsights provided by the administration's representative in these \nnegotiations--he is well known to us--he served on the Senate committee \nand is now the Special Assistant to the President, Bob Bell.\n  One particular reason for my statement now is to make a record of \nwhat has happened with regard to the Arms Control Observer Group \nparticipation in these efforts. In 1985, this group was created by our \nleader, Senator Dole, in an effort to have greater Senate participation \nin the negotiations and the processes that would lead to arms control \nagreements. Along with other Arms Control Observer Group Senators, I \nmade trips in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989, and on through the 1990's to \nGeneva, to Vienna, to Brussels, to the former Soviet Union, then to \nRussia, and to many of the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n  We did so in order to see to it that the Senate was involved in the \ndiscussions and the negotiations so that there would be no surprises in \nthe START process.\n  We are now seeing the fruits of the Senate's wisdom in creating the \nArms Control Observer Group, and I congratulate my good friend, Senator \nDole. He did this in 1985 in his first year as being the Senate leader.\n  It has given the Senate the ability to move through a very \ndeliberative process, and it does so through this group of Arms Control \nObserver Group Senators who come from the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthe Armed Services Committee, and the Intelligence Committee, as well \nas the Appropriations Committee.\n  We have had a very dedicated staff who have assisted us. And it is \nthrough staff behind the scenes efforts as well as the members \nconsensus, which is the result of the continued participation of the \nmembers of this group, which I think brings us to START II today. It is \na relatively noncontroversial subject, Mr. President, because we have \nbeen able to give the Senate knowledge of what is going on. We have \nbeen able to hold hearings and deliberate on various issues. We have \nhad a series of hearings where representatives of the administration \nand the military and the intelligence community have come and answered \nour questions. Only recently now we have come through an additional new \nprocess, and that is the process of working up a series of amendments \nwhich will soon be presented here as part of the managers' package.\n\n  I congratulate all concerned in regard to this. Many of those \ninitiatives came from the Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl]. Others have \nadded to them. And we now have a package which I think represents the \nviewpoints of all who have participated in the ongoing efforts of the \nArms Control Observer Group.\n  I can think of no finer gift to give the American people or the \npeople of the Russian Federation and literally all mankind this holiday \nseason than to deliver them a package which says that the Senate is \nprepared to take a major step for the world's really great major \nnuclear power. We will make the historic move that I think could \nsignificantly reduce the threat of nuclear conflagration, and that is \nthe step to ratify this START II treaty.\n  I wish to congratulate again the two managers of the bill. I think \nthrough their wisdom and knowledge and experience in handling this \nsubject, that it is a subject which any Member of the Senate should be \nproud to participate in the deliberation of and hopefully the vote for \nthe ratification of the START II Treaty. I hope that it will take place \nbefore end of the year, Mr. President. I look forward to the discussion \nwith my friend from Arizona on some of the points that we have \nintensely reviewed now for the past week or so, and I wish to \ncongratulate him and his staff for working with me and particularly \nJohn Roots who is on my staff now working on this matter. I am grateful \nto them for their assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to again thank Senator Stevens for his \nleadership role in bringing together a group of Senators who wanted to \nput the finishing touches on the declarations here and to do that in a \nvery short period of time. I appreciate his leadership in bringing the \ngroup together and getting this job done so that we could begin the \ndiscussion of the treaty now prior to the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by asking unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record several items which pertain to the matters which \nI will be discussing relative to the START II Treaty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n\n                         Baseline START I Force\n\n                    [For purpose of amendment No. 2]\n\nICBM:\n  Minuteman III.....................................................500\n  Peacekeeper......................................................  50\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total.........................................................550\nSubmarines:\n  Trident I.........................................................  8\n  Trident II.........................................................10\n                                                               ________\n\n      Total..........................................................18\n                                                               ========\n\nBombers:\n  B-52H..............................................................66\n  B-1B...............................................................96\n  B-2................................................................20\n                                                               ________\n\n182 Total............................................................\n                                                                    ____\n\n     From AMEMBASSY MOSCOW.\n     To SECSTATE WASHDC PRIORITY 1623, INFO MOSCOW POLITICAL \n         COLLECTIVE, Sept. 1995.\n     Subject: Internal Duma report recommends major amendments to \n         START-2 treaty\n       1. Decontrol upon receipt--sensitive but unclassified--\n     protect accordingly.\n       2. Summary: The Embassy recently acquired an internal state \n     Duma study of the START-2 treaty that recommends ratification \n     certain important amendments (copy being faxed to EUR/RUS). \n     The amendments are designed to correct what the authors see \n     as imbalances in the treaty in favor of the United States. \n     The report recommends that the Duma ratify the treaty while \n     stressing the link between strategic weapons reduction and \n     observance of the ABM treaty. It also recommends amending the \n     treaty to:\n       Permit each side to keep Mirved ICBM's with four warheads \n     or less, rather than banning Mirved ICBM's altogether;\n       Provide for the controlled liquidation of warheads removed \n     from Mirved ICBM's and SLBM's as part of the process of \n     meeting treaty-mandates levels of weaponry;\n       Require liquidation of old launch platforms and their \n     replacement with platforms designed specifically to bear \n     fewer warheads;\n       In order to reduce the cost of reconfiguring the land-based \n     leg of Russia's deterrent, permit utilization of 154 launch \n     silos built for heavy ICBM's to house single-warhead \n     missiles;\n       Delete the requirement to fill with concrete such ICBM \n     launch silos;\n       Permit redefinition of all 170 RS-18 missiles as single-\n     warhead missiles;\n       Push back the implementation deadline for START-2 by 2-3 \n     years.\n\n\n                       Start-2 and the ABM Treaty\n\n       3. The Duma study, written by the parliament's analytical \n     center before the July START-2 hearings, strongly attacks \n     U.S. plans to develop limited anti-missile defense systems. \n     It states that, ``In Reality, deployment of such a limited \n     ABM system, coupled with radical cuts in strategic nuclear \n     forces, \n\n[[Page S19210]]\n     is no less destabilizing a factor than constructing a full-scale ABM \n     system. Since a limited ABM system requires establishing a \n     full infrastructure (Information Systems, Communications, and \n     Military Command), it can grow very quickly to a size at \n     which a retaliatory strike by our strategic nuclear forces \n     could be neutralized.'' Thus, the report concludes, it is \n     essential for the duma to lay down an unbreakable link \n     between strategic force reductions and observance of the 1972 \n     ABM treaty.\n\n\n                          abm recommendations\n\n       4. Thus, the study recommends that, ``When ratifying the \n     START-2 treaty, the state duma of the Russian Federation \n     should declare that the `exceptional circumstances' mentioned \n     in paragraph 4, article VI of the treaty include as well \n     circumstances arising in connection with one of the parties \n     ceasing to observe the 1972 ABM treaty, or its substantial \n     violation.'' The report goes yet further, and also recommends \n     that, ``Attainment of a coordination and officially confirmed \n     agreement on demarcation of strategic and ``nonstrategic'' \n     ABM systems should precede ratification of START-2.'' The \n     report states that such an agreement on the demarcation issue \n     must include ``precise quantitative limitations on deployment \n     of ``nonstrategic''ABM systems.\n\n\n                             mirved icbm's\n\n       5. The report notes that the current text of the START-2 \n     treaty calls for total elimination of MIRVed ICBM's. It calls \n     this provision unacceptable, because it is contrary to \n     Russia's National Security interests and favorable to the \n     interests of the U.S. The study's authors note that 50 \n     percent of Russia's strategic forces consist of land-based \n     MIRVed ICBM's They recommend that the treaty be amended to \n     ban only MIRVed ICM's with more than 4 warheads\n       6. The authors admit that the effective life of Russia's \n     SS-18 and SS-24 missiles will run out in 10-15 years, and \n     that production of more such missiles will be next to \n     impossible, since the facilities for doing so are in Ukraine. \n     Russia cannot today afford to build a comparable defense \n     industrial infrastructure for producing new SS-18's and SS-\n     24's on its own soil, they note. However, they call for \n     developing a new, Mirved sea-based missile that could also be \n     deployed on land. In the future, they believe, Russia will \n     need to maintain a proper balance between Mirved and single-\n     warhead ICBM's in both its strategic rocket forces and fleet.\n\n\n              elimininating launch platforms and warheads\n\n       7. The Dama study states that START-2 would permit the U.S. \n     to maintain essentially intact a large number of launch \n     platforms for nuclear weapons that, while formally speaking \n     no longer used for nuclear purposes, could in a ``Crisis \n     Situation'' be rapidly refitted with nuclear warheads. The \n     report charges that, under the treaty, ``the U.S. would \n     assure itself of a favorable regime for reducing nuclear \n     weapons that would not require liquidation of the carriers of \n     nuclear weaponry, except for 50 MX ICBMs and part of its \n     older B-52 heavy bombers.'' Russia, on the other hand, would \n     have to undertake an expensive reconfiguration of much of its \n     strategic forces. It adds: ``The START-2 Treaty allows the \n     possibility of rapidly deploying the nuclear potential of the \n     U.S. in all components of the Strategic Nuclear triad.''\n       8. The study asserts that the U.S. would quickly be able to \n     redeploy previously removed nuclear warheads on still extant \n     Minuteman-3 and Trident-2 missiles in a crisis. Similarly, \n     nuclear weapons could be quickly reloaded onto B-LB bombers, \n     since ``START-2 does not require them to be refitted in order \n     to be re-oriented toward non-nuclear tasks.'' ``After \n     realization of START-2 the U.S. will have the possibility in \n     a crisis situation of operationally increasing its nuclear \n     potential by more than 4000 nuclear warheads. Russia cannot \n     compensate such an increase.'' Hence, the report's authors \n     recommend amending the START-2 Treaty to require liquidation \n     of warheads removed from Mirved ICBM's and SLBM's as part of \n     the process of meeting treaty-mandates levels of weaponry. \n     They also call for altering START-2 to require liquidation of \n     old launch platforms and their replacement with platforms \n     designed specifically to bear fewer warheads.\n\n\n        reducing the financial cost of implementation to russia\n\n       9. The Study charges that START-2 essentially favors the \n     U.S., permitting it to reduce its nuclear forces in the most \n     economical way, while imposing an unacceptably high burden on \n     Russia. It calls treaty provisions permitting Russia to re-\n     fit 90 launch silos for heavy ICBM's and re-utilize them for \n     single-warhead missiles insufficient. Its answer is to call \n     for amending the treaty to permit Russia to re-use 154 launch \n     silos built for heavy ICBM's to house single-warhead \n     missiles, to delete the requirement to fill with concrete \n     such ICBM launch silos, and to permit redefinition of all 170 \n     RS-18 missiles as single-warhead missiles.\n\n\n                     delaying treaty implementation\n\n       10. Finally, the study's authors also call for delaying \n     implementation of the START-2 treaty by 2-3 years. The report \n     argues that, since the seven-year implementation period for \n     START-1 will end in 2001, only one year will remain for \n     completing implementation of START-2. This is not enough \n     time, and so, when ratifying START-2. This is not enough \n     time, and so, when ratifying START-2, the Duma should \n     ``extend'' the implementation period by 2-3 years, in order \n     to avoid ``significant financial and production difficulty.''\n\n\n                                comment\n\n       11. This study was prepared as a guide for Duma deputies by \n     the Duma's Analytical Center, and thus reflects the views of \n     the Duma's in-house defense and security analysts. While pro-\n     ratification in principle, they are clearly eager to see \n     changes in the treaty that would substantially alter its \n     character in ways that appear to be unacceptable from the \n     standpoint of U.S. policy. In the first round of START \n     hearings in July, deputies did not raise the kind of \n     fundamental amendments addressed in this paper, though they \n     did stress the link between START-2 and the ABM Treaty. The \n     upcoming second round of hearings will show whether many \n     deputies agree with the views outlined in the START study, \n     and, indeed, whether the Duma is willing to ratify START-2 in \n     any form before the December parliamentary elections.\n       12. The START study also indicates that Russian Government \n     analysts are thinking carefully about how to restructure the \n     country's nuclear deterrent to adapt to the Government's \n     current straitened economic circumstances while maintaining \n     the force's effectiveness. If this study is any indication, \n     at least some analysts are envisaging a Russian deterrent \n     that would still contain significant numbers of Mirved ICBM, \n     both land-based and at sea--in contradiction of what START-2 \n     calls for.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in considering whether the United States \nshould ratify the START II Treaty, I believe it is critical that the \nterms of the treaty be reviewed in the context of the national \ndeterrent strategy of the United States.\n  Further, it is important to recall why this treaty came about and how \nit was intended to complement the strategic posture of the United \nStates.\n  The treaty, in other words, Mr. President, is based on assumptions. \nIf these assumptions change, we have to reassess our position with \nrespect to the treaty. What are some of these assumptions? First, the \nBush legacy, how the treaty came into being. As the Soviet communism \nand the Warsaw Pact were collapsing, President Bush moved to establish \na new framework for U.S. strategic forces, and it had two key elements. \nFirst involved a restructuring and downsizing of U.S. offensive nuclear \nforces and operations. This was the precursor for START II.\n  Second, it involved refocusing the strategic defense initiative from \nthe previous Reagan administration to provide protection against \nballistic missile attacks on the United States, our troops deployed \nabroad, and United States allies, and an offer to work cooperatively \nwith Russia and the allies in developing and fielding such defenses.\n  President Bush's commitment to a new strategic framework based on \nfewer but still potent nuclear forces and the development and \ndeployment of effective ballistic missile defenses was perhaps best \nhighlighted during June 1992 when he and President Yeltsin had their \nfamous summit. At that meeting, the two Presidents reached an agreement \non the outlines of the START II agreement which committed both sides to \nreduce their strategic nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads, \nsignificantly below the force levels permitted by START I. Importantly, \nthey also agreed to explore creation of a global ballistic missile \ndefense system and to cooperate in the development of missile defense \ntechnologies.\n  The administration's framework rightly retained a strong commitment \nto ensuring nuclear deterrence and supporting infrastructure over the \nlong term. President Bush and his advisors correctly believed that \nnuclear weapons should retain a legitimate, albeit more limited, role \nin U.S. national security policy. They also recognized that efforts to \ndelegitimize or to eliminate nuclear weapons could have the paradoxical \neffect of increasing national instability and the likelihood of \nconflict.\n  Finally, they prudently believed that given the possibility of \nreversal of reform in Russia, the United States should retain a healthy \nnuclear capability as a residual deterrent.\n  In sum, President Bush and his advisers understood that there was \nsimply too much uncertainty in the international arena to justify \neliminating what was a central element of U.S. national security \npolicy.\n  Likewise, President Bush's support for a more prominent role for \nballistic \n\n[[Page S19211]]\nmissile defenses in the United States and allied security policy was \ncorrectly seen as a means of bolstering, not replacing, nuclear \ndeterrence at reduced strategic offensive force levels. Such defenses \nalso could protect our allies and forward-deployed United States troops \nfrom threat posed by short and medium-ranged missiles and provide \nsubstantial population defense in the event of an accidental, \nunauthorized or limited attack on the American homeland from Russia or \nany other country.\n  From that foundation, we come to the Clinton administration. This \nadministration has essentially rejected the Bush framework and instead \nhas embraced what I believe is a dangerous and ill-conceived policy of \nproactive denuclearization. The administration has taken steps to lock \nin perhaps for decades to come America's vulnerability to missile \nattack and has used the arms control process to impede development and \ndeployment of effective defenses against short and medium-ranged \nmissiles and has used the arms control process to impede development \nand deployment of effective defenses against short- and medium-ranged \nmissiles.\n\n  The Clinton administration's antinuclear sentiments are perhaps best \nillustrated by reviewing the declining health of the U.S. nuclear \nweapons infrastructure. America's core nuclear competency is made up \nprimarily of skilled and motivated people, modern facilities, adequate \nfunding, and continued nuclear testing.\n  I would like to discuss each of these briefly. The concept, Mr. \nPresident, is this: When we draw our forces down from a very large \ncomponent of nuclear warheads and missile delivery systems to a much \nmore modest one under START I, and an even more modest level under \nSTART II, we have to be in a position to guarantee that what we are \nleft with will work for the purpose for which it is intended, to deter \nanyone from a nuclear attack. That is why it is necessary to ensure \nthat our infrastructure is not eroded or dismantled.\n  I mentioned that the first critical element of this group are the \npeople themselves. The critical skill base, or the expertise of \nindividuals at the weapons laboratories, is rapidly eroding and poses \nan immediate problem, Mr. President.\n  As noted in a recent Congressional Research Service report:\n\n       The experience gained from testing is irreplaceable, and \n     aspects of it may be lost unless it is passed on to the next \n     generation. Yet demographic data . . . indicate that skill \n     base is eroding rapidly. The weapons program is losing skills \n     as many experienced scientists retire and few new ones are \n     hired. As a result, gaps in the skill base are opening that \n     have adverse consequences for stewardship.\n\n  This means the stewardship of our nuclear stockpile.\n\n       The weapons programs face further strain from a budget that \n     is shrinking no end in sight and from a growth in mandated \n     non-programmed risks.\n\n  The CRS report further notes that a majority of weapons designers \nwill be facing retirement within the next 10 to 15 years and that the \nlabs have already lost certain experimental capabilities, and in other \nareas the labs are only one person deep.\n  The next critical element of our U.S. nuclear infrastructure are the \nfacilities. Currently the United States has no capacity to produce \ntritium, a critical gaseous element not only for our new nuclear \nwarheads but also for replenishment of the active inventory.\n  In sum, Mr. President, our weapons do not work without tritium, which \ndecays at such a rapid rate that it must constantly be reinterjected \ninto the weapons.\n  Energy Secretary O'Leary has twice delayed a decision to select a new \nproduction reactor technology as a replacement for the K reactor at \nSavannah River, SC. The Department of Defense now indicates that a \ndecision on the selected technology for a future tritium production \ncapability will be made soon. But given the numerous delays by the \nDepartment of Defense, I hope you will forgive my skepticism.\n  For all practical purposes, the United States has lost its capacity \nto produce critical plutonium components, including the vital pits of \nour nuclear warheads. And yet the Department of Defense has not decided \non where such a production facility will be located.\n  Meanwhile, the Pantex facility in Texas is so overloaded with the \ntask of dismantling warheads for disposal that it risks not being able \nto conduct a rigorous program of stockpile surveillance.\n\n  The next component for a robust stockpile, Mr. President, is nuclear \ntesting. The Clinton administration continues to embrace a nuclear \ntesting moratorium and a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as central to \nits arms control policy.\n  Contrary to President Clinton's beliefs, I believe that a moratorium, \na continued moratorium on U.S. nuclear testing will do nothing to aid \nin the fight against proliferation. Extension of the NPT matters little \nto the pariah nations that are or at least should be the primary object \nof our nuclear proliferation efforts. And with these states, U.S. \nnuclear testing has no bearing on their nuclear ambitions and programs.\n  In fact, Mr. President, Charles Krauthammer captured the essence of \nthis point in a Washington Post op-ed of July 16, 1993, of which he \nsaid:\n\n       There is something lunatic about saying that if we devalue \n     and degrade our arsenal, nukes will then have less value for \n     the North Koreas of the world. On the contrary. . . . The \n     future nuclear weapons reliably held by the great powers, the \n     greater the premium--the power--conferred upon the have-not \n     who acquires them.\n\n  At the same time, Mr. President, nuclear testing is needed to assure \nthe long-term safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons, and with \nit our ability to deter Russian nuclear aggression and to convince our \nallies, such as Germany and Japan, that abstaining from the acquisition \nof nuclear weapons makes sense as well. Even though U.S. nuclear \nweapons are at present safe and reliable, it is only through the \ncontinued explosive testing that the United States will be able to \nmonitor and improve the stockpile safety and reliability well into the \nfuture.\n  I talked before, Mr. President, about U.S. missile defense plans. And \nas I said, all of the premises of the START II Treaty are important to \nunderstanding why the START II Treaty is believed to be advantageous, \nbut in the event these assumptions change, our position would obviously \nhave to be reassessed.\n  To the issue of a combination of offense and defense, which was \ncontemplated by the Bush administration at the time that the treaty was \nsigned, I would note that following the Persian Gulf war, which \ncertainly focused attention on the proliferation of missile defenses \nand weapons of mass destruction, the Congress passed the Missile \nDefense Act of 1991 to continue this movement toward the development of \na robust missile defense system in the United States.\n  The act urged accelerated deployment of effective theater missile \ndefense capability. Perhaps more importantly, it served as a sign of \nintent that the Congress was prepared to adequately fund and support a \nrobust U.S. missile defense capability, both the theater missile system \nand a national missile defense.\n  But the consensus was short lived. One of the first casualties of \nPresident Clinton's quest to cut defense spending in order to pay for \ncostly social programs was the budget for ballistic missile defenses. \nThe DOD Bottom-Up Review of 1993 cut the fiscal year 1994 to 1999 5-\nyear budget for the Strategic Defense Initiative by approximately 60 \npercent from $41 billion to $18 billion. Hit hardest by this cut was \nthe National Missile Defense Account. DOD not only rejected the option \nto deploy a defense of the American homeland, but also rejected even a \nrobust research and development effort.\n\n  The Clinton administration has also used arms control to further \nerode the U.S. ability to effectively deploy TMD and NMD systems. Since \nNovember 1993, the administration has been engaged in negotiations with \nRussia and other states of the former Soviet Union in an effort to \ndemarcate the line between permitted TMD systems and those activities \nand systems that are banned under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile \nTreaty.\n  In those talks, the United States has taken the following positions: \nFirst, we are no longer seeking to amend the ABM Treaty to allow \nmultiple ground-based ABM sites in the United States, nor is the United \nStates continuing to propose that the treaty be amended to \n\n[[Page S19212]]\nallow space-based interceptors; for example, the so-called Brilliant \nEyes program, to perform direct battle management functions or \notherwise substitute for ABM radars. This is despite the fact that the \nspace-based system offers unique capabilities for sensing and \nintercepting missile threats that ground-based systems simply do not \nhave.\n  As described above, the United States needs to begin fielding a \nnational missile defense system now in order to be able to have it in \nplace by the time the new threat is deployed.\n  Second, the administration has agreed to multilateralize the ABM \nTreaty and accept as treaty partners any of the former 10 Soviet states \nwho want to be secessionites. And this means that all former Soviet \nUnion states will be required to approve any changes to the treaty. So \nthe administration approach will make it much more difficult for any \nfuture administration modifying the treaty, for example, to permit \nmultiple ground-based ABM sites or space-based interceptors since, of \ncourse, these modifications must be blessed, not only by Russia, but \nalso several other former republics of the Soviet Union.\n  Third, in November 1993, the administration proposed a standard for \ndetermining compliance of TMD systems with the ABM Treaty based on the \ndemonstrated capability of such systems. More recently, however, the \nadministration has accepted specific design/performance limitations on \nTMD systems and is considering numerical and deployment-area \nlimitations on such systems as well.\n  The limitations now under discussion are more restrictive than the \nABM system limitations already in the treaty. If accepted, such new \nlimitations would effectively transform the ABM Treaty into a Theater \nMissile Defense/ABM Treaty and would preclude the United States from \ndeploying one or more promising concepts for countering the growing \nthreat posed by theater missiles.\n  I have reference to the Navy Upper Tier program. Despite five letters \nfrom Senate Republicans and clear language from the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the House National Security Committee, the \nadministration has kept up its assault on theater ballistic missile \ndefenses.\n  A clearly stated objective of the Nuclear Posture Review, which was \npublicly released by the administration on September 22, 1994, was to \nprovide planning stability for the U.S. strategic forces between now \nand the year 2003, the year that START II is to be fully implemented.\n  This raises the next important point with regard to the assumptions \nunderlying the START II treaty, Mr. President, because, of course, the \nNuclear Posture Review is the document which determines the number and \nnature of our nuclear warheads and the targets to which they would be \nassigned.\n  The administration in this review embraced a force structure of 66 \nnuclear-capable B-52H bombers, down from previously 94; 450 to 500 \nICBM's--currently the number is 550--and 14 missile-carrying Trident \nsubmarines, down from 18, all to be backfitted with the D-5 missile.\n  This force structure was linked to the so-called ``hedge strategy'' \ndesigned to take into account the possibility of a reversal of reforms \nin Russia and the much slower paced nuclear drawdown there. But no \nsooner had the Defense Department released the results of the nuclear \nposture review, the President moved to overturn it. Just 5 days after \nthe NPR was released, President Clinton stated his willingness to begin \ndiscussions with Russia on a possible START III agreement to reduce \nstrategic forces below the 3,500 weapons permitted by START II and to \ndeactivate all strategic nuclear delivery systems to be reduced under \nSTART II by removing their nuclear warheads or taking other steps to \nremove them from combat status.\n  The President's declarations served to undermine whatever hoped-for \nplanning stability associated with U.S. strategic forces existed as a \nresult of the NPR. Since 1988, U.S. strategic nuclear forces have been \nreduced by approximately 50 percent and U.S. nonstrategic nuclear \nforces by approximately 90 percent.\n  Furthermore, the annual budget for strategic forces has been reduced \nfrom roughly $50 billion per year at the height of the cold war to \nbelow $13 billion today, and the United States has no new strategic \nsystems under development.\n  By contrast, Russia continues to modernize its strategic arsenal. The \nRussian program involves the development for deployment of two new \nICBM's, one new SLBM, submarine-launched ballistic missile, and \ncontinuation of deep underground bunkers for control and command and \nleadership survivor. This seems to indicate, despite severe economic \ndifficulties, Russia intends to modernize down to lower force levels.\n  In addition, Russia's new doctrine places much greater emphasis on \nretaliation against conventional attacks on targets in Russia. That \nbrings us to where we are today in consideration of the START II \ntreaty.\n  START II on January 3, 1993, President George Bush and Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin signed the treaty. START II builds on the START \nI treaty which reduces strategic offensive arsenals on both sides by \nabout one-third and which focuses on the conversion and destruction of \nmissile launchers--bombers, silos, submarine launchers--rather than the \nmissiles and the warheads.\n  START II reduces both countries' nuclear arsenal to about 3,300 \nwarheads for the United States and about 3,000 for Russia. The treaty \nrequires Russia to eliminate all MIRV'd missiles. These are the \nmissiles that have more than one warhead on top of them and present a \nspecial threat launched by either side. But it does allow the country \nto download 105 of the six-warhead SS-19's to a single warhead each, \nand to make 90 SS-18 silos inoperable by partly filling them with \nconcrete, but it allows Russia to house the less powerful SS-25 missile \nin the converted silo.\n  In addition, the treaty allows Russia to inspect, for the first time, \nthe bomb-bays of the B-2, the U.S. bomber, to ensure that the warhead \nlimits are adhered to. It actually also counts the warheads on the B-1 \nbomber cruise missiles, and it ensures that 100 U.S. bombers have been \nreassigned to conventional use.\n  START II requires the United States to scrap or modify its 50 MX \nmissiles, which have 10 warheads each, and to cut by about one-half the \nnumber of warheads on its submarine-launched missiles from 3,456 to \n1,728.\n  START II is to be implemented in two phases: the first is to be \ncompleted within 7 years of ratification and the second by the year \n2003. When reductions are complete, the U.S. level will return to those \nof the 1960's and the Russian levels to those of the 1970's.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that while I believe the \nSTART II treaty is fair and is advantageous to the United States, it is \nonly in the interest of the United States if certain key provisions of \nthe treaty are not changed or are not weakened in any way.\n  I do not think it is too much to expect those in the Senate who \nratify this treaty, who support ratification, to expect that the treaty \nwill be adhered to by both sides and will not be changed or weakened in \nany way. I know that some in the defense community have real concerns \nwith provisions of the treaty. The Washington-based Center for Security \nPolicy, for example, has listed the following provisions as \nparticularly troublesome:\n  First, the right on the part of the Russians to retain the SS-18 \nsilos. As I said, the START II treaty will not eliminate the \ninfrastructure associated with this most dangerous of the former Soviet \nUnion MIRV'd missile, SS-18 heavy ICBM's. Instead, it allows Moscow to \nretain 90 of the SS-18 silos and associated launch facilities and \nsupport complexes. As the United States has no idea how many SS-18 \nmissiles the Russians actually have in their inventory, even the \nmonitored destruction of ``declared'' heavy ICBM's could leave Moscow \nin a position to utilize these silos in the future to launch SS-18's. \nSo this is a matter of some concern.\n  The right to retain the SS-19's: Under START II, Moscow may retain as \nmany as 105 deployed SS-19's as long as these missiles are \n``downloaded,'' a process by which five of the six warheads are \nremoved. Unfortunately, as long as the Russians retain replacement \nwarheads, it can, with little fear of U.S. detection, rapidly reverse \nthe \n\n[[Page S19213]]\ndownloading process. In this manner, the Russians can retain a \nmilitarily significant breakout capability. This is an obvious concern. \nSince there are no limits on either START I or START II on the number \nof ``nondeployed'' SS-19's, the Russians may be able to keep as many of \nthese missiles, even in a fully loaded status, as they wish.\n  As I said before, the United States agreed to onsite inspections of \nthe B-2. The effect of this provision, though considered necessary for \nthe agreement of the treaty, will be to degrade the deterrent value of \nthis air-breathing leg of the U.S. strategic triad.\n  This is by no means a comprehensive list of some of the problematic \naspects of the treaty. I call my colleagues' attention to the testimony \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee by one of the critics of the \ntreaty, Sven Kraemer, former Director of Arms Control at the National \nSecurity Council, in which he lists a comprehensive listing of some of \nthe more troublesome aspects of the treaty.\n  I note these simply to indicate, Mr. President, that while I believe \nthis treaty, on balance, represents a fair and constructive way to \napproach the problem of reducing the number of these dangerous weapons \nas to the interests of the United States, that it is not without \nconcern and that those of us who support the treaty, I think, should be \nrespected in our delineation of these concerns, because, as I have \nsaid, much depends on the assumptions that underlie the treaty, and if \nthose assumptions later change, obviously we would have to reassess our \nposition under the treaty.\n\n  President Reagan said it well: ``Trust but verify.'' The problem here \nis that it is not easy to verify. There are some things that are just \nvery, very difficult to verify in this treaty, difficult if not \nimpossible. So, to some extent, there is an element of trust required, \nand I suspect that all of us base some of our position here on an \nelement of hope as well.\n  But the point is that as we bring the number of these weapons down to \na relatively lower number, much smaller number, we better make sure \nthat they work, we better make sure that the other side does not cheat, \nbecause cheating, when both sides only have a few, is much more \ndangerous than if we both have very large components in our nuclear \narsenal.\n  I also note, Mr. President, that the Russians have certain concerns \nwith START II. This would be, I think, obvious in any negotiation where \nboth sides give and take. So we are not the only ones who have \nconcerns. As a matter of fact, an internal Duma report prepared by the \nDuma's analytical center and reporting in an unclassified memo from the \nAmerican Embassy, we note that there are seven specific amendments \nrecommended to the treaty. I will not go into these, although I will be \nsubmitting my entire statement for the Record, which identifies these \nparticular proposed changes from the standpoint of the Russian Duma. \nNone of these amendments, suffice it to say, would be acceptable to the \nUnited States. In fact, if any one of these were to be accepted by the \nRussian Duma, it would gut the central provisions of START II. That is \nwhy, despite the fact that there are those who believe that some \namendments might have made the treaty more acceptable from the United \nStates' perspective and urged that we actually offer amendments to the \ntreaty in that regard, I think others of us felt that it was better to \nkeep the treaty as it was negotiated and signed by the two parties, \nbecause we did not want to begin the process of amendment which would \nthen give those in the Russian Duma a greater capability to argue the \nappropriateness of making amendments from their perspective.\n\n  That is why it is important that there be no amendments from either \nside. We have declarations and one condition, which we think help to \nestablish the basis of the treaty from our perspective. Clearly, no \namendment to the treaty, along the previously suggested lines, by the \nRussian Duma would be appropriate. That would be a basis for our \nwithdrawal from the treaty.\n  I want to make it very clear that there is one thing in particular I \nwould very strongly oppose. I will very strongly oppose any attempt by \nthe administration, or anyone else, to walk back the MIRV downloading \nprovision of the treaty, to allow the Russians to either increase the \nnumbers of SS-18's, or to modify the structural changes to the SS-18 \nsilos, or to delay the implementation of START II. I believe that any \nchanges to the treaty, especially in these two key areas, would \nobviously require Senate advice and consent.\n  Mr. President, if there is anyone who, during the course of this \ndiscussion, disagrees with that, I would like them to say that. I would \nlike to have a dialog with that individual. I doubt that anyone could \nconceivably come to that conclusion. But, clearly, we have to have it \nestablished, as we vote to ratify this treaty, that in those two most \nimportant respects the U.S. Senate would have to provide advice and \nconsent.\n  I know the administration has agreed with that proposition as of now. \nI cannot imagine any disagreement. I note, for the Record, that with \nregard to walking back the MIRV downloading, Mr. Bob Bell, Special \nAssistant to the President, and an individual well known here in the \nSenate, who has assisted Senator Nunn for many years, has written, \n``This report is totally unsubstantiated and pure fantasy.'' By the \nway, he was referring to a report that there may be some move toward \nsome MIRV downloading in the treaty. ``The administration is not \nplanning and does not have under consideration any such proposal.''\n  Mr. President, I accept that statement from Mr. Bob Bell, and I \ncertainly would not oppose the treaty based on assurances from the \nadministration that MIRV downloading will not occur. But, it is an \nillustration, Mr. President, of the kinds of things which at least have \nbeen talked about as possible changes and which I think we have to be \nvery, very careful in considering prior to the ratification of the \ntreaty, so that if those kinds of changes should ever be suggested to \nus, the record has been very clear that, A, it would require the advice \nand consent of the Senate, and, B, it would not be in the best interest \nof the United States.\n\n  One more note about Russian compliance with the arms control \nagreement, Mr. President. Questions about verifiability of the treaty \nare important because of concerns about whether the Russians will, in \nfact, abide by the terms of START II. Obviously, we all hope and \nrequire that the Russians fully comply with START II. But their record, \nand the record of the former Soviet Union, with respect to compliance \nwith arms control agreements is somewhat dubious. I will note just a \nfew of the areas of violation in the past:\n  The Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Agreements, \nthe Missile Technology Control Regime, START I, and the Conventional \nForces in Europe Treaties. All of these agreements have provisions that \nRussia has, in one way or another, failed to comply.\n  I mention this and the previous arms control agreements to underscore \nthe importance of assuring that the Russians comply with the START II \nTreaty--not that they intend to comply, but that they are complying. An \nassumption of Russian compliance with the terms of START II is one \nsignificant consideration in my decision to support the treaty. I have \nconfidence that they will comply, and that is the basis for my support \nof the treaty.\n  The final substantive point, Mr. President, I would make is this, and \nit has to do with linkage to the ABM Treaty.\n  There is no linkage between the ABM Treaty and the START II Treaty--\nalthough this is a favorite argument of some members of the \nadministration and of opponents of ballistic missile defenses in the \nRussian Duma. There is no linkage between these two treaties. There \nnever was and never will be.\n  There are those who believe that the ABM Treaty and START II are \nlinked; further, that action relating to ballistic missile defenses in \nthe United States will somehow affect ratification of START II in \nRussia. In fact, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the \nRussians have concerns about ratifying START II irrespective of Senate \naction on the ABM Treaty.\n  It is incontroverted by a variety of Russian spokesmen themselves, \nwho have made the point crystal clear that their concerns about START \nII have to do with the treaty itself, with their requirements under the \ntreaty, and with \n\n[[Page S19214]]\nthe costs that their compliance will entail, and not with the United \nStates position with respect to the ABM Treaty.\n  For example, chairman of the Duma's Foreign Relations Committee, \nVladimir Lukin, said ``We need big money to carry out these reductions \n[in START II], and we don't have it. We do not want to ratify this \nTreaty and then not be able to comply with its terms. We will have to \nwait until we see how to pay for our promises.'' As quoted by Jim \nHoagland in the Washington Post, July 2, 1995.\n  Other Russians tie START II ratification to other international \nissues. Speaker of the Federation Council [upper chamber], Vladimir \nShumeyko, stated, ``We closely link [START II] ratification with the \noverall situation existing between Russia and NATO. We consider the \nperseverance of NATO as a stumbling block to our cooperation in the \narea of disarmament and advancement on the road to peace.''--Interfax, \n1255 GMT, April 3, 1995.\n  And, still others see START II as inimical to Russian interests. \nViktor Ilyukhin, Chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, \ncommented, ``If this treaty [START II] is fully implemented, the United \nStates will almost double its superiority, while the damage to Russia's \nnational security will be unrecoverable.''--ITAR-Tass, 1849 GMT, \nFebruary 18, 1995.\n  There are also political problems with Russian ratification of START \nII. Aleksander Konovalov, Director of the Russian Academy of Sciences \nUSA and Canada Institute, observed, ``The outlook for the treaty's \n[START II] ratification by the Russian Federation's Federal Assembly is \nnot at all promising. Some deputies support the treaty in its current \nversion, but they are obviously the minority in parliament. A sizable \ngroup of opposition deputies will probably vote against the \nratification of START II for purely political reasons.''--Segodnya, \nNovember 15, 1994, p.10.\n  Sergei Karaganov, adviser to President Yeltsin, was quoted as saying, \n``There is widespread feeling now that the United States pushed too \nhard when Russia was weak and that the treaty is unfair.'' As quoted by \nJack Mendelshon, from ACDA, week of July 3, 1995.\n  The U.S. ambassador to the START II talks, Linton Brooks, wrote in a \nmemo dated November 5, 1995 about other factors affecting Duma \nconsideration of START II. Brooks said, ``The major reason START II is \nin trouble in the Yeltsin government is not pushing it. Indeed, the \ngovernment has been unable to say what the Russian force structure will \nbe under START II, how much it will cost, or how Russia will pay for \nit.''\n  Brooks further stated, ``The bluntest political analysis I heard came \nfrom Alexei Mitrofanov of the Liberal Democratic Party. He argued that \nrunning against START II was good politics. In the LDP analysis, the \nRussian public associates the ``reforms'' which have ruined their \ncountry with the United States. As a result, there is growing, deep-\nrooted, exploitable, anti-American sentiments in the Russian \nelectorate. START II is associated with the United States and thus no \npolitician will want to support it.''\n  Finally, Brooks correctly concluded ``without more action by the \nRussian government, nothing that the United States does will matter.'' \nI say ``amen'' to any further discussion about the negative impact of \nSenate action on the ballistic missile defenses and the negative impact \non Duma passage of the START II Treaty.\n  Now, I want to move from those substantive points to the final point \nof my presentation, which has to do with the nine managers' amendments \nto the resolution of ratification--not treaty amendments, but rather \ndeclarations, and, in one case, a condition. Again, I express my \nappreciation to Senator Stevens, who is chairman of the Arms Control \nObserver Group, who called the group together to consider these ideas, \nand Senator Lugar, who was active in participating in the discussions, \nand to all of the Members on the other side of the aisle, who were \nactive in negotiating and, in fact, also to Bob Bell, representing the \nadministration's point of view.\n  As a result of these discussions, we were able to agree to these nine \nmanagers' amendments. They will be discussed shortly, and I hope they \nwill be agreed to because they express, in important ways, the \nsubstance of what I have been saying here. For example, that there is \nno linkage between the START II Treaty and ballistic missile defenses; \nthat the President must consult closely with the Senate if he changes \nthe nuclear force structure; that the President must submit for advice \nand consent any material modification or amendment or reinterpretation \nof the START II Treaty; that the Senate is concerned about the impact \nof allowing Russia and Ukraine to use excess ballistic missiles for \nspace launch vehicles; and that the Senate is concerned about the \nmaintenance and preservation of the nuclear weapons stockpile and the \nattendant facilities.\n  These are important declarations, and I believe that in adopting \nthem, the Senate is putting the administration and Russians, and \neverybody else, on notice that this drawdown must be accomplished \ncarefully and with full cognizance of the impact on the future \ndeterrent posture of the United States.\n  The declarations also place the administration on notice that the \nSenate must be closely consulted with while it continues to negotiate \nwith the Russians about the precise implementation of START II.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I think President Bush got it right \nwhen he moved to reduce nuclear force levels and the role of nuclear \nweapons in the U.S. national security strategy. But he was also correct \nin maintaining a strong commitment to ensuring the long-term viability \nand efficacy of U.S. nuclear deterrent and supporting infrastructure. \nLikewise, his determination to refocus the SDI program on providing \ndefenses against limited missile strikes reflect the widespread \nproliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction and \nthe apparent willingness of regional aggressors to use those weapons.\n  Furthermore, once the United States' ability to manufacture and test \nnew nuclear weapons and repair unsafe or unreliable old ones has \ndisappeared, then neither we nor our allies will be able to count on \nour arsenal or deter aggression. At that point, we will have become \neffectively disarmed. Such a situation would result in a rethinking by \nour allies of their current commitment not to build their own nuclear \narsenal--although they are technically capable of doing so--with \ndramatic consequences for U.S. national security.\n  Likewise, the administration's abandonment of President Bush's plan \nto effect the TMD and NMD systems as a means of protection from \nstrikes, at least on the timetable and in the way we believe is \nimportant, based on its view of the world, I think, represents a \nstrategic blunder of major proportions.\n  I will be working in the future to try to readdress that issue so \nthat we can, at the same time we are drawing down our strategic \noffensive forces, provide a robust national and regional missile \ndefense system.\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the discussion of the declarations and \nthe condition that will transpire in just a moment, that it would be \nclear to all of our colleagues that we have tried to express our \nconcerns about the context in which the treaty must be considered, and \nthat our colleagues will agree with us that these are all important \ndeclarations and it is an important condition that we place upon the \ntreaty. I, of course, strongly urge the acceptance of that document.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I, too, would like to make some comments when \nthis matter is finally debated and voted on because I think it is \nimportant for all of our colleagues to hear something of the background \nof this treaty prior to the time--I say immediately prior to the time--\nthat the treaty is voted upon.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to commend Senators Helms, Lugar, \nand Pell for their fine work on the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks II \n[START II] Treaty. I rise to support this treaty, which builds on the \nreductions established under the START I Agreement.\n  Taken together, START I and START II will reduce the deployed \nstrategic offensive arms of the United States and Russia by more than \ntwo-thirds. This treaty, signed by Presidents George Bush and Boris \nYeltsin in 1993, limits both sides to between 3,500 and 3,000 deployed \nwarheads, Moreover, \n\n[[Page S19215]]\nSTART II obligates Russia and the United States to ban all land-based, \nmultiple warhead ballistic missiles and limits the number of warheads \ndeployed on submarine launched ballistic missiles [SLBMs]. In addition, \nSTART II achieves a long-standing U.S. goal of eliminating the threat \nof Russia's heavy ICBM missile, the 10 warhead SS-18 missiles and their \nlaunch canisters.\n  At the same time, however, the START II Treaty is not without \nloopholes. For instance, while the Russians are obligated to eliminate \ntheir heavy SS-18s ICBM by January 2003, the treaty allows Russia to \nretain 90 SS-18 silos to be converted to accommodate only single-\nwarhead missiles of the SS-25-type. Of course, the United States is \nallowed to inspect such conversion to ensure Russia retains only \nsingle-warhead missiles, as outlined by the Treaty. But one concern I \nhave is that the ``new type'' SS-25 missile Russia is now testing is an \nadvanced follow-on Topol-M missile, larger than the U.S. MX Peacekeeper \nmissiles.\n  On the whole, however, I support this treaty, particularly in light \nof the conditions and declarations added to the Resolution of \nRatification by the Foreign Relations Committee, and those proposed in \nthe form of the ``Manager's Amendment.'' I believe these amendments \nprovide a historical record of the Senate's view on a number of \nnational security issues associated with the START II Treaty. It is \nwith this understanding that I can conditionally support ratification \nof the START II Treaty.\n  I will address a few what I believe are the most important conditions \nand declarations proposed by the committee and the managers' \namendments.\n\n\n         1. start ii and the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty\n\n  The Foreign Relations Committee Resolution of Ratification contains a \ncondition stating that the U.S. government does not accept the view \nimplied by the Russian Federation that Russian ratification of START II \nis contingent upon continued adherence by the United States to Russian \ninterpretations of United States obligations under the 1972 Anti-\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. This condition makes clear that U.S. \nratification of the START II Treaty does not obligate the United States \nto accept any modification, change in scope or extension of the ABM \nTreaty.\n  This condition is wholly warranted, given Russian attempts to expand \nthe scope of the ABM Treaty to include systems never intended to be \ncovered by that Treaty--theater ballistic missile defenses. Further, by \ngiving its advice and consent to the START II Treaty, the Senate is \nonly agreeing to those limitations, eliminations and reductions of \nstrategic offensive weapons contained in that Treaty.\n  At the same time, I believe it is important to be on record stating \nthe converse. Namely, that Senate ratification of START II must in no \nway be construed by Russia as changing our rights to renegotiate \nchanges to the ABM Treaty or our right to withdraw from that Treaty \nshould supreme national interests warrant it. Which is why I believe \nthe Managers's amendment, in the form of a declaration, is an essential \nsupplement to the language already contained in the Committee's \nresolution of ratification.\n  This manager's amendment adds a new section to specify that \nratification does not change any of the rights of either Party with \nrespect to Articles 13 (which allows continual United States/Russian \nconsultation on changes in the strategic situation and their meaning \nfor the ABM Treaty); Article 14 (allowing either Party to propose \namendments to the treaty), and Article 15 (allowing either Party to \nwithdraw if supreme national interests are jeopardized).\n  I believe Articles 13, 14, and 15 are critical provisions of the ABM \nTreaty. The ABM Treaty is outdated. It may have been relevant to the \nstrategic situation in 1972, when deterrence was based on Mutual \nAssured Destruction [MAD]. But MAD is completely irrelevant to the \nstrategic environment of the 1990's. The Soviet Union no longer exists. \nBallistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction are proliferating \nthroughout the Third World. In a 1994 speech, Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Perry declared that, ``we now have the opportunity to create a \nnew relationship, based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, \nbut rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.'' [Speech \nbefore the Harry L. Stimson Center, 9/20/94]. The United States and \nRussia should, as the ABM Treaty envisioned, be discussing plans to \ndeploy a mutual protection system against these growing threats, \nincluding the possibility of amending the ABM Treaty to allow more than \none missile defense site.\n\n\n                     2. Implementation Arrangements\n\n  One particular concern of mine is whether and when the Russian Duma \nwill ratify START II. Perhaps the worst of all possible worlds would be \nif the United States began drawing down its strategic nuclear arsenal \nto conform with the limits established under START II, and Russia had \nnot yet ratified the treaty.\n  I believe, however, that this concern is addressed by a declaration \non implementation arrangements proposed in the managers' amendment. \nSpecifically, the language states that the START II Treaty shall not be \nbinding on the United States until such time as the Duma has ratified \nthe Treaty and the Treaty has entered into force. Equally important is \nthe two-step process set up if the President plans to go below the \nnumber of forces currently planned and consistent with the START II \nTreaty. Under these circumstances, the President is called upon to: \nFirst, consult with the Senate on how these reductions would effect \nU.S. national security; and second, take no such action until a \nPresidential determination is sent to the Senate stating that such \nreductions are in the U.S. national security interest.\n\n\n                            3. Noncompliance\n\n  Recognizing that compliance is critical to the integrity of any arms \ncontrol agreement, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Resolution of \nRatification contains a condition on noncompliance. This condition \nstates that if the President determines that a Party to either START I \nor START II is acting inconsistently with the object and purpose of \neither Treaty, the President shall submit a report to the Senate \ndetailing the impact of such noncompliance on the Treaty and seek to \nbring the noncompliant Party into compliance through diplomatic means. \nFurther, any modification or change in obligations shall be submitted \nfor Senate advice and consent. If such noncompliance persists, the \nPresident is called upon a to seek a Senate resolution in support of \ncontinued U.S. adherence to the Treaty or Treaties in question.\n  I believe this condition is important for several reasons. First, it \nsets a standard for evaluating noncompliant behavior. Second, \nunderlying the reporting requirement is the understanding that \nnoncompliant behavior by Russia could actually affect the United States \ncontinuing as a party to that treaty. Third, and most important, is \nthat this condition answers the decade-old question of what should be \ndone after a violation is detected. In the case of persistent \nnoncompliance, the Senate, at the President's request, is to vote on \nwhether to remain a party to that treaty.\n  While this condition addresses a number of compliance concerns, the \nmanagers' amendment builds on this language by adding several \ndeclarations. Each of these declarations will help ensure the Senate is \napprised of compliance concerns the United States Government may raise \nwith the Russian Federation through various channels and the outcome of \nsuch discussions.\n  And finally, this language declares that the Senate expects the \nRussian Federation to be ``in strict compliance with the terms of START \nII, as presented to the Senate for advice and consent.''\n\n\n                        4. Nature of Deterrence\n\n  In addition to the declarations offered by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in its Resolution of Ratification, is a declaration, proposed \nby the managers, on the nature of deterrence. This declaration \nrecognizes that offensive forms of deterrence alone cannot address the \nemerging threats to U.S. national security and states that missile \ndefenses are ``a necessary part of new deterrence strategies.''\n  I believe missile defenses make sense not only for addressing growing \nproliferation threats, but also within the \n\n[[Page S19216]]\nstrategic equation where the United States is reducing its nuclear \narsenal to significantly lower levels.\n  The START II Treaty could actually create conditions conducive to \ndeploying effective ballistic missile defenses. As the United States \nand the Russian Federation deploy only single warhead missiles, the old \nargument that missile defenses could be saturated by multiple warheads \nbecomes moot. Further, at the low levels of warheads required by START \nII, both sides should have an incentive to pursue mutual missile \ndefense deployments. Finally, as with other arms control treaties, \nSTART II contains loopholes Russia could exploit to retain a larger, \nmore lethal arsenal, ballistic missile defenses could provide a hedge, \nor insurance policy against possible Russian treaty violations.\n  My concerns about the impact of START II on U.S. national security \nhave been adequately addressed by the Foreign Relations Committee's \nactions and the Managers' amendments which add important conditions and \ndeclarations to the Resolution of Ratification. With this in mind, I \nwill support the START II Treaty Resolution of Ratification, with the \nunderstanding that these conditions and declarations specify certain \nU.S. obligations to be fulfilled.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty by the Senate. The case for ratification is, I believe, \noverwhelming. Both the START I Treaty, negotiated under President \nReagan, and the START II Treaty, negotiated under President Bush, are \nthe end products of bipartisan arms control support by the Congress and \nthe American people. Ratification of the START II Treaty is supported \nby the President as well as by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary \nPerry, as well as General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs.\n  The START II Treaty is a continuation of the substantial reductions \nin strategic weaponry brought about by the signing of the START I \nTreaty. The signing of the START I Treaty occurred after the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall at the end of the cold war, the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union, and the development of democratic movements and free \nelections in the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. These events have \ntransformed the longstanding bipolar relationship between the United \nStates and the now vanished Soviet Union.\n  Given these historic changes, ratification of the START II Treaty is \na very logical step. Upon entry into full force, the START II Treaty \nwill further reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads held in \nthe active inventories of the United States and Russia from about 8,000 \nweapons in START I levels, to between 3,000 and 3,500 weapons, a \nreduction of more than 50 percent.\n  By the time START II is fully implemented, the START I and START II \nTreaties will have led to more than a threefold reduction in the \nnumbers of strategic nuclear warheads online in both sides. Moreover, \nthe entry into force of this country will eliminate all of the land-\nbased multiple warhead or MIRV intercontinental ballistic missiles from \nthe arsenal of both sides.\n  It has long been a goal of U.S. arms control policy both under \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents and Congresses to eliminate these \npoised for instant launch MIRV ICBM's from the inventories of both \nsides. There was too much incentive on both sides if there was warning \nof some attack to feel that these weapons had to be used or lost in \nlarge numbers, and the ratios gave the wrong incentives. Elimination of \nthese land-based ICBM's, a required measure of the START II Treaty, \nwill help avoid a return to hair-trigger strategic posture on both \nsides and put an end to any conceivable incentive for a bolt-from-the-\nblue attack.\n  Ratification of the START II Treaty is a highly cost-effective way to \nreduce the threat to the United States' national security interest \nposed by nuclear weapons. It will eliminate 5,000 warheads from the \nRussian force. Our modest verification costs will be dwarfed by U.S. \ndefense budget savings that will flow both from the reduced threat and \nthe retirements of our excess nuclear weapons and delivery systems.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the ratification of \nthe START II Treaty today and to work to build support and \nunderstanding of the advantages of the START II Treaty among the \nmembers of the Russian Duma prior to the consideration of the treaty \nnext year.\n  There is considerable work that has to be done, Mr. President, by I \nthink Members of this legislative body if we are going to see the \nRussian Duma ratify this treaty. They are very dubious about the \ntreaty. They are very concerned about the antiballistic missile \ndevelopments and discussion and legislation in this country, and it is \ngoing to take a considerable amount of effort on the part of the United \nStates and our other allies, as well as friends of Russia, to see that \nthey ratify this treaty also. It is their decision. We cannot force it. \nBut certainly we ought to have every dialog we can with them on this \nbecause this treaty is truly in the interests not only of both the \nUnited States and Russia but also of mankind.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of ratification \nof the START II Treaty.\n  I would like to begin by summarizing what I see as the three major \nfeatures of this treaty. First, given that Russia remains the only \ncountry that presents a serious nuclear strategic threat to the United \nStates, the treaty effectively addresses three key aspects of this \nthreat: It will eliminate all Russian heavy inter-continental ballistic \nmissiles [ICBMs], it will ban all multiple-warhead ICBMs, and it will \nput a ceiling of 1,750 on the number of nuclear warheads deployed on \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles. Second, the treaty continues a \nprocess of arms reductions that is vital not just to U.S. national \nsecurity but that is also good for the U.S. economy: It will require a \ntwo-thirds reduction of the number of deployed United States and \nRussian strategic nuclear stockpiles by the year 2003. Third, \nreductions in nuclear stockpiles will help to curtail the global \nproliferation of nuclear weapons both by helping to fulfill America's \ncommitment under the NPT to seek an end to the nuclear arms race.\n  In these times of partisan bickering on all sorts of issues, I am \ngratified to see that this treaty had the support of all 18 members of \nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In my remarks today, I will \nspeak about the importance of the Senate providing its advice and \nconsent to the START II ty Treaty--I will not address today any of the \nspecific non-binding policy declarations that appear in the resolution, \nsome of which I find agreeable, and some I do not support. Instead, I \nbelieve it is better to focus on the overall attributes of the Treaty \nand how it advances the U.S. national security interest.\n                          A Verifiable Treaty\n\n  As with all of our arms control and nonproliferation agreements, the \nUnited States will depend heavily (but not exclusively) on ``national \ntechnical means'' to verify the START II treaty. Though I cannot \ndiscuss in any great detail the nature of these methods, I am gratified \nat the confidence that the Joint Chiefs and other members of our \nnational security community have shown in the verification measures in \nthis treaty.\n  On March 1, 1995, Gen. John Shalikashvili, as Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that:\n\n       We believe that the verification procedures are adequate to \n     ensure that we will be able to detect any significant \n     violations. Conversely, we also believe that the verification \n     provisions are sufficiently restrictive to protect ourselves \n     against unnecessary intrusion.\n\n  Similarly, on May 17, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark, the JCS Director \nfor Strategic Plans and Policy, testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that:\n\n       We are confident that the majority of monitoring \n     requirements for START II can be accomplished with high \n     confidence and there is little chance that the Russians can \n     engage in militarily significant cheating. Further, the Joint \n     Staff judges that the military risk to U.S. security \n     associated with any monitoring uncertainties is low. In short \n     the START II Treaty is effectively verifiable.\n\n  Echoing General Shalikashvili, General Clark added that:\n\n       I am confident that the Treaty verification procedures are \n     sufficiently restrictive to protect ourselves from \n     unnecessary intrusion.\n\n  The treaty follows closely the extensive verification regime \nestablished to monitor the START I Treaty. In addition, START II \nincludes some new verification measures, such as: U.S. observation of \nSS-18 silo conversion and  \n\n[[Page S19217]]\n\nmissile elimination procedures; exhibitions and inspections of all \nheavy bombers to confirm weapon loads; and exhibitions of heavy bombers \nreoriented to a conventional role to confirm their observable \ndifferences.\n  The START verification regime for conducting on-site inspections is \nnot an anytime, anywhere type of regime. As a result, both parties to \nthe treaty must always be on the watch for covert facilities or \nactivities. Last February 28, CIA Deputy Director Douglas MacEachin \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that:\n\n       . . . when estimating our chances of detecting and \n     correctly interpreting potential cheating, we judged that the \n     increased openness of Russia and the former Soviet republics \n     makes cheating increasingly difficult to conceal.\n  He added later that:\n\n       The Intelligence Community continues to doubt that Russia \n     will be able to initiate and successfully execute a \n     significant cheating program.\n\n  The use of the term ``increasingly difficult'' rather than \nimpossible, however, only underscores the vital importance of \nmaintaining America's intelligence capabilities (both for collection \nand analysis) to monitor compliance with this treaty. I think this \nconclusion equally applies to all of America's arms control and \nnonproliferation agreements.\n  From my vantage points on the Armed Services Committee and the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I will do my best to ensure that our country \nhas the resources it needs to ensure a high standard of compliance with \nall of these agreements, most particularly START II.\n\n\n                             Looking Ahead\n\n  Ratification of this treaty will constitute an important arms control \nmilestone--it does not, however, constitute the end of the road by any \nmeans. Ratification will set the stage for several additional arms \ncontrol measures that are vitally needed to strengthen U.S. national \nsecurity. The treaty should thus not be viewed in isolation, but should \ninstead be seen as a key stepping stone toward a safer world. By any \nmeasure, the agenda ahead is a lengthy one.\n  We need to get on with ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. We need to strengthen the safeguards that are used to \nmonitor compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We need \nto ensure the conclusion in 1996 of a treaty banning all underground \nnuclear explosions. We need to ensure that our export controls and \nsanctions policies are enforced and implemented in a manner that is \nconsistent with our treaty obligations--and we have a long way to go, I \nam afraid, before we achieve that particular goal. We need to bring the \nBritish, French, and Chinese nuclear stockpiles into the global arms \nreductions process, particularly in the context of START III Treaty \nnegotiations. We need to recognize the continuing value of the Anti-\nBallistic Missile [ABM] Treaty in stabilizing nuclear deterrence and in \nholding down defense expenditures in a post-cold war world.\n  We need to do more--much more--to strengthen controls over bomb-\nusable nuclear materials that are being produced particularly in \nEurope, Russia, and Japan for commercial uses. It is not enough merely \nto pursue a treaty banning the production of such materials for bombs \nor outside of safeguards--the security-related and environmental \nhazards of plutonium recognize no national borders or spurious \ndistinctions between civilian and military uses. We should not seek to \nfacilitate or to legitimize large-scale commercial uses of plutonium--\nwhether safeguarded or not--but should instead explore new measures to \ndiscourage such uses before the nuclear terrorist threat catches up \nwith us.\n  Above all, we need to recognize the relationships that exist between \nall of these important arms control regimes.\n  If the nuclear-weapons states fail to live up to their obligations to \nreduce their strategic stockpiles, this will inevitably have an effect \non the rate of the proliferation of such weapons to additional \ncountries.\n  If the United States abandons the ABM Treaty, this will inevitably \naffect in a most negative way the calculations of Russian leaders on \nboth offensive and defensive nuclear strategies.\n  If we succeed in reducing the stockpiles of the nuclear weapons \nstates, but fail to curb the burgeoning production of new bomb-usable \nnuclear materials (especially plutonium and highly-enriched uranium) \nfor commercial purposes, we should not be surprised to find ourselves \nfacing new nightmares of nuclear terrorism, blackmail, proliferation, \nand extortion down the road.\n  If we neglect the importance of traditional approaches to \nnonproliferation (in particular export controls and sanctions) and \nconcentrate our energies and resources merely on developing offensive \nand defensive military countermeasures to proliferation, we will again \nface a more dangerous world--our priority must remain to prevent, \nrather than to manage, the global spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  With these terms in mind, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor \nof ratification of the START II Treaty. I would like to take this \noccasion to recognize the debt that this treaty owes to the persistent \nwork of Senators Pell, Levin, and other long-time supporters of the \nSTART II Treaty in the Senate. I also credit the leadership of \nPresident Bill Clinton in encouraging timely action by the Senate in \nratifying this important treaty.\n  I can only hope that the bipartisanship the Senate is showing today \nin voting, I hope overwhelmingly, to approve this treaty will echo into \nthe next session, where I am sure it will be needed as much if not more \nthan the treaty itself.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the START II \nTreaty which has finally been brought to the floor of the Senate after \na long, unnecessary, and perhaps fatal delay. I will elaborate on that \nlast point in a moment.\n  But first, let me say that START II represents an unprecedented \nopportunity to dismantle the Soviet nuclear arsenal. I say ``Soviet,'' \nMr. President, because START II would, if implemented, eliminate the \nmost devastating nuclear missiles built by the Soviet Union in the \n1970's and 1980's: Hundreds of multi-warhead missiles of cataclysmic \ndestructive power--among them, the infamous SS-18, which became the \nvery symbol of the Soviet threat.\n  Even as we speak today, these missiles remain deployed in launching \nsilos scattered across a Russian nation undergoing enormous political \nturmoil. They could at a moment's notice be targeted on the United \nStates of America.\n  For the American people, the future of those missiles is a \nfundamental, compelling national security question.\n  The salient feature of START II is its planned elimination of every \nland-based multi-warhead missile in the Soviet-now-Russian arsenal. \nThese were the weapons that, for years, so worried our defense \nestablishment that we expended hundreds of billions of dollars to \ncounter their first-strike potential.\n  Mr. President, that apocalyptic potential remains today.\n  As matters now stand, this threat carries with it considerable irony. \nFor months, the Senate has engaged in yet another round of controversy \nover whether to build an anti-missile system intended to protect the \nUnited States from missile attack.\n  Earlier this week, this body passed a defense authorization \nconfernece report that would require deployment of such a system by \n2003, putting us on a collision course with the ABM Treaty, which has \nbeen the basis for all strategic arms controls agreements over the past \ntwo decades.\n  Any such system, if built, would be monumentally expensive, of highly \nuncertain reliability, likely to provoke additional offensive \ndeployments, and available, at best, only sometime in the next century. \nYet, the START II Treaty during that same period would eliminate with \nverifiable certainty the one serious missile threat the United States \nhas ever faced.\n  The effort over the past several months to eviscerate the ABM Treaty \nhas been driven by those who do not favor the limits in START II, and, \ncorrespondingly, never much cared for the ABM Treaty. They believe that \nthe ABM Treaty prevents us from constructing an impenetrable shield \nagainst all types of ballistic missiles.\n  I admit--a ballistic missile shield is a comforting image. But, as \nour experience with star wars in the 1980's demonstrated, it is not \ngrounded in reality.  \n\n[[Page S19218]]\n\nUnfortunately, that ballistic missile shield, if it could ever overcome \nawesome technical and financial barriers--and I doubt it would, would \nprovide a false sense of security.\n  That is because it would not alleviate a much greater threat--a \nterrorist transporting a nuclear device or its components into the \nUnited States through very conventional means, and detonating that \ndevice near an important landmark.\n  Our focus ought to be in preventing that possibility by improving our \ncapabilities to tract terrorists and securing the many tons of fissile \nmaterial spread across the territory of the former Soviet Union.\n  My colleagues know that last Sunday, the Russian people went to the \npolls and decided to elect a Duma apparently dominated by Communists \nand nationalists who are skeptical about START II and suspicious about \nAmerican motives on the ABM treaty. They do not regard as a mere \ncoincidence that 2003 is the year established for final compliance with \nthe central limits in START II, as well as the target date \nfor deployment of a national missile defense system in the Republican \nplan.\n\n  From their perspective, START II will take away their most effective \nmeans of countering a national missile defense--overwhelming it with \noffensive missiles.\n  While Russian concerns alone should not determine our policy \ndecisions, it would be shortsighted, to say the least, to ignore them \naltogether when Russian behavior and Russian missiles can have a direct \nbearing on our national security.\n  If the Russians decide that we are intent on abrogating the ABM \nTreaty, then they will likely refuse to ratify START II, halt START I \nimplementation, and begin a strategic build-up. We would have to follow \nsuit and waste vast sums of money on deploying more offensive missiles \nand developing more missile defenses.\n  How ironic that would be--in the post-cold war era when we are on the \nverge of ratifying a historic reduction in strategic nuclear weapons--\nto set off an offense-defense spiral that the ABM Treaty was designed \nto prevent, and did prevent for over 20 years.\n  For the past several months many here saw the Communist and \nnationalist clouds building in Russia, and for that reason we \nrepeatedly called for early United States ratification of START II in \norder to encourage similar action by the Duma. That could have locked \nin the gains promised by START II. Unfortunately, we did not act.\n  Now, some reports suggest that the new Duma may wait to see the \nresults of our presidential election before approving START II. I hope \nthat is not the case, because between now and then Russia will hold its \nown presidential election. That election has the potential to rearrange \nRussian politics in ways we cannot predict.\n  Our action today can send a clear signal that we are serious about \nimplementing START II, and provide the incentive for quick action by \nthe Duma.\n  It is my hope that the Senate's advice and consent to START II will \nencourage the Duma to act in kind prior to the G-7 Nuclear Safety \nSummit in Moscow next April. Due to the crowded political calendar in \nboth countries later in the year, the summit would be the ideal, and \nmaybe last, opportunity for Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin to exchange \ninstruments of ratification. I would also hope that the two leaders can \nat that time agree to begin negotiations toward a new agreement on even \nfurther reductions.\n  I would just like to add here that I am concerned with some of the \nhortatory language that is contained both within the committee report \nand the proposed managers' amendment. In particular, I find the \nlanguage on missile defenses and nuclear testing to be particularly \nproblematic. However, I have decided not to object at this time because \nI believe it is absolutely critical that we act quickly and favorably \non START II. I think it is also important to emphasize for all \nconcerned that the language to which I and many of my colleagues object \nis non-binding.\n  Mr. President, the ultimate entry into force of the START II Treaty \nmay well depend on a choice we must make in the months ahead: Do we \npursue a technically questionable and prohibitively expensive national \nmissile defense which would doom START II, or do we pursue a path that \npromises with greater certainty and less cost to eliminate the very \nmissiles such a system would defend against?\n  In my view, there is not much of a choice. Star Wars technology is \nuncertain, costly, and likely to undermine our national security. On \nthe other hand, arms control agreements like START II are proven, cost-\neffective, and will reduce the nuclear threat to the United States.\n  The American people, having sent us here to protect the security of \ntheir homes and children, are entitled to the only rational choice: We \nshould ratify START II and abandon the reckless plans for an ABM \nTreaty-busting national missile defense system.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today is a very important day in the \nhistory of the modern world. It is a crucially important day in the \nhistory of human-kind's efforts to achieve peace and avoid armed \nconflict.\n  For over 50 years following the end of the World War II, the United \nStates was locked in what came to be known universally as the cold war. \nThat war, while it only occasionally broke into open armed conflict, \nwas a very destructive conflict. It consumed the wealth of much of the \nworld as armaments were stacked upon armaments to prepare for the open \nconflict that we hoped would never come.\n  There have been countless periods in the history of the world during \nwhich there have been uneasy periods of standoff of one power against \nanother. But there has been none even nearly approximating the cold \nwar. The reason is terrifyingly simple. The cold war was the first time \nin the world's history when human beings possessed weapons of mass \ndestruction in the form of thermonuclear weapons. First the United \nStates and then the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics obtained the \nability to manufacture and use nuclear weapons. Eventually that \ncapability was acquired by other nations. The use of just one such \nweapon is sufficient to annihilate an entire city.\n  The use of many not only could obliterate an entire nation and all \nits people from the face of the earth, but arguably might set in motion \nnatural reactions which could lead to the extinguishment of most if not \nall life on this planet.\n  All of us in this Chamber endured most if not all of the cold war. We \nknow of many of its human costs, although they will never be fully \ncalculated. We also know today that there were a number of occasions \nwhere the world teetered on the very brink of the use of such weapons, \nwhich very likely would have been followed by a general exchange \nbetween the United States and the Soviet Union, and which very likely \nwould have involved use of their nuclear weapons by the other nations \npossessing them.\n\n  What we also know, Mr. President, is that there was and is no higher \nobjective--while preserving the liberties for which this Nation was \nfounded and for the preservation of which so many have sacrificed so \ngreatly--than to reduce both the threat of and the ability to wage \nnuclear war.\n  This objective has been reflected in numerous efforts initiated by \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations to negotiate limits on \nthe manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons, to negotiate limits on \nthe types, capabilities, and numbers of weapons systems armed with \nnuclear devices, and to negotiate various other measures designed to \nreduce the likelihood that a nuclear weapon will be used in anger.\n  The treaty between the United States of America and the Russian \nFederation on further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive \narms--the so-called START II Treaty--which is before the Senate today \nis one of the most significant milestones among these efforts. It \nbuilds upon the foundation established by the original START Treaty \nsigned by the United States and the Russian Federation in 1991.\n  That first START Treaty was the first treaty that provided for real \nreductions--rather than just limits on further growth--of \nstrategic offensive arms of both nations. It provided for overall \nreductions of 30 to 40 percent, and reductions of up to 50 percent in \nthe most threatening systems. That treaty now acts to emphasize and \nenhance stability in times of international crisis. It provides for \nrough  \n\n[[Page S19219]]\n\n\nequality of strategic forces between the two sides, and was \npainstakingly crafted to be effectively verifiable. That treaty will \nresult in the elimination of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems \nfrom the territories of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine and accession \nof these three states to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear \nweapons [the NPT] as non-nuclear state parties. As a result, after 7 \nyears, of the states formed upon the disintegration of the former \nSoviet Union, only Russia will possess deployed strategic offensive \narms.\n  START II adds to these very significant accomplishments. It increases \nthe stability of the nuclear balance. It bans deployment of the most \ndestabilizing type of nuclear weapons system--land-based \nintercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple independently \ntargetable nuclear warheads [or MIRV's]. Under its terms, Russia and \nthe United States will reduce the number of nuclear weapons each \npossesses to 3,500.\n  Mr. President, some believe that with the passing of the former \nSoviet Union, and the economic weakness and chaos that have in many \nrespects permeated its successor states, there no longer is a danger of \nnuclear conflict. Some would argue that these nations and their people, \nalready struggling to make their way in a world that passed them by \nduring the cold war period, would never risk losing literally \neverything they are and have by initiating a nuclear conflict. But that \nis an incomplete if not naive view of the world situation.\n  As long as nuclear weapons exist, there is a danger they will be \nused. Disagreements can escalate, and sometimes become dangerously \npersonalized as national leaders struggle to maintain power and \ncontrol. It is conceivable that rogue elements of a nation's military \ncould gain control of one or more weapons--or even the entire nuclear \napparatus of a nation--and launch one or more or many of those weapons. \nThere are countless scenarios where those weapons could be employed. \nThere is no better reason than this simple reality, Mr. President, for \nputting in place the reductions contained in the START II Treaty.\n  As we seek to bring to a conclusion the business of the Senate prior \nto this weekend of great significance to families and religions, I will \nnot take the Senate's time to exhaustively detail all of the reason why \nthis treaty will provide increased stability to the world, will reduce \nthe danger of nuclear conflict and nuclear accidents, and will do this \nwhile preserving the defensive capability of the United States so that \nit unquestionably can effectively defend our democracy and liberties \nthat are so precious to us. The legislative record of the treaty is \navailable for all to see, and other Senators already have spoken \neloquently to these issues.\n  There is simply no question, Mr. President, that the immediate \nratification of this treaty is in the best interests of the United \nStates and, indeed, the world. All of our most senior national security \nleadership concurs. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff joined by \nall the Chiefs have so testified. Our intelligence leadership has so \ntestified. Our diplomatic leadership has to testified. The agreement is \nneither partisan nor regional. While exceedingly little of vital \nimportance occurs with absolutely unanimity, the START II Treaty comes \nas close as any major foreign policy or national security issue of \nwhich I am aware.\n\n  It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I was distressed, and \nremain distressed, that the Senate's action on this treaty was delayed \nfor many months when the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nheld it hostage in an attempt to compel Members of this body to \nacquiesce to his plan to constrain the diplomatic capacity and media \nthat are of critical importance to our Nation and its leaders--\nregardless of their party affiliation. For months many other Members of \nthis body and I struggled to free this treaty for Senate action.\n  Finally, last month, the negotiation effort succeeded, and we were \nassured the Senate would at least take up the treaty before the end of \nthis year. I am pleased to have helped accomplish this.\n  It is not just that it was and is regrettable that, because of this \nhostage-taking, the United States did not do everything in its power to \nspeed this beneficial treaty into effect, and thereby the increased \nsafety and security it offers have been unnecessarily delayed. That is \nregrettable enough--and I only hope that history does not show that \nthis failure resulted in loss of life. The delay, in fact, has placed \nthe entire treaty in jeopardy. While I think there is virtually no \ndoubt that the Senate, when it is permitted to finally act on this \ntreaty, will vote overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis to approve it, \nthe deteriorating situation in the Russian Federation makes approval by \nthe Russian Duma increasingly uncertain. As nationalists and \nreconstructed Communists push successfully for greater influence in \nRussia, it is quite possible they will reject an treaty they see as \nresulting in too great a reduction in power-projecting weapons systems.\n  So, ironically, in the very kind of situation where the reduced \nthreat of nuclear conflict would be most significant and valuable, the \nshort-sighted actions here in the Senate could deny us and the world \nthe heightened security this treaty offers. That would be a catastrophe \nof monumental proportions, Mr. President. If it comes to pass, history \nwill properly and caustically criticize those who have delayed Senate \naction or acquiesced in that delay.\n\n  Before I complete my remarks, Mr. President, I want to address a \nrelated issue that is of great importance. There are some who would \ndraw a connection between this treaty and the establishment of a \nballistic missile defense. That, in turn, raises questions of continued \nadherence to the anti-ballistic missile or ABM Treaty. Such a linkage \nof this treaty to the question of ballistic missile defense is not \nnecessary, is inappropriate, and could be tremendously \ncounterproductive.\n  I have long and strongly supported development of effective defenses \nagainst theater and short-range ballistic missiles. Our troops and \nsailors deserve such protection whenever they are sent into harm's way. \nBut I have equally fervently supported the ABM Treaty as a critical \nlink in the chain of United States-Russian relations. So much about the \ncold war--and so much in our new and still unfamiliar post-Soviet \nrelationship--is dependent on each nation feeling confident of its \nability to protect its homeland and repel aggressors. The ABM Treaty \nhas made and continues to make an absolutely vital contribution to that \nconfidence. The treaty provides confidence that, in case of an attack \nlaunched by the other side, the attacked nation would be able to \neffectively counterattack with its ballistic missiles. This uneasy but \neffective balance acted to keep the cold war from ever going hot.\n  Now, in the form of the START Treaty and the START II Treaty, we are \nreducing the terror arrayed on both sides, and reducing the likelihood \nthat what remains will be used in anger. But the confidence must \nremain. The START II Treaty increases confidence on both sides. Nothing \nin it prejudices the consideration of how to provide for defense \nagainst theater and short-range ballistic missiles while maintaining \nthe critical balancing tool of the ABM Treaty. Ratification of the \nSTART II Treaty certainly does not increase the need for a national \nmissile defense that would be in violation of the ABM Treaty--to the \ncontrary, it reduces the danger of attack and removes the most \nthreatening of the Russian nuclear delivery systems.\n  Mr. President, immediately is not too soon to provide the Senate's \noverwhelming approval of this treaty. All who labored in its \nnegotiation are to be commended for their service to the security of \nthis Nation, the security of the world, and the safety of our citizens \nand those around the globe. I compliment especially the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and the distinguished ranking \nDemocratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell, and \ntheir staffs, for their roles in managing the treaty and moving it \ntoward approval by the Senate. I urge the majority leader, and the \nDemocratic leader, to ensure that the Senate acts finally and \nexpeditiously on the treaty just as soon as the Senate returns to \nsession after the holidays.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today--at long last--we discuss START II. \nI urge this body to ratify it quickly.\n  START II is a truly historic treaty. It will cut the number of the \nworld's \n\n[[Page S19220]]\nnuclear weapons in half, getting rid of nearly 4,000 deployed H-bombs \nin Russia and about the same number here. An overwhelming number of our \ncitizens favor implementing this treaty, and a large number of elected \nofficials on both sides of the aisle have expressed their support for \nit.\n  Mr. President, START II should be ratified for many reasons. First, \nSTART II destroys weapons. This reduces the risk of an accidental \nlaunch. Second, every Russian weapon destroyed is a weapon we don't \nneed to defend against. The following table, which I ask unanimous \nconsent be printed in the Record, shows the numbers and kinds of ICBMs \nthat can be eliminated under START II.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles--Eliminated Under START II     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Delivery system                  Launchers     Warheads \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSS-18.........................................          188        1,880\nSS-19.........................................      \\1\\ 170        1,020\nSS-24.........................................           46          460\nSLBM's........................................  ...........      \\2\\ 600\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total...................................          304        3,960\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Some SS-19s may be converted to carry only a single warhead in order\n  to offset the cost of developing a new launcher.                      \n\\2\\ Based on limit of 1,750 submarine launched ballistic missiles. The  \n  current Russian arsenal of SLBMs is estimated at 2,350.               \n                                                                        \nSource: Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Nuclear Notebook, September/     \n  October 1995.                                                         \n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Additionally, destroying weapons saves taxpayers' money. \nJust look at the current defense authorization bill. As my friend from \nNew Mexico pointed out in the report to the Defense Authorization Act, \nthe act ``proposes a nuclear weapons manufacturing complex sized to \nmeet a need of a hedge stockpile far above the active START II \nstockpile of 3,500 weapons.'' The total cost of producing our nuclear \nweapons to date is about $4 trillion. Compare that with our $5 trillion \nnational debt. In 1995 alone, $12.4 billion was spent to build, \noperate, and maintain strategic nuclear weapons. If we ratify START II \nwe can give taxpayers the double peace dividend of higher security at \nlower cost.\n  Even if START II were fully implemented, we would have more than \n3,000 deployed strategic missiles--500 warheads on missiles in silos, \n1,680 warheads on submarine-launched missiles, and 1,320 on airplanes. \nFurthermore, an additional 4,000 nuclear weapons would remain in our \nstockpile. Surely, this will be more than enough atomic fire-power to \ncounter any conceivable threat to the United States.\n  Mr. President, Russia and other former Soviet Republics are more open \nthan ever before. We have all seen the unprecedented pictures on \ntelevision of Russian missiles and airplanes being destroyed. This new \nopenness will make START II even more verifiable then START I. With the \nrecent Russian elections and the presidential election season just \nstarting, we must act now to keep this olive branch from withering.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we need to ratify START II quickly. It \nis not in the national interest to play politics over the ratification \nof any treaty. Russian President Yeltsin needs quick American \nratification of START II to help get the Russian Parliament to ratify \nit. We need the security of fewer Russian warheads now. We need to stop \nspending so much money making our nuclear weapons now. We can use the \nwarheads we have now to defend America. We need to ratify START II now.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we have checked with both sides of the \naisle to make certain that all parties are in agreement, and after \nthat, I ask unanimous consent that the START II Treaty be advanced \nthrough its various parliamentary procedure stages up to and including \nthe presentation of the resolution of ratification, and the managers' \namendments which I will offer after consultation with Senator Pell be \ndeemed agreed to, and that no further amendments be in order to the \nresolution of ratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the treaty will be \nconsidered as having passed through its various parliamentary stages up \nto and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That (a) the Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Moscow on \n     January 3, 1993, including the following protocols and \n     memorandum of understanding, all such documents being \n     integral parts of and collectively referred to as the ``START \n     II Treaty'' (contained in Treaty Document 103-1), subject to \n     the conditions of subsection (b) and the declarations of \n     subsection (c):\n       (1) The Protocol on Procedures Governing Elimination of \n     Heavy ICBMs and on Procedures Governing Conversion of Silo \n     Launchers of Heavy ICBMs Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms \n     (also known as the ``Elimination and Conversion Protocol'').\n       (2) The Protocol on Exhibitions and Inspections of Heavy \n     Bombers Relating to the Treaty Between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms (also known as the ``Exhibitions and \n     Inspections Protocol'')\n       (3) The Memorandum of Understanding on Warhead Attribution \n     and Heavy Bomber Data Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms \n     (also known as the ``Memorandum on Attribution'').\n       (b) Conditions.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following conditions, which shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) Noncompliance.--If the President determines that a \n     party to the Treaty Between the United States of America and \n     the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Moscow on \n     July 3, 1991 (in this resolution referred to as the ``START \n     Treaty'') or to the START II Treaty is acting in a manner \n     that is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the \n     respective Treaty or is in violation of either the START or \n     START II Treaty so as to threaten the national security \n     interests of the United States, then the President shall--\n       (A) consult with and promptly submit a report to the Senate \n     detailing the effect of such actions on the START Treaties;\n       (B) seek on an urgent basis a meeting at the highest \n     diplomatic level with the noncompliant party with the \n     objective of bringing the noncompliant party into compliance;\n       (C) in the event that a party other than the Russian \n     Federation is determined not to be in compliance--\n       (i) request consultations with the Russian Federation to \n     assess the viability of both START Treaties and to determine \n     if a change in obligations is required in either treaty to \n     accommodate the changed circumstances, and\n       (ii) submit for the Senate's advice and consent to \n     ratification any agreement changing the obligations of the \n     United States; and\n       (D) in the event that noncompliance persists, seek a Senate \n     resolution of support of continued adherence to one or both \n     of the START Treaties, notwithstanding the changed \n     circumstances affecting the object and purpose of one or both \n     of the START Treaties.\n       (2) Treaty Obligations.--Ratification by the United States \n     of the START II Treaty obligates the United States to meet \n     the conditions contained in this resolution of ratification \n     and shall not be interpreted as an obligation by the United \n     States to accept any modification, change in scope, or \n     extension of the Treaty Between the United States of America \n     and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation \n     of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, signed at Moscow on May \n     26, 1972 (commonly referred to as the ``ABM Treaty'').\n       (3) Financing Implementation.--The United States \n     understands that in order to be assured of the Russian \n     commitment to a reduction in arms levels, Russia must \n     maintain a substantial stake in financing the implementation \n     of the START II Treaty. The costs of implementing the START \n     II Treaty should be borne by both parties to the Treaty. The \n     exchange of instruments of ratification of the START II \n     Treaty shall not be contingent upon the United States \n     providing financial guarantees to pay for implementation of \n     commitments by Russia under the START II Treaty.\n       (4) Exchange of Letters.--The exchange of letters--\n       (A) between Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and \n     Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, dated December \n     29, 1992, regarding SS-18 missiles and launchers now on the \n     territory of Kazakstan,\n       (B) between Secretary of State Eagleburger and Minister of \n     Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, dated December 29, 1992, and \n     December 31, 1992, regarding heavy bombers, and\n       (C) between Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev and Secretary \n     of Defense Richard \n\n[[Page S19221]]\n     Cheney, dated December 29, 1992, and January 3, 1993, making assurances \n     on Russian intent regarding the conversion and retention of \n     90 silo launchers of RS-20 heavy intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles (ICBMs) (all having been submitted to the Senate \n     associated with the START II Treaty),\n\n     are of the same force and effect as the provisions of the \n     START II Treaty. The United States shall regard actions \n     inconsistent with obligations under those exchanges of \n     letters as equivalent under international law to actions \n     inconsistent with the START II Treaty.\n       (5) Space-launch vehicles.--Space-launch vehicles composed \n     of items that are limited by the START Treaty or the START II \n     Treaty shall be subject to the obligations undertaken in the \n     respective treaty.\n       NTM and cuba.--The obligation of the United States under \n     the START Treaty not to interfere with the national technical \n     means (NTM) of verification of the other party to the Treaty \n     does not preclude the United States from pursuing the \n     question of the removal of the electronic intercept facility \n     operated by the Government of the Russian Federation at \n     Lourdes, Cuba.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Cooperative threat reductions.--Pursuant to the Joint \n     Statement on the Transparency and Irreversibility of the \n     Process of Reducing Nuclear Weapons, agreed to in Moscow, May \n     10, 1995, between the President of the United States and the \n     President of the Russian Federation, it is the sense of the \n     Senate that both parties to the START II Treaty should attach \n     high priority to--\n       (A) the exchange of detailed information on aggregate \n     stockpiles of nuclear warheads, on stocks of fissile \n     materials, and on their safety and security;\n       (B) the maintenance at distinct and secure storage \n     facilities, on a reciprocal basis, of fissile materials \n     removed from nuclear warheads and declared to be excess to \n     national security requirements for the purpose of confirming \n     the irreversibility of the process of nuclear weapons \n     reduction; and\n       (C) the adoption of other cooperative measures to enhance \n     confidence in the reciprocal declarations on fissile material \n     stockpiles.\n       (2) Asymmetry in reductions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the START or \n     START II Treaty, the President should, within the parameters \n     of the elimination schedules provided for in the START \n     Treaties, regulate reductions in the United States strategic \n     nuclear forces so that the number of accountable warheads \n     under the START and START II Treaties possessed by the \n     Russian Federation in no case exceeds the comparable number \n     of accountable warheads possessed by the United States to an \n     extent that a strategic imbalance endangering the national \n     security interests of the United States results.\n       (3) Expanding strategic arsenals in countries other than \n     russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that, if during the \n     time the START II Treaty remains in force or in advance of \n     any further strategic offensive arms reductions the President \n     determines there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the START II Treaty so as \n     to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the START II Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (4) Substantial further reductions.--Cognizant of the \n     obligation of the United States under Article VI of the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons of July 1, \n     1968 ``to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at \n     any early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on \n     general and complete disarmament under strict and \n     effective international control'', it is the sense of the \n     Senate that in anticipation of the ratification and entry \n     into force of the START II Treaty, the Senate calls upon \n     the parties to the START II Treaty to seek further \n     strategic offensive arms reductions consistent with their \n     national security interests and calls upon the other \n     nuclear-weapon states to give careful and early \n     consideration to corresponding reductions of their own \n     nuclear arsenals.\n       (5) Missile technology control regime.--The Senate urges \n     the President to insist that the Republic of Belarus, the \n     Republic of Kazakstan, Ukraine, and the Russian Federation \n     abide by the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime (MTCR). For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``Missile Technology Control Regime'' means the policy \n     statement between the United States, the United Kingdom, the \n     Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and \n     Japan, announced April 16, 1987, to restrict sensitive \n     missile relevant transfers based on the MTCR Annex, and any \n     amendment thereto.\n       (6) Further arms reduction obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval international \n     agreements that would obligate the United States to reduce or \n     limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in a \n     militarily significant manner only pursuant to the treaty \n     power as set forth in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the \n     Constitution.\n       (7) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification with respect to the INF \n     Treaty. For purposes of this declaration, the term ``INF \n     Treaty'' refers to the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols, approved by the Senate on May \n     27, 1988.\n\n  Mr. Pell. Mr. President, the amendments the Senator from Indiana [Mr. \nLugar] and I will accept today, represent a bipartisan effort to reach \na reasonable consensus in the committee and with regard to the floor \naction. In particular, I would note the effective and valuable role \nplayed in this process by the bipartisan Senate Arms Control Observer \nGroup at the initiative of its administrative cochairman, the Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Stevens], who worked very closely with a number of the \ngroup's members in the START II issue, including Senator Lugar, Senator \nLevin, and myself.\n  The package also includes an amendment included on behalf of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence requiring a Presidential \ncertification that we have sufficient national technical means to \nverify Russian compliance. The amendment is a positive addition, and we \naccept it.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that when \nthe Senate resumes executive session to consider the resolution of \nratification, there be 6 hours for debate, to be equally divided in the \nusual form, with unlimited additional time under the control of Senator \nThurmond; and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution of ratification, \nwithout further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PELL. Certainly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think we should show that Mira Baratta, working with \nSenator Dole, has been very helpful in working with this group.\n  Mr. PELL. I concur in your thought.\n  Mr. LUGAR. A point of parliamentary clarification. Am I correct to \nassume that the report of the Foreign Relations Committee resolution \nratification is before the body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding of the \nunanimous-consent propounded.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3111\n\n         (Purpose: Regarding interpretation of the ABM Treaty)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. The unanimous-consent request stated I would submit, as a \nmanager, amendments. I have submitted those to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the information of the Senate, the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself and Mr. \n     PELL, proposes amendments en bloc numbered 3111.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 1(b)(2) of the resolution of ratification, \n     insert ``(A)'' after ``START II Treaty''.\n       In section 1(b)(2), before the period at the end, insert \n     ``, and (B) changes none of the rights of either Party with \n     respect to the provisions of the ABM Treaty, in particular, \n     Articles 13, 14, and 15''.\n       At the end of section 1(b) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new condition:\n       (7) Implementation arrangements.--(A) The START II Treaty \n     shall not be binding on the United States until such time as \n     the Duma of the Russian Federation has acted pursuant to its \n     constitutional responsibilities and the START II Treaty \n     enters into force in accordance with Article VI of the \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If the START II Treaty does not enter into force \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A), and if the President plans to \n     implement reductions of United States strategic nuclear \n     forces below those currently planned and consistent with the \n     START Treaty, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no action to reduce United States strategic \n     nuclear forces below that currently planned and consistent \n     with the START Treaty until he submits to the Senate his \n     determination that such reductions are in the \n\n[[Page S19222]]\n     national security interest of the United States.\n       In section 1(c)(2) of the resolution of ratification, \n     insert ``(A)'' immediately after ``Reductions.--''.\n\n       At the end of section 1(c)(2), insert the following:\n       (B) Recognizing that instability could result from an \n     imbalance in the levels of strategic offensive arms, the \n     Senate calls upon the President to submit a report in \n     unclassified form to the Committees on Foreign Relations and \n     Armed Services of the Senate not later than January 31 of \n     each year beginning with January 31, 1997, and continuing \n     through such time as the reductions called for in the START \n     II Treaty are completed by both parties, which report will \n     provide--\n       (i) details on the progress of each party's reductions in \n     strategic offensive arms during the previous year;\n       (ii) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the START II Treaty or specifies \n     any act of noncompliance by the Russian Federation; and\n       (iii) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance \n     endangering the national security interests of the United \n     States exists.\n       In section 1(c)(4) of the resolution of ratification--\n       (1) strike ``the parties'' and all that follows through \n     ``national security interests'' and insert ``the President to \n     seek further strategic offensive arms reductions to the \n     extent consistent with United States national security \n     interests''; and\n       (2) strike ``it is the sense of the Senate that'' and \n     insert in ``and''.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declarations:\n       (8) Compliance.--Concerned by the clear past pattern of \n     Soviet noncompliance with arms control agreements and \n     continued cases of noncompliance by the Russian Federation, \n     the Senate declares that--\n       (A) the START II Treaty is in the interests of the United \n     States only if both the United States and the Russian \n     Federation are in strict compliance with the terms of the \n     Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification, such compliance being measured by \n     performance and not by efforts, intentions, or commitments to \n     comply;\n       (B) the Senate expects the Russian Federation to be in \n     strict compliance with its obligations under the terms of the \n     START II Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification; and\n       (C) Given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the Administration to offer regular briefings, but \n     not less than four times per year, to the Committees on \n     Foreign Relations and Armed Services on compliance issues \n     related to the START II Treaty. Such briefings shall include \n     a description of all U.S. efforts in U.S./Russian diplomatic \n     channels and bilateral fora to resolve the compliance issues \n     and shall include, but would not necessarily be limited to, \n     the following:\n       i. Any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Implementation \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings;\n       ii. Any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Implementation Commission, within thirty days of such \n     meetings; and\n       iii. Any Presidential determination that the Russian \n     Federation is in non-compliance with or is otherwise acting \n     in a manner inconsistent with the object and purpose of the \n     START II Treaty, within thirty days of such a determination, \n     in which case the President shall also submit a written \n     report, with an unclassified summary, explaining why it is in \n     the national security interests of the United States to \n     continue as a party to the START II Treaty.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Submission of future agreements as treaties.--The \n     Senate declares that following Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty, any agreement or \n     understanding which in any material way modifies, amends, or \n     reinterprets United States or Russian obligations under the \n     START II Treaty, including the time frame for implementation \n     of the Treaty, should be submitted to the Senate for its \n     advice and consent to ratification.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Nature of deterrence.--(A) On June 17, 1992, Presidents \n     Bush and Yeltsin issued a Joint Understanding and a Joint \n     Statement at the conclusion of their Washington Summit, the \n     first of which became the foundation for the START II Treaty. \n     The second, the Joint Statement on a Global Protection \n     System, endorsed the cooperative development of a defensive \n     system against ballistic missile attack and demonstrated the \n     belief by the governments of the United States and the \n     Russian Federation that strategic offensive reductions and \n     certain defenses against ballistic missiles are stabilizing, \n     compatible, and reinforcing.\n       (B) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that:\n       (i) The long-term perpetuation of deterrence based on \n     mutual and severe offensive nuclear threats would be outdated \n     in a strategic environment in which the United States and the \n     Russian Federation are seeking to put aside their past \n     adversarial relationship and instead build a relationship \n     based upon trust rather than fear.\n       (ii) An offense-only form of deterrence cannot address by \n     itself the emerging strategic environment in which, as \n     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin said in January 1994, \n     proliferators acquiring missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction ``may have acquired such weapons for the express \n     purpose of blackmail or terrorism and thus have a \n     fundamentally different calculus not amenable to deterrence. \n     . . . New deterrent approaches are needed as well as new \n     strategies should deterrence fail.''.\n       (iii) Defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail. Because deterrence may be inadequate to \n     protect United States forces and allies abroad, theater \n     missile defense is necessary, particularly the most capable \n     systems of the United States such as THAAD, Navy Upper Tier, \n     and the Space and Missile Tracking System. Similarly, because \n     deterrence may be inadequate to protect the United States \n     against long-range missile threats, missile defenses are a \n     necessary part of new deterrent strategies. Such defenses \n     also are wholly in consonance with the summit statements from \n     June 1992 of the Presidents of the United States and the \n     Russian Federation and the September 1994 statement by \n     Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, who said, ``We now \n     have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not \n     on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather on \n     another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''.\n       (iv) As the governments of the United States and Russia \n     have built upon the June 17, 1992, Joint Understanding in \n     agreeing to the START II Treaty, so too should these \n     governments promptly undertake discussions based on the Joint \n     Statement to move forward cooperatively in the development \n     and deployment of defenses against ballistic missiles.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Report on use of foreign excess ballistic missiles for \n     launch services.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should not issue licenses for the use of a foreign \n     excess ballistic missile for launch services without first \n     submitting a report to Congress, on a one-time basis, on the \n     implications of the licensing approval on nonproliferation \n     efforts under the Treaty and on the United States space \n     launch industry.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) United states commitments ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.--The \n     Senate declares that the United States is committed to \n     ensuring the safety, reliability, and performance of its \n     nuclear forces. To this end, the United States undertakes the \n     following additional commitments:\n       (A) The United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining \n     nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities, that \n     will ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the \n     United States nuclear arsenal at the START II levels and meet \n     requirements for hedging against possible international \n     developments or technical problems, in conformance with \n     United States policies and to underpin deterrence.\n       (B) The United States is committed to reestablishing and \n     maintaining sufficient levels of production to support \n     requirements for the safety, reliability, and performance of \n     United States nuclear weapons and demonstrate and sustain \n     production capabilities and capacities.\n       (C) The United States is committed to maintaining United \n     States nuclear weapons laboratories and protecting the core \n     nuclear weapons competencies therein.\n       (D) As tritium is essential to the performance of modern \n     nuclear weapons, but decays radioactively at a relatively \n     rapid rate, and the United States now has no meaningful \n     tritium production capacity, the United States is committed \n     to ensuring rapid access to a new production source of \n     tritium within the next decade.\n       (E) As warhead design flaws or aging problems may occur \n     that a robust stockpile stewardship program cannot solve, the \n     United States reserves the right, consistent with United \n     States law, to resume underground nuclear testing if that is \n     necessary to maintain confidence in the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile. The United States is committed to maintaining the \n     Nevada Test Site at a level in which the United States will \n     be able to resume testing, within one year, following a \n     national decision to do so.\n       (F) The United States reserves the right to invoke the \n     supreme national interest of the United States to withdraw \n     from any future arms control agreement to limit underground \n     nuclear testing.\n\n\n                               condition\n\n       (a) Conditions.--The Senate's advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following condition, which shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) Presidential certification and report on national \n     technical means.--Within ninety days after the United States \n     deposits instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, \n     the President shall certify that U.S. National Technical \n     Means are sufficient to ensure effective monitoring of \n     Russian compliance with the provisions of the Treaty \n\n[[Page S19223]]\n     governing the capabilities of strategic missile systems. This \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report to the Senate \n     of the United States indicating how U.S. National Technical \n     Means, including collection, processing and analytic \n     resources, will be marshalled to ensure effective monitoring. \n     Such report may be supplemented by a classified annex, which \n     shall be submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations, the \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services \n     and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would note that under the previous \norder those amendments are now agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 3111) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Was there a summary of those amendments and a \nexplanation along with the Senator's submission?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I respond to the distinguished Senator that a summary was \nnot included with the text.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that we be permitted to insert \nin the Record an explanation of each of the provisions within that \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the explanation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                          Amendment Summaries\n\n       Amendment No. 1: Nothing in START II changes the rights of \n     either party to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.\n       Amendment No. 2: Adds the condition that the U.S. shall not \n     implement START II reductions until the Treaty has entered \n     into force.\n       Amendment No. 3: Requires the President to report yearly on \n     symmetrical nuclear weapons reductions.\n       Amendment No. 4: Calls upon the President to consider \n     whether to seek only those strategic future reductions \n     consistent with U.S. National Security interests.\n       Amendment No. 5: States the compliance expectations of the \n     Senate and asks for periodic updates from the administration \n     on compliance issues.\n       Amendment No. 6: States the requirement for Senate advice \n     and consent to any possible future amendments to START II.\n       Amendment No. 7: Discusses the compatibility of offensive \n     deterrence and defenses against ballistic missiles, and calls \n     upon the United States and Russia to implement the Bush/\n     Yeltsin Joint Statement on a Global Protection System.\n       Amendment No. 8: Requests that the President suspend \n     licenses for the use of foreign excess ballistic missiles \n     until he submits a report to the Congress on the implications \n     of the licensing approval on the American space launch \n     industry and on non-proliferation efforts.\n       Amendment No. 9: Declares the United States commitment to \n     ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of its \n     nuclear forces. This includes declaring support for a new \n     production source of tritium and maintaining the capability \n     of resuming underground nuclear testing if there is a \n     national decision to do so.\n       Amendment No. 10: Reviews Intelligence Committee issues.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, one more point of parliamentary inquiry. Is \nthe status now of the START II Treaty proceedings at a point at which \nno further amendments are in order and the next stage of activity will \nbe when the Senate is next in executive session and this is called \nforward, that 6 hours of debate plus potential unlimited time allotted \nto Senator Thurmond would be in order at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, to the Chair's \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Followed by disposition of the treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague if he has further comment?\n  Mr. PELL. No, no further suggestions. Just to congratulate you, Mr. \nChairman, and Senator Stevens, on guiding this legislation through. I \nthank my own staff, Bill Ashworth, very much indeed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I join the distinguished Senator in thanking the minority \nstaff. Of course I thank Kenny Myers and Lindon Brooks, who has been an \nable backup negotiator of this treaty.\n  In particular, my colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, who, in his \ncochairmanship of the Arms Control Observer Group, did a remarkable job \nin pulling this together for four sessions, with many Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle, to think through the implications of this \ntreaty, to refine the language of the managers' amendment that has been \nsubmitted and adopted today.\n  Does Senator Stevens have further comment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, Mr. President. I do not have. I am grateful for the \ncomments of my two friends. I do have another statement if we are \nfinished with this matter, though.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Is it relevant to START II?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, for the moment I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me ask the Chair, is it proper now to make \nstatements on another matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator the Senate \nis still in executive session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19206-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I have always been enormously proud of \nserving in the U.S. Senate, and am proud today of my ability to be here \nto represent my constituents and to make judgments on the part of this \ncountry in the public sector and on public policy issues. But there are \ndays when one shakes their head and wonders, what on Earth is this \ninstitution, or the institution of Congress, doing or thinking? How can \nwe look as foolish as we look sometimes when the mix of different \nviewpoints in the House and the Senate between conservatives and \nliberals produces a gridlock that then produces a bizarre Byzantine \nresult.\n  I am speaking today of the circumstance when about an hour or two \nago, I was on the floor asking a question of the Republican whip. I \njust watched the other body vote for a resolution of adjournment, and \nthey apparently have now left town and are having no further votes. \nThere will be no additional rollcall votes in the Senate.\n  We have a circumstance where there will be a continuing resolution, \nor a funding bill, coming over from the House that provides sufficient \nfunding so that veterans checks that have been written and are now \nsitting in a warehouse somewhere in this metropolitan area, will be \nable to be delivered--late, however, but, nonetheless, delivered--and a \nnumber of other payments that are important will be made despite the \nfact that the continuing resolution has not been passed to provide \nfunding for all of the Government's activities.\n  So some things will get taken care of this afternoon, I assume, by a \nunanimous consent in the Senate to accept the limited funding \nresolution provided for by the U.S. House. But some things will not be \ntaken care of. Let me describe what is left undone.\n  Today, there are 270,000 Federal workers who stayed at home. They \nstayed at home yesterday and the day before. They are prevented from \ncoming to work. The law prevents them from coming to work because there \nis no funding for them. And, in fact, those who want to come to work \nare told they cannot come to work. Two hundred and seventy thousand \npeople are at home today who should be working.\n  The Speaker of the House said they will be paid anyway as they were \nduring previous shutdowns.\n  In addition to the 270,000 who are not working, you have another \n500,000--one-half million--Federal workers who are working. All of \nthese folks, nearly 800,000 people, get only one-half of a \n\n[[Page S19224]]\npaycheck during their pay period. And if a continuing resolution is not \nenacted by January 3, they will get no pay during the next pay period \nbecause there is not enough money to do that. It has not been \nauthorized by the Congress to do that.\n  So what you have are nurses who work in veterans homes, prison \nguards, law enforcement officials, and others, some of whom make very \nlittle money, who during this pay period now before Christmas will \nreceive half of a paycheck. And if something is not done within the \nnext week and a half, on January 3 will receive zero.\n\n  Some say, ``Well, we will restore that. We will make sure they all \nget their money.'' Is that much solace to one who works on relatively \nlow income, trying to make the payments for heat, food, rent, and to \nbuy Christmas presents?\n  I hope those who sink their teeth into their turkey on Christmas day, \nand who serve in the Congress and who do not allow us to pass a clean \ncontinuing resolution in order to put people back to work to get the \nGovernment operating again, those folks who eat turkey on Christmas Day \nwho prevented that from happening will think about the families that \nare disadvantaged by this.\n  Think about the nurse at the veterans home who only gets half of a \npaycheck. I hope they will think a little bit about the prison guards \nwho get half of a paycheck and think about the 270,000 people who have \nhad to explain to their neighbors why they are not at work, which the \nSpeaker of the House says they will get paid for anyway.\n  Sometimes you just do not have the foggiest understanding why someone \ndoes something.\n  How on Earth can anybody believe that any leverage is provided for \nanyone to say, ``Well, all right, if there is not a balanced budget \nresolution completed by this evening, Friday night, we will insist that \nthe shutdown remain in effect''?\n  Ted Koppel asked five Members of the other body the other evening on \nhis program twice, and they could not answer this question: What \nleverage does it give you to tell 270,000 Federal workers, ``You cannot \ncome to work, you stay home, and we will pay you''? What leverage is \nthat? Is that not saying to the American taxpayers that we are going to \npenalize you in order to pay for work that is not done, we are going to \ndo that so we have some leverage? Ted Koppel says, ``What leverage do \nyou have?''\n  The other day I said that it is sort of like having an argument with \nyour uncle. ``All right, I am angry at my uncle. So I will walk across \nthe street and punch my neighbor.''\n  What on Earth are they talking about, penalizing the American \ntaxpayer by telling 270,000 workers, ``You cannot come to work, you \nstay home, we insist on it, and we are going to demand that you be \npaid''?\n  What is happening is that the House of Representatives has just \nadjourned, or passed an adjournment resolution. They are leaving. No \nmore votes. This Senate is going to have no more record votes. We have \n270,000 people not working, and the Congress is not coming back--\nprobably not next week at all. Maybe the House comes back in the middle \nof the week.\n  So is the assumption here that these 270,000 people who are not \nworking are going to continue not working next week, or maybe the start \nof the week after? Is the assumption that the American taxpayer is \ngoing to keep paying them? Is the assumption that those 270,000 people \nand the other half million people do not matter because they only get a \nhalf a paycheck, and they probably will get no paycheck on January 3rd?\n  Is not the assumption that the Federal workers, the half million \npeople who are working today, do not matter very much and do not matter \nto anybody here if they only get a half a paycheck? Does it not matter \nif they have rent payments to make or food to buy or presents for their \nchildren? It does not matter, I guess.\n  The questions I asked an hour or two ago were, are there conditions \nunder which by the end of today somebody might start thinking a little \nbit and saying, ``Yes, OK, so we have this big fight going on. Let us \nat least let these people go back to work and make sure that they are \nworking and that we pay them for working. Let us at least do that.''\n\n  It does not make much sense to penalize the American taxpayer for our \nstubbornness or intransigence. I guess it is an easy thing to say that \nif we cannot reach an agreement, we will penalize the American \ntaxpayer. It hardly makes any sense to me. I guess I do not understand \nexactly what is at work.\n  I watched the proceedings of the other body about an hour ago. I saw \nan enormous amount of anger, people standing on the floor of the House \nshouting at each other--I mean literally shouting on both sides. I \nunderstand. But, you know, this anger, in my judgment, is aimed in the \nwrong direction. So, Members of Congress are angry? So what do we do? \nWe say to the American people, ``We will get you. What we will do is we \nwill tell 270,000 people not to come to work, and we will still pay \nthem.'' That is quite a way to manifest your anger.\n  Can you imagine a city council in this country, they are sitting \naround the table in their small town in the city council chamber and \nthey say, ``Boy, we cannot agree. We are having a heck of a fight here. \nWe just cannot agree. So do you know what we will do? What we are going \nto do is we are going to tell all of the city workers to stay home. `Do \nnot come to work.' We want to keep paying them, but say to all city \nworkers, `We cannot agree, so you sit at home and we will pay you for \ndoing nothing.' '' Can you imagine how long the residents of that city \nwould take to tell the city council members to take a hike?\n  I just hope all of those in Congress who decided to prevent us from \npassing a clean appropriations bill to put these people back to work \nand to stop this goofy shutdown, I hope that they will find a disguise \nof some sort, because, frankly, if the people who decided we are not \ngoing to have Government up and operating but we will pay 270,000 \npeople for doing nothing and we are going to tell these lower income \npaid Federal workers you get a half pay-check and will probably get no \npaycheck January 3, I hope nobody recognizes them because I think \nsomebody is going to give them a piece of their mind when they get back \nhome.\n  I suppose some of them will say, well, I hope the piece of their mind \nthat we get would be stand firm for a balanced budget.\n  Well, so stand firm. Let us all stand firm for a balanced budget. Let \nus fight for a balanced budget in the right way. Let us balance the \nbudget the right way, protecting priorities.\n  But should we, because we cannot agree yet on the specific recipe for \nbalancing the budget, decide to continue a Government shutdown? I \nunderstand why people are angry with Congress. This is a decision that \nmakes no good sense for anybody. It gives no advantage for Republicans \nor Democrats or conservatives or liberals. It provides only \ndisadvantage for the American taxpayer and for the Federal workers who \nare the pawns--270,000 of whom will stay home and still get paid and a \nhalf a million of whom will get a half a paycheck despite the fact that \nthey worked the full pay period.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me ask for one additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senate is still in session today. And I do not know \nwhether the House is yet out of session. They have said they will have \nno votes. I still hope and I would still ask everyone who serves in \nthis Congress to think a little bit. Just think a little bit. Does this \nmake any sense at all or is this not totally and completely irrational? \nIs this the way to end the year in 1995? Is this the spirit of charity? \nIs this the Christmas spirit? Is this the spirit of compromise to say \nwe are going to use Federal workers as the pawns and say to the \nAmerican taxpayer, you pay the bill?\n  I tell you, Mr. President, if the House and the Senate adjourn and \nquit and say here is the condition under which we quit--a Government \nshutdown--paying people for not working and for those who work deciding \nthey are not going to get the pay for which they worked, the American \npeople have every right to say, what on Earth are you people thinking \nof? Could you not begin thinking like the rest of the American people \nand think through this and do the logical, rational thing? \n\n[[Page S19225]]\n\n  I just hope that by the end of today the leaders and other Members of \nCongress will step aside and agree to a clean CR to keep this \nGovernment up and operating. Let us start doing what the American \npeople expect us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am tempted to offer unanimous consent \nfor a clean CR, but I shall not do that. I hope that it will be done by \nsomeone and not objected to in the next couple of hours, and with that \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COCHRAN). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19223-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19225-S19227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE WELFARE REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments \nabout the vote today on the welfare reform bill. Several people have \ntalked to me about it and have expressed concern that we did not \nreceive the bipartisan support in this piece of legislation that we had \nin the original Senate bill. I want to reflect on that for a few \nmoments and discuss how we might be able to bridge the gap and what \nkind of gap it is that now keeps us apart on the welfare issue.\n  First, I would like to thank the Members of the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle who supported the conference report. I think they will be \nvery proud of the vote they cast as a real step forward for moving this \ncountry toward a kind of reform in the welfare system that the American \npublic and the people who are now in the welfare system or may find \nthemselves at some point in time in their life to be in need of the \nwelfare system have been asking for for a long time.\n  My impression of what went on--just from listening to the debate and \nthe comments of Members who eventually voted against the legislation--\nwas that for the most part Members who voted against this legislation, \non the other side of the aisle in particular, were people who felt that \nthey had to vote against it and they were sort of looking for a reason \nwhy.\n  You say, what do you mean they had to vote against it? The President \ncame out yesterday morning and said he was going to veto the \nlegislation. I think I understand why the President did that. I am not \ntoo sure I think that the President is vetoing this legislation because \nhe substantively disagrees with it on so many counts, but more that I \nthink he sees welfare as being included in these negotiations that are \ngoing on right now in the budget package, and to sign a separate \nwelfare bill sort of takes welfare off the table in the bargaining \nbetween all the other programs that are being considered in trying to \nbalance the budget.\n  I think what the President wanted to do--and I think many Members on \nthe other side agreed with it--is they wanted to keep welfare in play \nin the greater negotiations, and to sign off on one package without \nhaving the interaction of the other programs yet to be determined \nwould, in their estimation, be an unwise move. So I will say to them, \nit is my firm belief that is what is going on here--I will explain that \nlater--that this was more of a tactical move in opposition to this \nlegislation than it really was a substantive move that this legislation \nsomehow did not meet the test of welfare reform as defined by most \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  It was interesting for me to note that the people who debated the \nwelfare reform bill here on the floor the last day, last night and \ntoday, by and large were the 12 people who voted against the \nlegislation when it first came through.\n  So the principal opponents, at least the most vocal opponents, on the \nother side of the aisle were all people who voted against the Senate-\npassed bill, which got 87 votes; and in fact, the only two people that \nI can recollect who debated the bill this morning who had previously \nsupported the bill did so on very narrow and limited grounds.\n\n  In fact, I have had discussions with those Members subsequently--at \nleast one of them--and think some of the grounds on which they base \ntheir opposition actually did not square with the facts. I am not \nsaying that the Senators misrepresented the facts. I am not saying that \nat all.\n  I think in this case, because this bill was moved over here so \nquickly, a lot of the factual information that was in the bill did not \nget out in proper fashion, and there were changes made to the bill in \nthe last couple of days that were simply not disseminated to the other \nside. I think there was some misunderstanding, particularly in the area \nof child care funding, and a look at the facts, I think, would satisfy \nsome of the concerns of Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  I want to go through the points that were made about the welfare bill \nas reasons for opposing it and try to explain why those concerns may \nnot have been as legitimate as some would have originally suggested. \nSome, I believe, are legitimate.\n  I think there was one concern in particular that I know concerned \nMembers on this side of the aisle and, I think, was the result of the \ntwo negative votes over here and, I think, concerned many Members and \ncould be a legitimate reason to, in a sense, hang your hat on \nopposition to this proposal and actually speaks for including welfare \nin the larger budget package. What I am referring to is the Medicaid \nportion or the Medicaid reference in the welfare bill.\n  It was asked by the Governors and others who were negotiating the \nMedicaid portion of the Balanced Budget Act that we, for purposes of \nwelfare, do not guarantee anyone who is on AFDC, guarantee them \ncoverage under Medicaid automatically. That is current law, that if you \nqualify for AFDC, mothers and children automatically qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  Governors have said that now they are in the process during this \nbudget debate of working out amongst themselves and Members of Congress \nto give some more flexibility in establishing who must qualify for \nMedicaid and allowing them the flexibility to make some of their own \ndeterminations.\n  So they asked, for purposes of this bill, do not lock them in quite \nyet on guaranteeing Medicaid coverage for AFDC recipients when, in \nfact, they are negotiating that very issue in their Medicaid \ndiscussions. So, as a result, because this bill moved ahead of the rest \nof the package, we left that provision out and said that is to be \nnegotiated with Medicaid, not with welfare.\n  As a result, many Members seized upon this and said, ``Oh, what we're \ndoing here is unprecedented. It was not in the House bill, it was in \nthe Senate bill. We are cutting off, in the welfare bill, all these \npeople from Medicaid.'' Well, in a sense that is not completely true. \nBut it certainly makes for a very good reason to vote against this bill \neven though you can make several arguments against that point.\n  One is the obvious one I think I have already made in detailing what \nthe problem was; that that decision is going to be made later, and, in \nfact, it may very well say in the Medicaid bill that AFDC recipients \nare covered. That is a decision that is going to be made later. It is \nnot that we are making the decision here affirmatively; it is a \ndecision that will be made, but this was not the appropriate vehicle to \nmake it. That does not soothe, I know, a lot of people, but it is in a \nsense an accurate description of what is going on.\n\n  The other point is--or several other points--according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, all of the children who are on AFDC today \nwould otherwise qualify for Medicaid even if the current legislation \nwhich just passed here were signed by the President. That is, children, \npoor children, would qualify under the Medicaid statute, not under the \nAFDC statute, and therefore would be eligible for Medicaid even if they \nwere not automatically eligible as a result of receiving AFDC. So \nchildren would have been covered anyway.\n  So to say, as some Members said, we are cutting off children by this \nis not \n\n[[Page S19226]]\nan accurate description of at least what the Congressional Budget \nOffice interpreted. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office scored \nthis welfare bill as having all the existing children eligible for \nMedicaid.\n  For example, the Congressional Budget Office said that approximately \nhalf of the women--again, most AFDC recipient parents are women--half \nof the women on AFDC would automatically--or I should not say \nautomatically--would otherwise qualify for Medicaid because of their \nstatus without the automatic qualification under AFDC.\n  So that leaves a block of about half of the women who currently \nreceive AFDC, who qualify under AFDC, who would not otherwise qualify \nfor Medicaid. That is a legitimate debate, and I think Members cited \nthat. It is a legitimate debate as to whether this is the right \napproach to take.\n  My only point was--and I will go back to the first point I made--that \nis an issue to be decided in the Medicaid debate, not in the welfare \ndebate, and it is in the process of being decided.\n  So we have that as, I think, the principal stumbling block and the \nreason that most Members will be able to go back and say this is why \nthis bill was substantively different than the bill that passed the \nSenate because, if you look at everything else, if you look at all the \nother provisions of the welfare reform bill and match it up against the \nwelfare reform bill that passed here with 87-87 votes, there is nary a \nreason for a dissenting vote of anyone who gave assent the first time. \nIn fact, I would suggest that most of the concerns--or many; I should \nnot say most--many of the concerns that were raised on the other side \nabout the potential toughness of the welfare reform bill were solved by \nthe addition, for example, of 1 billion extra dollars in child care.\n  Some comments were made by Members on the other side that child care \nfunding was cut. The Senator from Massachusetts and I had a discussion \nabout that last night, and I attempted to clarify that. I will do it \none more time. The Senate bill that passed last--I guess a few months \nago; I do not know exactly the month--had $8 billion for child care, \nmandatory child care spending for the first 5 years and $2 billion in \nthe sixth and seventh years combined; so a total of 10 billion in \nmandatory entitlement child care dollars.\n  Under the conference bill, in the first 5 years, there was $7.8 \nbillion, not $8 billion as in the original bill, but $7.8 billion, $200 \nmillion less, in the first 5 years. However, in the next 2 years, \ninstead of having $2 billion for child care, there was $3.2 billion for \nchild care. So in a sense, we took $200 million and shifted it forward \nto the sixth and seventh year and added an additional billion dollars \nfor child care.\n  So there is, overall, more money over the 7 years, just $200 million \nless in the first 5, but we shifted it, we did not lose it; we shifted \nit to the sixth and seventh year.\n  Why did we do that? We did it because the Governors asked us to do \nit. You say, ``Why would the Governors ask for the money further out?'' \nThe reason is because the participation standards--now what is that? \nThat is the percentage of people who go on to welfare who are going to \nbe required to go to work.\n  Not everyone who goes on welfare is going to be required to go to \nwork. In fact, in the first year, I believe the number is 20 percent of \nthe people who go on welfare, the States will collect only 20 percent \nof the caseload and say, ``You will be in the time-limited program, the \nother 80 percent will be in the old welfare program.'' That will phase \nup 5 percent a year until we reach 50 percent.\n  When this program is fully phased in, 50 percent of the people who \ncome on to the welfare rolls will be put in a time-limited welfare \nprogram. The other 50 percent will be in the existing program, no time \nlimit.\n  But because it phases in over time and because anyone who is in a \ntime-limited program when you go in--if you are one of the 20 percent \nnext year that goes into the welfare program, under the law as drafted, \nyou get 2 years of AFDC without having to work. So no one will be \nrequired to work under this law--since the block grant in this bill \ndoes not go into effect until October 1, 1996--so the first person who \nwalks into the door on October 1, 1996 who is now subject to this law, \n2 years later is October 1998, that is the first person who has to work \nunder this law. And, again, 20 percent of the caseload will have to do \nthat, and many of those 20 percent, obviously, will have found work or \ngotten off the program anyway, so it is only a small percentage of the \n20 percent.\n  What am I saying? The reason they want to backload it is because as \nparticipation rates increase, the number of people who are going to \nneed day care because of the work requirements will increase in the \noutyears. So they really do not need day care funding as much next year \nor the year after or the year after. It is not until the year 2000, \n2001, 2002 that the day care funds really are needed in larger amounts. \nThat is why we pushed the money back.\n  So I think it was somewhat--well, let us just say erroneous for some \nreason for Members to argue that there were cuts in day care funds \nwhen, in fact, we added more money and put it in the years where we \nbelieve the money was to be needed.\n  So the two major criticisms that I heard on the floor, one being the \nMedicaid issue and the other being the issue with child care, I think, \nwere not necessarily made accurately.\n  If I can just make a couple more comments about the Medicaid issue. \nThe one other thing I wanted to mention on Medicaid is that there are \nseveral States that have gotten Medicaid waivers already to be able to \ndetermine eligibility. They have gotten waivers from the Federal \nGovernment to enact their own Medicaid plan and to create their own \neligibility standards for who qualifies for Medicaid.\n\n  All of the States that have done that have actually expanded \neligibility. Let me repeat that. States who have actually gotten \nwaivers and have been given the opportunity to redetermine who is \neligible or not have actually not cut people from the Medicaid rolls \nbut have actually expanded the Medicaid rolls.\n  So the concern that somehow or another if we do not require AFDC \nrecipients to be included in Medicaid that States will immediately rush \nto cut them off is not borne out by the experiences of the States, like \nTennessee and others that have gone forward with their own Medicaid \nwaivers.\n  That is just an additional point that I think should have been noted.\n  There were a couple other things that were mentioned that I want to \ndiscuss. Those are the two major issues.\n  So you can see from the discussion that we are really not that far \napart on the big issues. In fact, I suggest we, in fact, moved in their \ndirection on one of those two issues, and the other one is going to be \ndebated in the Medicaid debate.\n  The Democratic leader said that there were cuts in the EITC, the \nearned income tax credit. That is true. There was a cut in the earned \nincome tax credit. When I say cut, we reduced the rate of growth. That \nprogram is expanding tremendously, and we cut back somewhat in the \ngrowth in that program, but it is not in this bill.\n  I do not know whether he suggested that it was or that it is coming \nlater, but he did mention in his statement we cut the earned income tax \ncredit. I just wanted to state for the record that the earned income \ntax credit is not in the welfare bill; it is not in the bill we voted \non. I think that just needs to be clarified for the purposes of the \nrecord.\n  The other comment that I heard on the floor was that we changed the \nSSI provisions to reduce benefits to some children and knock off the \nSSI rolls other children. Two comments.\n  With respect to knocking off children who are on SSI right now, SSI \nbeing supplemental security income--children who have disabilities \nqualify for SSI and who are in poor families. They qualify for roughly \n$458 a month, plus Medicaid, plus food stamps and other services.\n  What we have done is something that was in the original Senate bill \nthat passed with 87 votes, as far as redetermining who are truly \ndisabled and should be eligible. That provision passed in the Senate \nwith 87 votes. It was included in the Democratic substitute welfare \nproposal. That exact language was included in the Democratic \nsubstitute, both in the House \n\n[[Page S19227]]\nand the Senate, I might add. The House had the same language. It got \nthe support of every Democratic Senator at one point in time.\n  So I do not think there is a dispute that these children who came in \nand got on SSI as a result of what were individual functional \nassessments, that those children should no longer be covered under SSI. \nIn fact, there was never even an amendment offered to change that \nstandard. So we can put that issue aside.\n  The other issue is a legitimate one, and that is that we have reduced \npayments to some children who are still considered disabled under SSI. \nLet me explain to you how that occurred.\n  In the Senate bill, all children who qualified for SSI received the \nfull $458 a month. That is an SSI benefit. That is an SSI benefit \nwhether you are an adult or child. SSI was originally created to be a \nsupplemental income program. That is what it is, supplemental security \nincome. It was supposed to be a supplemental security income program \nfor adults who are disabled and, obviously, not able to work. So we \nprovided this money for them to be able to support themselves.\n  Children have been included in that but get the same amount of money \nas an adult who, with that money, must support themselves. Obviously, \nchildren do not have to support themselves. Many of the families of \nchildren who are on SSI are on AFDC and other government support \nprograms. Some of them are working families, working poor, and qualify \nas poor and, therefore, their children are eligible for SSI. So that is \nnot the sole source of income to support that child, yet they get the \nsame amount of money as an adult who must use that as their sole means \nof support.\n  So what we said in looking at how we could compromise with the \nHouse--and what the House had done was take children who qualified for \nSSI and divided them into two categories: The first category being \nthose who needed 24-hour care or care that if they did not get would \nhave been institutionalized. They would continue to receive cash. \nEveryone else would get no cash. They would still be eligible for SSI, \nbut they would get no cash. What they would get is they would be \neligible for amounts of funds that were then going to be block granted \nto States, and the States could provide services to them to meet the \nneeds of their disability.\n\n  Well, there are many Members on this side of the building who had \nproblems with no cash for these less severely disabled children, and we \ndid not like the idea of the block grant. A lot of disability advocates \ndid not like the idea of a block grant. So what we did is--and Senator \nChafee worked very hard on this, and I gave him credit for that last \nnight when I talked--we fought very hard on this to keep the cash \nassistance for all disabled children. But we recognized--and this is \nthe concession we gave to the House--that there were varying degrees of \ndisability, and a child with disabilities that did not require \nadditional attention from the parents to be able to stay at home and \nlive at home, obviously, did not need the kind of cash resources like \nthe more severely disabled children. So we created a differentiation \nbetween those who need more constant home care from the parent, which \nwould, in a sense, take the parent from the job market and require them \nto stay at home, and the children who were disabled but do not require \nthat kind of constant attention, and that is therefore not as much of a \ndrain on the parents to provide for them. So we created that very small \ndifference, which is a 25-percent reduction in benefits. They still \nreceive cash assistance, but they only receive 75 percent of the full \nSSI payment. We think that was a very reasonable compromise. I can \nunderstand how some Members would like to see the full 100 percent. But \nwe think that was a reasonable compromise between what the House and \nthe Senate had come up with.\n  The final point I wanted to make is in the area of child protection. \nThere were comments made about how we are taking foster care and \nadoption and family protection services and slashing them under this \nbill. I will state for the Record, again, that under the House bill, \nthis area was block granted completely. All of the services provided \nunder that title were block granted and cut by $2.3 billion over the \nnext 7 years. In the Senate bill, we did not have any provision on this \nissue, except that we cut $1.3 billion from this area to help finance \nthe rest of the bill. We did not deal with any reforms in the area. We \nsimply took some money out of one section of the child protection area; \n$1.3 billion was the cut here.\n  In the conference report, we did not cut $2.3 billion, we did not cut \n$1.3 billion, we cut $400 million. So the bill that Members voted for \nhere--87 Members voted for it--actually cut the area of adoption and \nfoster care and child protection more than the bill that they now \nobjected to as cutting too much. So, again, I question whether all of \nthat information really was sufficiently discussed and debated and \ngotten to Members on both sides of the aisle before their votes were \ncast.\n  The other point I wanted to make is that the entitlements to \nmaintenance payments for adoption and foster care remained entitlements \nin the conference report. They were not in the House bill, but we \nnegotiated and maintained the direct payments to children for adoption \nand foster care as an entitlement under this bill, which we think was \nvery important, and was a step in the direction of those who had \nconcerns about the block grant. The area we block granted, I say to \nMembers, is that in the child protection area, 50 percent of all the \nmoney spent in that area is spent on administrative overhead expenses. \nFifty percent does not get to the children. It is all very overhead-\nintensive. What we have done is given the States the flexibility, \nthrough the block grant, to eliminate a lot of this overhead expense \nand get a lot more direct services to the children in need. We also \nallow for agencies like the police and the social service agency to \ncommunicate with each other, which is not allowed under current law.\n  We think we have taken dramatic steps forward in this area in which \nwe have seen some miserable results in recent months, from the Chicago \ncase to this horrible tragedy of this young girl, Alyssa, in New York, \nto other tragedies which we are all familiar with in our States. So we \nbelieve this is an area that is ripe for new developments and changes. \nWe allow for that in this bill.\n  In conclusion, I want to say that I think the real differences \nbetween the Republicans and the Democrats on the welfare issue come \ndown now to more tactical reasons for not supporting this bill than \nthey do substantive reasons. Again, I am not questioning whether or not \nit is a legitimate reason to oppose the bill. In fact, I say it very \nmay well be a legitimate reason to oppose this bill. All I am \nsuggesting is that those who voted against this conference report \nexamine it for the particulars that are in here, and look at it in \nterms of not saying that we have to scrap this and start all over \nagain, when, in fact, I think we have substantial agreement here, and \nthat if we can make some modifications in a couple of the areas that I \nsuggested, and that, in fact, we can find a workable compromise that \nnot only will many Members on the other side of the aisle and, \nhopefully, all our Members on this side, will be able to support \nenthusiastically, but one that the President could support and one that \nwe can include in the Balanced Budget Act of, hopefully 1995--maybe \n1996, the way things are going.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his indulgence. I know he has \nbeen waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mistakes of the Past\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, many mistakes have been made in Yugoslavia, \nthe most tragic by the parties themselves. All of the mistakes made by \nthe international community added together do not even register on the \nscale compared to what the parties have done to each other.\n  Nevertheless, we should learn from our mistakes. Such mistakes \ninclude premature international recognition of the separate states \nbefore any agreement on minority rights or before any basic test for \nstate viability. Another mistake was the United States and European \nfailure--primarily, at the first instance, European failure--to deal \ndecisively with the first Serb aggression. Commitment of a lightly \narmed U.N. peacekeeping force in the middle of a civil war was another \nmistake. Dual-key arrangements required for military action with the \nUnited Nations in control was certainly a fundamental violation of any \nkind of a real effective command structure. And the United Nations \nconstantly posed threats and deadlines with no followthrough, thereby \nsteadily losing credibility. I could go on and on.\n  This is not, however, meant to denigrate in any way the efforts, \noften heroic, of the U.N. forces and the numerous international \norganizations that provided humanitarian assistance to the Bosnian \npeople. Tens of thousands of lives were saved.\n  There are many lessons for Europe, the United Nations, for NATO, and \nfor our own country in this tragedy that has caused so much hardship \nand cost so many lost lives.\n  Mr. President, the job now is to learn from the past and also face \nthe reality of the future. United States and NATO forces face many \nobstacles and risks in Bosnia, but there is also a bright side based on \nevents that have already occurred and also an opportunity for the \nfuture.\n\n\n                           II. Positive Side\n\n  Let me start today with the positive side. On the positive side, the \nNATO allies finally seem to mean business. Just a few examples: French \nPresident Chirac led an effort to provide greater combat capability to \nthe U.N. protection force, and he exercised leadership in firming up \nthe allies' commitment. NATO, urged by the Clinton administration, sent \na clear and unmistakable signal of its determination with its bombing \ncampaign against Bosnian Serb command, control and communication \nfacilities when they continued to flaunt their own obligations.\n  President Clinton seized the opportunity presented by the bombing \ncampaign and the Federation ground campaign to launch an intensive \ndiplomatic effort under the effective leadership of Ambassador Richard \nHolbrooke that resulted in a comprehensive peace agreement between the \nparties. The Croatian and the Federation ground campaign, together with \nthe peace agreement, greatly improved the clarity of lines separating \nthe parties making a peace enforcement mission more feasible and less \ndangerous.\n  Finally, strong leadership by President Clinton and the United States \nin this area is producing tangible and positive results in NATO. Just a \nfew of those results in NATO, some of which are truly remarkable.\n  First of all, Germany is providing troops for this first time ``out \nof area'' NATO operation. Second, French troops will be operating under \nNATO command and control. France has announced its return to regular \nparticipation in the NATO military committee. This is a reversal, Mr. \nPresident, of 30 years of French policy. Russia has agreed to place its \nforces under the operational control of an American general. Russia \nwill consult with NATO on a 16-nation to one-nation basis, but will not \nhave a veto over NATO decisions.\n  These events have the potential to lead to future developments with \nRussia that could have a decidedly positive impact on European security \nin the years ahead. There are also, of course, potential downsides to \nthis arrangement. There will be no substitute for constant high-level \nvigilance to this Russian military participation, both in Washington \nand in Moscow, as well as in the field. This one bears very careful and \nclose nurturing and attention.\n  All NATO nations except Iceland, as well as many other nations, have \ncommitted forces to Bosnia. The United States forces will be primarily \nin the Tuzla area where the roads and terrain are difficult but not as \nsevere as some other areas of Bosnia. The Nordic brigade comprised of \nNorway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and recently joined by Poland, that \nwill be colocated with American forces, have operated in the area for \nsome time. They have heavy equipment. They have not tolerated \ninterference. They have been friendly with the people of the area, and \nthey have been firm. They are helping our advance team immensely with \ntheir advice and their knowledge of the area and of the people.\n  The Turkish brigade will be near American troops, which should help \nto temper the more extreme elements of the Moslem communities. Turkey \nis a key NATO ally with strong influence in the moderate Muslim world.\n  All of our commanders who have testified before our committee or who \nhave spoken to me privately believe that the rules of engagement are \nclear, they are robust, and they are appropriate. They authorize the \nuse of force, including deadly force, in response to both hostile acts \nas well as, in the judgment of the commander, hostile intent. These are \nthe same rules of engagement as were utilized in Haiti. Most \nimportantly, the mission and the military task are doable, according to \nall of our military witnesses.\n\n\n                         III. Military Mission\n\n                         A. Mission Definition\n\n  The military mission is a subject of considerable importance in how \nit is defined. General Shalikashvili has defined our military mission \nas follows: ``In an evenhanded manner, monitor and enforce compliance \nwith the military aspects of the Dayton peace agreement.''\n  General Shalikashvili has further listed the military tasks of the \nDayton agreement as follows: Supervise selective marking of cease-fire \nline, inter-entity boundary line and zones of separation.\n  Monitor and, if necessary enforce, withdrawal of forces to their \nrespective territories within agreed periods as follows:\n  Ensure withdrawal of forces behind zones of separation within 30 days \nof transfer of authority from UNPROFOR to the Implementation Force;\n  Ensure redeployment of forces from areas to be transferred from one \nentity to the other within 45 days of transfer of authority;\n  Ensure no introduction of forces into transferred areas for an \nadditional 45 days;\n  Establish and man a 4-kilometer zone of separation--2 kilometers on \neither side of cease fire/inter-entity boundary line;\n  Establish liaison with local military and civilian authorities; and\n  Create a Joint Military Commission and subordinate military \ncommissions to resolve disputes between the Parties.\n  In order to accomplish these military tasks, the Military Annex to \nthe General Framework Agreement provides that ``the IFOR Commander \nshall have the authority, without interference or permission of any \nParty, to do all that the Commander judges necessary and proper, \nincluding the use of military force, to protect the IFOR and to carry \nout the responsibilities'' under the agreement. The peace agreement, \nthus, gives the NATO Implementation Force well defined \nresponsibilities--basically to separate the parties and create a stable \nenvironment--and grants it broad authorities to carry out its mission \nand to protect itself. In many ways, NATO's clearly defined \nresponsibility with very broad authority and robust capability is the \nopposite of what the U.N. forces evolved into: broad and ill-defined \nresponsibility with narrow authority and limited capability. The worst \nkind of combination. General Shalikashvili has testified that the \nmilitary mission and the military tasks are appropriate and executable.\n\n[[Page S19229]]\n\n\n\n               B. Definition of success and Exit Strategy\n\n  There is a strong correlation between the definition of success when \nyou are using military forces and also the exit strategy. I would like \nto briefly discuss those.\n  In discussing the obstacles to the success of the military mission we \nfirst must avoid confusing the military mission with the much broader \nU.S. and international political goals in Bosnia. It is a part of the \noverall political goals, but it is only one part of the broader goal.\n  In my view, we should view the military mission as a success if the \nImplementation Force provides the time and space for the parties, \nassisted by the international community, to begin a peaceful building \nprocess. I use the term ``building'' in both the physical and political \nsense; that is, both building the democratic processes for a unified \nnation and reconstructing the economy and the physical infrastructure \nof the nation.\n  The military part of the mission is to create the climate and \nstability required to begin the building process. The civilian part of \nthe mission is to build the political and civil institutions that can \nendure. In the long run, only the parties themselves can bring about \nthis success.\n  The building process is separate and distinct from the military \nmission. It is entirely possible that the military mission will be \ncarried out with great professionalism and accomplish the military goal \nand still have the civilian building process end in dismal failure. \nThat is what I think we have to recognize.\n  The success of the military mission will require a great deal of \ncoordination with the Parties' military and civilian representatives \nand with the High Representative and the participating civilian \norganizations. The Joint Military Commission and subordinate military \ncommissions at the brigade and battalion level will bring all of these \nparties together under the chairmanship of the Implementation Force \ncommander and his local commanders. One of the principal uses of these \nforums is for the IFOR commander--U.S. Admiral Smith--and his \nsubordinate commanders to work with the military commanders of the \nFederation and the Bosnian Serbs at all levels to convince them that \npeace is in the best interests of their respective peoples and that the \nmilitary goal of regaining and holding lost territory is not \nachievable.\n  Mr. President, they do not have perfect civilian control in this part \nof the world. If we are going to really get a peace there that endures, \na key part of that will be having the military leaders of each one of \nthe parties, the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Moslems, Bosnian Croats, to \nrecognize that peace is in the interests of the people that they \nrepresent. That is a key. Our military forces will play a key role in \nthat kind of understanding. This is very, very important.\n  Bringing the military leadership of the opposing parties together \nunder U.S. and NATO auspices to begin the slow and tortuous process of \nbuilding trust and cooperation may be one of the most important NATO \nchallenges and opportunities.\n  The exit strategy and the definition of a successful military mission \nflow together, in my view. Separating the parties--providing time and \nspace for the civil building process--creating an environment of peace \nand stability--and through non-U.S. military means, leaving a \nreasonable military balance which gives the parties an opportunity to \ndefend their own borders. These are all key components of ``success'' \nin the broad context and are required for a successful exit of U.S. and \nNATO forces within approximately 1 year.\n\n\n                               iv. risks\n\n                    a. risks to the military mission\n\n  Mr. President, I get a lot of letters, and I know all of my \ncolleagues do, about the risks to the United States military forces. \nThese risks are very much on the minds of all of us as we send our \nyoung men and women to this dangerous area of the world.\n  There are certainly risks involved in this military operation.\n  There are a number of risks to U.S. military personnel. First, I \nbelieve, is accidents, based on all the records of the U.N. Forces. \nThen landmines, snipers, attacks by extremists, hostage taking, and, \nfinally, one that is overlooked many times; complacency of our military \nforces when things are going well. This complacency can lead to \ncarelessness and can only be avoided by strong leadership from the unit \nlevel right on up.\n  General Shalikashvili testified that he does not believe that our \nforces will be subjected to attacks from organized combat units. He \nbelieves the greatest risk will come from accidents on the dangerous \nBosnian roads. In this regard, it should be noted that the U.N. \nProtection Force sustained 213 deaths, of which 80 were due to combat \nand 133 due to other causes.\n  I am confident that the excellent equipment, training and discipline \nof our forces should minimize the risks, but there will undoubtedly be \nAmerican casualties. Potential attackers should be on notice that the \nforces available to NATO and the robust rules of engagement mean that \nswift and overpowering responses will take place if NATO forces are \nattacked or provoked.\n  Our forces are supposed to be even-handed, and I am sure they will \nbe. But evenhanded does not mean, nor should it imply, being gentle \nwhen they are either attacked or when they detect hostile intent. NATO \nand the United States must insist that President Izetbegovic of Bosnia, \nfully meet his commitment to ensure that the mujahedin forces depart \nBosnia within 30 days of the signing of the peace agreement. This has \nbeen a firm pledge by the Bosnian President.\n  This will be seen by the United States as well as a number of other \nparties, including the Bosnian Moslems, Bosnian Croats, as well as the \nBosnian Serbs, as an indication of the extent of the Iranian and other \noutside Islamic fundamentalist influence on the Bosnian Moslems.\n  It is hard to imagine that the Bosnian Moslem and Croat Federation \ncould hold together if there is a pervasive extreme Islamic \nfundamentalist influence within the Bosnian Muslim entity.\n  It is also hard to believe that the Bosnian Serbs, particularly those \nwho are living in the suburbs of Sarajevo, and whose cooperation or at \nleast acquiescence is necessary to the security of the forces of the \nFrench contingent in that area, will be reassured if the mujahedin do \nnot depart as scheduled. Although I will not dwell on this today, while \nwe are talking about risk, there is also a risk of renewed conflict in \nEastern Slavonia or a flare-up in Kosovo.\n\n\n                B. Risks relating to arming and training\n\n  There are also risks relating to arming and training, which is a \nmission that I would like to discuss just for a few minutes.\n  The Regional Stabilization Annex to the Framework Agreement gives the \nparties 180 days after the agreement was signed to negotiate limits on \nthe levels of armaments. These negotiations are to be carried out under \nthe auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE). I want to emphasize that this is a civilian and not a military \ntask and the NATO Implementation Force is not responsible for this \neffort. The fact that it is a civilian task does not mean that the \nUnited States will not play a leadership role in this effort. On the \ncontrary, the United States should endeavor to play a strong leadership \nrole since a general reduction in the number of arms in former \nYugoslavia will reduce the risk to the United States and allied forces \nparticipating in the Implementation Force as well as improve the chance \nfor lasting peace.\n\n  The U.S. commitment to lead an international effort to arm and train \nthe Federation forces was essential to securing the peace agreement but \nwe should make no mistake that it carries substantial risk. An \nassessment is already underway to identify the capabilities of the \nBosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat Federation, to assess what the \nFederation needs to redress its deficiencies, to plan how those needs \nwill be met, and to commence training, since training may be provided \nimmediately under the Regional Stabilization Annex and the UN Security \nCouncil resolution that lifts the arms embargo.\n  If arming and training is not carried out with care, it could wind up \nincreasing the risk to United States forces in Bosnia and alienating \nour allies. It will be important to ensure that United \n\n[[Page S19230]]\nStates forces in Bosnia are not involved and that the involvement of \nactive duty United States military personnel is kept to administrative \nfunctions. In this regard, I was pleased to note that President \nClinton, in his letter of December 12, 1995 to Senator Dole on this \nissue, stated that ``I will do nothing that I believe will endanger the \nsafety of American troops on the ground in Bosnia.'' Mr. President, I \nbelieve all of us agree with that goal. It will also be important for \nthe Administration to keep our allies informed on the steps we are \ntaking and to take into consideration their comments.\n\n  The use of a third country, such as Turkey--a secular Muslim country, \nto carry out the training seems to be the best choice.\n  In the case of training, I believe the emphasis should be on small \nunit training and the maintenance, repair and use of defensive weapons \nand equipment.\n  In the case of arming, I believe that whatever arms are provided to \nthe Federation, the emphasis must be on defensive capability. By \ndefensive capability, I mean that the weapons, equipment, and training \nthat are provided are suited to allow the force to defend itself rather \nthan to enable it to conduct offensive operations to gain and hold \nterritory. That is a very important distinction--in the kind of \nequipment we encourage to be furnished by other countries. In the case \nor weapons and equipment, it would mean emphasizing counter battery \nradar, night vision devices, communications equipment, anti-armor, \nammunition, light vehicles, and the like rather than providing large \nnumbers of tanks and artillery tubes. There also may be a need to \nperform some modest military construction to relocate the Federation \nforces out of the cities and towns in which they are presently located.\n  There are also risks to the military mission that relate to the \naccomplishment of the civilian political goals.\n\n\n                  C. Risks to Civilian/Political Goals\n\n  It is obvious that the planning for the accomplishment of the \nmilitary tasks is far ahead of that for the civilian tasks and that \nthere is a serious and growing gap between the two.\n  NATO planning at the strategic and operational levels benefitted \ngreatly from the planning accomplished over the last year relating to a \npossible NATO operation to extract the United Nations Protection Force \nfrom Bosnia.\n  Our military people have been going through contingency planning on \nthis situation for some time.\n  Both planning efforts required a common set of data relating to the \nall-important logistics effort to insert forces rapidly, to stabilize \nthe security situation, and to extract the force safely once the \nmission had been carried out. Additionally, NATO has an in-place staff \nthat specializes in such planning and is trained to adapt its plans as \nmore information on the specific military tasks become available, as \nwas the case during the negotiation of the General Framework Agreement \nand its Annexes.\n  By comparison, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope and the other organizations that will be involved in the civil \npolitical mission have no counterpart planning staffs and have no \nexperience in carrying out many of the tasks they will carry out in \nBosnia. For example, the High Representative was only named a little \nmore than a week ago to the London Conference.\n  The broad international political goal is to preserve Bosnia and \nHerzegovina as a unified country in a region in which peace and \nstability endures. Accomplishing that broad goal would require \novercoming a number of obstacles that could defy its attainment and the \ncivilian side of this will really have to address many of these \nobstacles.\n\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is look at Haiti to find out that \nyou can have a military mission go extremely well but not have the \neconomic development, the infrastructure development, and even the \npolitical development keep up with that. And you can still have a \ncountry that is hanging on the bare edge. That is the case in Haiti \ntoday, and that will also be the case in Bosnia unless the civilian \nside begins to catch up with the military side and really understand \nthe obstacle to having stability in this region.\n  Such obstacles include the history of the region, the ethnic \nconsciousness of significant parts of the population, the residual \nhatred resulting from the cruel and inhuman behavior of the warring \nparties, such as ethnic cleansing carried out by but not limited to the \nBosnian Serbs, and the tendency of the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian \nSerbs to identify with Croatia and Serbia respectively rather than with \na unified Bosnia and Herzegovina. Faced with such obstacles, reaching \nthe broad political goals will be extremely difficult. The underlying \ncauses of the conflict cannot be cured by the military mission. And it \nis important for all of us to understand that.\n\n\n                   D. Bosnia--One Nation or Partition\n\n  Mr. President, the broad goal is to have one nation called Bosnia. \nThere are other tugs in the direction of partition and those tugs have \nnot ended.\n  The General Framework Agreement and its 11 Annexes contain a number \nof provisions that both reinforce and undermine the broad political \ngoal of a united Bosnia.\n  On the positive side for unity, for example, the following provisions \nreinforce that goal: the commitment to free and fair elections and the \nprotection of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms in the agreement; the vesting of responsibility in the Federal \nGovernment for foreign policy, foreign trade, customs, immigration, and \nmonetary policy; the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly, a \nPresidency, and a Constitutional Court; and the arrangements for \ninternational assistance for rehabilitation.\n  On the other hand the following provisions are contrary to that goal \nof one Bosnia. On that side of the ledger, the recognition of two semi-\nautonomous entities, the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Bosnian Serb \nRepublic, within clearly demarcated geographic boundaries, each of whom \nwill have their own army; a Parliamentary Assembly whose legislation \ncan be blocked by two-thirds of the representatives from the Federation \nor the Serb Republic or, in the case of a proposed decision deemed to \nbe ``destructive of a vital interest of the Bosniac, Croat, or Serb \npeople,'' by a majority of the Bosniac, Croat, or Serb Delegates.\n  We can understand in this parliamentary body how dicey that \nproposition is.\n  A three-member Presidency, consisting of one Bosnian, one Croat, and \none Serb, in which a decision may be blocked by declaration of one \nMember that it is ``destructive of the vital interest of the Entity'' \nhe represents.\n\n\n                         e. fragile assumptions\n\n  Another very tricky proposition, Mr. President, that I would like to \nmention before closing today are two fragile assumptions that are very \nimportant to the overall peace agreement. These are fragile \nassumptions, and they are interrelated assumptions.\n  The first assumption is that the Moslem-Croat Federation, which was \nformed as a result of a U.S. diplomatic initiative in the February 1994 \nWashington Agreement, will stay together. One only has to recall that \nthe Muslims and Croats armies were actively fighting each other prior \nto the Washington Agreement and that, even afterwards, the functioning \nof the city of Mostar has essentially been stymied for more than a year \nas a result of the inability of the Moslem and Croat mayors to work \ntogether. So that is a very questionable assumption.\n  The second assumption, pertains to the Sub-Regional Arms Control \nAnnex which contains a ``default'' formula for limits on armaments that \nkicks in if the Parties cannot agree otherwise within 180 days. They \nfirst have the opportunity to negotiate. If they do not negotiate, then \nthis so-called default formula and ratios kick in. The assumption is \nthat it is stabilizing to establish a ratio based on the population of \nthe respective parties.\n\n  Under that formula, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, commonly \nreferred to as Serbia, has a baseline or a limit of 5. The Republic of \nCroatia has a limit of 2 compared to 5. And Bosnia and Herzegovina have \na limit of 2. So the ratio is 5 Serbia, 2 Croatia, and 2 for the Bosnia \nand Herzegovina entity. The limit for Bosnia is further divided on the \nbasis of a ratio for the Federation 2 and 1 for the Serb Republic.\n  Assuming the ratios are met in the default formula--it requires a \ngreat leap of faith--but even if they are \n\n[[Page S19231]]\nreached, unless there has been significant political and economic \nprogress, stability is far from assured.\n  If the Moslem Croat Federation stays together, the Bosnian Serbs' 2 \nto 1 disadvantage in arms compared to the Federation could serve as an \nincentive for them to align more closely with Serbia, to the detriment \nof the goal of a unified Bosnia.\n  If, on the other hand, the Federation does not stay together, the \nBosnian Moslems will be at a 2 to 1 disadvantage in a potential two-\nfront conflict with the combined strength of the Bosnian Croats and the \nBosnian Serbs.\n  Now, I would say that it is unlikely that the Bosnian Croats and the \nBosnian Serbs will join in some kind of unified or coordinated attack \nagainst the Bosnian Muslims, but the Bosnian Muslims could in the \nfuture easily find themselves in a conflict with both parties. These \nfragile assumptions, which could go awry very easily, make it even more \nessential from my perspective that the goal of the arms control \nbuilddown, the first effort to build down the weapons, as well as any \narm-and-train program, leave all the parties with primarily a defensive \ncapability.\n  If we start basically building up offensive arms, these ratios and \nall the complexities are going to be vast.\n  In spite of these fragile and questionable assumptions, I believe \nthat a builddown process is worth a try. I believe that we must \nundertake at least the effort.\n  Finally, it will be imperative for the United States to remain \nengaged at the highest diplomatic levels to assure that the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other civilian \norganizations utilize the time available to them to undertake an \nintensive and focused effort to accomplish their task.\n\n\n        F. risks to military mission relating to civilian tasks\n\n  Mr. President, possibly the greatest risk to the military mission is \nthat there will be confusion of the military mission and the much \nbroader U.S. and international political goals--confusion in the \nCongress and confusion in the country.\n  This has two aspects. The first is that there will be mission creep \non the ground with the U.S. military being expected to assume more and \nmore responsibility for the political or civilian aspects of the \nframework agreement. These include the task of continuing humanitarian \naid, rehabilitation of infrastructure and economic reconstruction, the \nreturn of displaced persons and refugees, the holding of free \nelections, police functions within borders, and the like.\n  One of the trickiest areas is not about separating the forces. That \nis a clear military mission. But what happens within an area if you \nstart having murders take place within the borders? Whose job is it to \ntake on the policing of that? Certainly, the civilian mission will be \nto do what they can to restore the function of the police forces, but \nin the meantime what does the United States military and what do other \nNATO militaries do when there is really chaos within the borders?\n  These are a few of the areas that could very easily lead to mission \ncreep.\n  The second danger--and this is something I think all of us in the \nCongress have a keen responsibility to keep in mind in our remarks--\nrelates to public perception of how we define the military mission's \nsuccess or lack thereof. I noted earlier that the military mission is \nlimited. Assuming the United States military leaves Bosnia in \napproximately 1 year and the conflict there resumes shortly thereafter, \nhas the military mission been a failure under these circumstances? If \nthe news media and the American public confuse our narrowly defined 1-\nyear military mission with the long-term political goals for a united \nand stable and peaceful Bosnia, the perception of failure after 1 year \nis possible and perhaps even probable. So I think it is important for \nus to define these terms very carefully.\n\n\n                           V. residual force\n\n  Since the plans for carrying out the civilian tasks are far behind \nthe military side and since they are so important to the building \nprocess, the best case is that there will be a solid beginning toward \naccomplishing the civilian tasks during the first year of the military \ndeployment. But it will be far from complete. Because of this, I \nbelieve that planning must start now for a residual military force to \nreplace the NATO implementation force at the end of a year to give the \nparties and the organizations helping them the secure environment and \nconfidence they need to continue the longer-term civilian task which \nwithout any doubt is going to take far longer than 1 year.\n  A residual force should not include United States ground forces, in \nmy view, but could be supported by the United States in those military \nareas where we have unique capabilities. Such a residual force can be a \nUnited Nations peacekeeping force or a coalition of forces from \nEuropean and other nations that are committed to seeing the building \nprocess continued. This will in most likelihood take a number of years. \nThe point is that the planning for a residual force needs to commence \nas soon as possible.\n  Finally, as a necessary contingency, the United States should begin \nto work with our allies to ensure continuing cooperation to contain the \nconflict if the peace process breaks down, either while our troops are \nthere or after we leave in about a year. NATO's vital interests in my \nview have never been involved in Bosnia itself--important interests, \nbut not vital. But NATO's vital interests could certainly be involved \nif there is a spread of this conflict. Strategic planning within NATO \nmust begin now for a long-term containment strategy if that breakdown \noccurs.\n  Mr. President, the United Nations deployment to Macedonia in which \nUnited States and Nordic forces are participating is a first step, only \na first step but at least a first step, toward this broader containment \nstrategy which may be essential in the long run.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I thank \nthe Chair for the time. I would at this point yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19228-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM PETTIT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

For more than a generation, Tom gave millions of \nviewers a front-row seat to a world of news and politics. As NBC news \nvice president Bill Wheatley noted:\n\n       His work was always distinctive: There was never any doubt \n     that it was a Tom Pettit report. Truly, he was among the very \n     best in the profession that he so loved.\n\n  Having interviewed every President since Harry Truman, Tom certainly \nearned his stripes in broadcast journalism. He preserved many moments \nof history, including the tragic assassination of President John F. \nKennedy in Dallas. I know I speak for all of my colleagues in sending \nour thoughts and prayers to his wife, Patricia, and his children: \nDebra, Anne, James, and Robert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19231-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19231-S19232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JOINT STATEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just for the information of my colleagues, \nfollowing the meeting today at the White House, we issued a joint \nstatement. I will just read the joint statement.\n  We have agreed that we will issue statements from now on so we do not \nhave any problem about somebody saying something that might be \nmisinterpreted. And the joint statement reads:\n\n       Today we had good meetings which built on the progress made \n     in yesterday's discussions. Staff will prepare further \n     analysis to clarify options for the budget advisory group, \n     which will then advise the principals on outstanding issues. \n     Following the meeting of the budget advisory group, the \n     principals will meet again next Friday afternoon.\n\n  So there will be a meeting with the President and the Vice President, \nthe chief of staff, Leon Panetta, and the leaders of the House and the \nSenate.\n  On Thursday of next week and Wednesday of next week, staff and the \nadvisory committees will meet.\n  So without much elaboration, I will say, in my view, we had a good \nsession, very positive. I felt people wanted to get something done. \n\n[[Page S19232]]\n\n  We discussed some very difficult issues. The hard decisions have not \nbeen made yet, but I guess without being too specific, it is fair to \nsay, at least right now, the attitude of everyone is very positive, and \nI hope that we can do what the American people want us to do, and that \nis come to some agreement which will balance the budget over the next 7 \nyears, using Congressional Budget Office numbers.\n  If we can do that--it may be painstaking, it may interrupt holiday \nschedules for some, but it will be worth it in the long run. So I \ncertainly want to thank all of my colleagues and members of our staff \nwho have been working this past week and will be working next week in \nan effort to bring about a balanced budget over the next 7 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19231-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, while we are waiting, I will just say we \nhave been trying to find some way that would permit Federal employees \naround the country to come back to work without enacting another \ncontinuing resolution. It is costing $40 million a day because we are \ngoing to pay the Federal employees. It is no fault of their own they \nare not working. It seems to me--at least I am getting a lot of calls \nfrom taxpayers around the country saying, ``Why are you paying people \nfor not working?''\n  My view is they ought to be able to go back to work, but under the \nlaw, they cannot even volunteer to go back to work, because if they \nvolunteer, their supervisor might be in violation of some criminal \nstatute. There is a purpose for all this, because if you do not have \nany money in the agency, it is pretty hard to say we are going to pay \nsalaries.\n  But in this case, in fact we agreed to say, it is safe to say, this \nafternoon--it should have been in that joint communique--the principals \nagreed those who are furloughed will be paid because it is no fault of \ntheir own.\n  As the Washington Post said in an editorial, they are the victims, \nthey are the pawns in this struggle for a balanced budget, and if you \nare in the Agriculture Department, we passed that appropriations bill, \nas the Presiding Officer knows because he is chairman of that \nAppropriations subcommittee, and they are working and they are getting \npaid. But if you work for the Interior Department, you are not getting \npaid because we have not passed a CR--we passed the Interior bill. \nUnfortunately, the President could have put people back to work, but he \nvetoed it.\n  So we have been trying to find some way out of the impasse because \nthere are Federal workers--in fact, I heard this morning on the radio \nrepresentatives of the Federal employees union saying that it is giving \nthe Federal employees a bad image; that many believe they are out there \nshopping in the shopping malls knowing they are all going to get paid, \nand they are just getting more time off.\n\n  So I discussed in general the concept with Senator Daschle while we \nwere at the White House and have been working with Senator Warner \nthroughout the day. We believe we have found a way that would permit \nFederal employees to come back to work and they would be paid on the \nassurance given by not only the principals in today's meeting, but a \nletter signed by myself and the Speaker of the House last Thursday \ndirected to Senator Warner and to Congresswoman Morella, Congressman \nTom Davis and Congressman Frank Wolf.\n  Let me read it:\n\n       Section 1342 of title 31, U.S. Code, is amended, (1) by \n     inserting after the first sentence ``for the period December \n     15, 1995, through February 1, 1996, all officers and \n     employees of the United States Government or the District of \n     Columbia Government shall be deemed to be performing services \n     relating to emergencies involved in the safety of human life \n     or the protection of property and, (2) by striking out the \n     last sentence.\n\n  Hopefully by then we will have completed our balanced budget and \neverybody will be back to work in a normal fashion.\n  I am going to try to clear this on the Democratic side and send it to \nthe House. I have had a brief discussion with the Speaker, and I am not \ncertain if he has had a chance to analyze this. But this does two \nthings, we are told.\n  First of all, it permits Federal employees to go back to work without \ngetting somebody in trouble, and, second, it assures they are going to \nbe paid.\n  So I hope we can clear this before the evening ends. I am not certain \nthe House could take it up today, but they will be back on Wednesday.\n  I know there is a lot of stress and unrest among Federal employees \nwho are not working, but they will be paid, which means there is a lot \nof stress and unrest with the general taxpayers who wonder why they are \nnot working if they are going to be paid. So this would permit Federal \nemployees to do what I guess nearly everyone wants to do in the first \nplace.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, who has \njust come to the floor, for his assistance. We are trying to clear this \nat this point with the Democratic leader. If we cannot do that, at \nleast I will have the bill printed in the Record and perhaps we can \nbring it up again next Wednesday when we are back in session.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader. Throughout this current series of problems and, \nindeed, in the last series, I was able to work with him expressing at \nall opportunity the need for the Federal employees to be treated with \nfairness and equity and compassion, and that means going back to work.\n  I just want to thank the leader for what he has done, and I am \ndelighted to be a cosponsor of this particular piece of legislation, \nwhich, Mr. President, will enable them to be treated just like all \nother civil service employees, and I think that is the bare minimum we \nowe to these fine people who are public servants in every true sense.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think there is another matter we need to deal with very \nquickly because there are, I understand, 470,000, almost 500,000 \nemployees who are working who are going to have difficulty being paid. \nSo we need to address that very quickly, and we are working on that.\n  So as I was saying, as the Senator from Virginia indicated this \nmorning, it is costing $40 million a day. These employees want to work \nand they cannot work. They cannot volunteer. Somebody is going to be in \ntrouble if they do that. So we have discussed this with the \nParliamentarian and legislative counsel, and this brief language would \npermit them to go back to work and also assure them they would be paid. \nThose are the two purposes of the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I thank the distinguished leader, \nand I hope it is accepted.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there is a considerable amount of what we \ncall wrap-up around here. While that is being prepared, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19232-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19232-S19233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN FEDERAL COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to name the \nFederal courthouse--U.S. District Courts and Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit--in the Nation's Capital in honor \nof the late Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman.\n  Following my graduation from the University of Virginia Law School in \n\n\n[[Page S19233]]\n1953, I was privileged to serve as his law clerk. He was then a member \nof the circuit court, and later became Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n  As one of the Nation's most distinguished jurists, I believe that \nthis building complex should be named for Judge Prettyman in honor of \nhis more than 35 years of service in judicial affairs.\n  Further, Mr. President, I wish to add that the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, on which I serve, has recently approved the \nauthorization for design of a D.C. courthouse ``annex'' to be appended \nto the existing structure. The urgent need for an ``annex'' was brought \nto my attention by the Honorable Oliver Gasch, U.S. District Judge, \nspeaking on behalf of the jurists, local bar, and others in this \njudicial district. This ``annex'' is critically needed because of the \never-increasing number of cases here in the Nation's Capital and the \never-growing importance of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The existing buildings, together with the ``annex,'' will be named \nfor the distinguished former Chief Judge, E. Barrett Prettyman.\n  He was born in Lexington, VA, home of my alma mater, Washington & Lee \nUniversity, and he was a resident of six Virginia cities over the \ncourse of his lifetime making him both a Virginian and a Washingtonian. \nHe also had connections with the State of Maryland. So he is truly a \ngreater metropolitan area citizen.\n  After graduating from Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, he \nearned a law degree from Georgetown University.\n  Mr. President, the recognition of the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of Judge Prettyman to his chosen profession--that is, the \nlaw and to his community--are known by many here in the Nation's \ncapital, and all across America.\n  He served as the Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court, from \n1953 to 1960, and is perhaps best known as the first Chief Judge of the \ncourt to take his case for judicial reform to Congress and to the \nAmerican people.\n  As the son of the Chaplain of the United States Senate during the \nWilson administration, Judge Prettyman had a knowledge of the Congress \nof the United States. Testifying before Congress on numerous occasions, \nJudge Prettyman asked the Judiciary Committee to provide funds to \nauthorize two additional judges to relieve the backlog of cases before \nthe Juvenile Court which was then served by only one judge. By allowing \nfor two additional judges to serve the court, Judge Prettyman \nbelieved justice would be better served. And, as we know, justice \ndelayed is justice denied.\n\n  Called the swing man by observers of the nine-member circuit court of \nappeals, Judge Prettyman made his mark as much for his decisions as his \nleadership.\n  In the centrist role he wielded exceptional influence over the \nopinions of this court. In what perhaps was his best-known opinion, \nJudge Prettyman wrote that the State Department has a right to bar \nentry for U.S. citizens into certain areas, such as Red China. The 1959 \nruling by the court in which William Worthy, Jr., a journalist \nattempted to obtain a passport to visit Red China, he wrote that \n``While travel was a right''--Judge Prettyman wrote--``it can be \nrestrained like any other right in foreign affairs, especially in the \ninternational posture of today's world of jets, radio, and atomic \npower. A blustering inquisitor vowing his own freedom to go and do as \nhe pleases can throw the whole international neighborhood into \nturmoil.''\n  This decision was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  His 26 years on the Federal bench demonstrated him to be fair, firm, \nand thorough. And I might add, Mr. President, he had a great sense of \nhumor.\n  Always seeking insight from his colleagues, he was well suited to \nserve as the chairman of the judicial conference composed of all of the \nFederal judges in the area. In 1960, he noted to as the chairman of \nthis conference that ``more than to any other person or group, the \npeople have a right to look for suggestion as to what needs improvement \nand how.''\n  While seeking advice and counsel from his colleagues on new and \nbetter ways to serve the judiciary, Judge Prettyman was also highly \nvisible in areas which he felt needed improvement.\n  He was a strong advocate for providing free legal aid to the \nindigent, as well as the desirability in appointing an African-American \nto serve as a juvenile court judge.\n  I might also add, Mr. President, that I worked with Judge Prettyman \nto set up a special institute at Georgetown University, which institute \nwas to serve those lawyers who desired to be better trained and better \nqualified in the representation of indigent defendants. That was a \nlandmark accomplishment by this distinguished jurist.\n  Judge Prettyman served as an appointee under both the Kennedy and \nJohnson administrations. Under President Kennedy, Judge Prettyman \nserved as chairman of the panel appointed to inquire into the U-2 \nincident and aided President Johnson as chairman of a committee \nstudying the feasibility of phasing out veterans administration \nhospitals.\n  He was indeed an exceptionally able and scholarly judge.\n  I can think of no better qualified or more lasting tribute to such a \nfine, honorable public servant than to name the U.S. courthouse in the \nNation's Capital the ``E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse.''\n  Mr. President, I also wish to thank his son, a lifetime friend and \nformer law partner of mine, E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., now a senior \npartner of Hogan & Hartson. He is an extraordinary man in his own right \nwith great accomplishments, having served three Supreme Court Justices \nin the course of his career as a law clerk, and known throughout the \nUnited States as one of the foremost advocates before the Supreme Court \nof the United States. I thank him, and members of Judge Prettyman's \nfamily for their acquiescence and assistance with this proposed \nlegislative naming.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. This is a particularly moving \nmoment for me to pay tribute to this great American. And I am hopeful \nthat eventually the Congress will accept this. The pending legislation \nfor the augmentation of the Federal district court is before the House \nof Representatives, and I anticipate its approval in the very near \nfuture. And I also wish to acknowledge the support of Congresswoman \nEleanor Holmes Norton with whom I discussed this matter before \npreparing this speech.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. \n  \n[[Page S19234]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues, particularly \nSenator Daschle, the Democratic leader. We did discuss it today at the \nWhite House. It is not a perfect solution as people will find when they \nget into it, because if the employee returns to work and there is an \nexpenditure involved they may not be able to carry out their normal \nduties. But at least I think from the standpoint of self-esteem, \nwhatever, the Federal employees can come back to work and if they are \npaid, that would be satisfactory to them and to others who object to \nFederal employees being furloughed and then being paid. When they come \nback, they will not have a problem because they will at least be \nreporting for work and they will be at work and they will be paid.\n  It seems to me that in fairness to the Federal employees, this is \nnot--as I said earlier, they are sort of in the middle. They are sort \nof the pawns in this exercise. I hope the House will take this and \nconsider it carefully. Maybe they can improve upon it. They will be \nback on Tuesday. And I thank my colleagues on both sides for clearing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. One item we tried to add to the continuing resolution \nearlier today was a clean CR so that we would not have any question.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right.\n  Mr. FORD. And the distinguished majority leader said in the Chamber \nyesterday he did not approve of closing Government down. And I \nappreciate what he is trying to do here. I think this needs some work \non it.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right.\n  Mr. FORD. I believe the majority leader agrees with that, because if \nthe others are not being paid, how does that Federal employee perform \nthe service that he is there voluntarily doing until such time as a \ncontinuing resolution is passed for them to be paid?\n  So I thank him for trying here, but a clean CR would have been much \nbetter than what we are trying to do. We are monkeying with the \nstatutory provisions now, and I am not sure that we are doing \neverything that we ought to do. A clean CR would have accomplished the \nend result, and I think it is unfortunate that we are furloughing \nFederal employees by statute and then paying them for not working by \ncontinuing resolution at the rate of $40 million a day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, this \nis a clear effort by the distinguished majority leader and, indeed, \nwith the consent of the distinguished minority leader to take this \nprocess a step further.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us make it clear that this is a step forward, and it \nputs all Federal civil servants in one category and not two classes, so \nto speak.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that, I say to my friend. And I say to him, a \nclean CR would have taken care of everything, and now we send what we \nthink is compassionate in our clean CR to the House and they take out \nMedicaid and send it back to us and recess.\n\n  These sorts of things just do not ring well outside the beltway.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate included the Medicaid provision \nand the House seems to think that there are other sources of funding \navailable. A signature pen on a lot of these bills would have obviated \nmany of the problems. So I do not suggest at this time, this late at \nnight we ought to reopen what has been thoroughly debated this week.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a substantive, concrete step forward by the \ndistinguished majority leader, and I am privileged to have been the \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I do not argue with my friend from Virginia \nat all. I have had a call from my State as it relates to the Medicaid \npayment. They are very concerned about it. That is a quarterly payment. \nIt ends this month. The January, February, and March quarter for \nMedicaid is vitally important to them. And then when we have the, I \nthink, good judgment to include that in the continuing resolution and \nthe House said there are other means of paying it, well, if there are \nother means of paying it, let us not fuss at the Secretary of the \nTreasury trying to keep the Government open and keep it afloat with \nmoney when he finds other ways to make ends meet around here.\n  So I just wanted to make the point, and I do not want to offend my \nfriend from Virginia. I understand what the Senate is trying to do and \nI applaud Senator Dole for saying he does not want to shut the \nGovernment down. So the blame now is where it ought to be. The blame \nnow is where it ought to be, not on the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19233-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19234-S19235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, these budget proposals now being \nnegotiated will directly affect virtually every segment of the \nGovernment and every citizen of this country.\n  I am strongly in support of deficit reduction and favor the \nelimination of the national debt over a period of time. I have long \nsupported a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I supported \nthe 1993 reconciliation bill which has already led to significant \nreductions in our annual deficits. But as with any omnibus legislation \nof this type, there is a right and wrong way to pursue the same goal.\n  In our endeavor to achieve reductions in deficit spending, our \npriorities should be to reach an agreement on a 7-year budget and \neliminating the Federal deficit. I think this is the wrong time for tax \ncuts. Eliminating tax cuts from the equation at this time will enable \nus to reach an agreement on the budget, and overcome this political \nimpasse. Consideration on the proposed tax cuts should be postponed for \n2 years to determine if deficit targets are being met, and in order to \nallow intensive study and hearings to determine what taxes should be \nreduced and how much taxes can be cut without detouring off the road \ntoward a balanced budget.\n  Furthermore, focusing our attention to balancing the budget and \nreducing the Federal deficit, while postponing consideration of tax \ncuts, will allow hundreds of thousands of Federal workers to return to \nwork and return a sense of financial stability to our country.\n  I have several major concerns surrounding the proposals, but the most \ndisturbing are the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. The Republican plan \nwould cut Medicare growth by $270 billion over 7 years. It mandated a \nmajor restructuring of the program to supposedly give Medicare \nenrollees a wide range of options to join private health plans. \nHowever, I am concerned that instead of options, senior citizens would \nbe faced with fewer alternatives, and forced into certain plans because \nthey have no choice.\n  This direction would ultimately cause senior citizens to be charged \nmore for health care while receiving less in Medicare. A great portion \nof the savings in Medicare would result by raising the part B premium. \nThe premiums that our senior citizens pay would rise from the $46.10 \nper month to nearly $90.00 by the year 2002.\n  I have reservations and misgivings with regard to any Medicare reform \nthat threatens the access to, and quality of, health care for senior \ncitizens. I am fearful that the Republican plan would cut inpatient \nhospital service, home health care services, extended care services, \nhospice care, physicians services, outpatient hospital services, \ndiagnostic tests, and other important services to our senior citizens.\n  In addition to a reduction in services, the following immediate \nburdens would be placed on our senior citizens: For fiscal year 1996, \nthe monthly premium would rise to $53.70. Participants in the part B \nprogram would be required to pay the first $150.00 of expenses out-of-\npocket rather than the current $100 deductible. These combinations with \nthe proposal to raise the eligibility age to 67 leads me to believe \nthat seniors are being singled out to bear the brunt of budget cuts.\n  These extreme cuts to Medicare also threaten health care for millions \nof people of all ages living in rural America. Since rural hospitals \nrely on Medicare for a significant proportion of their revenue, they \nwill be particularly hard hit. Some will be forced to close altogether. \nHospitals in rural areas are \n\n[[Page S19235]]\nfew and far between. A hospital closing affects all rural residents in \nthe vicinity, not just seniors on Medicare. Under the GOP plan, these \nAmericans will be forced to drive further to the nearest hospital, \nputting lives at risk.\n  Not only do these proposals cut Medicare, but Medicaid is also being \nreduced over the next 7 years. For the past 30 years, the Medicaid \nProgram has been America's health and long-term care safety net. The \nRepublican proposal was to repeal Medicaid, slash its Federal funding \nover the next 7 years, and to turn remaining Federal funds over to the \nStates in the form of a block grant. In a State like Alabama, which is \nhabitually faced with budget proration, the effects of such additional \nburdens would be huge and devastating.\n  The bottom line is this--these Medicaid cuts are simply too much, too \nsoon. Our State will not be able to cope without hurting people \nseverely.\n  Mr. President, as I stated before, our primary objective must be to \nfirst focus on passing a budget that reduces the Federal deficit \nwithout putting Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid at risk, \nand then after 2 years, turn our attention to the issue of reducing \ntaxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19234-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PASSAGE OF THE SOURCE TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, I am extremely pleased to announce \nthat the source tax bill has again passed both houses. As many of you \nknow, this legislation was passed in the 102d and 103d Congresses, and \nagain in the 104th Congress as an amendment to the budget bill, only to \nbe struck because of the so called Byrd rule. I have been working on \nthis issue virtually since I came to Congress.\n  There are many people who have been essential to the bill's passage, \nand I wish to acknowledge some of them now. This issue was brought to \nmy attention by a Navadan named Bill Hoffman. He told me about the \nunjust cases of retirees being taxed by States they no longer were \nliving in. Many of these stories were very tragic, because the retiree \nrelied completely on their pension incomes to survive.\n  Bill and his wife Joanne heard so many of these tragic stories that \neventually they started an organization known as Retirees to Eliminate \nState Income Source Tax [RESIST]. RESIST was founded in July 1988 in \nCarson City, NV. In less than 4 years, it had grown in membership to \ntens of thousands of members. It includes members of every State of the \nUnion. RESIST is truly a nonprofit, grass roots organization, and I \ncongratulate and thank Bill and Joanne today for their tireless \nefforts. Without their help the source tax bill would not have made it \nto this stage today.\n  I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Chairman Roth and \nSenator Moynihan, their staff, and especially the Finance Committee \nstaff, for all of their help getting the source tax bill out of \ncommittee and to the floor. With everything that has been going on in \nrecent weeks, they made this bill a priority and I am very grateful for \ntheir hard work.\n  I also extend my thanks to Senator Bryan and Congresswoman Barbara \nVucanovich and her staff. The Congresswoman has also been working on \nthis bill for a very long time, and my colleague, Senator Bryan, has \nbeen continually supportive and essential in the passage of this bill.\n  Currently, retirees may be forced to pay taxes to States where they \ndo not reside, and from which they receive no benefits. This is truly \nan unfair practice, especially for those retirees with relatively low \nincomes. This bill prohibits States from taxing the retirement income \nof nonresidents. It ends taxation without representation. It will \nprotect all income received from pension plans recognized as qualified \nunder the Internal Revenue Code. It will also exempt income received \nunder certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans.\n  Often times, the pension income retirees receive is the only income \nthey have on which to live. I have heard many stories of the \ndevastating effects of taxing these pensions. One story, which I have \ntold on this floor before, is of an older woman from Fallon, NV, who \nhad an annual income of between $12,000 and $13,000 a year. One day she \nreceives a notice from California saying she owes taxes on her pension \nincome from California, plus the penalties and interest on those taxes.\n  The California Franchise Board had gone back to 1978 and calculated \nher tax debt to be about $6,000. That is half of her annual income. \nThis story, as unfair and unequitable as it sounds, is unfortunately \nnot unique. That is why this legislation is such a big victory for all \nretirees in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19235-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as this unprecedented Government \n``shutdown'' continues, I trust we will not fail to consider its impact \nin terms of how it affects so many individuals.\n  In my home State of Wyoming--a ``public lands'' State--the closure of \nnational treasures such as Yellowstone National Park inflicts pain and \nfrustration on many fronts. This closure, and the shutdown of related \nfacilities and activities in my State, is a ``hammer blow'' to the \nrecreation industry. It is an extreme disappointment to those who have \nlong planned outdoor recreational vacations in that pristine winter \nenvironment. It also has a devastating economic impact on businesses \nand individuals throughout the region.\n  All across America, people's lives are being harshly affected by this \naction and it is all too easy--in our effort to view this problem on a \nregional, national, or even philosophical scale--to forget the needs \nand desires of the many individuals who sent us here to Washington not \nto bicker things to death, but to try to resolve them.\n  Let me cite here another example of the many affects of the shutdown \nof key services and facilities. I am deeply honored to serve as a \nRegent of the Smithsonian Institution. It is shut down. People from \naround our Nation--and from all around the world--as a part of this \nholiday season, have gathered their families to visit the Anacostia \nMuseum, the Arts and Industries Building, the Cooper-Hewitt National \nDesign Museum in New York, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Hirshorn \nMuseum and Sculpture Garden, the National Air and Space Museum, the \nNational Museum of African Art, and National Museum of American Art, \nthe National Museum of American History, the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian, the National Museum of Natural History, the National \nPortrait Gallery, the National Postal Museum, the National Zoological \nPark, the Renwick Gallery, the Arthur Sackler Gallery, the Smithsonian \n``Castle,'' the National Zoo, and a host of research facilities. But \nthey won't. They can't. These facilities are not open to the taxpaying \npublic. Their treasures are not to be viewed. The people who so wish to \nvisit them over the holidays must be wondering wide-eyed, ``What on \nearth is going on!?''\n  The museums of the Smithsonian report more than 25 million visitors \nannually. This great treasure of an institution is about to celebrate \nits 150th anniversary. And yet it is closed.\n  Last December more than 1 million people visited the Smithsonian \nmuseums and galleries.\n  In past years, visitorship in the last week of December has been \ndouble the week before. This year, most likely, it will not be.\n  The Smithsonian's retail shops and restaurants netted $2.6 million \nfor the Institution last December--$440,000 in the final week alone, \nnot counting restaurant proceeds. This is traditionally one of the most \nproductive months for these operations of the Smithsonian. Until this \nyear.\n  Another beneficiary of the Smithsonian's ``draw'' is the District of \nColumbia--itself in the midst of a major financial crisis. The \nSmithsonian's closure will certainly result in a parallel reduction of \nincome for the District, as people learn there is no reason--and no \nway-- to visit.\n\n[[Page S19236]]\n\n  In the case of Yellowstone Park, our three-member Wyoming delegation \nis working with our fine Governor, Jim Geringer, and with the \nDepartment of Interior in a sincere effort to craft an arrangement \nwhereby Yellowstone can be reopened. It is not yet known whether that \ncan yet happen, but if that is the case, the impact of this regrettable \n``shutdown'' can be, at least to that certain degree, minimized--1997 \nwill be Yellowstone's 125th anniversary.\n  The Smithsonian will be celebrating a birthday too. I trust that \nlater today we will be able to call up and pass H.R. 2627, the House \npassed legislation authorizing the minting of a commemorative coin \ncelebrating the Smithsonian's 150 years of existence. This legislation \nis being presently held at the desk, has been ``cleared'' on our side \nof the aisle and, I believe, will soon be ``cleared'' on the other \nside.\n  Swift passage of this legislation will be a clear and bright signal \nof our concern for this wonderful institution. Sales of this \ncommemorative coin will help to minimize the financial damage of this \nunfortunate shutdown to the Smithsonian.\n  And beyond all that, I trust that in this holiday season we might be \nespecially mindful of our duties and responsibilities to our Nation, \nour States, and our dear friends, family and neighbors as we deal with \nthe vexing issues that divide us. Perhaps those eternal concepts of \nintegrity, common purpose, trust, fair compromise and statesmanship can \nagain carry us through this difficulty, helping us to responsibly agree \nas to the path that should guide us and so many future generations of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak about this crucial yet \npotentially devastating issue of raising the debt ceiling. It's \ncertainly obvious why raising the debt ceiling is so crucial--the \nGovernment must meet its obligations.\n  However, I do find this whole exercise a devastating testament to the \ncontinuing excesses of spending.\n  Last year, I served on the bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and \nTax Reform, which was guided through the deep swamps of entitlement \nspending by two remarkable and courageous men--Senator Bob Kerrey, who \nserved as our able chairman, and our former colleague, Senator Jack \nDanforth, who served as vice chairman.\n  From June through December, the Commission held a series of public \nmeetings in which we looked for any and all ways to slow down the \nincredible pace at which entitlement spending is growing. Along the \nway, the Commission approved--by a vote of 30 to 1--an interim report \nwhich spelled out some highly sobering truths about Federal spending.\n  Perhaps the single most important finding in the interim report was \nthat entitlement spending and interest on the debt together accounted \nfor almost 62 percent of all Federal expenditures in 1993. Furthermore, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this spending will \nconsume fully 72 percent of the Federal budget by the year 2003 if the \npresent trends continue. These are expenditures that occur \nautomatically without Members of Congress casting so much as a single \nvote. This ought to serve as a ``wake-up call'' to all of us that we \nare headed on a course to disaster unless we act affirmatively to \nchange course.\n  By the year 2012--less than 20 years away--entitlements and interest \non the mounting debt will together consume all tax revenues collected \nby the Federal Government. We stand to have no money left over for \nnational defense, education, national parks--pick your program.\n  Unfortunately, the Commission concluded its business in December \nwithout reaching an agreement on specific recommendations for bringing \nentitlement spending under control. That was most disappointing to me. \nI offered my own solution, as did the Co-Chairs, Senators Kerrey and \nDanforth, but the majority of the Commission would not endorse the \nnecessary measures.\n  However, 24 of the Commission's 32 members joined in writing a letter \nto President Clinton, emphasizing the need for ``immediate action'' and \noutlining various policy options--some of which Senator Kerrey and I \nhave introduced in a retirement reform package to shore up the Social \nSecurity Program.\n  Each of us has an obligation--not only to our constituents, but to \nourselves and our children and grandchildren--to confront these issues \nhead-on. Whatever outrage and hostility we may encounter from today's \ndefenders of the ``status quo''--and there will be plenty of it, a \nworld of it--it will pale in comparison to the richly deserved scorn we \nwill receive from future generations if we fail to have the courage to \nact on the impending entitlements crisis.\n  So as we act on the raising of the debt ceiling, let us remember what \nthis means to our children and grandchildren who will be billed for \nthis debt. That's why I supported the inclusion of a ``generational \naccounting'' chapter in the President's budget. We need to be reminded \nof what this debt means to future generations, and why defenders of the \nstatus quo who oppose our budget-balancing efforts should be called to \naccount.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19235-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19236-S19237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MARVIN STONE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marvin L. Stone, the chairman and president \nof the International Media Fund, has issued a final report on a 5-year \neffort he headed to assist emerging journalists in the former Soviet \nUnion in identifying their new role as skeptics, rather than employees, \nof the state.\n  Mr. Stone and volunteers from the U.S. newspapers and media have \ntaught, trained, and conducted workshops to give a boost to men and \nwomen who were struggling to nurture new independent media in the post-\nCommunist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\n  It was not an easy task. Mr. Stone reports that IMF encountered a \nbloated, entrenched, corrupting bureaucracy in the wake of the \nCommunist collapse. And this bureaucracy, Stone adds, continues to \nfight a rear guard attempt at redemption--and a return to power.\n  The guiding principle brought to Central and Eastern Europe by Mr. \nStone is the first amendment, a beacon that has kept America on course \nfor more than 200 years. We can only hope that at some future date, it \nwill be in the preamble of every constitution adopted by the countries \nof the old Eastern bloc.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the message from Chairman \nStone be printed in the Congressional Record so that other Americans \nmay learn of the work of this native Vermonter and the important \ncontribution of IMF to sustain democracy in the post-cold-war world.\n  I have relied on his advice and his dedication to public service for \na generation. All Americans owe him thanks for all he does.\n  There being no objection, the material was the ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                       Message From the Chairman\n\n                          (By Marvin L. Stone)\n\n       Five years ago a few of us started a three-year project \n     whose goal was both simple and straightforward: to give a \n     boost to men and women who were struggling to nurture new \n     independent media in the post-Communist countries of Central \n     and Eastern Europe.\n       It may cross the mind that we overstayed our leave by two \n     years. The fact is that we, and others in the field, \n     underestimated how difficult was the challenge. The \n     Communists left behind a bloated, entrenched, corrupting \n     bureaucracy. Even now it is obvious that these same \n     apparatchicks are fighting a rear guard attempt at \n     redemption--and a return to power.\n       So, while we are wrapping up our five years before the job \n     is finished, we are eager to share our experiences with \n     others who will continue what we have started. Perhaps the \n     report on these pages will be of help.\n       Largely, ours is a story of going in cold to work with a \n     skeptical bunch of journalists in countries as different as \n     Estonia is from Albania, as Poland is from Hungary.\n       ``Why are you here?'' was always question Number One.\n       It soon became known that although the International Media \n     Fund was financed largely by U.S. government dollars, it had \n     a fiercely independent Board of Directors and an army of \n     volunteer American editors, publishers, broadcasters and \n     academics willing to join in our effort. From the start is \n     was understood that the U.S. government would not interfere \n     with policy decisions of the Board.\n       Surveys by our own staff soon indicated what we had already \n     sensed: that it was not going to be possible to try to build \n     the new media from the top down. The ideological roots of \n     anyone over 40 were too deeply implanted. So we decided to \n     build from the bottom up. Training was aimed at younger \n     newcomers starting to work in the field. We invited local \n     universities to let us help train \n\n[[Page S19237]]\n     their youngsters, the opinion-molders of tomorrow. And we also helped \n     establish journalism resource centers to work with college-\n     age students and professionals--and, yes, wannabees off the \n     street. At the same time, we did not neglect business \n     workshops, to help the new independent newspapers and \n     broadcast stations survive in the competitive marketplaces of \n     ideas and economics.\n       We've tried to put some numbers together (including our \n     work over the last two years in Russia).\n       By our reckoning:\n       We conducted 29 workshops for about 1,300 broadcasters.\n       We arranged 14 special broadcast survey and consultation \n     trips.\n       We conducted 13 business workshops for some 650 newspaper \n     executives.\n       We held 22 journalism and business workshops, jointly held \n     for about 1,000 broadcast and newspaper participants.\n       We established 14 university radio and television training \n     facilities or stations.\n       We helped start 16 university student publications.\n       We worked with 19 Central and Eastern European \n     universities.\n       And those figures do not include the participants at the \n     great many workshops and training courses held at the six \n     journalism resources centers supported by the Fund, or the \n     training equipment supplied by the Fund to those centers, or \n     the participation by Fund representatives as speakers or \n     discussion leaders in numerous media conferences arranged by \n     others in the U.S. and Europe.\n       Our donations of technical equipment is equally impressive. \n     In fact, the Media Fund is leaving behind a substantial \n     presence--giant printing presses, computer units, radio \n     stations, television companies, journalism centers and \n     university courses, none of which existed five years ago.\n       But beyond a check list is something more important. Our \n     hundred or so American volunteer professionals made a lasting \n     impression whenever they ventured--from Vladivostok in the \n     east to Prague in the west, from Tallinn in the north to \n     Tirana in the south, with Warsaw and Bratislva and Bucharest \n     and other cities in between. And our own small staff, of \n     course, made all this possible--a vigorous start to a job yet \n     to be completed. We are leaving the scene early only because \n     our primary source of funding no longer allows us the freedom \n     and flexibility to carry out the mission for which we were \n     created.\n       The labor of these five years is our legacy from those of \n     us who have lived in a land with a free press to those \n     journalist sin other lands who wish to enshrine democracy in \n     the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19236-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF JUDGE COFFIN'S APPOINTMENT TO THE FEDERAL COURT \n                               OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. COHEN Mr. President, 30 years ago, President Johnson wisely \nacceded to Senator Edmund Muskie, urging that Frank Coffin be nominated \nto fill a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. \nSoon afterwards the President sent Senator Muskie a photograph of the \ntwo of them inscribed ``Dear Ed, Come let us reason together--L.B.J.'' \nThis is the very message that Judge Coffin has been delivering to \ncolleagues on the bench, advocates at the bar, and scholars across the \ncountry--``come, let us reason together.'' And for three decades now, \njurists, lawyers, and academics have responded to this invitation to \nengage in a dialog about the law with the learned barrister from \nLewiston.\n  Judge Coffin came to the law in a more simple time, before the age of \nmega-firms, multimillion-dollar verdicts, and television cameras in the \ncourtroom. He hung out his shingle in Lewiston and practiced law the \nway many lawyers probably wish they could today, in a one-man firm \nservicing the day-to-day legal needs of his individual clients. His \nrelationship with a fellow Bates College graduate, Ed Muskie, brought \nhim into politics, and then, after almost a decade of service in \nCongress and the executive branch, he joined the bench.\n  From his vantage point on the first circuit, he has witnessed a \nrevolution in the law, from the activist period of the Warren and \nBurger courts, to the new formalism of today's majority. Yet he has \nremained a pragmatist, examining the nuances of each set of facts, \nidentifying the competing interests at stake, and then drafting an \noption that candidly expresses the reasons for the court's ultimate \njudgment. Judge Coffin's concern has been with legal craftsmanship, not \ntrendy theorizing. The careful balancing of competing interests ``is \nnot jurisprudential theory,'' he has written, ``but, done well, it is a \ndisciplined process, a process with demanding standards of specificity, \nsensitivity, and candor.''\n  He is a product of the age of civility. Advocates who have appeared \nbefore the court, often in the harshest of disputes, aptly characterize \nhim as ``a real gentleman, kind and decent, smart as a whip, formal and \npolite, a great judge.'' ``He has the kind of demeanor,'' one attorney \nwrote, ``where everyone comes out of court feeling good, even the \neventual losers.''\n  He has dedicated the lion's share of his career to public life and \nbelieves strongly in the virtues of public service. ``I do worry about \nyoung people today,'' he has said, ``going into the most lucrative \nprofessions where they earn immense amounts of money rather than \nworking in public service, which needs good people more than ever.''\n  For 30 years, the people of Maine, litigants before the first \ncircuit, and the legal profession in general have benefited from the \nservice of a good person--Frank Coffin. Lawyer, politician, jurist, \nscholar, he continues to contribute to the quality of our national \ndialog.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19237-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19237-S19239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S. INTERNATIONAL AVIATION POLICY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \ndevelopment in U.S. international aviation policy that occurred over \nthe past year. I do not refer to any particular bilateral aviation \nagreement, although the number of new international air service \nopportunities created in 1995 was impressive and unprecedented. \nInstead, I wish to highlight the critical lesson we learned during the \nyear and, hopefully, will continue to apply.\n  Simply put, the best way for the United States to secure the \nstrongest possible international aviation agreements is for our \nnegotiators to make decisions based on economic analysis with the goal \nof maximizing benefits for the U.S. economy. In other words, \ninternational aviation decisions should turn on what is best for our \ncountry, not which carriers can generate the most political support. In \n1995, Transportation Secretary Pena did an excellent job in this regard \nand the results speak for themselves. U.S. passenger and cargo carriers \nare capitalizing on a plethora of new international opportunities, \nwhile the increased competition brings consumers lower air fares, \nreduced shipping costs, and greater choices.\n  This new focus on economic analysis, which I have advocated and \nenthusiastically support, is beneficial in several other regards. \nFirst, it has the practical effect of elevating U.S. international \naviation policy to the status of a national trade issue. Second, it \nclearly defines the criteria the United States applies in assessing \ninternational aviation agreements and, by doing so, gives foreign \nnations a clearer understanding of what will and will not be acceptable \nto our negotiators. Finally, it prevents foreign nations from \nexploiting parochial disagreements between our carriers.\n  Looking ahead to 1996, it is imperative that sound economic analysis \ncontinues to be the guiding principle in our international aviation \nnegotiations. We face a number of significant challenges, most notably \naviation policy with Japan and the United Kingdom. Also, we have a \ngolden opportunity to obtain an open skies agreement with Germany which \nwould be a catalyst for further liberalization of air service \nopportunities throughout Europe. Next year is shaping up to be a very \nimportant year for U.S. international aviation policy.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that I believe the best bilateral \naviation agreement for all parties involved is one which is open and \npermits market forces to determine what air service is provided in \nparticular markets. Open skies agreements ensure consumers pay a \ncompetitive air fare, maximize consumer choice, and promote greater \nefficiencies for all carriers. Having made that important point, let me \nbriefly turn to our relations with our three most important aviation \ntrading partners overseas: Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n  As I have said in this body before, the major impediment to \nliberalizing aviation relations with the Government of Japan is the \nhigh operating costs of Japanese carriers. Due in large part to Japan's \ntightly regulated airline industry, Japanese carriers have operating \ncosts significantly higher than United \n\n[[Page S19238]]\nStates competitors. Until the Government of Japan permits its carriers \nto become more competitive, there will be enormous pressure within \nJapan to continue to protect the Japanese air service market.\n  The Government of Japan, along with other Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation [APEC] members including the United States, recently \ncommitted to work toward the goal of free and open trade between all \nmember nations. The so-called Bogor Declaration has the potential to \nhave a major impact on United States-Japan aviation relations. Time \nwill tell.\n  One thing, however, is certain in United States-Japan aviation \nrelations. The continued refusal of the Government of Japan to abide by \nthe terms of United States-Japan bilateral aviation agreement \nconcerning beyond rights guaranteed to several of our carriers will \nundoubtedly complicate aviation relations between our two countries.\n  Currently, the Government of Japan is refusing to honor United \nAirlines' right to provide service between Osaka and Seoul, Korea. \nAlso, Federal Express Corporation is being wrongfully denied the right \nto provide service between Japan and China. In August, this body \nunanimously passed a resolution I sponsored calling on the Government \nof Japan to respect the beyond rights of our so-called 1952 carriers. \nApparently that message has not yet been heard.\n  Why have beyond rights become such a point of contention between the \nUnited States and Japan? From a long-term perspective, I suspect it has \nsomething to do with the fact that passenger and cargo service \nopportunities in the Asia-Pacific market beyond Japan are booming. For \nexample, the International Air Transport Association [IATA] estimates \nby the year 2010 there will be around 288 million international \npassengers traveling within the intra-Asian air service market alone. \nBeyond rights from Japan are absolutely essential if U.S. carriers are \nto fully participate in the booming Asia-Pacific market.\n  Turning to aviation relations with the United Kingdom, I continue to \nbe very concerned about the extremely restrictive United States-United \nKingdom bilateral aviation agreement. Of all our international aviation \nagreements, I believe the most restrictive agreement--and therefore our \nmost anticonsumer bilateral--is the so-called Bermuda II agreement with \nthe United Kingdom. Ironically, in areas other than aviation, our trade \nrelations with the British are generally based on free market \nprinciples.\n  How lopsided is the United States-United Kingdom bilateral aviation \nagreement? For starters, recent statistics indicate approximately 58 \npercent of the passenger traffic between the United States and the \nUnited Kingdom is carried on British carriers. Due to capacity controls \nand other restrictions, our carriers are forced to settle for 42 \npercent of that traffic.\n  Moreover, according to a recent report prepared by the Commission of \nEuropean Communities [EC], between 1984 and 1994 British carriers \nimproved their market share vis-a-vis United States carriers by 21 \npercent. During the same period, a majority of carriers from other \nEuropean Community countries lost market share. These statistics are \nparticularly remarkable when one considers the fact that operating \ncosts of European carriers generally are higher than those of U.S. \ncarriers. Clearly, market factors are not controlling the distribution \nof air service opportunities between the United States and Britain.\n  Mr. President, the principal problem in United States-United Kingdom \ninternational aviation relations continues to be access for our \npassenger carriers to London's Heathrow Airport. Access to Heathrow is \nparticularly important since it is arguably the most important gateway \nairport in the world. It offers connecting service opportunities \nworldwide. In fact, approximately one-third of all passengers traveling \nto Heathrow connect to flights elsewhere.\n  So why is access to Heathrow such a sticking point? The British argue \nthe sole explanation is airport congestion. This may be part of the \nproblem but, as I explained to this body several months ago, the \nBritish could create significant new take-off and landing opportunities \nat Heathrow simply by switching their runway operations to a more \nefficient operating mode. Perhaps another factor is yields on flights \nto Heathrow are generally 15 percent higher than those to London \nGatwick Airport. Heathrow is the hub of British Airways, the most \nprofitable airline in the world.\n  Since October, phase 2 negotiations with the British have been \nsuspended. I believe, however, we owe it to consumers on both sides of \nthe Atlantic to continue to press for further liberalization of the \nUnited States-United Kingdom bilateral aviation agreement. In that \nregard, I recently wrote Sir Colin Marshall, the chairman of British \nAirways, in response to his call for a ``bigger, bolder and braver \napproach'' to liberalizing air service opportunities between our two \ncountries. I hope his enthusiasm is shared by the British Government.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my correspondence to Sir Colin \nMarshall to which I have referred be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, in contrast to the reluctance of the \nBritish to liberalize air service opportunities between our countries, \na very important opportunity has presented itself in Germany. Based on \na recent meeting with German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann, I \nbelieve the German Government is enthusiastic about promptly securing \nan open skies agreement with the United States. For this reason, I \nrecently wrote Secretary Pena and Secretary Christopher urging them to \nintensify our negotiating efforts with Germany. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of that correspondence be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. What would an open skies agreement with Germany mean \nfor United States carriers? Such an agreement would produce significant \ndirect and indirect benefits for our carriers. Let me explain.\n  In terms of direct benefits, an open skies agreement with Germany \nwould immediately produce new air service opportunities for our \ncarriers between the United States and Germany. Equally important, \nGerman airports would provide well-situated gateway opportunities for \nour carriers to serve points beyond Germany such as the Middle East and \nthe booming Asia-Pacific market. In that regard, the Germans recently \nhave expanded airport capacity in Frankfurt and Munich, and a new \ninternational airport is planned in Berlin-Brandenburg.\n  The potential of Germany as a gateway to the Asia-Pacific market is \nparticularly intriguing. IATA estimates that by the year 2010, 10 \npercent of all international passengers traveling to the Asia-Pacific \nregion annually will originate in Europe. Significantly, that is the \nsame percentage of Asia-Pacific passengers IATA estimates will \noriginate in North America.\n  With respect to indirect benefits, an open skies agreement with \nGermany would be an important catalyst for further liberalization of \nair service opportunities throughout Europe. To put this point in \nperspective, an open skies agreement with Germany--in combination with \nliberalized air service agreements we already secured with the \nNetherlands in 1992 and with nine other European countries earlier this \nyear--would mean nearly half of all passengers traveling between the \nUnited States and Europe would be flying to or from European countries \nwith open skies regimes.\n  Under such a scenario, tremendous competitive pressure would be \nbrought to bear on European countries with whom we do not have \nliberalized aviation relations. The recent European Commission report \non EC/U.S. aviation relations supports my assessment of the competitive \nimpact of an open skies agreement with Germany. In its report, the EC \nastutely concluded that as a result of our successful initiatives to \nsecure open skies agreements with some European countries, other \nEuropean countries which resist liberalization ``will either have to \nfollow the open skies policy, or risk being left behind in the \ncompetition and in market share.'' \n\n[[Page S19239]]\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the competitive impact of an open skies \nagreement with Germany would be particularly acute in the United \nKingdom and France. As a result, such an agreement would have the \nsignificant collateral benefit of strengthening our hand in \nnegotiations with both the British and the French. Let there be no \nmistake, both British and French airports are today competing with \nother European airports for international travelers and statistics \nclearly show the trend favors countries with an open skies policy.\n  For instance, between 1992 and 1994, total passenger traffic between \nthe United States and the Netherlands grew an astounding 56 percent. \nDuring the same period, total passenger traffic between the United \nStates and the United Kingdom grew just 7.5 percent. What does this \nillustrate? It demonstrates that Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is \ndrawing passenger traffic originating in the United States away from \nUnited Kingdom airports, particularly Heathrow. The significance of \nthis point is not fully appreciated until it is understood that \ncurrently passengers connecting onto British carriers at Heathrow alone \naccount for more than 1 billion pounds a year in export earnings for \nthe United Kingdom.\n  Since this is such a critical point, let me share another example of \nmarket forces driving passengers to European countries that have an \nopen skies agreement with the United States. Between 1992 and 1994, the \nnumber of passengers traveling from Germany to the United States was \nmore or less stable. During that same period, the number of German \npassengers choosing to travel to the United States via Amsterdam's \nSchiphol Airport increased approximately 80 percent.\n  The potential direct and indirect benefits of an open skies agreement \nwith Germany are tremendous. As I have said, I believe Secretary Pena \nand Secretary Christopher should aggressively pursue this opportunity.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that the international \naviation challenges we face in 1996 make it imperative that our \nnegotiators continue to make decisions based on economic analysis with \nthe goal of maximizing benefits for the United States economy. This was \na successful formula in our 1995 international aviation negotiations. \nIn 1996, it is critical we build on the lesson we learned over the past \nyear.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                Washington, DC, November 21, 1995.\n     Sir. Colin Marshall,\n     Chairman, British Airways, Berkeley Square House, 6th Floor, \n         London, England.\n       Dear Sir Colin: With great interest I read your speech on \n     United States/United Kingdom aviation relations delivered to \n     the Wings Club in New York last week. Your call for a \n     ``bigger, bolder and braver approach'' to liberalizing air \n     service opportunities between our countries peaked the \n     interest of many on this side of the Atlantic.\n       I agree with you that no two nations are better suited to \n     have a fully liberalized transatlantic air service market \n     than the United States and the United Kingdom. To the extent \n     nations worldwide have embraced the Bermuda I and Bermuda II \n     agreements as a model for restricting air service \n     opportunities in their markets, such an initiative would \n     undoubtedly serve as a shining example for open aviation \n     markets globally. As you correctly observed, consumers \n     benefit most when markets are open and competition is robust.\n       I hope we can continue the dialogue we started in London in \n     July on how this vision can come to pass. In the meantime, \n     please contact me or Michael Korens of my staff if I can be \n     of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, \n         SW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Pena: As Chairman of the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I am writing to urge \n     you to intensify your efforts to obtain an open skies \n     aviation agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany. I am \n     aware that some progress has been made in this regard. I \n     believe, however, the importance of this initiative calls for \n     renewed vigor on the part of both the Department of \n     Transportation and the Department of State.\n       In addition to immediately creating additional new \n     opportunities for our carriers in Germany, such an agreement \n     would be enormously beneficial to our national interest in \n     liberalizing air service markets throughout Europe. Simply \n     put, an open skies agreement with Germany would bring \n     considerable competitive pressure to bear on all European \n     countries which currently restrict air service opportunities \n     to our carriers.\n       For instance, I believe an open skies agreement with \n     Germany would contribute significantly to our efforts to \n     liberalize our air service relationship with the United \n     Kingdom. Moreover, such an agreement would provide invaluable \n     leverage in securing a bilateral aviation agreement with \n     France.\n       Mr. Secretary, I am aware that you share my vision of an \n     open skies agreement with Germany. As your efforts in that \n     regard intensify, please contact me if I can be of \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19237-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19239-S19249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to Section 303 of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(b)), a \nNotice of Adoption of Procedural Rules, together with a copy of the \nadopted rules, was submitted by the Office of Compliance, U.S. \nCongress. These rules, first published in the Record of November 14, \n1995, govern the procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged \nviolation of the laws made applicable under Part A of Title II of the \nCongressional Accountability Act. (P.L. 104-1).\n  The Congressional Accountability Act specifies that the Notice and \nrules be printed in the Congressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous \nconsent that the notice and adopted rules be printed in the Record.\n  Furthermore, the Office of Compliance has available, for review, a \n``red-lined'' copy of the proposed rules which were published in the \nCongressional Record on November 14, 1995. This ``red-lined'' copy, \nalong with the final rules, will enable interested parties to note the \nchanges that were made.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n                            Procedural Rules\n\n\n                 NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n       Summary: Section 303 of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act directs the Executive Director of the Office of \n     Compliance to adopt rules governing the procedures of the \n     office. After considering comments to the Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking published November 14, 1995 in the Congressional \n     Record, the Executive Director has adopted and is publishing \n     rules to govern the procedures for consideration and \n     resolution of alleged violations of the laws made applicable \n     under Part A of Title II of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act (P.L. 104-1). Pursuant to Section 303(a) the rules have \n     been approved by the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance.\n       For Further Information Contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, Room LA-200, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, DC 20540-1999. Telephone (202) 252-3100.\n\n                         Background and summary\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), PL \n     104-1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 et. seq. In general, the CAA applies the rights and \n     protections of eleven federal labor and employment law \n     statutes to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the legislative branch. Section 301 of the CAA establishes \n     the Office of Compliance as an independent office within that \n     branch. Section 303 of the CAA directs that the Executive \n     Director, the chief operating officer of the Office of \n     Compliance, shall, subject to the approval of the Board, \n     adopt rules governing the procedures for the Office of \n     Compliance, including the procedures of Hearing Officers. The \n     rules that follow establish the procedures by which the \n     Office of Compliance will provide for the consideration and \n     resolution of alleged violations of the laws made applicable \n     under Part A of Title II of the CAA. The rules include \n     procedures for counseling, mediation, and for electing \n     between filing a complaint with the Office of Compliance and \n     filing a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States. The rules also address the procedures for the conduct \n     of hearings held as a result of the filing of a complaint and \n     for appeals to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well as other \n     matters of general applicability to the dispute resolution \n     process and to the operations of the Office of Compliance.\n       To obtain input from interested persons on the content of \n     these rules the Executive Director published for comment a \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Congressional Record on \n     November 14, 1995 (141 Cong. R. S17012 (daily ed., November \n     14, 1995) (``NPR'')), inviting comments regarding the \n     proposed rules. Seven comments were received in response to \n     the proposed rules. \n\n[[Page S19240]]\n      Comments were received from Members of Congress, employing offices and \n     a management employee of the Architect of the Capitol \n     expressing his personal view. After full consideration of the \n     comments received, the Executive Director has, with the \n     approval of the Board, adopted these procedural rules.\n\n             Summary and board's consideration of comments\n\n                     Confidentiality and Sanctions\n\n       Summary of comments: Several commenters questioned whether \n     the CAA empowers the Board, Hearing Officers, or the Office \n     to impose sanctions for breaches of confidentiality. They \n     also stated that, assuming sanctions can be imposed, the \n     rules should provide more details as to what conduct may be \n     sanctioned, what the sanctions will be, and how those \n     sanctions will be imposed. One commenter noted that \n     identifying possible sanctions will help forestall any due \n     process challenges in the context of breaches of \n     confidentiality.\n       Response: Section 1.07 sets forth the standard for imposing \n     sanctions against individuals or employing offices that \n     violate the confidentiality provisions of section 416 of the \n     CAA. The form and procedures governing the imposition of \n     sanctions are modeled after Rule 37(b) of the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure.\n       Section 1.07 makes clear that the confidentiality \n     provisions prohibit any disclosure of information discussed \n     or exchanged in the course of counseling under Section 402, \n     mediation under Section 403 and Board hearings and \n     deliberations under Sections 405 and 406 of the CAA. Section \n     1.07 of the rules only prohibits the use of information \n     (including documents) which was obtained by the individual \n     during the counseling, mediation or other proceedings. \n     However, employees, employing offices and individuals that \n     participate in counseling, mediation or other confidential \n     proceedings are not prohibited by these rules from discussing \n     or disclosing information that was obtained by that person \n     outside the confidential proceedings. The Board believes that \n     a confidentiality rule of this breadth appropriately balances \n     the statutory mandates for confidentiality and the statutory \n     mandate to have open and effective counseling, mediation, \n     hearings and Board proceedings. Finally, this section makes \n     clear that communications necessary for the pursuit or \n     defense of claims under the CAA (communications with lawyers \n     or other representatives) are not prohibited, even if such \n     communications involve disclosure of the contents of \n     confidential proceedings. The Board believes that these \n     provisions adequately address the concerns expressed by \n     some commenters that the confidentiality provisions not \n     unduly limit the ability of employees and employing \n     offices to engage in communications which the law should \n     encourage and not discourage parties from utilizing the \n     procedures of the CAA.\n       It is the intent of the Board that Section 1.07 and the \n     confidentiality provisions apply to non-party participants \n     such as witnesses and representatives. Such persons have \n     voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Office of \n     Compliance by participating in the proceedings, or are \n     subject to the Office's jurisdiction by virtue of the \n     subpoena power. Section 1.07 is part of the general authority \n     of the Office of Compliance to set the rules and procedures \n     of the Office, including the procedures of hearing officers, \n     under Section 303(a) of the CAA. Section 1.07 is reasonably \n     necessary to preserve the confidentiality of counseling, \n     mediation and Board proceedings mandated by section 416 of \n     the CAA.\n       Section 1.07 does not authorize sanctions against personnel \n     of the Office of Compliance, as suggested by a commenter. \n     Although the Board agrees that the confidentiality provisions \n     apply to personnel of the Office of Compliance, the Board \n     believes that violations by Office personnel can be \n     adequately addressed as a disciplinary matter within the \n     Office, not under Section 1.07.\n\n                Filings by Facsimile Transmission (FAX)\n\n       Summary of Comments: On the filing of documents by FAX, two \n     commenters suggested that Sections 1.03 and 2.03 of the \n     proposed rules should clearly state that a request for \n     counseling can be filed by FAX. One commenter stated that the \n     rules should allow ``all documents'' to be filed by FAX. \n     Another commenter suggested that the rules expressly provide \n     that, in order to expedite the pre-hearing and hearing \n     processes, documents may be filed with a Hearing Officer by \n     FAX.\n       Response: The language of Section 1.03(a) has been \n     clarified to expressly provide that a formal request for \n     counseling may be filed by FAX and a provision has been added \n     to allow the Board or a Hearing Officer, in their discretion, \n     to order documents to be filed by FAX. Generally, allowing \n     all documents to be filed by FAX might impose undue burdens \n     on the receivers of FAX submissions and interfere with the \n     Office of Compliance's orderly handling of documents. \n     Accordingly, the proposed rule has not been modified to allow \n     for such filing.\n\n                 Withdrawals of Requests for Counseling\n\n       Summary of Comments: Several commenters suggested that \n     Section 2.03(k) of the proposed rules should limit an \n     employee's right to reinstate counseling to situations in \n     which the request for reinstatement of counseling is made \n     within the 180-day period established by Section 402 of the \n     CAA. One commenter also expressed concern about the prospect \n     of covered employees extending their claims indefinitely by \n     repeatedly withdrawing from counseling and then reinstating \n     the counseling request until the 30-day limit is reached. \n     Another commenter indicated that the 30-day statutory limit \n     on the counseling period requires the 30 days to be \n     consecutive with no hiatus.\n       Response: The revised rule permits a covered employee, who \n     has begun counseling, to withdraw from counseling with a \n     single opportunity to reinstate counseling so long as that \n     reinstatement request occurs within 180 days after the \n     alleged violation and the counseling period does not exceed a \n     total of 30 days. This addresses the commenter's concerns \n     regarding the timeliness of counseling and the possibility of \n     extended processing of claims. Because the Board is of the \n     view that allowing an aggregate of 30 days of counseling \n     conducted during two separate time frames is permissible \n     under the CAA, the proposed rule has not been further \n     modified.\n\n  Grievance Procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol \n                                 Police\n\n       Summary of Comments: Commenters asked for clarification in \n     Section 2.03(m) of the term ``grievance procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police'' under \n     Section 401 of the CAA. One commenter suggested that Section \n     203(m) also provide for the Executive Director to recommend \n     to any covered employees that they use grievance procedures \n     which may be instituted in the future in any other employing \n     offices.\n       Response: The adopted and approved rule defines the term \n     ``grievance procedures'' to include any internal procedure of \n     the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police that is \n     capable of resolving the issue about which the employee of \n     the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police has sought \n     counseling.\n       Section 2.03(m) of the proposed rules exists by virtue of \n     Section 401 of the CAA and reflects the statutory \n     authorization to toll the statutory counseling and mediation \n     periods if an employee of the Architect of the Capitol or the \n     Capitol Police accepts the recommendation of the Executive \n     Director. The CAA expressly authorizes such tolling of the \n     statutory time periods only with regard to an employee of \n     the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police, and \n     does not permit tolling in other circumstances.\n\n                        Discoverable Information\n\n       Summary of Comments: One commenter stated that Section 6.01 \n     should not limit discovery to ``relevant'' information. \n     Instead, the commenter suggested that, consistent with Rule \n     26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a hearing \n     officer should allow discovery of any information \n     ``reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of \n     admissible evidence.'' Another commenter requested that the \n     rules specifically provide for discovery of requests for \n     counseling and requests for mediation.\n       Response: The comments have been considered and the rule \n     that has been adopted reflects the discovery standard of Rule \n     26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The rule \n     does not, however, provide for the discovery of requests for \n     counseling or mediation because that change in the rule is \n     not necessary and could chill employees in their resort to \n     counseling and mediation and hamper the effectiveness of \n     those processes. To the extent that the commenter believes \n     discovery is necessary to determine whether the applicable \n     statutory requirements for filing a complaint have been met, \n     the Office intends to include sufficient information in the \n     notice of the end of the mediation period to allow such a \n     determination by the employing office to be made.\n\n                  Disqualification of Hearing Officers\n\n       Summary: Two commenters stated that Section 7.03 should \n     provide that the denial of a motion to disqualify a Hearing \n     Officer may be appealed directly to the Board, without review \n     by the Executive Director.\n       Response: The Board has approved a rule that eliminates the \n     requirement that the Executive Director review motions to \n     disqualify a Hearing Officer and provides for Board review of \n     the denial of a motion to disqualify during the appeal to the \n     Board, if any, of the Hearing Officer's decision on the \n     merits.\n\n                       Admissibility of Evidence\n\n       Summary of Comments: Two commenters suggested that the \n     procedural rules should not require a Hearing Officer to \n     apply the Federal Rules of Evidence. One commenter was \n     concerned that the reliance on the Federal Rules of Evidence \n     would require a covered employee to retain an attorney. \n     Another commenter stated that the rules should merely state \n     that the Hearing Officer shall apply the provisions of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (Sec. 554 through 557 of the \n     Title 5, U.S. Code) (APA), specifically Sec. 556(d) of Title \n     5, in hearing a case because Section 405(d)(3) of the CAA \n     instructs that the hearing shall be conducted, ``to the \n     greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the \n     principles and procedures'' of those sections of the APA. \n     This commenter asserts that the Federal Rules of Evidence set \n     a ``more restrictive'' standard than that found in the APA \n     and may limit the development of the hearing record.\n       Response: Section 7.09 of the rules has not been modified. \n     The Federal Rules of Evidence clarify and more fully develop \n     the APA provisions regarding evidentiary rulings. They are \n     complementary, not contradictory, to the APA. In addition, \n     the procedural rules require that the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence be applied ``to the greatest extent practicable.'' \n     Accordingly, a Hearing Officer, in his or her discretion, may \n     adapt, or \n\n[[Page S19241]]\n     depart from, these rules as warranted. Moreover, as the Federal Rules \n     of Evidence are applicable in the federal courts, the adopted \n     rule provides the collateral benefit of affording some \n     uniformity between the administrative hearing process of the \n     Office of Compliance and civil actions filed in the district \n     courts under Section 408 of the CAA.\n\n                    Informal Resolution of Disputes\n\n       Summary of Comments: Three comments were received with \n     respect to Section 9.03(b) of the proposed rules. Two \n     commenters questioned whether the informal resolution of \n     disputes is permitted under the CAA in light of the \n     requirements of Section 414. Another commenter stated that \n     the proposed rule should be revised because resolution of \n     disputes cannot exist without a mandatory waiver of a covered \n     employees rights or the commitment by the employing office to \n     an enforceable obligation.\n       Response: Section 9.03 of the rules has been reorganized to \n     clarify its intent and meaning. Before a complaint is filed, \n     an employee and an employing office may agree upon a mutually \n     satisfactory arrangement, thereby resolving the dispute \n     without a waiver by the employee or a commitment by the \n     employing office to an enforceable obligation. The Board has \n     considered the comments but is not persuaded that all early, \n     mutually satisfactory resolutions of disputes between \n     parties must be reduced to writing and approved by the \n     Executive Director under Section 414 of the CAA. Section \n     9.03 of the rules recognizes that the policy underlying \n     the CAA favors the early resolution of disputes and \n     permits a covered employee for whom counseling and \n     mediation has been successful to withdraw from the dispute \n     resolution process without the requirement that such \n     resolution be reduced to writing and submitted to the \n     Executive Director for approval.\n\n                       Attorney's fees and costs\n\n       Summary of Comments: One commenter suggested that Section \n     9.01(a) of the proposed rules be modified to prevent requests \n     for attorney's fees during the pendency of an appeal of the \n     Hearing Officer's decision. In this commenter's view, such \n     requests would be ``premature'' because the Board could \n     reverse a Hearing Officer's decision in the complainants \n     favor, making an award of fees inappropriate.\n       Response: The Board has considered this comment in the \n     context of the applicable provisions of the CAA. Under \n     Section 225(a), if a covered employee is a ``prevailing \n     party,'' the Hearing Officer, Board, or court, as the case \n     may be, may award attorney's fees, expert fees, and any other \n     costs as would be appropriate if awarded under section 717(d) \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Similarly, Section 405(g) \n     provides that the Hearing Officer shall order, at the time of \n     the final decision, ``such remedies as are appropriate \n     pursuant to title II'' of the CAA, which includes attorney's \n     fees, if appropriate. These statutory sections contemplate \n     that the Hearing Officer would make an attorney's fee award, \n     if appropriate, without awaiting a decision disposing of the \n     case on appeal.\n       In actions involving private sector parties, an award of \n     attorney's fees and costs is not delayed ordinarily by an \n     appeal of the decision on the merits. See generally Fed. R. \n     Civ. P., 58, Fed. R. App. Proc., 4(a)(4). The Board has \n     considered the comment and does not find any compelling \n     reason to delay the Hearing Officer's decision on fees and \n     costs simply because the decision on the merits is pending on \n     appeal. Therefore, Section 9.01 of the procedural rules has \n     not been modified.\n\n                             Class Actions\n\n       Summary of Comments: One commenter questioned whether the \n     proposed rules were intended to prohibit class actions and \n     requested that the rules specifically set forth procedures \n     governing class actions.\n       Response: The procedural rules that have been adopted do \n     not purport to address whether and in what circumstances, if \n     any, employees may pursue class claims. The issue is one that \n     involves substantive legal questions that are not \n     appropriately addressed in these procedural rules.\n\n                          Additional Comments\n\n       Commenters suggested various technical and ministerial \n     changes in the proposed rules which improved their clarity \n     and effectiveness and were consistent with the policy \n     underlying the particular provisions. Those changes have been \n     made and are included in the published rules, which are \n     ``red-lined'' to indicate all changes made.\n       Several other suggestions, such as what information the \n     Office will include in certain notifications and how it will \n     handle telephonic requests for counseling, will be and are \n     best handled as part of the Office's internal operational \n     process rather than codified in the procedural rules. \n     Similarly, requests that the Senate Chief Counsel for \n     Employment or the House Office of General Counsel receive \n     certain notifications during the dispute-resolution process \n     are best handled by House and Senate internal procedures \n     rather than in the Office's procedural rules, particularly \n     because the confidentiality provisions of the CAA preclude \n     the Office from disclosing the existence of a particular \n     proceeding to individuals other than the parties or their \n     designated representatives. However, to the extent that the \n     commenters sought such notification in order to file an \n     amicus curiae brief, it should be noted that the Board may, \n     in certain cases, solicit such briefs. In those cases the \n     Board will employ appropriate safeguards to ensure that the \n     identity of the participants in any proceeding is not \n     disclosed.\n       Finally, commenters suggested other additions or \n     modifications to the procedural rules such as not allowing \n     additional time for filings when documents are served by \n     mail, permitting more time for the filing of responses, the \n     imposition of more formal and detailed discovery procedures, \n     the holding of pre-hearing conference at a later date than \n     that proposed, a requirement that parties file pre-hearing \n     memoranda and limitations on a party's ability to object to \n     testimony or the calling of a witness. The Board is of the \n     view that the Office's procedures should be neither \n     cumbersome nor onerous for the parties who wish to \n     participate in the CAA's administrative dispute resolution \n     process and that the short time frames under the CAA, \n     particularly the 60-day period between complaint and hearing, \n     should be fully available for the preparation and processing \n     of claims. It is the Board's considered judgment that to \n     incorporate the foregoing or similar suggestions in the \n     procedural rules would have the undesired effect of \n     discouraging the use of the administrative process and, \n     thereby, encouraging the use of the federal civil process.\n\n            Part I--Office of Compliance Rules of Procedure\n\n                     Subpart A--General Provisions\n\n     Sec. 1.01  Scope and Policy\n     Sec. 1.02  Definitions\n     Sec. 1.03  Filing and Computation of Time\n     Sec. 1.04  Availability of Official Information\n     Sec. 1.05  Designation of Representative\n     Sec. 1.06  Maintenance of Confidentiality\n     Sec. 1.07  Breach of Confidentiality Provisions\n     Sec. 1.01  Scope and policy\n       These rules of the Office of Compliance govern the \n     procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged \n     violations of the laws made applicable under Part A of title \n     II of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. The rules \n     include procedures for counseling, mediation, and for \n     electing between filing a complaint with the Office of \n     Compliance and filing a civil action in a district court of \n     the United States. The rules also address the procedures for \n     the conduct of hearings held as a result of the filing of a \n     complaint and for appeals to the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well \n     as other matters of general applicability to the dispute \n     resolution process and to the operations of the Office of \n     Compliance. It is the policy of the Office that these rules \n     shall be applied with due regard to the rights of all parties \n     and in a manner that expedites the resolution of disputes.\n     Sec. 1.02  Definitions\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these rules, \n     for purposes of this Part;\n       (a) Act.

Documents may be filed in person or \n     by mail, including express, overnight and other expedited \n     delivery. Requests for counseling under Section 2.03, \n     requests for mediation under Section 2.04 and complaints \n     under Section 2.06 of these rules may also be filed by \n     facsimile (FAX) transmission. In addition, the Board or a \n     Hearing Officer may order other documents to be filed by FAX. \n     The original copies of documents filed by FAX must also be \n     mailed to the Office no later than the day following FAX \n     transmission. The filing of all documents is subject to the \n     limitations set forth below.\n       (1) In Person. A document shall be deemed timely filed if \n     it is hand delivered to the Office in: Adams Building, Room \n     LA 200, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, \n     before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of the \n     applicable time period.\n       (2) Mailing. (i) If mailed, including express, overnight \n     and other expedited delivery, a request for mediation or a \n     complaint is deemed filed on the date of its receipt in the \n     Office.\n       (ii) A document, other than a request for mediation or a \n     complaint, is deemed filed on the date of its postmark or \n     proof of mailing to the Office. Parties, including those \n     using franked mail, are responsible for ensuring that any \n     mailed document bears a postmark date or other proof of the \n     actual date of mailing. In the absence of a legible postmark \n     a document will be deemed timely if it is received by the \n     Office at Adams Building, Room LA 200, 110 Second Street, \n     S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, by mail within five (5) \n     days of the expiration of the applicable filing period.\n       (3) Faxing documents. Documents transmitted by FAX machine \n     will be deemed filed on the date received at the Office at \n     202-252-3115. A FAX filing will be timely only if the Office \n     receives the document no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time on \n     the last day of the applicable filing period. Any party using \n     a FAX machine to file a document bears the responsibility for \n     ensuring both that the document is timely and accurately \n     transmitted and confirming that the Office has received a \n     facsimile of the document. The party or individual filing the \n     document may rely on its FAX status report sheet to show that \n     it filed the document in a timely manner, provided that the \n     status report indicates the date of the FAX, the receiver's \n     FAX number, the number of pages included in the FAX, and that \n     transmission was completed.\n       (b) Computation of Time. All time periods in these rules \n     that are stated in terms of days are calendar days unless \n     otherwise noted. However, when the period of time prescribed \n     is five (5) days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and \n     Federal government holidays shall be excluded in the \n     computation. To compute the number of days for taking any \n     action required or permitted under these rules, the first day \n     shall be the day after the event from which the time period \n     begins to run and the last day for filing or service shall be \n     included in the computation. When the last day falls on a \n     Saturday, Sunday, or federal government holiday, the last day \n     for taking the action shall be the next regular federal \n     government workday.\n       (c) Time Allowances for Mailing of Official Notices. \n     Whenever a person or party has the right or is required to do \n     some act within a prescribed period after the service of a \n     notice or other document upon him or her and the notice or \n     document is served by regular, first-class mail, five (5) \n     days shall be added to the prescribed period. Only two (2) \n     days shall be added if a document is served by express mail \n     or other form of expedited delivery. When documents are \n     served by certified mail, return receipt requested, the \n     prescribed period shall be calculated from the date of \n     receipt as evidenced by the return receipt.\n     Sec. 1.04  Availability of official information\n       (a) Policy. It is the policy of the Board, the Office and \n     the General Counsel, except as otherwise ordered by the \n     Board, to make available for public inspection and copying \n     final decisions and orders of the Board and the Office, as \n     specified and described in paragraph (d) below.\n       (b) Availability. Any person may examine and copy items \n     described in paragraph (a) above at the Office of Compliance, \n     Adams Building, Room LA200, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, under conditions prescribed by \n     the Office, including requiring payment for copying costs, \n     and at reasonable times during normal working hours so long \n     as it does not interfere with the efficient operations of the \n     Office. As ordered by the Board, the Office may withhold or \n     place under seal identifying details or other necessary \n     matters, and, in each case, the reason for the withholding or \n     sealing shall be stated in writing.\n       (c) Copies of forms. Copies of blank forms prescribed by \n     the Office for the filing of complaints and other actions or \n     requests may be obtained from the Office.\n       (d) Final decisions. Pursuant to Section 416(f) of the Act, \n     a final decision entered by a Hearing Officer or by the Board \n     under Section 405(g) or 406(e) of the Act, which is in favor \n     of the complaining covered employee or reverses a Hearing \n     Officer's decision in favor of a complaining covered employee \n     or reverses a Hearing Officer's decision in favor of a \n     complaining covered employee shall be made public, except \n     as otherwise ordered by the Board.\n       (e) Release of records for judicial action. The records of \n     Hearing Officers and the Board may be made public if required \n     for the purpose of judicial review under Section 407 of the \n     Act.\n       (f) Access by committees of Congress. At the discretion of \n     the Executive Director, the Executive Director may provide to \n     the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of the House \n     of Representatives and the Select Committee on Ethics of the \n     Senate access to the records of the hearings and decisions of \n     the Hearing Officers and the Board, including all written and \n     oral testimony in the possession of the Office. The \n     identifying information in these records may be redacted at \n     the discretion of the Executive Director. The Executive \n     Director shall not provide such access until the Executive \n     Director has consulted with the individual filing the \n     complaint at issue, and until a final decision has been \n     entered under Section 405(g) or 406(e) of the Act.\n     Sec. 1.05  Designation of representative\n       (a) An employee, a witness, or an employing office wishing \n     to be represented by another individual must file with the \n     Office a written notice of designation of representative. The \n     representative may be, but is not required to be, an \n     attorney.\n       (b) Service where there is a representative. All service of \n     documents shall be directed to the representative, unless the \n     represented individual or employing office specifies \n     otherwise and until such time as that individual or employing \n     office notifies the Executive Director of an amendment or \n     revocation of the designation of representative. Where a \n     designation of representative is in effect, all time \n     limitations for receipt of materials by the represented \n     individual shall be computed in the same manner as for \n     unrepresented individuals with service of the documents, \n     however, directed to the representative, as provided.\n     Sec. 1.06  Maintenance of confidentiality\n       (a) Policy. In accord with Section 416 of the Act, it is \n     the policy of the Office to maintain, to the fullest extent \n     possible, the confidentiality of the proceedings and of the \n     participants in proceedings conducted under Sections 402, \n     403, 405 and 406 of the Act and these rules.\n       (b) At the time that any individual, employing office or \n     party, including a designated representative, becomes a \n     participant in counseling under Section 402, mediation under \n     Section 403, the complaint and hearing process under Section \n     405, or an appeal to the Board under Section 406 of the Act, \n     or any related proceeding, the Office will advise the \n     participant of the confidentiality requirements of Section \n     416 of the Act and these rules and that sanctions may be \n     imposed for a violation of those requirements.\n     Sec. 1.07  Breach of confidentiality provisions\n       (a) In general. Section 416(a) of the CAA provides that \n     counseling under section 402 shall be strictly confidential, \n     except that the Office and a covered employee may agree to \n     notify the employing office of the allegations. Section \n     416(b) provides that all mediation shall be strictly \n     confidential. Section 416(c) provides that all proceedings \n     and deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, \n     including any related records shall be confidential, except \n     for release of records necessary for judicial actions, access \n     by certain committees of Congress, and publication of certain \n     final decisions. See also Sections 1.06 and 2.10 of these \n     rules.\n       (b) Prohibition. Unless specifically authorized by the \n     provisions of the CAA or by order of the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer or a court, or by the procedural rules of the Office, \n     no participant in counseling, mediation or other proceedings \n     made confidential under section 416 of the CAA (confidential \n     proceedings) may disclose the contents or records of those \n     proceedings to any person or entity.\n       (c) Participant. For the purposes of this rule, participant \n     means any individual, employing office or party, including a \n     designated representative, that becomes a participant in \n     counseling under Section 402, mediation under Section 403, \n     the complaint and hearing process under Section 405, or an \n     appeal to the Board under Section 406 of the Act, or any \n     related proceeding which is expressly or by necessity deemed \n     confidential under the Act or these rules.\n       (d) Contents or records of confidential proceedings. For \n     the purpose of this rule, the contents or records of \n     counseling, mediation or other proceeding includes the \n     information disclosed by participants to the proceedings, and \n     records disclosed by either the opposing party, witnesses or \n     the Office. Notwithstanding these rules, a participant is \n     free to disclose facts and other information obtained from \n     any source outside of the confidential proceedings. For \n     example, information forming the basis for the allegation of \n     a complaining employee may be disclosed by that \n\n[[Page S19243]]\n     employee, provided that the information contained in those allegations \n     was not obtained in a confidential proceeding. However, the \n     employing office or representatives other than the \n     complaining party's representative (or, in some cases, the \n     Office) may not disclose that information. Nothing in these \n     rules prohibit a bona fide representative of a party under \n     Section 1.05 from engaging in communications with that party \n     for the purpose of participation in the proceedings, provided \n     that such disclosure is not made in the presence of \n     individuals not reasonably necessary to the \n     representative's representation of that party.\n       (e) Violation of confidentiality. Any complaint regarding a \n     violation of the confidentiality provisions must be made to \n     the Executive Director no later than 30 days after the date \n     of the alleged violation. Such complaints may be referred by \n     the Executive Director to a Hearing Officer. The Hearing \n     Officer is also authorized to initiate proceedings on his or \n     her own initiative, or at the direction of the Board, if the \n     alleged violation occurred in the context of Board \n     proceedings. Upon a finding of a violation of the \n     confidentiality provisions, the Hearing Officer, after notice \n     and hearing, may impose an appropriate sanction, which may \n     include any of the sanctions listed in section 7.02 of these \n     rules, as well as any of the following:\n       (i) An order that the matters regarding which the violation \n     occurred or any other designated facts shall be taken to be \n     established against the violating party for the purposes of \n     the action in accordance with the claim of the other party;\n       (ii) An order refusing to allow the violating party to \n     support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or \n     prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in \n     evidence;\n       (iii) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or \n     staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or \n     dismissing with or without prejudice the action or \n     proceedings or any part thereof, or rending a judgment by \n     default against the violating party;\n       (iv) In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition \n     thereto, the Hearing Officer shall require the party \n     violating the confidentiality provisions or the \n     representative advising him, or both, to pay, at such time as \n     ordered by the Hearing Officer, the reasonable expenses, \n     including attorney fees, caused by the violation, unless the \n     Hearing Officer finds that the failure was substantially \n     justified or that other circumstances make an award of \n     expenses unjust. Such an order shall be subject to review on \n     appeal of the final decision of the Hearing Officer under \n     section 406 of the Act.\n       No sanctions may be imposed under this section except for \n     good cause and the particulars of which must be stated in the \n     sanction order.\n\nSubpart B--Procedures Applicable to Consideration of Alleged Violations \n of Part A of Title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995\n\n     Sec. 2.01   Matters Covered by Subpart B\n     Sec. 2.02  Requests for Advice and Information\n     Sec. 2.03  Counseling\n     Sec. 2.04  Mediation\n     Sec. 2.05  Election of Proceedings\n     Sec. 2.06  Complaints\n     Sec. 2.07  Appointment of the Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 2.08  Filing, Service and Size Limitations of Motions, \n         Briefs, Responses and other Documents\n     Sec. 2.09  Dismissal of Complaint\n     Sec. 2.10  Confidentiality\n     Sec. 2.11  Filing of Civil Action\n     Sec. 2.01  Matters covered by subpart B\n       (a) These rules govern the processing of any allegation \n     that Sections 201 through 206 of the Act have been violated \n     and any allegation of intimidation or reprisal prohibited \n     under Section 207 of the Act. Sections 201 through 206 apply \n     to covered employees and employing offices certain rights and \n     protections of the following laws:\n       (1) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n       (2) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n       (3) Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n       (4) The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\n       (5) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.\n       (6) The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988.\n       (7) The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.\n       (8) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n       (9) Chapter 43 (relating to veterans' employment and \n     reemployment) of title 38, United States Code.\n       (b) This subpart applies to the covered employees and \n     employing offices as defined in Section 1.02(b) and (h) of \n     these rules and any activities within the coverage of Section \n     201 through 206 and 207 of the Act and referenced above in \n     Section 2.01(a) of these rules.\n     Sec. 2.02  Requests for advice and information\n       At any time, an employee or an employing office may seek \n     from the Office informal advice and information on the \n     procedures of the Office and under the Act and information on \n     the protections, rights and responsibilities under the Act \n     and these rules. The Office will maintain the confidentiality \n     of requests for such advice or information.\n     Sec. 2.03  Counseling\n       (a) Initiating a proceeding; formal request for counseling. \n     In order to initiate a proceeding under these rules, an \n     employee shall formally request counseling from the Office \n     regarding an alleged violation of the Act, as referred to in \n     Section 2.01(a), above. All formal requests for counseling \n     shall be confidential, unless the employee agrees to waive \n     his or her right to confidentiality under Section \n     2.03(e)(2), below.\n       (b) Who may request counseling. A covered employee who \n     believes that he or she has been or is the subject of a \n     violation of the Act as referred to in Section 2.01(a) may \n     formally request counseling.\n       (c) When, how and where to request counseling. A formal \n     request for counseling:\n       (1) Shall be made not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the alleged violation of the Act;\n       (2) May be made to the Office in person, by telephone, or \n     by written request;\n       (3) Shall be directed to: Office of Compliance, Adams \n     Building, Room LA 200, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C. 20540-1999; telephone: (202) 252-3100; FAX (202) 252-\n     3115; TDD (202) 426-1912.\n       (d) Purpose of counseling period. The purpose of the \n     counseling period shall be: to discuss the employee's \n     concerns and elicit information regarding the matter(s) which \n     the employee believes constitute a violation(s) of the Act; \n     to advise the employee of his or her rights and \n     responsibilities under the Act and the procedures of the \n     Office under these rules; to evaluate the matter; and to \n     assist the employee in achieving an early resolution of the \n     matter, if possible.\n       (e) Confidentiality and waiver. (1) Absent a waiver under \n     paragraph 2, below, all counseling shall be strictly \n     confidential. Nothing in these rules shall prevent a \n     counselor from consulting with personnel within the Office \n     concerning a matter in counseling, except that, when the \n     person being counseled is an employee of the Office, the \n     counselor shall not consult with any individual within the \n     Office who might be a party or witness without the consent of \n     the person requesting counseling. Nothing contained in these \n     rules shall prevent the Executive Director from reporting \n     statistical information to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives, so long as that statistical information does \n     not reveal the identity of the employees involved or of \n     employing offices that are the subject of a request for \n     counseling.\n       (2) The employee and the Office may agree to waive \n     confidentiality of the counseling process for the limited \n     purpose of contacting the employing office to obtain \n     information to be used in counseling the employee or to \n     attempt a resolution of any disputed matter(s). Such a \n     limited waiver must be written on the form supplied by the \n     Office and signed by both the counselor and the employee.\n       (f) Role of counselor in informing employee of his or her \n     rights and responsibilities. The counselor will provide the \n     employee with appropriate information concerning rights and \n     responsibilities under the Act and these rules.\n       (g) Role of counselor in defining concerns. The counselor \n     may:\n       (1) obtain the name, home and office mailing addresses, and \n     home and office telephone numbers of the person being \n     counseled;\n       (2) obtain the name and title of the person(s) whom the \n     employee claims has engaged in a violation of the Act and the \n     employing office in which this person(s) works;\n       (3) obtain a detailed description of the action(s) at \n     issue, including all relevant dates, and the covered \n     employees reason(s) for believing that a violation may have \n     occurred;\n       (4) inquire as to the relief sought by the covered \n     employee;\n       (5) obtain the name, address and telephone number of the \n     employees representative, if any, and whether the \n     representative is an attorney.\n       (h) Role of counselor in attempting informal resolution. In \n     order to attempt to resolve the matter brought to the \n     attention of the counselor, the counselor must obtain a \n     waiver of confidentiality pursuant to Section 2.03(e)(2) of \n     this chapter. If the employee executes such a waiver, the \n     counselor may:\n       (1) conduct a limited inquiry for the purpose of obtaining \n     any information necessary to attempt an informal resolution \n     or formal settlement;\n       (2) reduce to writing any formal settlement achieved and \n     secure the signatures of the employee, his or her \n     representative, if any, and a member of the employing office \n     who is authorized to enter into a settlement on the employing \n     office's behalf; and, pursuant to Section 414 of the Act and \n     Section 9.03 of these rules, seek the approval of the \n     Executive Director. Nothing in this subsection, however, \n     precludes the employee, the employing office or their \n     representatives from reducing to writing any formal \n     settlement.\n       (i) Counselor not a representative. The counselor shall \n     inform the person being counseled that the counselor does not \n     represent either the employing office or the employee. The \n     counselor provides information and may act as a third-party \n     intermediary with the goals of increasing the individual's \n     understanding of his or her rights and responsibilities under \n     the Act and of promoting the early resolution of the matter.\n       (j) Duration of counseling period. The period for \n     counseling shall be 30 days, beginning on the date that the \n     request for counseling is received by the Office unless the \n     employee and the Office agree to reduce the period.\n       (k) Duty to proceed. An employee who initiates a proceeding \n     under this part shall be responsible at all times for \n     proceeding, regardless of whether he or she has designated a \n     representative. An employee, however, may withdraw from \n     counseling once without \n\n[[Page S19244]]\n     prejudice to the employee's right to reinstate counseling regarding the \n     same matter, provided that the request to reinstate \n     counseling is received in the Office not later than 180 \n     days after the date of the alleged violation of the Act \n     and that counseling on a single matter will not last \n     longer than a total of 30 days.\n       (l) Conclusion of the counseling period and notice. The \n     Executive Director shall notify the employee in writing of \n     the end of the counseling period, by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested. The Executive Director, as part of the \n     notification of the end of the counseling period, shall \n     inform the employee of the right and obligation, should the \n     employee choose to pursue his or her claim, to file with the \n     Office a request for mediation within 15 days after receipt \n     by the employee of the notice of the end of the counseling \n     period.\n       (m) Employees of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and Capitol Police.\n       (1) Where an employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or of the Capitol Police requests counseling under \n     the Act and these rules, the Executive Director may recommend \n     that the employee use the grievance procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police. The term \n     grievance procedures refers to internal procedures of the \n     Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police that can \n     provide a resolution of the matter(s) about which counseling \n     was requested. Pursuant to Section 401 of the Act and by \n     agreement with the Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol \n     Police Board, when the Executive Director makes such a \n     recommendation, the following procedures shall apply:\n       (i) The Executive Director shall recommend to the employee \n     that the employee use the grievance procedures of the \n     Architect or of the Capitol Police Board, as appropriate, for \n     a period generally up to 90 days, unless the Executive \n     Director determines a longer period is appropriate for \n     resolution of the employee's complaint through the grievance \n     procedures of the Architect or the Capitol Police Board;\n       (ii) After having contacted the Office and having utilized \n     the grievance procedures of the Architect or to the Capitol \n     Police Board, the employee may notify the Office that he or \n     she wishes to return to the procedures under these rules:\n       (A) within 10 days after the expiration of the period \n     recommended by the Executive Director, if the matter has not \n     been resolved; or\n       (B) within 20 days after service of a final decision \n     resulting from the grievance procedures of the Architect or \n     of the Capitol Police Board.\n       (iii) The period during which the matter is pending in the \n     internal grievance procedure shall not count against the time \n     available for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the \n     grievance is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, or if \n     no request to return to the procedures under these rules is \n     received within the applicable time period, the Office will \n     consider the case to be closed in its official files.\n       (2) Notice to employees who have not initiated counseling \n     with the Office. When an employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol or the Capitol Police raises in the internal \n     procedures of the Architect or of the Capitol Police Board an \n     allegation which may also be raised under the procedures set \n     forth in this subpart, the Architect or the Capitol Police \n     Board should advise the employee in writing that a request \n     for counseling about the allegation must be initiated with \n     the Office within 180 days after the alleged violation of law \n     occurred if the employee intends to use the procedures of the \n     Office.\n       (3) Notice in final decisions when employees have not \n     initiated counseling with the Office. When an employee raises \n     in the internal procedures of the Architect or of the Capitol \n     Police Board an allegation which may also be raised under the \n     procedures set forth in this subpart, any final decision \n     pursuant to the procedures of the Architect of the Capitol or \n     of the Capitol Police Board should include notice to the \n     employee of his or her right to initiate the procedures under \n     these rules within 180 days after the alleged violation \n     occurred.\n       (4) Notice in final decisions when there has been a \n     recommendation by the Executive Director. When the Executive \n     Director has made a recommendation under paragraph 1 above, \n     the Architect or the Capitol Police Board should include \n     notice to the employee of his or her right to resume the \n     procedures under these rules within 20 days after service on \n     the employee of the final decision and shall transmit a copy \n     of the final decision, settlement agreement, or other final \n     disposition of the case to the Executive Director.\n     Sec. 2.04 Mediation.\n       (a) Explanation. Mediation is a process in which employees, \n     employing offices and their representatives, if any, meet \n     separately and/or jointly with a neutral trained to assist \n     them in resolving disputes. As parties to the mediation, \n     employees, employing offices and their representatives \n     discuss alternatives to continuing their dispute, including \n     any and all possibilities of reaching a voluntary, mutually \n     satisfactory resolution. The neutral has no power to impose a \n     specific resolution, and the mediation process, whether or \n     not a resolution is reached, is strictly confidential, \n     pursuant to Section 416 of the Act.\n       (b) Initiation. Not more than 15 days after receipt by the \n     employee of the notice of the conclusion of the counseling \n     period under Section 2.03(l), the employee may file with the \n     Office a written request for mediation. The request for \n     mediation shall contain the employee's name, address, and \n     telephone number, and the name of the employing office that \n     is the subject of the request. Failure to request mediation \n     within the prescribed period will preclude the employee's \n     further pursuit of his or her claim.\n       (c) Notice of commencement of the mediation period. The \n     Office shall notify the employing office or its designated \n     representative of the commencement of the mediation period.\n       (d) Selection of Neutrals; Disqualification. Upon receipt \n     of the request for mediation, the Executive Director shall \n     assign one or more neutrals to commence the mediation \n     process. In the event that a neutral considers him or herself \n     unable to perform in a neutral role in a given situation, he \n     or she shall withdraw from the matter and immediately shall \n     notify the Office of the withdrawal. Any party may ask the \n     Office to disqualify a neutral by filing a written request, \n     including the reasons for such request, with the Executive \n     Director. This request shall be filed as soon as the party \n     has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification. \n     The Executive Director's decision on this request shall be \n     final and unreviewable.\n       (e) Duration and Extension. (1) The mediation period shall \n     be 30 days beginning on the date the request for mediation is \n     received, unless the Office grants an extension.\n       (2) The Office may extend the mediation period upon the \n     joint request of the parties. The request shall be written \n     and filed with the Office no later than the last day of the \n     mediation period. The request shall set forth the joint \n     nature of the request and the reasons therefor, and specify \n     when the parties expect to conclude their discussions. \n     Requests for additional extensions may be made in the same \n     manner. Approval of any extensions shall be within the sole \n     discretion of the Office.\n       (f) Procedures. (1) The Neutral's Role. After assignment of \n     the case, the neutral will promptly contact the parties. The \n     neutral has the responsibility to conduct the mediation, \n     including deciding how many meetings are necessary and who \n     may participate in each meeting. The neutral may accept and \n     may ask the parties to provide written submissions.\n       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the \n     mediation, the neutral will ask the parties to sign an \n     agreement (``the Agreement to Mediate'') to adhere to the \n     confidentiality of the process . The Agreement to Mediate \n     will also provide that the parties to the mediation will not \n     seek to have the counselor or the neutral participate, \n     testify or otherwise present evidence in any subsequent civil \n     action under Section 408 of the Act or any other proceeding.\n       (g) Who may participate. The covered employee, the \n     employing office, their respective representatives, and the \n     Office may meet, jointly or separately, with the neutral. A \n     representative of the employee and a representative of the \n     employing office who has actual authority to agree to a \n     settlement agreement on behalf of the employee or the \n     employing office, as the case may be, must be present at the \n     mediation or must be immediately accessible by telephone \n     during the mediation.\n       (h) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at \n     the end of the mediation period, the parties have not \n     resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for \n     mediation, the Office shall provide the employee, and the \n     employing office, and their representatives, with written \n     notice that the mediation period has concluded. The written \n     notice to the employee will be sent by certified mail, return \n     receipt requested and it will also notify the employee of his \n     or her right to elect to file a complaint with the Office in \n     accordance with Section 405 of the Act and Section 2.06 of \n     these rules or to file a civil action pursuant to Section 408 \n     of the Act and Section 2.11 of these rules.\n       (i) Independence of the Mediation Process and the Neutral. \n     The Office will maintain the independence of the mediation \n     process and the neutral. No individual, who is appointed by \n     the Executive Director to mediate, may conduct or aid in a \n     hearing conducted under Section 405 of the Act with respect \n     to the same matter or shall be subject to subpoena or any \n     other compulsory process with respect to the same matter.\n       (j) Confidentiality. Except as necessary to consult with \n     the parties, their counsel or other designated \n     representatives, the parties to the mediation, the neutral, \n     and the Office shall not disclose, in whole or in part, any \n     information or records obtained through, or prepared \n     specifically for, the mediation process. This rule shall not \n     preclude a neutral from consulting with the Office, except \n     that when the covered employee is an employee of the Office a \n     neutral shall not consult with any individual within the \n     Office who might be a party or witness. This rule shall also \n     not preclude the Office from reporting statistical \n     information to the Senate and House of Representatives that \n     does not reveal the identity of the employees or employing \n     offices involved in the mediation. All parties to the action \n     and their representatives will be advised of the \n     confidentiality requirements of this process and of the \n     sanctions that might be imposed for violating these \n     requirements.\n       (k) Employees of the office of the Architect of the Capitol \n     and the Capitol Police.

Upon receipt of a complaint or an \n     amended complaint, the Office shall serve the employing \n     office named in the complaint, or its designated \n     representative, with a copy of the complaint or amended \n     complaint and a copy of these rules.

Failure to \n     raise a claim or defense in the answer shall not bar its \n     submission later unless to do so would unduly prejudice the \n     rights of the other party or unduly delay or otherwise \n     interfere with or impede the proceedings.\n     Sec. 2.07  Appointment of the hearing officer\n       Upon the filing of a complaint, the Executive Director will \n     appoint an independent Hearing Officer, who shall have the \n     authority specified in Sections 2.09 and 7.01(b) below.

Each of these documents must be \n     accompanied by a certificate of service specifying how, when \n     and on whom service was made. It shall be the duty of each \n     party to notify the Office and all other parties in writing \n     of any changes in the names or addresses on the service list.\n       (c) Time limitations for response to motions or briefs and \n     reply. Unless otherwise specified by the Hearing Officer or \n     these rules, a party shall file a response to a motion or \n     brief within 15 days of the service of the motion or brief \n     upon the party. Any reply to such response shall be filed and \n     served within 5 days of the service of the response.

A dismissal by the Hearing Officer made under \n     Section 2.09(a)-(c) or 7.16 of these rules may be subject to \n     appeal before the Board if the aggrieved party files a timely \n     petition for review under Section 8.01.\n       (e) Withdrawal of Complaint by Complainant. At any time a \n     complainant may withdraw his or her own complaint by filing a \n     notice with the Office for transmittal to the Hearing Officer \n     and by serving a copy on the employing office or \n     representative. Any such withdrawal must be approved by the \n     Executive Director.\n     Sec. 2.10  Confidentiality\n       Pursuant to Section 416(c) of the Act, all proceedings and \n     deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, including \n     any related records, shall be confidential. A violation of \n     the confidentiality requirements of the Act and these rules \n     could result in the imposition of sanctions. Nothing in these \n     rules shall prevent the Executive Director from reporting \n     statistical information to the Senate and House of \n     Representatives, so long as that statistical information does \n     not reveal the identify of the employees involved or of \n     employing offices that are the subject of a matter.\n     Sec. 2.11  Filing of civil action\n       (a) Filing.

Discovery is the process by which a party \n     may obtain from another person, including a party, \n     information, not privileged, reasonably calculated to lead to \n     the discovery of admissible evidence, for the purpose of \n     assisting that party in developing, preparing and presenting \n     its case at the hearing. This provision shall not be \n     construed to permit any discovery, oral or written, to be \n     taken from employees of the Office or the counselor(s), or \n     the neutral(s) involved in counseling and mediation.\n       (b) Office policy regarding discovery. It is the policy of \n     the Office to encourage the early and voluntary exchange of \n     relevant and material nonprivileged information between the \n     parties, including the names and addresses of witnesses and \n     copies of relevant and material documents, and to encourage \n     Hearing Officers to develop procedures which allow for the \n     greatest exchange of relevant and material information and \n     which minimize the need for parties to formally request such \n     information.\n       (c) Discovery availability. Pursuant to Section 405(e) of \n     the Act, the Hearing Officer \n\n[[Page S19246]]\n     in his or her discretion may permit reasonable prehearing discovery. In \n     exercising that discretion, the Hearing Officer may be guided \n     by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n       (1) The Hearing Officer may authorize discovery by one or \n     more of the following methods: depositions upon oral \n     examination or written questions; written interrogatories; \n     production of documents or things or permission to enter upon \n     land or other property for inspection or other purposes; \n     physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.\n       (2) The Hearing Officer may make any order setting forth \n     the forms and extent of discovery, including orders limiting \n     the number of depositions, interrogatories, and requests for \n     production of documents, and may also limit the length of \n     depositions.\n       (3) The Hearing Officer may issue any other order to \n     prevent discovery or disclosure of confidential or privileged \n     materials or information, as well as hearing or trial \n     preparation materials and any other information deemed not \n     discoverable, or to protect a party or person from annoyance, \n     embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\n       (d) Claims of privilege. Whenever a party withholds \n     information otherwise discoverable under these rules by \n     claiming that it is privileged or confidential or subject to \n     protection as hearing or trial preparation materials, the \n     party shall make the claim expressly and shall describe the \n     nature of the documents, communications or things not \n     produced or disclosed in a manner that, without revealing the \n     information itself privileged or protected, will enable other \n     parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or \n     protection.\n     Sec. 6.02  Request for subpoena\n       (a) Authority to issue subpoenas. At the request of a \n     party, a Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, documents, or other \n     records. The attendance of witnesses and the production of \n     records may be required from any place within the United \n     States. However, no subpoena may be issued for the attendance \n     or testimony of an employee of the Office of Compliance.\n       (b) Request. A request for the issuance of a subpoena \n     requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the \n     production of documents or other evidence under paragraph (a) \n     above shall be submitted to the Hearing Officer at least 15 \n     days in advance of the date scheduled for the commencement of \n     the hearing. If the subpoena is sought as part of the \n     discovery process, the request shall be submitted to the \n     Hearing Officer at least 10 days in advance of the date set \n     for the attendance of the witness at a deposition or the \n     production of documents. The Hearing Officer may waive the \n     time limits stated above for good cause.\n       (c) Forms and showing. Requests for subpoenas shall be \n     submitted in writing to the Hearing Officer and shall specify \n     with particularity the witness, correspondence, books, \n     papers, documents, or other records desired and shall be \n     supported by a showing of general relevance and reasonable \n     scope.\n       (d) Rulings. The Hearing Officer shall promptly rule on the \n     request.\n     Sec. 6.03  Service\n       Subpoenas shall be served in the manner provided under rule \n     45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service of a \n     subpoena may be made by any person who is over 18 years of \n     age and not a party to the proceeding.\n     Sec. 6.04  Proof of service\n       When service of a subpoena is effected, the person serving \n     the subpoena shall certify the date and the manner of \n     service. The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued \n     shall file the server's certification with the Hearing \n     Officer.\n     Sec. 6.05  Motion to quash\n       Any person against whom a subpoena is directed may file a \n     motion to quash or limit the subpoena setting forth the \n     reasons why the subpoena should not be complied with or why \n     it should be limited in scope. This motion shall be filed \n     with the Hearing Officer before the time specified in the \n     subpoena for compliance and not later than 10 days after \n     service of the subpoena\n     Sec. 6.06  Enforcement\n       (a) Objections and Requests for enforcement. If a person \n     has been served with a subpoena pursuant to Section 6.03 but \n     fails or refuses to comply with its terms or otherwise \n     objects to it, the party or person objecting or the party \n     seeking compliance may seek a ruling from the Hearing \n     Officer. The request for a ruling shall be submitted in \n     writing to the Hearing Officer. However, it may be made \n     orally on the record at the hearing at the Hearing Officer's \n     discretion. The party seeking compliance shall present the \n     proof of service and, except where the witness was required \n     to appear before the Hearing Officer, shall submit evidence, \n     by affidavit or declaration, of the failure or refusal to \n     obey the subpoena\n       (b) Ruling by hearing officer. (1) The Hearing Officer \n     shall promptly rule on the request for enforcement and/or the \n     objection(s)\n       (2) On request of the objecting witness or any party, the \n     Hearing Officer shall, or on the Hearing Officer's own \n     initiative the Hearing Officer may, refer the ruling to the \n     Board for review\n       (c) Review by the board. The Board may overrule, modify, \n     remand or affirm the ruling of the Hearing Officer and in its \n     discretion, may direct the General Counsel to apply in the \n     name of the Office for an order from a United States district \n     court to enforce the subpoena\n       (d) Application to an appropriate court; civil contempt. If \n     a person fails to comply with a subpoena, the Board may \n     direct the General Counsel to apply, in the name of the \n     Office, to an appropriate United States district court for an \n     order requiring that person to appear before the Hearing \n     Officer to give testimony or produce records. Any failure to \n     obey a lawful order of the district court may be held by such \n     court to be a civil contempt thereof\n\n                          Subpart G--Hearings\n\n     Sec. 7.01  The Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 7.02  Sanctions\n     Sec. 7.03  Disqualification of the Hearing Officer\n     Sec. 7.04  Motions and Prehearing Conference\n     Sec. 7.05  Scheduling the Hearing\n     Sec. 7.06  Consolidation and Joinder of Cases\n     Sec. 7.07  Conduct of Hearing; disqualification of \n         representatives\n     Sec. 7.08  Transcript\n     Sec. 7.09  Admissibility of Evidence\n     Sec. 7.10  Stipulations\n     Sec. 7.11  Official Notice\n     Sec. 7.12  Confidentiality\n     Sec. 7.13  Immediate Board Review of a Ruling by a Hearing \n         Officer\n     Sec. 7.14  Posthearing Briefs\n     Sec. 7.15  Closing the record\n     Sec. 7.16  Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry in Records of the \n         Office\n     Sec. 7.01 The hearing officer\n       (a) Exercise of authority.

When a party fails to \n     comply with an order (including an order for the taking of a \n     deposition, for the production of evidence within the party's \n     control, or for production of witnesses), the Hearing Officer \n     may:\n       (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party on \n     the issue related to the information sought;\n       (2) Stay further proceedings until the order is obeyed;\n       (3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order \n     from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying \n     upon, evidence relating to the information sought;\n       (4) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary \n     evidence concerning the information sought;\n       (5) Strike any part of the complaint, briefs, answer, or \n     other submissions of the party failing to comply with the \n     order;\n       (6) Direct judgment against the non-complying party in \n     whole or in part; or\n       (7) Order that the non-complying party, or the \n     representative advising that party, pay all or part of the \n     attorney's fees and reasonable expenses of the other party or \n     parties or of the Office, caused by such non-compliance, \n     unless the Hearing Officer or the Board finds that the \n     failure was substantially justified or that other \n     circumstances make an award of attorney's fees and/or \n     expenses unjust.\n       (b) Failure to prosecute or defend. If a party fails to \n     prosecute or defend a position, the Hearing Officer may \n     dismiss the action with prejudice or rule for the \n     complainant.\n       (c) Failure to make timely filing.

That memorandum may include:\n       (1) The major factual contentions and legal issues that the \n     party intends to raise at the hearing in short, successive, \n     and numbered paragraphs, along with any proposed stipulations \n     of fact or law.\n       (2) An estimate of the time necessary for presentation of \n     the party's case;\n       (3) The specific relief, including the amount of monetary \n     relief, that is being or will be requested;\n       (4) The names of potential witnesses for the party's case, \n     except for potential rebuttal witnesses, and the purpose for \n     which they will be called and a list of documents that the \n     party is seeking from the opposing party, and, if discovery \n     was permitted, the status of any pending request for \n     discovery. (It is not necessary to list each document \n     requested. Instead, the party may refer to the request for \n     discovery.)\n       (5) A brief description of any other unresolved issues.\n       (d) At the prehearing conference, the Hearing Officer may \n     discuss the subjects specified in paragraph (c) above and the \n     manner in which the hearing will be conducted and proceed. In \n     addition the Hearing Officer may explore settlement \n     possibilities and consider how the factual and legal issues \n     might be simplified and any other issues that might expedite \n     the resolution of the dispute. The Hearing Officer shall \n     issue an order, which recites the action taken at the \n     conference and the agreements made by the parties as to any \n     of the matters considered and which limits the issues to \n     those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the \n     parties. Such order, when entered, shall control the course \n     of the proceeding, subject to later modification by the \n     Hearing Officer by his or her own motion or upon proper \n     request of a party for good cause shown.\n     Sec. 7.05  Scheduling the hearing\n       (a) Date, time, and place of hearing. The Office shall \n     issue the notice of hearing, which shall fix the date, time, \n     and place of hearing. In no event, absent a postponement \n     granted by the Office, will a hearing commence later than 60 \n     days after the filing of the complaint.\n       (b) Motions for postponement or a continuance. Motions for \n     postponement or for a continuance by either party shall be \n     made in writing to the Office, shall set forth the reasons \n     for the request, and shall state whether the opposing party \n     consents to such postponement. Such a motion may be granted \n     upon a showing of good cause. In no event will a hearing \n     commence later than 90 days after the filing of the \n     complaint.\n     Sec. 7.06  Consolidation and joinder of cases\n       (a) Explanation. (1) Consolidation is when two or more \n     parties have cases that might be treated as one because they \n     contain identical or similar issues or in such other \n     appropriate circumstances.\n       (2) Joinder is when one person has two or more claims \n     pending and they are united for consideration. For example, \n     where a single individual who has one appeal pending \n     challenging a 30-day suspension and another appeal pending \n     challenging a subsequent dismissal, joinder might be \n     warranted.\n       (b) The Board, the Office, or a Hearing Officer may \n     consolidate or join cases on their own initiative or on the \n     motion of a party if to do so would expedite processing of \n     the cases and not adversely affect the interests of the \n     parties, taking into account the confidentiality requirements \n     of Section 416 of the Act.\n     Sec. 7.07  Conduct of hearing; disqualification of \n         representatives\n       (a) Pursuant to Section 405(d)(1) of the Act, the Hearing \n     Officer shall conduct the hearing in closed session on the \n     record. Only the Hearing Officer, the parties and their \n     representatives, and witnesses during the time they are \n     testifying, shall be permitted to attend, except that the \n     Office may not be precluded from observing the hearings. The \n     Hearing Officer, or a person designated by the Hearing \n     Officer or the Executive Director, shall control the \n     recording of the proceedings.\n       (b) The hearing shall be conducted as an administrative \n     proceeding. Witnesses shall testify under oath or \n     affirmation. Except as specified in the Act and in these \n     rules, the Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing, to the \n     greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the \n     principles and procedures in Sections 554 through 557 of \n     title 5 of the United States Code.\n       (c) No later than the opening of the hearing, or as \n     otherwise ordered by the Hearing Officer, each party shall \n     submit to the Hearing Officer and to the opposing party typed \n     lists of the hearing exhibits and the witnesses, excluding \n     rebuttal witnesses, expected to be called to testify.\n       (d) At the commencement of the hearing, or as otherwise \n     ordered by the Hearing Officer, the Hearing Officer may \n     consider any stipulations of facts and law pursuant to \n     Section 7.10, take official notice of certain facts pursuant \n     to Section 7.11, rule on objections made by the parties and \n     hear the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Each \n     party will be expected to present his or her cases in a \n     concise manner, limiting the testimony of witnesses and \n     submission of documents to relevant matters.\n       (e) If the Hearing Officer concludes that a representative \n     of an employee, a witness, or an employing office has a \n     conflict of interest, he or she may, after giving the \n     representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify the \n     representative. In that event, within the time limits for \n     hearing and decision established by the Act, the affected \n     party will have a reasonable time to retain other \n     representation.\n     Sec. 7.08  Transcript\n       (a) Preparation. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record of the hearing shall be kept and shall be the sole \n     official record of the proceeding. The Office shall be \n     responsible for the cost of transcription of the hearing. \n     Upon request, a copy of a transcript of the hearing shall \n     be provided to each party, provided, however, that such \n     party has first agreed to maintain and respect the \n     confidentiality of such transcript in accordance with the \n     applicable rules prescribed by the Office or the Hearing \n     Officer in order to effectuate Section 416(c) of the Act. \n     Additional copies of the transcript shall be made \n     available to a party at the party's expense. Exceptions to \n     the payment requirement may be granted for good cause \n     shown. A motion for an exception shall be made in writing \n     and accompanied by an affidavit or declaration setting \n     forth the reasons for the request. Requests for copies of \n     transcripts shall be directed to the Office. The Office \n     may, by agreement with the person making the request, make \n     arrangements with the official hearing reporter for \n     required services to be charged to the requester.\n       (b) Corrections. Corrections to the official transcript \n     will be permitted. Motions for correction must be submitted \n     within 10 days of service of the transcript upon the party. \n     Corrections of the official transcript will be permitted only \n     upon approval of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer may \n     make corrections at any time with notice to the parties.\n     Sec. 7.09  Admissibility of evidence\n       The Hearing Officer shall apply the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence to the greatest extent practicable. These rules \n     provide, among other things, that the Hearing Officer may \n     exclude evidence if, among other things, it constitutes \n     inadmissible hearsay or its probative value is substantially \n     outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, by confusion of \n     the issues, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of \n     time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n     Sec. 7.10  Stipulations\n       The parties may stipulate as to any matter of fact. Such a \n     stipulation will satisfy a party's burden of proving the fact \n     alleged.\n     Sec. 7.11  Official notice\n       The Hearing Officer on his or her own motion or on motion \n     of a party, may take official notice of a fact that is not \n     subject to reasonable dispute because it is either: (a) A \n     matter of common knowledge; or (b) capable of accurate and \n     ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy \n     cannot reasonably be questioned. Official notice taken of any \n     fact satisfies a party's burden of proving the fact noticed.\n       Where a decision, or part thereof, rests on the official \n     notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in \n     the record, the fact of official notice shall be so stated in \n     the decision, and any party, upon timely request, shall be \n     afforded an opportunity to show the contrary. \n     \n[[Page S19248]]\n\n     Sec. 7.12  Confidentiality\n       Pursuant to Section 416 of the Act, all proceedings and \n     deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, including \n     the transcripts of hearings and any related records, shall be \n     confidential, except as specified in Section 416(d), (e), and \n     (f) of the Act. All parties to the proceeding and their \n     representatives, and witnesses who appear at the hearing, \n     will be advised of the importance of confidentiality in this \n     process and of their obligations, subject to sanctions, to \n     maintain it.\n     Sec. 7.13  Immediate board review of a ruling by a hearing \n         officer\n       (a) Review strongly disfavored. Board review of a ruling by \n     a hearing officer while a proceeding is ongoing (an \n     ``interlocutory appeal'') is strongly disfavored. In general, \n     a request for interlocutory review may go before the Board \n     for consideration only if the Hearing Officer, on his or her \n     own motion or by motion of the parties, determines that the \n     issue presented is of such importance to the proceeding that \n     it requires the Board's immediate attention.\n       (b) Standards for review. In determining whether to forward \n     a request for interlocutory review to the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer shall consider the following:\n       (1) Whether the ruling involves a significant question of \n     law or policy about which there is substantial ground for \n     difference of opinion;\n       (2) Whether an immediate review of the Hearing Officers \n     ruling by the Board will materially advance the completion of \n     the proceeding; and\n       (3) Whether denial of immediate review will cause undue \n     harm to a party or the public.\n       (c) Time for Filing. A motion by a party for interlocutory \n     review of a ruling of the Hearing Officer shall be filed with \n     the Hearing Officer within 5 days after service of the ruling \n     upon the parties. The motion shall include arguments in \n     support of both interlocutory review and the determination \n     requested to be made by the Board upon review. Responses, if \n     any, shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within 3 days \n     after service of the motion.\n       (d) Hearing Officer Action. If the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (b) above are met, the Hearing Officer shall \n     forward a request for interlocutory review to the Board for \n     its immediate consideration. Any such submission shall \n     explain the basis on which the Hearing Officer concluded that \n     the standards in paragraph (b) have been met.\n       (e) Grant of Interlocutory Review Within Board's Sole \n     Discretion. The Board, in its sole discretion, may grant \n     interlocutory review.\n       (f) Stay Pending Review. Unless otherwise directed by the \n     Board, the stay of any proceedings during the pendency of \n     either a request for interlocutory review or the review \n     itself shall be within the discretion of the Hearing Officer, \n     provided that no stay shall serve to toll the time limits set \n     forth in Section 405(d) of the Act.\n       (g) Denial of Motion Not Appealable; Mandamus. The grant or \n     denial of a motion for a request for interlocutory review \n     shall not be appealable. The Hearing Officer shall promptly \n     bring a denial of such a motion, and the reasons therefor, to \n     the attention of the Board. If, upon consideration of the \n     motion and the reason for denial, the Board believes that \n     interlocutory review is warranted, it may grant the review \n     sua sponte. In addition, the Board may, in its discretion, in \n     extraordinary circumstances, entertain directly from a party \n     a writ of mandamus to review a ruling of a Hearing Officer.\n       (h) Procedures Before Board. Upon its acceptance of a \n     ruling of the Hearing Officer for interlocutory review, the \n     Board shall issue an order setting forth the procedures that \n     will be followed in the conduct of that review.\n       (i) Review of a Final Decision. Denial of interlocutory \n     review will not affect a party's right to challenge rulings, \n     which are otherwise appealable, as part of an appeal to the \n     Board under Section 8.01 from the Hearing Officer's decision \n     issued under Section 7.16 of these rules.\n     Sec. 7.14  Posthearing briefs\n       (a) May Be Filed. The Hearing Officer may permit the \n     parties to file posthearing briefs on the factual and the \n     legal issues presented in the case.\n       (b) Length. No principal brief shall exceed 50 pages, or \n     12,500 words, and no reply brief 25 pages, or 6,250 words, \n     exclusive of tables and pages limited only to quotations of \n     statutes, rules, and the like. Motions to file extended \n     briefs shall be granted only for good cause shown; the \n     Hearing Officer may in his or her discretion also reduce the \n     page limits. Briefs in excess of 10 pages shall include an \n     index and a table of authorities.\n       (c) Format. Every brief must be easily readable. Briefs \n     must have double spacing between each line of text, except \n     for quoted texts and footnotes, which may be single-spaced.\n     Sec. 7.15  Closing the record of the hearing\n       (a) Except as provided in Section 7.14, the record shall be \n     closed at the conclusion of the hearing. However, when the \n     Hearing Officer allows the parties to submit additional \n     evidence previously identified for introduction, the Hearing \n     Officer may allow an additional period before the conclusion \n     of the hearing as is necessary for that purpose.\n       (b) Once the record is closed, no additional evidence or \n     argument shall be accepted into the hearing record except \n     upon a showing that new and material evidence has become \n     available that was not available despite due diligence prior \n     to the closing of the record. However, the Hearing Officer \n     shall make part of the record any motions for attorney fees, \n     supporting documentation, and determinations thereon, and any \n     approved correction to the transcript.\n     Sec. 7.16  Hearing Officer decisions; entry in records of the \n         Office\n       (a) Pursuant to Section 405(g) of the Act, no later than 90 \n     days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer \n     shall issue a written decision.\n       (b) Upon issuance, the decision and order of the Hearing \n     Officer shall be entered into the records of the Office.\n       (c) The Office shall promptly provide a copy of the \n     decision and order of the Hearing Officer to the parties.\n       (d) If there is no appeal of a decision and order of a \n     Hearing Officer, that decision becomes a final decision of \n     the Office, which is subject to enforcement under Section \n     8.021 of these rules.\n\n                Subpart H. Proceedings Before the Board\n\n     Sec. 8.01  Appeal to the Board\n     Sec. 8.02  Compliance with Final Decisions, Requests for \n         Enforcement\n     Sec. 8.03  Judicial Review\n     Sec. 8.01  Appeal to the Board\n       (a) No later than 30 days after the entry of the decision \n     and order of the Hearing Officer in the records of the \n     Office, an aggrieved party may seek review of that decision \n     and order by the Board by filing with the Office a petition \n     for review by the Board. The appeal must be served on the \n     opposing party or its representative.\n       (b) Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, within 21 days \n     following the filing of a petition for review to the Board, \n     the appellant shall file and serve a supporting brief in \n     accordance with Section 2.08 of these rules. That brief shall \n     identify with particularity those findings or conclusions in \n     the decision and order that are challenged and shall refer \n     specifically to the portions of the record and the \n     provisions of statutes or rules that are alleged to \n     support each assertion made on appeal.\n       Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, within 21 days \n     following the service of the appellant's brief, the opposing \n     party may file and serve a responsive brief. Unless otherwise \n     ordered by the Board, within 10 days following the service of \n     the appellee's responsive brief, the appellant may file and \n     serve a reply brief.\n       (c) Upon the request of any party or upon its own order, \n     the Board, in its discretion, may hold oral argument on an \n     appeal.\n       (d) Upon appeal, the Board shall issue a written decision \n     setting forth the reasons for its decision. The Board may \n     affirm, reverse, modify or remand the decision and order of \n     the Hearing Officer in whole or in part. Where there is no \n     remand the decision of the Board shall be entered in the \n     records of the Office as the final decision of the Board and \n     shall be subject to judicial review.\n       (e) The Board may remand the matter to the Hearing Officer \n     for further action or proceedings, including the reopening of \n     the record for the taking of additional evidence. The Hearing \n     Officer shall render a decision or report to the Board, as \n     ordered, at the conclusion of proceedings on the remanded \n     matters. Upon receipt of the decision or report, the Board \n     shall determine whether the views of the parties on the \n     content of the decision or report should be obtained in \n     writing and, where necessary, shall fix by order the time for \n     the submission of those views. A decision of the Board \n     following completion of the remand shall be entered in the \n     records of the Office as the final decision of the Board and \n     shall be subject to judicial review.\n       (f) Pursuant to section 406(c) of the Act, in conducting \n     its review of the decision of a Hearing Officer, the Board \n     shall set aside a decision if it determines that the decision \n     was:\n       (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not consistent with law;\n       (2) not made consistent with required procedures; or\n       (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\n       (g) In making determinations under paragraph (f), above, \n     the Board shall review the whole record, or those parts of it \n     cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule \n     of prejudicial error.\n       (h) Record. The complaint and any amendments, notice of \n     hearing, answer and any amendments, motions, rulings, orders, \n     stipulations, exhibits, documentary evidence, any portions of \n     depositions admitted into evidence, and the transcript of the \n     hearing (together with any electronic recording of the \n     hearing if the original reporting was performed \n     electronically) together with the Hearing Officer's decision \n     and the petition for review, any response thereto, any reply \n     to the response and any other pleadings shall constitute the \n     record in the case.\n     Sec. 8.02  Compliance with final decisions, requests for \n         enforcement\n       (a) Unless the Board has, in its discretion, stayed the \n     final decision of the Office during the pendency of an appeal \n     pursuant to Section 407 of the Act, A party required to take \n     any action under the terms of a final decision of the Office \n     shall carry out its terms promptly, and shall within 30 days \n     after the decision or order becomes final and goes into \n     effect by its terms, provide the Office and all parties to \n     the proceedings with a compliance \n\n[[Page S19249]]\n     report specifying the manner in which compliance with the provisions of \n     the decision or order has been accomplished. If complete \n     compliance has not been accomplished within 30 days, the \n     party required to take any such action shall submit a \n     compliance report specifying why compliance with any \n     provision of the decision order has not yet been fully \n     accomplished, the steps being taken to assure full \n     compliance, and the anticipated date by which full compliance \n     will be achieved.\n       (b) The Office may require additional reports as necessary;\n       (c) If the Office does not receive notice of compliance in \n     accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section, the Office \n     shall make inquiries to determine the status of compliance. \n     If the Office cannot determine that full compliance is \n     forthcoming, the Office shall report the failure to comply to \n     the Board and recommend whether court enforcement of the \n     decision should be sought.\n       (d) Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a \n     final decision of the Office or the Board. The petition shall \n     specifically set forth the reasons why the petitioner \n     believes enforcement is necessary.\n       (e) Upon receipt of a report of non-compliance or a \n     petition for enforcement of a final decision, or as it \n     otherwise determines, the Board may issue a notice to any \n     person or party to show cause why the Board should not seek \n     judicial enforcement of its decision or order.\n       (f) Within the discretion of the Board, it may direct the \n     General Counsel to petition the Court for enforcement under \n     Section 407(a)2 of a decision under Section 406(e) of the Act \n     whenever the Board finds that a party has failed to comply \n     with its decision and order.\n     Sec. 8.03  Judicial review\n       Pursuant to Section 407 of the Act, a party aggrieved by a \n     final decision of the Board under Section 406(e) in cases \n     arising under Part A of Title II of the Act may file a \n     petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit.

The Board or the Hearing \n     Officer, after giving the respondent an opportunity to reply, \n     shall rule on the motion.\n       (b) Form of Motion. In addition to setting forth the legal \n     and factual bases upon which the attorney's fees and/or costs \n     are sought, a motion for an award of attorney's fees and/or \n     costs shall be accompanied by:\n       (1) accurate and contemporaneous time records;\n       (2) a copy of the terms of the fee agreement (if any);\n       (3) the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work; \n     and\n       (4) an itemization of costs related to the matter in \n     question.\n     Sec. 9.02  Reserved--Ex parte communications\n     Sec. 9.03  Informal resolutions and settlement agreements.\n       (a) Informal Resolution. At any time before a covered \n     employee files a complaint under Section 405, a covered \n     employee and the employing office, on their own, may agree \n     voluntarily and informally to resolve a dispute, so long as \n     the resolution does not require a waiver of a covered \n     employee's rights or the commitment by the employing office \n     to an enforceable obligation.\n       (b) Formal Settlement Agreement. The parties may agree \n     formally to settle all or part of a disputed matter in \n     accordance with Section 414 of the Act.

A bill to amend part V of title 28, United States Code, to \nrequire that the Department of Justice and State attorneys general are \nprovided notice of a class action certification or settlement, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           the protecting class action plaintiffs act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protecting Class \nAction Plaintiffs Act of 1995. This legislation is necessary to address \na troubling number of instances where class action lawsuits have been \nfiled on behalf of thousands, and in some cases, millions of Americans, \nbut the suits have been settled in ways that do not promote the best \ninterest of the plaintiffs.\n  A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents \nan individual plaintiff, but in addition, the suit seeks relief for all \nthose individuals who have suffered an injury similar to the plaintiff. \nFor example, a suit brought against a pharmaceutical company by a \nperson suffering from the side effects of a drug, can, if the court \napproves it as a class action, be expanded to cover all individuals who \nused that drug.\n  More often than not, these suits are settled. Settlement agreements \nprovide monetary and other relief to class Members, protect defendants \nfrom future lawsuits, and stipulate how the plaintiffs' attorneys will \nbe paid.\n  All class members are notified of the terms of the settlement and \ngiven the opportunity to exclude themselves from the class action if \nthey do not want to be bound by the agreement. All class action \nsettlements must be approved by a court.\n  Although the class action is an important part of our civil justice \nsystem, it is fraught with difficulties. The primary problem is that \nthe client in a class action is a diffuse group of thousands of \nindividuals scattered across the country, that is incapable of \nexercising meaningful control over the litigation. While in theory the \nclass action lawyers must be responsive to their clients, in practice, \nthe lawyers control all aspects of the litigation.\n  Moreover, when a class actions is settled, the amount of the \nattorneys' fee, is negotiated between the plaintiffs' lawyers and the \ndefendants. Yet, in most cases, the fee is paid by the class members--\nthe only party that does not have a seat at the bargaining table.\n  In addition, class actions are now being used by defendants as a tool \nto limit their future liabilities. Class actions are being settled that \ncover all individuals exposed to a particular substance but whose \ninjuries have not yet manifest themselves. As Prof. John Coffee of the \nColumbia Law School has written, ``the class action is providing a \nmeans by which unsuspecting future \n\n[[Page S19251]]\nclaimants suffer the extinguishment of their claims even before they \nlearn of their injury.''\n\n  In light of the incentives that are driving the parties, it is easy \nto understand how class action settlements can be abused. Plaintiffs' \nattorneys and corporate defendants can reach agreements that satisfy \ntheir respective interests--limiting the defendants' liability and \nmaximizing the attorneys' fee. But, because the plaintiffs themselves \ndo not participate in the settlement negotiations, they are sometimes \nleft out in the cold. Again, as Professor Coffee has concluded, ``if \nnot actually collusive, settlements all too frequently have advanced \nthe interests of plaintiffs' attorneys, not those of class members.''\n  Presumably, judges would not approve settlements that were unfair to \nthe plaintiffs. But, it is difficult for judges to adequately \nscrutinize such settlements. In most instances, the only parties \nappearing before them--the plaintiffs' lawyers and the defendants--\nsupport the settlement. Without anyone providing adversarial scrutiny \nto reveal the flaws in class action settlements, judges are apt to \napprove them, especially since they result in the removal of complex \ncases from crowded court dockets.\n  I am familiar with one particularly egregious case where this is \nexactly what transpired. A constituent of mine, Dexter Kamilewicz, of \nYarmouth, ME was a member of a class action lawsuit filed in Alabama \nState Court against BancBoston Mortgage Corp. The suit alleged that the \nbank was availing itself of ``free money'' by requiring its mortgage \nholders to maintain an excessive balance in their mortgage escrow \naccount. After the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on a \npreliminary motion, the parties settled the case.\n  Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to refund the excess \nmoney they were holding in escrow and provide a small amount of \ncompensation to the plaintiffs for lost interest.\n  BancBoston offered to pay the entire fee for the lawyers representing \nthe class based on a formula that had been used to settle a different \ncase. But the plaintiffs' lawyers rejected this offer. Instead, they \ninsisted that their fees be paid directly from their clients' escrow \naccounts based on a formula that would provide them a more lucrative \nreturn.\n  The bank assented to this process and the State court judge approved \nthe settlement.\n  Pursuant to the settlement, Mr. Kamilewicz received a check for $2.19 \nin back interest, but did not receive any other refund because his \nescrow account did not have an excessive balance. Then, about a year \nlater, Mr. Kamilewicz noticed on his annual bank statement that $91.33 \nhad been withdrawn from his escrow account for miscellaneous \ndisbursements. The bank told him that the money was used to pay the \nclass action lawyers. In essence, Mr. Kamilewicz paid $91.33 to the \nlawyers for work on a lawsuit that provided him with only a $2.19 \nbenefit.\n  The class action lawyers, however, did quite well. According to a \nrecent New York Times article about the case, they received $8.5 \nmillion--over 20 percent of the $40 million refunded by the bank to \nclass members. Not only is this a large fee, but one must consider that \nthe $40 million refund was, and always would have been the plaintiffs' \nmoney. The only benefit of the lawsuit to the class was that they \nreceived the money in 1994 instead of when they closed their mortgages. \nThe attorney fee in this case, therefore, bore no relationship to the \nactual benefit that the lawsuit provided to the class.\n\n  Since the New York Times article ran, I have learned a bit about the \nlawyers who were involved in this case. In an unrelated case from \nChicago, a judge would not even permit these lawyers to maintain a \nclass action based on his view that they would not adequately represent \nthe class. The judge commented on the record that:\n\n       For five and a half years . . . I have been witness to \n     their unparalleled and shocking abuse of process; their \n     blatant manipulation of the rules of Court; their disregard \n     for orderly processes and Court orders; their discourtesy and \n     hostility to opposing counsel; their subversion of their \n     clients' best interests; their preoccupation with slanderous \n     accusations; their disinclination to trial preparation; their \n     unfamiliarity with and disregard for case law precedent in \n     their path; and their unabashed utilization of class action \n     techniques as a weapon to heighten litigation costs and \n     bootstrap modest individual claims into handsome class fees.\n\n  The judge concluded that he ``could think of no plague worse than to \nhave a Court impose [these lawyers] on absent and unsuspecting members \nof a class.''\n  There are other problematic cases from across the country. In \nPhiladelphia, a group of lawyers settled a set of cases for clients of \ntheirs against a consortium of asbestos companies. In exchange, these \nsame lawyers agreed to a class action settlement covering all other \nindividuals exposed to the companies' asbestos. The class action \nsettlement, however, provided less money for the class members than had \nbeen provided for the lawyers' individual clients.\n  To make matters worse, this class action--Georgine versus Amchem \nProducts--covers individuals that have been exposed to asbestos but \nhave not yet become sick. How can these individuals make a rational \ndecision about the merits of the settlement when they do not know \nwhether they will become ill and, if they do, how serious their \nillnesses will be?\n  This month's American Bar Association Journal contains an article \nabout two competing nationwide class actions currently pending in two \ndifferent State courts. These cases both concern defective polybutelene \npipe that is causing floods in people's homes across the country. The \ncase in Tennessee has settled for $850 million. It may cover over 3 \nmillion homeowners. The case in Alabama is going to trial. Lawyers in \nthe Alabama case are trying to convince homeowners to opt-out of the \nTennessee settlement and join their case. Homeowners are receiving \nconflicting notices from both cases and are confused. As one of them \nsaid, ``I don't know about all this legal stuff . . . all I want is my \nwalls fixed.''\n  So there are a wide range of legal and ethical issues concerning \nclass actions that are deserving of some careful attention from \nCongress. My legislation is a first step in this direction. It attempts \nto address the problem of class action settlements in two ways:\n  First, it would require class action lawyers to notify the attorney \ngeneral of States in which class members reside whenever a class action \nis settled. Providing notice to the attorneys general will enable them \nto scrutinize class action settlements and object to the court if the \nsettlements fail to promote the consumers' interests. In my view, the \nparticipation of the attorneys general is critical to improve the class \naction settlement process.\n\n  Second, the legislation would require that notices mailed to class \nmembers contain summaries written in plain, easily understandable \nlanguage. Such summaries are necessary because most class action \nnotices are lengthy and filled with legal jargon that the average \ncitizen cannot understand. Anyone covered by a class action settlement \nshould know the benefits they will obtain, the rights that they are \nsacrificing, and the way their attorneys will be paid, Today, most \npeople simply throw away action notices like junk mail because they are \ntoo complicated and difficult to comprehend.\n  In sum, the legislation will bring some sunlight into the class \naction process and, as we know, sunlight is the best disinfectant. It \nwill enable State attorneys general to provide adversarial scrutiny to \nsettlements and promote the interests of consumers when the plaintiffs' \nlawyers and corporate defendants are not. It will also give individual \ncall members the information they need to make informed decisions about \nwhether they wish to join a class action or be bound by a settlement \nagreement. This is a modest step, but one that I believe will be \neffective.\n  Before closing, I want to make clear that I do not oppose class \naction lawsuits. Over the past three decades, class actions have been \nused to oppose racially segregated schools, obtain redress for victims \nof employment discrimination, and provide compensation for individuals \nexposed to toxic chemicals or injured by defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims collectively that otherwise would be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty of any litigation reform endeavor is finding ways to \nweed \n\n[[Page S19252]]\nout the bad cases without closing the courthouse doors to those who \nhave genuine grievances deserving of redress. Legislation that limits \nmonetary recoveries or provides immunity for wrongdoers does not meet \nthis litmus test. In an effort to deter frivolous lawsuits these \nmeasures have the perverse effect of limiting the remedies available to \nthose with legitimate claims.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is an example of the type of \nlitigation reform that I believe will help to protect against unethical \nattorney behavior and curb abusive lawsuits. It will not limit the \navailability of judicial remedies for meritorious cases.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the bill and the New York Times article about \nthe Kamilewicz case be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kamilewicz never wants to win a class-action \n     lawsuit again--at least not when it costs him more than he \n     wins.\n       Mr. Kamilewicz, a real estate broker in Portland, Me., \n     found out this year that he was among the winners of a class-\n     action suit against his mortgage bank, the Bank of Boston. He \n     learned of his victory only when he spotted a $91.33 \n     ``miscellaneous deduction'' from his escrow account that \n     turned out be his payment for lawyers he never knew he had \n     hired. His winnings were apparently just $2.19 in back \n     interest.\n       Many class actions end with plaintiffs winning meager \n     awards while their lawyers walk away with millions of dollars \n     in fees. But the suit against the Bank of Boston has taken \n     that difference to a new level.\n       ``This is the only class action that I have heard about \n     where the consumers won and ended up paying money out of \n     their own pockets,'' said Will Lund, superintendent of the \n     Maine Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection.\n       The suit, which accused the bank of keeping excessive \n     amounts of its customers' money in escrow accounts, involved \n     a nationwide class of 715,000 current and former mortage \n     holders. The 300,000 current holders would up footing the \n     lawyers' bill for $8.5 million. Only after the case was \n     settled last year did some members of that group--just how \n     many is unclear--say they realized they ended up with a loss.\n       Now the matter is back in court again and may soon be the \n     catalyst for Congressional action.\n       Mr. Kamilewicz (pronounced CAM-eh-lev-itch); his wife, \n     Gretchen, and a third disgruntled plaintiff recently filed a \n     new lawsuit--which is itself seeking class-action status--\n     that accuses the original plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as the \n     bank, of fraud. Both the bank and the lawyers say the \n     settlement was fair and deny doing anything wrong.\n       Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, says he has \n     heard enough complaints about the settlement to propose a \n     corrective measure. His legislation, expected to be \n     introduced in the next month, would differ from other recent \n     efforts in Congress at tort reform in that it would protect \n     plaintiffs, rather than defendants, against the excesses of \n     lawyers.\n       ``There is evidence from around the country that in many \n     instances class actions are benefiting lawyers to a much \n     greater extent than their clients,'' Senator Cohen said.\n       Dozens of suits were filed in the early 1990's over escrow \n     accounts before Federal regulations were adopted to more \n     strictly limit the excess money that banks could hold in \n     the accounts. Scores of class actions of all sorts are \n     certified in Federal and state courts each year.\n     \n[[Page S19253]]\n\n       In the Bank of Boston case, critics of the settlement note, \n     the lawyers' fees took the form of an assessment against the \n     escrow accounts that sometimes dwarfed the modest awards. \n     What is more, apart from a few dollars in back interest, the \n     ``awards'' were simply refunds of the plaintiffs' own money, \n     which would have been returned sooner or later even without \n     the suit. Mr. Kamilewicz and others who apparently had no \n     excessive amounts of money in their accounts were hit hardest \n     because they got no refund but still had to pay legal fees.\n       Finally, the fees were larger than they should have been, \n     the critics say, because they were based not on the current \n     value of the refunds but on unrealistic projections of their \n     future worth.\n       ``Lawyers' fees are often a problem in these kinds of \n     cases,'' said Jerome Hoffman, a former top official with the \n     Florida Attorney General's office, which had tried to block \n     the settlement. ``But this is probably the most egregious \n     case I have ever seen.''\n       For their part, the plaintiffs' lawyers and a bank \n     spokesman noted that the settlement had been approved by a \n     state judge in Alabama, where the suit was filed.\n       In the settlement itself, the bank denied doing anything \n     improper in handling the escrow. Money held in escrow is used \n     to pay real estate taxes and property insurance. Banks are \n     allowed to maintain a cushion of extra money to cover \n     increases in those costs, but the Bank of Boston was accused \n     of using a formula that often resulted in an excessively \n     large cushion.\n       Ed Russell, the bank spokesman, declined to comment on the \n     new suit, filed this month in federal court in Chicago. But \n     several of the lawyers now being sued described it as \n     groundless. The lawyers are with Ezell & Sharbrough of \n     Mobile, Ala., and two Chicago firms, Edelman & Combs and \n     Lawrence Walner & Associates.\n       One of the lawyers, Daniel A. Edelman, called the new suit \n     ``the most frivolous I have even seen.''\n       But legal experts say that the dispute highlights the \n     problems associated with class actions. Consumers and \n     investors are often made parties without realizing it or \n     understanding that they may receive trivial amounts while \n     their lawyers make millions.\n       Information in legal notices is often shrouded in dense \n     jargon. In some cases, lawyers for both sides may \n     intentionally cloud that information to mislead plaintiffs \n     about important issues, the experts said.\n       ``It is not designed to be good communication,'' said John \n     Coffee, a professor at the Columbia University School of Law. \n     ``It is designed to convince a judge who can wave his magic \n     wand and approve a settlement.'' Stephen Gardner, a lawyer in \n     Dallas who has handled many consumer cases, added, ``A lot of \n     settlement notices are engineered by the parties to keep \n     class members in the dark about how much money the lawyers \n     are making versus how many dollars they are going to get.''\n       To address that problem, Senator Cohen said his legislation \n     would, among other things, require the parties to disclose \n     proposed settlements to the attorneys general in all states \n     which plaintiffs reside.\n       In settling its case, the Bank of Boston agreed to pay a \n     maximum of $8.76 in back interest to individual mortgage \n     holders. The bank also agreed to change its future escrow \n     accounting methods and refund about $30 million in excess \n     escrow payments. Normally, any extra money is returned when a \n     mortgage ends or is refinanced. All told, plaintiffs' lawyers \n     say, the settlement conferred about $40 million in benefits, \n     including estimated savings from the accounting change.\n       ``Nothing fraudulent or improper took place,'' Mr. Edelman \n     said. ``There was an economic benefit in excess of $40 \n     million and the lawyers received $8.5 million, and that is a \n     low-end number.''\n       Even critics acknowledged that the plaintiffs' lawyers \n     helped their clients by getting the bank to change its escrow \n     practices. Still, they said the plaintiffs ended up with a \n     questionable deal on two fronts.\n       For one, fees were assessed even against people like Mr. \n     Kamilewicz, who apparently did not have excessive amounts of \n     money in escrow, or not enough extra to produce a refund to \n     fully cover the fees.\n       The fees were levied as a percentage of the balance in each \n     escrow account, court papers indicate. Mr. Russell, the \n     bank's spokesman, declined to comment when asked if the bank \n     knew how many accounts might not have had excessive amounts. \n     He also declined to discuss Mr. Kamilewicz's case.\n       Speaking generally, Mr. Gardner, the Dallas lawyer, said \n     that in an escrow case of this size, at least several \n     thousand people would have no cushion at all in their \n     accounts.\n       The other problem for the plaintiffs was the way the fee \n     was set, critics of the settlement said.\n       After the plaintiffs won a partial summary judgment in \n     1993, negotiations to resolve the case began. Initially, the \n     bank offered to change its escrow accounting procedures and \n     to pay lawyers' fees of $500,000, court papers indicate. The \n     bank said that to take such money out of the escrow accounts \n     would result in a ``net out-of-pocket loss' to many \n     customers, the new lawsuit contends.\n       Mr. Russell, the bank spokesman, declined to make the \n     bank's lawyers available. But one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, \n     John W. Sharbrough 3d, said the $500,000 offer did not even \n     cover the lawyers' expenses, and to negotiate fees with the \n     bank would have been unethical.\n       In any event, the lawyers requested as their fee a third of \n     the $42 million in excess escrow that was then held by the \n     bank, a court transcript shows.\n       A one-third award to plaintiffs' lawyers would not be \n     unusual in a typical contingency-fee case, like a personal \n     injury suit, where the settlement comes out of a defendant's \n     pocket. But since an escrow case involves the return of the \n     plaintiffs' own money, banks have frequently paid the \n     plaintiffs' legal bill using a fixed figure for each account.\n       To justify a far larger fee, the plaintiffs' firms offered \n     expert testimony suggesting that consumers would realize a \n     significant windfall by getting their money back now rather \n     than later.\n       For example, E.W. McKean, an accountant in Mobile testified \n     that if a consumer used a hypothetical $100 refund to reduce \n     the principal on a 20-year, $10,000 loan at 8.6 percent \n     interest, the benefit over time in lower interest payments \n     would be nearly $400 in current dollars.\n       But consumer lawyers like Mr. Gardner said it was \n     unrealistic to place too much future value on small sums that \n     are recovered.\n       ``This is like winning a scratch card,'' he said. ``People \n     are not going to invest this money.''\n       Mr. Edelman, the plaintiffs' lawyer, disagreed, saying that \n     the future benefit of a recovery is a common yardstick for \n     determining fees.\n       The judge in the case eventually awarded the plaintiffs' \n     lawyers 28 percent of the excess escrow, a pie that totaled \n     about $30 million when the fees were actually set.\n       Mr. Sharbrough said that while some class members who got \n     in touch with him were initially confused about the \n     settlement, they were all pleased once it was explained to \n     them. Mr. Edelman said banks were probably behind the new \n     lawsuit because he had represented consumers in other class-\n     action claims against financial institutions.\n       Such an assertion would no doubt surprise Mr. Kamilewicz, \n     who said he started the ball rolling because he was so angry. \n     ``The issue isn't the $91,'' he said. ``The issue is behavior \n     standards.''\n       Some lawyers are wishing him luck. ``Somebody ought to give \n     him a gold medal,'' said Peter Antonacci, the Deputy Attorney \n     General of Florida. ``This thing was begging to be done.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1502. A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide that the \nrequirements relating to marking imported articles and containers not \napply to spice products, coffee, or tea; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the tariff act of 1930 amendment act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect several inadvertent results from recent rulings by the U.S. \nTreasury Department changing over 50 years of law and practice in the \nU.S. regarding spices. This legislation will exempt these products, as \nwell as coffee and tea, from proposed new regulations that would \nneedlessly and inadvertently require their containers to be \nindividually marked with country of origin.\n  These labeling requirements are unnecessary because the coffee, tea \nand spices under consideration, with one exception, are not \nmanufactured in the United States and therefore do not offer consumers \nthe option to purchase domestically-grown alternatives. The one \nexception is not processed in such a way as to fall under the new \nregulations, so it will be unaffected by this legislation.\n  This bill, supported by the House Ways and Means Committee, was \nincluded in the House's version of the budget reconciliation bill, but \nwas excluded under Senate rules. The legislation is also supported by \nthe U.S. Treasury Department, which issued the regulations but requires \nlegislative language to except these three areas.\n  Finally, my bill is supported by coffee, tea, and spice importers. \nWithout this legislation, regulations calling for country of origin \nmarkings ultimately would require extremely costly record keeping and \nmarking of individual jars and canisters of products which are often \nmixes of nearly identical products from different countries and \ndifferent parts of the world. The countries of origin vary quite often \ndue to market prices and availability. Marking requirements under the \nnew regulations would ultimately cost consumers millions of dollars in \nhigher coffee, tea and spice prices while providing no useful \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass \nthis important and bipartisan technical correction.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n      \n[[Page S19254]]\n\n  S. 1504. A bill to control crime by mandatory victim restitution; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     victim restitution legislation\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1504, the \nVictims Restitution Enforcement Act of 1995. I do so because I am \nconvinced that justice demands we devise an effective mechanism for \nenforcing orders of restitution owed by criminals to the victims of \ntheir crimes.\n  We take an important step today with the adoption of H.R. 665. This \nbill makes restitution mandatory and thereby sends a clear message to \ncriminals that they will be made to pay for their crimes. I also \nbelieve it is critical that we let victims know that at last they will \nbe entitled to some relief.\n  In order to help realize the promise of H.R. 665's mandatory victim \nrestitution, however, I believe further steps are needed. To that end, \nthe bill I am introducing today will bring important and needed changes \nto the enforcement mechanisms covering orders of restitution in Federal \ncourt. This bill will further ensure that restitution payments from \ncriminals to their victims become a reality.\n  S. 1504 will provide four major advantages to victims named in \ncriminal restitution orders.\n  First, restitution orders would be enforceable as a civil debt and \npayable immediately.\n  Right now, most restitution is collected entirely through the \ncriminal justice system. It is frequently paid as directed by the \nprobation officer, which means restitution payments can't begin until \nthe prisoner is released. This bill makes restitution orders payable \nimmediately, as a civil debt, speeding recovery and impeding attempts \nto avoid payment.\n  Without this provision, it will remain easier for the Government to \ngo after students who have defaulted on their student loans than it is \nfor the Government to enforce an order of restitution against convicted \ncriminals. Of course, this provision will impose no criminal penalties \non those unable to pay. It will simply allow civil collection against \nthose who have assets.\n  Second, this bill will add a whole new arsenal of weapons for \ncollecting victim restitution payments. If the debt is payable \nimmediately all normal civil collection procedures--principally the \nFederal Debt Collection Act--can be used. This bill also explicitly \ngives victims access to other extensive civil procedures already in \nplace for the collection of debts.\n  We want to make criminals pay, not burden our courts or our Federal \ncriminal prosecutors. Thus we should not be unilaterally deciding to \nplace enforcement of all victim restitution within the criminal \nprocess, but should permit the Attorney General to place responsibility \nfor collecting restitution payments on Government attorneys charged \nwith collecting other civil debts.\n\n  Third, this bill will make restitution judgments subject to criminal \nenforcement for 5 years.\n  Current law only allows enforcement of an order of restitution by the \nUnited States in the same manner as fines are enforced, permitting the \nlimited use of some criminal sanctions. Presently, for example, the \ncourt will be permitted to resentence a criminal who wilfully refuses \nto make restitution payments--but nothing short of that.\n  This bill will add a variety of less draconian criminal sanctions to \nthe court's arsenal, such as modification of the terms or conditions of \nparole, extension of the defendant's probation or supervised release, \nor revocation of probation or supervised release.\n  The bill will thus retain the fines mechanism, and improve on the \ncriminal sanctions, as well as add a number of purely civil methods of \ndebt collection.\n  Fourth, this legislation will give the courts power to impose \npresentence restraints on defendant's use of their assets in \nappropriate cases. This will prevent well-heeled defendants from \ndissipating assets prior to sentencing.\n  Without this provision the whole victim restitution law may well be \nuseless in many cases. Even in those rare cases in which a defendant \nhas the means to pay full restitution at once, if the court has no \ncapacity to prevent the defendant from spending ill-gotten gains prior \nto the sentencing phase, frequently there will be nothing left for the \nvictim by the time the restitution order is entered.\n  The provisions permitting pre-sentence restraints are similar to \nother such provisions that already exist in the law for private civil \nactions and asset forfeiture cases. For example, they require a court \nhearing and place a preponderance of the evidence burden on the \nGovernment.\n  Finally, this bill will prevent the defendant from denying the \nessential findings underlying a criminal restitution judgment in any \nfuture civil action brought by the victim.\n  All victims named in a restitution order will be able to bring a \ncivil action to enforce the order in State court without having to \nrelitigate the essential findings of the criminal judgment against the \ndefendant.\n  This provision merely corrects an aberration in the law.\n  Currently the United States and some--but not all--victims are \npermitted to use the criminal judgment in subsequent civil proceedings.\n  Indeed, under current law, the only victims who absolutely cannot use \nthe essential findings of a criminal judgment in a subsequent civil \naction are victims who happen to live in states with mutuality \nrequirements for collateral estoppel, and who have been victims of \ncrimes in which the defendant did not plead guilty.\n  This makes no sense. In such instances there has already been a full \ncriminal trial in Federal court convicting the defendant under a higher \nburden of proof than is required in a civil action.\n  Ordinarily, the victim would be able to take advantage of the \ncriminal conviction, just as the United States can. And in fact, \nvictims are often able to use anything the criminal has agreed to in a \nplea bargain because those statements constitute judicial admissions.\n  But because of a clause in the law that limits the effect of criminal \njudgments in subsequent civil actions to the extent that would be \npermitted by state law, these Federal criminal judgments are, in some \ncases, not accorded the effect they are due. For the sake of judicial \neconomy alone, this should be corrected.\n  If we are willing to take the step of making some crimes subject to \nmandatory restitution, as we do in the victim restitution bill today, I \nbelieve we should take the additional step of making those mandatorily-\nissued orders easily enforceable.\n  This is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these \nfurther steps to make victim restitution work that are contained in my \nvictim restitution bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Breaux and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1505. A bill to reduce risk to public safety and the environment \nassociated with pipeline transportation of natural gas and hazardous \nliquids, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n          THE ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee to introduce the Accountable Pipeline \nSafety and Partnership Act. It is the necessary reauthorization \nlegislation for the Office of Pipeline Safety [OPS] in the Department \nof Transportation.\n  This is important legislation because it will reauthorize the Federal \nprogram with regulatory authority for approximately 2 million miles of \nnatural gas pipelines and nearly 200,000 miles of hazardous liquid \npipelines. In the lower 48 States and Hawaii, there are 700 different \noperators who manage these pipelines. This bill does not affect the \nFederal statute that regulates the Alaskan pipeline.\n  The goal of my legislation is accurately reflected in three words \nfrom the title--accountable, safety, and partnership. The bill gives \nthe Office of Pipeline Safety the necessary tools to shift the program \naway from a very prescriptive, command-and-control approach to a \nresponsible risk-based management partnership which continues to ensure \nindustry's accountability and the public's safety.\n  According to the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], \ntransportation of natural gas and liquids by pipelines is by far the \nsafest mode of \n\n[[Page S19255]]\nconveyance. NTSB's 1994 transportation safety data highlight this fact. \nOut of 43,134 transportation facilities, only 22--just 0.05 percent--\nwere related to pipelines.\n  Let me be absolutely clear: I want to send an unambiguous signal here \ntoday on the Senate floor and through the text of this bill that \npipeline safety will not be jeopardized.\n  In fact, I would assert that the public's safety will be enhanced \nthrough a more effective Government and industry pipeline safety \npartnership that is proposed by this bill.\n  Through this legislation, Congress will recognize and appreciate this \nrelationship. Pipeline operators, who are responsible for day-to-day \nsafe operations, experience many adverse consequences from accidents on \ntheir systems. Therefore, pipeline operators have a direct and \ncompelling reason to work hard to keep their system and the public \nsafe.\n  There is another partnership role which must be acknowledged and that \nis the active and positive involvement of States which also direct \nresources at pipeline monitoring.\n  The governmental role is two-tiered: OPS for the Federal Government \nand State agencies. Together their mission is to inspect, audit, and \nenforce pipeline compliance and safety activities.\n  Historically, the regulations governing safety for transmission and \nutility pipelines have been modeled or based upon industry-developed \nstandards and practices. The most effective procedures have formed the \ncore of today's pipeline safety regulations.\n  However, recent legislative proposals would, in effect, add \nunnecessary layers of regulations in direct response to specific \natypical incidents. This has diverted resources. This is what this \nlegislation will address using the same three words from the bill's \ntitle as my philosophical underpinning--accountable, safety, \npartnership.\n  For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, OPS has worked with natural gas and \nhazardous liquid pipeline operators and other interested parties to \nfind better ways to address the issues inherent to pipeline safety. \nTheir goal is to promulgate new reasonable, effective and cost \nefficient regulations. OPS is currently analyzing the actual risks \njuxtaposed to existing regulations to determine what is useful and what \nis unnecessary.\n  This process develops a regulatory approach which provides companies \nwith greater flexibility in protecting both their systems and the \npublic's safety. I built upon this activity, and it served as the \nstarting point for a legislative approach which is incorporated into \nthis reauthorization.\n  It is worthwhile to note that the major provisions of this bill were \ndrafted through a genuine bipartisan effort. This bill reflects real \ninput and informal consultation with the regulated industry, national \nassociations representing personnel who are actively involved in \npipeline safety, and Administration officials. Technical assistance was \nalso provided throughout the drafting process from the Congressional \nResearch Service. I appreciate all of the invaluable suggestions during \nthe development of this legislation.\n  There are four major provisions within the legislation.\n  First, it establishes a new risk assessment combined with a detailed \ncost-benefit analysis followed by an independently verified peer review \nfor all future regulations. The process is streamlined and meets the \nAmerican common sense test. President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 \nprovided the framework for this bill's new regulatory approach. It also \ntakes advantage of risk models being developed by OPS.\n  Second, it authorizes a 4-year demonstration project under which \ncompanies can voluntarily develop individually tailored risk management \nplans. These plans must be approved by the Department of \nTransportation. OPS will monitor the plans to ensure that operations \nwill provide equal or greater safety protection than existing \nregulations.\n  Third, it authorizes funding for the OPS in such a manner that money \nwill be double the projected inflation rate through the end of this \ncentury. Each year the funding will increase by 6-percent. Because OPS \nis funded entirely by user fees assessed on pipelines, these funds must \nbe concentrated on OPS's primary mission of monitoring pipeline safety \non the public's behalf.\n  Fourth, it clarifies the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. This will \nremove confusions which have hampered finalizing several rules.\n  My intention is straightforward: to focus OPS regulatory resources on \nareas where there are significant nationwide pipeline safety risks, and \nto identify and develop cost-effective regulatory means for addressing \nthese risks.\n  The bill will ensure that America's taxpayers get the maximum safety \nvalue from their OPS investment. It will lead to a responsible \nallocation of limited resources to increase public safety.\n  It will prevent a hidden tax on natural gas consumers resulting from \nan excessive increase in user fees to duplicate ongoing industry \nresearch.\n  It also means that rules will be clarified to accommodate changes \naffecting issues like smart pig retrofitting and explicit definitions \nfor unusually sensitive environmental areas.\n  There will always be some who will argue that the Government must \nspend more and more money for safety concerns. My response is that \nsafety is not just a function of how much the government spends. I \nbelieve the critical factor is how the money is spent--not how much. \nThis bill deals with how. The NTSB Safety data makes the case that the \nexcellent safety record for pipelines does not indicate that increased \nfunding is needed.\n  This legislation is both responsible and balanced.\n  Amercian taxpayers win.\n  Government regulators win.\n  Regulatory reform wins.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who are my initial cosponsors, and I \nlook forward to other Senators joining me as cosponsors of this \nimportant reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 45. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States in order to ensure that private \npersons and groups are not denied benefits or otherwise discriminated \nagainst by the United States or any of the several States on account of \nreligious expression, belief, or identity; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              religious equality constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, religious liberty is the first freedom \nmentioned in the Bill of Rights. Today, I am introducing a religious \nequality constitutional amendment to restore that freedom to its \nintended and proper place in American society. This amendment is \nintended to rescue the first amendment's requirement that Congress \n``shall make no law * * * prohibiting the free exercise [of religion] * \n* *'' from a misguided Supreme Court jurisprudence and the hostility \nthat jurisprudence has spawned among local, State, and Federal \nGovernments toward the participation of religious institutions in the \npublic square. This is the same amendment introduced by Congressman \nHenry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In my view, our \nNation benefits greatly from the participation of religious \ninstitutions in the public square. Religious values and influences are \nimportant components in addressing the social problems facing our \ncountry. These problems include the breakdown of the family, loss of \nrespect for the values of human life, honesty, and hard work, the \ngrowing problem of juvenile crime, and the worsening drug problem.\n  We can provide public support to private religious institutions in \ncarrying out vital social welfare functions whenever public support is \nprovided to private secular institutions without establishing a \nreligion or group of religions.\n  The amendment embodies two key principles. First, if public benefits \nare dispensed to private secular entities, Government cannot deny such \nbenefits to private religious entities. Second, in dispensing such \nbenefits among private religious entities, the Government may not \ndiscriminate among them based on religious beliefs.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this amendment after careful personal \nconsideration and considerable public debate. I revere the Constitution \nand do not take lightly the proposal of new amendments to it. But after \nlong study and discussion, and a series of hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee which I chair, I believe that a constitutional amendment is \nnecessary to protect the rights of believing Americans. These rights \nare now often denied as a result of a confused and often erroneous \nconstitutional jurisprudence in the courts and discrimination against \nreligious groups and individuals by administrative agencies.\n  In our Judiciary Committee hearings this past autumn, we heard \nstories of individuals who were denied access to government benefits \nsimply because of their religious beliefs. Surely no one who has not \nbeen schooled in the intricate confusions of first amendment \njurisprudence would think that the cases we heard were fairly resolved.\n  We heard from the station manager of the Fordham University public \nradio station, which was denied construction funds available to all \nother public radio stations by the Clinton administration's Commerce \nDepartment because it broadcasts the Catholic mass 1 hour a week.\n  Arguments that the religious broadcast was a very small part of a \nvery diverse programming schedule or that it was a practice going back \nmore than 50 years were unavailing. Even the fact that the station was \nresponding to community needs, as public stations are supposed to, by \nproviding this religious programming to the elderly and disabled shut-\nins did not move the bureaucrats at the Commerce Department. Given that \nthe station needed the funds to comply with government facility \nrequirements, but were told that the station would receive no money as \nlong as the offending program was broadcast, the Clinton administration \nwas virtually saying, ``stop broadcasting Catholic mass or stop \nbroadcasting at all.''\n  This is appalling enough as an administrative abuse, but is has been \nabetted by a lower Federal court, and now awaits an appeals court \ndecision. I should note that the statutory remedy provided by the \nlandmark Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which I was proud to \ncosponsor and which President Clinton was proud to sign, was held \nunavailing in this case.\n  Two Supreme Court cases that were much discussed at our hearings by \nconstitutional experts point up the human costs of discrimination by \nthe government in dispensing public benefits. In Aguilar versus Felton, \nthe Supreme Court held that remedial English and math could not be \nprovided to economically deprived children on the premises of their \nschool, if the school is religious. Similarly, in the case of Witters \nversus Dept. of Services for the Blind, Larry Witters, and otherwise \neligible applicant for Government assistance to blind students, was \nultimately denied that assistance because his chosen course of study \nwas religious. The Supreme Court held that the first amendment did not \nrequire that he be denied funding, but it was not prepared to hold that \nthe First Amendment prohibited antireligious discrimination. On remand, \nthe State supreme court of Washington found that the State constitution \nrequired the denial of benefits and the U.S. Supreme Court denied \nfurther review of the case. Mr. President, does it make sense that \npeople with disabilities who are otherwise entitled to Government \nassistance are denied that help because they also choose to exercise \ntheir rights of conscience?\n  Even when a religious person wins a case, it often takes so long that \nthe help is no longer needed, or the case is decided on such narrow \ngrounds or with such narrow vote margins that future parties have no \ncomfort in ordering their conduct based on Supreme Court precedent. In \nthe case of Zobrest versus Catalina Foothills School District, a deaf \nstudent's right to a deaf interpreter at school was not vindicated \nuntil well after he had graduated. And in the important case of \nRosenberger versus University of Virginia, decided earlier this year, a \nChristian student group's right to funding of publishing activities on \npar with other student groups, including Jewish and Muslim groups, was \nupheld on a 5-to-4 vote, with Justice O'Connor, one of the five-vote \nmajority, explicitly stating that the case was decided on its \nparticular facts and that no broad principle upon which anyone can rely \nwas announced in that case.\n  Mr. President, more must be done to safeguard the right of conscience \nof religious Americans. Many of us have tried to help with statutory \nsafeguards like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But statutory \nsolutions are not wholly adequate to correcting the erroneous \ninterpretations of first amendment law by the courts. Only a \nconstitutional amendment can do that. And that is why I am proposing \none today.\n  The proposed amendment does not seek to bring back school-sponsored \nor state-sponsored prayer; it does not seek to create a nationally \nestablished theology. It merely seeks to require that the government \nact neutrally among beneficiaries of generally available resources. At \na time when social values are eroding and family structures are \ncollapsing why should we actively discriminate against religious \nentities and drive them out of the public square? At a time when all \ntypes of groups and viewpoints can receive Federal funds, why do we \nshut out or seriously hamper religious groups? At a time when we wish \nto make our Federal dollars go farther, why should we not take \nadvantage of religious charities, day care, educational, or other \nsocial services? We should not be cutting ourselves off from their help \nsimply because they have a partly religious mission. Nor should we be \nturning away otherwise qualified Americans from Government assistance \nsimply because they seek to enjoy their rights as religious believers.\n\n[[Page S19260]]\n\n  On a more personal note, Mr. President, I come from a religious \ntradition which has known the heavy hand of government. People of my \nfaith know what it is like to be a minority religion subject to \npersecution by other religions and by the State and Federal \nGovernments. In the middle of the last century, the Mormons were driven \nfrom State to State, and ultimately out of the then-United States \naltogether, and even then they were still molested by the Federal \nGovernment. I am concerned that government not drive religion out of \nthe public square and from our public dialog on issues confronting our \npeople. And I am concerned that the Government not single out persons \nof faith for worse treatment than their fellow Americans when it comes \nto enjoying the benefits of public resources.\n  Rather than upset the fine balance between religious beliefs and \nother philosophies in our pluralistic society, the proposed amendment \nseeks to restore it. No group should be disenfranchised by government \nfiat--and we should be especially careful that no group be \ndisenfranchised for exercise of religious faith. Their rights were to \nbe protected by the First particular among our Bill of Rights. It is \nsad that we must revisit so basic an issue in this way at this late \nhour because of recent aberrations in our Government's understanding of \nthose rights.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this is an important issue and that \namending the Constitution is a serious step. I am confident that this \namendment will generate useful discussion and debate about the issue, \nand I think that will be good for the country. I commend this amendment \nto my colleagues, scholars, and fair-minded people throughout our \ncountry, and hope it will find their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19250-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 90\n\n  At the request of Mr. Robb, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n90, a bill to amend the Job Training Partnership Act to improve the \nemployment and training assistance programs for dislocated workers, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1028, a bill to \nprovide increased access to health care benefits, to provide increased \nportability of health care benefits, to provide increased security of \nhealth care benefits, to increase the purchasing power of individuals \nand small employers, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1166\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the names of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Warner] and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1166, a bill to amend the Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, to improve the \nregistration of pesticides, to provide minor use crop protection, to \nimprove pesticide tolerances to safeguard infants and children, and for \nother purposes.\n                                S. 1317\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1317, a bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, \nto enact the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1995, and for other \npurposes.\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n[Mr. Coverdell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1317, supra.\n                                S. 1419\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1419, a bill to \nimpose sanctions against Nigeria.\n                                S. 1484\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby] and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1484, a bill to enforce the public debt limit \nand to protect the social security trust funds and other Federal trust \nfunds and accounts invested in public debt obligations.\n                                S. 1494\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1494, a bill to provide an extension for fiscal year 1996 for certain \nprograms administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \nand the Secretary of Agriculture, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19260-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19260-S19261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 202--CONCERNING THE BAN ON THE USE OF UNITED STATES \n                    PASSPORTS FOR TRAVEL TO LEBANON\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n                              S. Res. 202\n       Whereas on January 26, 1987, the Department of State issued \n     a prohibition on the use of United States passports for \n     travel to Lebanon, creating a ban on travel to Lebanon by \n     United States citizens;\n       Whereas the ban on travel to Lebanon was instituted during \n     a time of civil war, anarchy, and general lawlessness in \n     Lebanon, when the safety and well-being of United States \n     citizens were at serious risk, American hostages were being \n     taken, and hundreds of lives were being lost due to acts of \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas the civil war in Lebanon ended in 1990 and the last \n     United States hostage held in Lebanon was freed on December \n     4, 1991;\n       Whereas there has been no incident of violence against any \n     United States citizen in Lebanon since December 4, 1991;\n       Whereas security in Lebanon has improved demonstrably since \n     the end of the civil war due to, among other efforts, the \n     exchange of security delegations between the United States \n     and Lebanon to monitor ongoing progress on security;\n       Whereas the United States and Lebanon have made special \n     joint efforts to agree upon and sign international \n     conventions against terrorism which would address crimes \n     committed against United States citizens in Lebanon during \n     the civil war;\n       Whereas the United States maintains an economic and \n     military assistance program in Lebanon;\n       Whereas it is estimated that more than 45,000 United States \n     citizens, including Members of Congress, traveled safely to \n     Lebanon in the past 4 years, either in defiance of the ban or \n     under current United States regulations which permit the use \n     of passports by dual Lebanese-United States nationals and in \n     urgent humanitarian cases;\n       Whereas Americans of Lebanese descent who have families \n     residing in Lebanon and who are not willing to defy the \n     travel ban have been seriously harmed by this ban and are \n     prevented from being reunited with their loved ones in \n     Lebanon;\n       Whereas the United States has eased certain restrictions on \n     the travel ban to permit airline tickets to be issued \n     directly from the United States to Beirut for travel by non-\n     United States nationals United States citizens who have \n     obtained the appropriate waiver from the Department of State;\n       Whereas it is in the United States' national interest to \n     assist actively the Government of Lebanon to attain the \n     principles of democracy in the region;\n       Whereas the Lebanese government has initiated a 10-year, \n     $18,000,000,000 reconstruction effort, and in 1993-1995 \n     awarded more than 500 contracts worth more than \n     $2,700,000,000 to business firms for development, \n     reconstruction, and consulting projects;\n       Whereas the ban on the use of United States passports for \n     travel to Lebanon creates a major impediment to United States \n     firms that wish to bid for contracts in Lebanon;\n       Whereas it is in the United States national interest for \n     United States businesses to participate in the reconstruction \n     of Lebanon, since United States participation will bring \n     economic benefit to the United States;\n       Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States \n     for there to be an independent, politically and economically \n     self-reliant Lebanon as a stabilizing state in the region;\n       Whereas in determining whether to restrict the use of \n     United States passports in any country, the Secretary of \n     State should apply consistent criteria; and\n       Whereas travel advisories, rather than travel bans, are in \n     effect for countries such as Bosnia, Rwanda, Haiti, Colombia, \n     and Peru, in which United States citizens have historically \n     experienced as serious risk to their safety as they do in \n     traveling to Lebanon: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it \n     is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in deciding whether to renew the ban on the use of \n     United States passports for travel to Lebanon, the Secretary \n     of State should--\n       (A) expand the present humanitarian waiver provisions to \n     permit American citizens of Lebanese descent to travel to \n     Lebanon for family reunification purposes;\n       (B) create a new waiver category to permit exceptions for \n     United States business personnel who wish to travel to \n     Lebanon for business purposes; and\n       (C) change the Lebanon travel ban to a travel advisory \n     because American citizens have been safely traveling there \n     since 1991, and it appears as if the risk posed to the safety \n     of American citizens is no greater in Lebanon that it is in \n     other countries that currently maintain travel advisories; \n     and\n       (2) the Secretary of State should identify those conditions \n     within Lebanon that are of risk to United States citizens and \n     provide  \n     \n[[Page S19261]]\n\n     suggestions for Lebanon to ameliorate those risks.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation \nregarding the ban on the use of United states passports for travel to \nLebanon. I, along with my colleagues, Mr. Simon, Mr. Graham of Florida, \nand Mr. Kennedy, cosponsored this resolution with the hope that the \npassport restriction will eventually be lifted.\n  The current policy--in effect, a travel ban to Lebanon--has had a \nnegative impact on United States businesses and individuals. Since the \nrestriction on the use of United States passports for travel to Lebanon \ninordinately affects Americans of Lebanese descent, we are proposing \nexpanding the humanitarian considerations provision to permit those \nAmericans of Lebanese descent to travel to Lebanon. This would ease the \nconcerns of many Lebanese Americans who may want to travel to Lebanon \nfor family reunification purposes, but who presently are unable to do \nso.\n  We also advocate creating a new waiver category which would permit \ntravel by United States business personnel who wish to do business in \nLabanon. While the reconstruction effort in Lebanon is progressing at a \nfast pace, United States businesses are hindered from participating in \nthis rebuilding effort due to the travel restrictions. United States \nbusinesses cannot compete with foreign companies with representation in \nand free access to Lebanon.\n  While we understand and agree that the safety and security of United \nStates citizens is of paramount concern when reviewing the travel \npolicy, it is also our understanding that more than 45,000 Americans \nare estimated to have traveled without incident to Lebanon during the \npast 4 years. That being the case, the current restrictions appear to \nbe inconsistent with the situation on the ground. In addition, we note \nthat other countries equally and, in some cases, more unstable than \nLebanon are not subject to similar travel constraints.\n  In view of these considerations, and taking into account the overall \nimprovement in circumstances inside Lebanon, we urge the Secretary of \nState to lift the passport restriction for Lebanon and issue in its \nplace a travel advisory. Such a step would make clear any risks and \ndangers associated with travel to Lebanon, and at the same time enable \nUnited States citizens to make their own informed decisions.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this resolution will be incorporated into \nthe next review process of the travel restrictions to Lebanon, and that \nin February 1996, the Department of State will implement the \nsuggestions encompassed in this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19260-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 203--RELATIVE TO THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this title \n     of this joint resolution, except section 206, whenever the \n     Act listed in section 201 as passed by both the House and \n     Senate as of the date of enactment of this joint resolution, \n     does not include funding for an ongoing project or activity \n     for which there is a budget request, or whenever the rate for \n     operations for an ongoing project or activity provided by \n     section 201 for which there is a budget request would result \n     in the project or activity being significantly reduced, the \n     pertinent project or activity may be continued under the \n     authority and conditions provided in the applicable \n     appropriations Act for the fiscal year 1995 by increasing the \n     rate for operations provided by section 201 to a rate for \n     operations not to exceed one that provides the minimal level \n     that would enable existing activities to continue. No new \n     contracts or grants shall be awarded in excess of an amount \n     that bears the same ratio to the rate for operations provided \n     by this section as the number of days covered by this \n     resolution bears to 366. For \n\n[[Page S19263]]\n     the purposes of this title of this joint resolution the minimal level \n     means a rate for operations that is reduced from the \n     current rate by 25 percent.\n       Sec. 212. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title \n     of this joint resolution, except section 206, whenever the \n     rate for operations for any continuing project or activity \n     provided by section 201 or section 211 for which there is a \n     budget request would result in a furlough of Government \n     employees, that rate for operations may be increased to the \n     minimum level that would enable the furlough to be avoided. \n     No new contracts or grants shall be awarded in excess of an \n     amount that bears the same ratio to the rate for operations \n     provided by this section as the number of days covered by \n     this resolution bears to 366.\n       Sec. 213. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title \n     of this joint resolution, except sections 206, 211, and 212, \n     for those programs that had high initial rates of operation \n     or complete distribution of funding at the beginning of the \n     fiscal year in fiscal year 1995 because of distributions of \n     funding to States, foreign countries, grantees, or others, \n     similar distributions of funds for fiscal year 1996 shall not \n     be made and no grants shall be awarded for such programs \n     funded by this title of this resolution that would impinge on \n     final funding prerogatives.\n       Sec. 214. This title of this joint resolution shall be \n     implemented so that only the most limited funding action of \n     that permitted in this title of this resolution shall be \n     taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and \n     activities.\n       Sec. 215. The provisions of section 132 of the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Act, 1988, Public Law 100-202, shall \n     not apply for this title of this joint resolution.\n       Sec. 216. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title \n     of this joint resolution, except section 206, none of the \n     funds appropriated under this title of this joint resolution \n     shall be used to implement or enforce any system of \n     registration of unmarried, cohabiting couples whether they \n     are homosexual, lesbian, heterosexual, including but not \n     limited to registration for the purpose of extending \n     employment, health, or governmental benefits to such couples \n     on the same basis that such benefits are extended to legally \n     married couples; nor shall any funds made available pursuant \n     to any provision of this title of this joint resolution \n     otherwise be used to implement or enforce D.C. Act 9-188, \n     signed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia on April 15, \n     1992.\n\n                     TITLE III--VETERANS' BENEFITS\n\n       That the following sums are hereby appropriated, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and out of \n     applicable corporate or other revenues, receipts, and funds, \n     for the several departments, agencies, corporations and other \n     organizational units of Government for the fiscal year 1996, \n     and for other purposes, namely:\n\n     SEC. 301. ENSURED PAYMENT DURING FISCAL YEAR 1996 OF \n                   VETERANS' BENEFITS IN EVENT OF LACK OF \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Payments Required.--In any case during fiscal year 1996 \n     in which appropriations are not otherwise available for \n     programs, projects, and activities of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     nevertheless ensure that--\n       (1) payments of existing veterans benefits are made in \n     accordance with regular procedures and schedules and in \n     accordance with eligibility requirements for such benefits; \n     and\n       (2) payments to contractors of the Veterans Health \n     Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs are made \n     when due in the case of services provided that directly \n     relate to patient health and safety.\n       (b) Funding.--There is hereby appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary for the payments pursuant to subsection (a), \n     including such amounts as may be necessary for the costs of \n     administration of such payments.\n       (c) Charging of Accounts When Appropriations Made.--In any \n     case in which the Secretary uses the authority of subsection \n     (a) to make payments, applicable accounts shall be charged \n     for amounts so paid, and regular appropriations become \n     available for those purposes.\n       (d) Existing Benefits Specified.--For purposes of this \n     section, existing veterans benefits are benefits under laws \n     administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that have \n     been adjudicated and authorized for payment as of--\n       (1) December 15, 1995; or\n       (2) if appropriations for such benefits are available \n     (other than pursuant to subsection (b)) after December 15, \n     1995, the last day on which appropriations for payment of \n     such benefits are available (other than pursuant to \n     subsection (b)).\n       Sec. 302.

as follows:\n\n       In section 1(b)(2) of the resolution of ratification, \n     insert ``(A)'' after ``START II Treaty''.\n       In section 1(b)(2), before the period at the end, insert \n     ``, and (B) changes none of the rights of either Party with \n     respect to the provisions of the ABM Treaty, in particular, \n     Articles 13, 14, and 15''.\n       At the end of section 1(b) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new condition:\n       (7) Implementation arrangements.--(A) The START II Treaty \n     shall not be binding on the United States until such time as \n     the Duma of the Russian Federation has acted pursuant to its \n     constitutional responsibilities and the START II Treaty \n     enters into force in accordance with Article VI of the \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If the START II Treaty does not enter into force \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A), and if the President plans to \n     implement reductions of United States strategic nuclear \n     forces below those currently planned and consistent with the \n     START Treaty, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no action to reduce United States strategic \n     nuclear forces below that currently planned and consistent \n     with the START Treaty until he submits to the Senate his \n     determination that such reductions are in the national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       In section 1(c)(2) of the resolution of ratification, \n     insert ``(A)'' immediately after ``Reductions.--''.\n       At the end of section 1(c)(2), insert the following:\n       (B) Recognizing that instability could result from an \n     imbalance in the levels of strategic offensive arms, the \n     Senate calls upon the President to submit a report in \n     unclassified form to the Committees on Foreign Relations and \n     Armed Services of the Senate not later than January 31 of \n     each year beginning with January 31, 1997, and continuing \n     through such time as the reductions called for in the START \n     II Treaty are completed by both parties, which report will \n     provide--\n       (i) details on the progress of each party's reductions in \n     strategic offensive arms during the previous year;\n       (ii) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the START II Treaty or specifies \n     any act of noncompliance by the Russian Federation; and\n       (iii) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance \n     endangering the national security interests of the United \n     States exists.\n       In section 1(c)(4) of the resolution of ratification--\n       (1) strike ``the parties'' and all that follows through \n     ``national security interests'' and insert ``the President to \n     seek further strategic offensive arms reductions to the \n     extent consistent with United States national security \n     interests''; and\n       (2) strike ``it is the sense of the Senate that'' and \n     insert in ``and''.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declarations:\n       (8) Compliance.--Concerned by the clear past pattern of \n     Soviet noncompliance with arms control agreements and \n     continued cases of noncompliance by the Russian Federation, \n     the Senate declares that--\n       (A) the START II Treaty is in the interests of the United \n     States only if both the United States and the Russian \n     Federation are in strict compliance with the terms of the \n     Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification, such compliance being measured by \n     performance and not by efforts, intentions, or commitments to \n     comply;\n       (B) the Senate expects the Russian Federation to be in \n     strict compliance with its obligations under the terms of the \n     START II Treaty as presented to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification; and\n       (C) given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the Administration to offer regular briefings, but \n     not less than four times per year, to the Committees on \n     Foreign Relations and Armed Services on compliance issues \n     related to the START II Treaty. Such briefings shall include \n     a description of all U.S. efforts in U.S./Russian diplomatic \n     channels and bilateral fora to resolve the compliance issues \n     and shall include, but would not necessarily be limited to, \n     the following:\n       (i) Any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Implementation \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings;\n       (ii) Any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Implementation Commission, within thirty days of such \n     meetings; and\n       (iii) Any Presidential determination that the Russian \n     Federation is in non-compliance with or is otherwise acting \n     in a manner inconsistent with the object and purpose of the \n     START II Treaty, within thirty days of such a determination, \n     in which case the President shall also submit a written \n     report, with an unclassified summary, explaining why it is in \n     the national security interests of the United States to \n     continue as a party to the START II Treaty.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Submission of future agreements as treaties.--The \n     Senate declares that following Senate advice and consent to \n     ratification of the START II Treaty, any agreement or \n     understanding which in any material way \n\n[[Page S19264]]\n     modifies, amends, or reinterprets United States or Russian obligations \n     under the START II Treaty, including the time frame for \n     implementation of the Treaty, should be submitted to the \n     Senate for its advice and consent to ratification.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Nature of deterrence.--(A) On June 17, 1992, Presidents \n     Bush and Yeltsin issued a Joint Understanding and a Joint \n     Statement at the conclusion of their Washington Summit, the \n     first of which became the foundation for the START II Treaty. \n     The second, the Joint Statement on a Global Protection \n     System, endorsed the cooperative development of a defensive \n     system against ballistic missile attack and demonstrated the \n     belief by the governments of the United States and the \n     Russian Federation that strategic offensive reductions and \n     certain defenses against ballistic missiles are stabilizing, \n     compatible, and reinforcing.\n       (B) It is, therefore, the sense of the Senate that:\n       (i) The long-term perpetuation of deterrence based on \n     mutual and severe offensive nuclear threats would be outdated \n     in a strategic environment in which the United States and the \n     Russian Federation are seeking to put aside their past \n     adversarial relationship and instead build a relationship \n     based upon trust rather than fear.\n       (ii) An offense-only form of deterrence cannot address by \n     itself the emerging strategic environment in which, as \n     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin said in January 1994, \n     proliferators acquiring missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction ``may have acquired such weapons for the express \n     purpose of blackmail or terrorism and thus have a \n     fundamentally different calculus not amenable to deterrence. \n     . . . New deterrent approaches are needed as well as new \n     strategies should deterrence fail.''.\n       (iii) Defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail. Because deterrence may be inadequate to \n     protect United States forces and allies abroad, theater \n     missile defense is necessary, particularly the most capable \n     systems of the United States such as THAAD, Navy Upper Tier, \n     and the Space and Missile Tracking System. Similarly, because \n     deterrence may be inadequate to protect the United States \n     against long-range missile threats, missile defenses are a \n     necessary part of new deterrent strategies. Such defenses \n     also are wholly in consonance with the summit statements from \n     June 1992 of the Presidents of the United States and the \n     Russian Federation and the September 1994 statement by \n     Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, who said, ``We now \n     have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not \n     on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather on \n     another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''.\n       (iv) As the governments of the United States and Russia \n     have built upon the June 17, 1992, Joint Understanding in \n     agreeing to the START II Treaty, so too should these \n     governments promptly undertake discussions based on the Joint \n     Statement to move forward cooperatively in the development \n     and deployment of defenses against ballistic missiles.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) Report on use of foreign excess ballistic missiles for \n     launch services.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should not issue licenses for the use of a foreign \n     excess ballistic missile for launch services without first \n     submitting a report to Congress, on a one-time basis, on the \n     implications of the licensing approval on nonproliferation \n     efforts under the Treaty and on the United States space \n     launch industry.\n       At the end of section 1(c) of the resolution of \n     ratification, add the following new declaration:\n       (8) United states commitments ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.--The \n     Senate declares that the United States is committed to \n     ensuring the safety, reliability, and performance of its \n     nuclear forces. To this end, the United States undertakes the \n     following additional commitments:\n       (A) The United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining \n     nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities, that \n     will ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the \n     United States nuclear arsenal at the START II levels and meet \n     requirements for hedging against possible international \n     developments or technical problems, in conformance with \n     United States policies and to underpin deterrence.\n       (B) The United States is committed to reestablishing and \n     maintaining sufficient levels of production to support \n     requirements for the safety, reliability, and performance of \n     United States nuclear weapons and demonstrate and sustain \n     production capabilities and capacities.\n       (C) The United States is committed to maintaining United \n     States nuclear weapons laboratories and protecting the core \n     nuclear weapons competencies therein.\n       (D) As tritium is essential to the performance of modern \n     nuclear weapons, but decays radioactively at a relatively \n     rapid rate, and the United States now has no meaningful \n     tritium production capacity, the United States is committed \n     to ensuring rapid access to a new production source of \n     tritium within the next decade.\n       (E) As warhead design flaws or aging problems may occur \n     that a robust stockpile stewardship program cannot solve, the \n     United States reserves the right, consistent with United \n     States law, to resume underground nuclear testing if that is \n     necessary to maintain confidence in the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile. The United States is committed to maintaining the \n     Nevada Test Site at a level in which the United States will \n     be able to resume testing, within one year, following a \n     national decision to do so.\n       (F) The United States reserves the right to invoke the \n     supreme national interest of the United States to withdraw \n     from any future arms control agreement to limit underground \n     nuclear testing.\n\n\n                               condition\n\n       (a) Conditions.--The Senate's advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the START II Treaty is subject to the \n     following condition, which shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) Presidential certification and report on national \n     technical means.--Within ninety days after the United States \n     deposits instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, \n     the President shall certify that U.S. National Technical \n     Means are sufficient to ensure effective monitoring of \n     Russian compliance with the provisions of the Treaty \n     governing the capabilities of strategic missile systems. This \n     certification shall be accompanied by a report to the Senate \n     of the United States indicating how U.S. National Technical \n     Means, including collection, processing and analytic \n     resources, will be marshalled to ensure effective monitoring. \n     Such report may be supplemented by a classified annex, which \n     shall be submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations, the \n     Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Armed Services \n     and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19263-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19264-S19269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE VICTIM RESTITUTION ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  HATCH (AND BIDEN) AMENDMENT NO. 3112\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Hatch, for himself and Mr. Biden) proposed an \namendment to the bill (H.R. 665) to control crime by mandatory victim \nrestitution; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

If the number or identity of victims cannot be \n     reasonably ascertained, or other circumstances exist that \n     make this requirement clearly impracticable, the probation \n     service shall so inform the court.\n       ``(b) The court shall disclose to both the defendant and \n     the attorney for the Government all portions of the \n     presentence or other report pertaining to the matters \n     described in subsection (a) of this section.\n       ``(c) The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and Rule \n     32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the \n     only rules applicable to proceedings under this section.\n       ``(d)(1) Within 60 days after conviction and, in any event, \n     not later than 10 days prior to sentencing--\n       ``(A)(i) the attorney for the Government, after consulting \n     with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the \n     probation service of the court with a listing of the amounts \n     subject to restitution;\n       ``(ii) the attorney for the Government shall provide notice \n     to all identified victims, informing the victims of the \n     offenses of which the defendant was convicted, the listing of \n     amounts subject to restitution submitted to the probation \n     service, the victim's right to submit information to the \n     probation service concerning the amount of the victim's \n     losses, and the scheduled date, time, and place of the \n     sentencing hearing; and\n       ``(iii) if any victim objects to any of the information \n     provided to the probation service relating to the amount of \n     the victim's losses subject to restitution, the attorney for \n     the Government shall advise the victim that the victim may \n     file a separate affidavit and shall provide the victim with \n     an affidavit form which may be used to do so; and\n       ``(B) each defendant shall prepare and file with the \n     probation service of the court an affidavit fully describing \n     the financial resources of the defendant, including a \n     complete listing of all assets owned or controlled by the \n     defendant as of the date on which the defendant was arrested, \n     the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and \n     the defendant's dependents, and other information the court \n     requires relating to such other factors as the court deems \n     appropriate.\n       ``(2) After reviewing the report of the probation service \n     of the court, the court may require additional documentation \n     or hear testimony. The privacy of any records filed, or \n     testimony heard, pursuant to this section shall be maintained \n     to the greatest extent possible, and such records may be \n     filed or testimony heard in camera.\n       ``(3) If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the \n     date that is 10 days prior to sentencing as provided in \n     paragraph (1), the attorney for the Government shall so \n     inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the \n     final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 \n     days after sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers \n     further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery \n     of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended \n     restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a \n     showing of good cause for the failure to include such losses \n     in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.\n       ``(4) The court may refer any issue arising in connection \n     with a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate or \n     special master for proposed findings of fact and \n     recommendations as to disposition, subject to a de novo \n     determination of the issue by the court.\n       ``(e) Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of \n     restitution shall be resolved by the court by the \n     preponderance of the evidence.

The \n     burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the \n     defendant and the financial needs of the defendant and such \n     defendant's dependents shall be on the defendant. The burden \n     of demonstrating such other matters as the court deems \n     appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the court \n     as justice requires.\n       ``(f)(1)(A) In each order of restitution, the court shall \n     order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each \n     victim's losses as determined by the court and without \n     consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\n       ``(B) In no case shall the fact that a victim has received \n     or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss \n     from insurance or any other source be considered in \n     determining the amount of restitution.\n       ``(2) Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed \n     to each victim, the court shall, pursuant to section 3572, \n     specify in the restitution order the manner in which and the \n     schedule according to which the restitution is to be paid, in \n     consideration of--\n       ``(A) the financial resources and other assets of the \n     defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly \n     controlled;\n       ``(B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; \n     and\n       ``(C) any financial obligations of the defendant; including \n     obligations to dependents.\n       ``(3)(A) A restitution order may direct the defendant to \n     make a single, lump-sum payment, partial payment at specified \n     intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at \n     specified intervals and in-kind payments.\n       ``(B) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make \n     nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on \n     the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant \n     do not allow the payment of any amount of a restitution \n     order, and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of \n\n\n[[Page S19267]]\n     a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable \n     schedule of payments.\n       ``(4) An in-kind payment described in paragraph (3) may be \n     in the form of--\n       ``(A) return of property;\n       ``(B) replacement of property; or\n       ``(C) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim \n     or a person or organization other than the victim.\n       ``(g)(1) No victim shall be required to participate in any \n     phase of a restitution order.\n       ``(2) A victim may at any time assign the victim's interest \n     in restitution payments to the Crime Victims Fund in the \n     Treasury without in any way impairing the obligation of the \n     defendant to make such payments.\n       ``(h) If the court finds that more than 1 defendant has \n     contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each \n     defendant liable for payment of the full amount of \n     restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants \n     to reflect the level of contribution to the victim's loss and \n     economic circumstances of each defendant.\n       ``(i) If the court finds that more than 1 victim has \n     sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the \n     court may issue an order of priority based on the type and \n     amount of each victim's loss, accounting for the economic \n     circumstances of each victim. In any case in which the United \n     States is a victim, the court shall ensure that all \n     individual victims receive full restitution before the United \n     States receives any restitution.\n       ``(j)(1) If a victim has received or is entitled to receive \n     compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any \n     other source, the court shall order that restitution shall be \n     paid to the person who provided or is obligated to provide \n     the compensation, but the restitution order shall provide \n     that all restitution of victims required by the order be paid \n     to the victims before any restitution is paid to such a \n     provider of compensation.\n       ``(2) Any amount paid to a victim under an order of \n     restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as \n     compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in--\n       ``(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and\n       ``(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by \n     the law of the State.\n       ``(k) A restitution order shall provide that the defendant \n     shall notify the court and the Attorney General of any \n     material change in the defendant's economic circumstances \n     that might affect the defendant's ability to pay restitution. \n     The court may also accept notification of a material change \n     in the defendant's economic circumstances from the United \n     States or from the victim. The Attorney General shall certify \n     to the court that the victim or victims owed restitution by \n     the defendant have been notified of the change in \n     circumstances.

Mr. President, we are in the 7th day of a \npartial Government shutdown. The President is playing politics with \nthis issue and he should stop it. He is trying to blame Congress for \nhis failure to sign the legislation which would have averted this \ncrisis. In addition, he is trying to divide the House freshmen and the \nHouse Republican leadership. And, he is trying to divide House and \nSenate Republicans. Such desperate tactics on his part are doomed to \nfail.\n  Yesterday, in a demonstration of solidarity, House Republicans--\nconservatives and moderates alike--told the Nation that the President's \npolitics of division wouldn't work, that they remained united in our \nstruggle against President Clinton's efforts to undermine a balanced \nbudget agreement. More importantly, they rightly pointed the finger of \nblame for the partial Government shutdown directly at the White House.\n  Congress has sent three spending bills to the President which would \nhave kept open the Departments of Veterans Affairs, HUD, Commerce, \nJustice, State, and Interior. What did President Clinton do? He vetoed \nall of these bills, and in so doing delayed benefits checks to our \nNation's veterans. He had the power to prevent the shutdown of these \nagencies and to keep Federal workers on the job. Instead, with the \nstroke of a pen he sent thousands of Federal workers home during this \nholiday season.\n  The Congress did its job and passed appropriations bills which \nresponsibly reduced Government spending and which would have kept \nagencies open. But, President Clinton wasn't interested in that. He was \nlooking for a photo opportunity. He vetoed funding bills and closed \ndown parts of the Government. He should be and will be held accountable \nfor this shutdown.\n  Furthermore, workers at the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education \ncould be at the desks today if the Democrats would end the filibuster \nwhich they began in September.\n  When you look at the Government shutdown, the facts simply don't \nsupport the President's extremist rhetoric. In reality, this crisis has \nbeen engineered by the President to bolster his reelection campaign. \nAfter being viewed as irrelevant for so long, the President has now \nidentified himself with something he believes in passionately. He is \npassionate about spending--deficit spending. He is passionate about \npreserving the status quo which heaps trillions of dollars of debt on \nour children and grandchildren.\n  I hope that he will abandon his harsh scare tactics and get serious \nabout balancing the budget. It was not until just a few days ago that \nhe agreed to finally offer a balanced budget plan using honest numbers. \nHe finally abandoned his preferred strategy of cooking the books as a \nway to balance the budget. Such policies won't lead to a balanced \nbudget. They never have and they never will. President Clinton had \nchosen the path of certain failure. Congress rightly did not follow him \ndown that dead-end road.\n  Although Congress has already passed legislation once to provide for \nveterans benefits, we have an opportunity today to overturn the \nPresident's action which cut off these funds. The men and women who \nhave served our Nation in the armed services should not be used as a \nbargaining chip in this budget struggle between Congress and the \nPresident. I support the immediate restoration of funds for veteran \nbenefits, and I hope that we will pass such legislation today.\n  Finally, I call upon the President to give America a Christmas \npresent in the form of a balanced budget and a working Government. I \ncall upon him to sign the funding bills which he has rejected, and I \ncall upon him to help end the Democratic filibuster of the Labor, HHS \nappropriations bill. If the President wanted--all of this could be done \nbefore Christmas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19270-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join with my esteemed colleague \nfrom Texas Senator Gramm, to introduce this bill for Medicare \nreimbursement to the Department of Defense [DOD] for care provided in \nour military medical treatment facilities to Medicare eligible \nbeneficiaries. When these dedicated men and women made a commitment to \na career of service in the Armed Forces, a promise was made to them \nthat upon retirement they and their family members would continue to \nreceive health care for life in our superb Military Health Services \nSystem [MHSS]--if they so chose. In fact, approximately 230,000 of the \n1.2 million Medicare eligible retirees currently do choose to get their \nhealth care at military treatment facilities. Regrettably, as the \nmilitary downsizes and Defense health budgets are cut, without Medicare \nreimbursement, the MHSS will no longer be able to provide health care \nfor these retirees. Many of these retired servicemembers and their \nfamilies made career-long sacrifices based in part on the expectation \nthat they would have guaranteed health care. I believe it is important \nthat our Nation continue its firm commitment and honor the promises \nmade to those individuals and their families.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides an additional benefit to the \nNation--more cost effective health care for this population. If the \nMHSS can no longer provide their health care, 230,000 more retirees who \nare already Medicare eligible will be forced into the Medicare system--\nat a substantially higher cost than that for DOD reimbursement. As a \ntaxpayer, this just makes good business sense.\n  Mr. President, these dedicated servicemembers kept their promise to \nour nation and now I believe it is right that the Nation keep its \npromise to them. This bill will enable the MHSS to continue to provide \nhealth care services to Medicare eligible retirees and their families \nas promised for those who choose to receive their care in our military \nfacilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19270-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19270-S19271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE AU PAIR PROGRAM\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, my \noffice has received many telephone calls from concerned Minnesotans \nregarding the partial shutdown of the Federal Government and the lack \nof funding which has resulted for the program which brings nannies from \nforeign countries into America.\n  Nannies have been coming to the United States through the Au Pair \nprogram, a cultural exchange program run by the United States \nInformation Agency (USIA) which oversees the matching of young people \nfrom abroad with American families in need of live-in babysitters.\n  Approximately 13,000 young adults have participated in this program \nover the years and 10,000 American families have benefitted from the \nhelping hands these visiting babysitters provide. They are paid a \nweekly salary of $115 plus room and board for their services.\n  When its appropriations expired at the end of the last fiscal year on \nSeptember 30, the entire Au Pair program was put into limbo until it \ncould be funded again. It had been included in three separate \nappropriations bills, but each has failed to become law due to \nobjections over issues unrelated to the Au Pair program. On December \n11, Senator Helms recognized the pressing nature of the situation and \nintroduced S. 1465, legislation funding and extending the Au Pair \nprogram for 2 years. The bill passed the Senate on December 13 and a \nrelated measure was introduced in the House that same day.

Mr. President, the crime news is good and bad.\n  The good news is that murders in the United States were down 12 \npercent for the first 6 months of 1995, and the FBI reports an \nastounding and welcome drop.\n  The bad news is that drug and alcohol use among our Nation's eighth \ngraders is on the rise, and because of that, as they grow older the \ncrime rate probably will rise again.\n  Adding to this likelihood are the numbers. There are more eighth \ngraders than their counterparts 4 years older, and as the numbers grow, \nwe will probably have more, not less, bad news. Ten years from now \nthere will be 25 percent more young males between the ages of 14 and \n17.\n  What can be done?\n  There are no magic bullets, but there are some things that will help. \nThey include:\n  Get treatment and counseling for adult drug and alcohol addicts.\n  Children of addicts are much more likely to be addicts. Illinois is \nlike most States: people who want help often cannot get it. Considering \nthe extent of our problem, we are woefully short on treatment \nfacilities. Rev. George Clements, a quietly dynamic Roman Catholic \npriest, has suggested that all churches and synagogues and mosques \nshould adopt one addict. That's not as easy as fixing the church roof \nor serving as usher or singing in the choir. But it is a greater test \nof the meaningfulness of faith. The most effective way to reach \nchildren is through a parent.\n  Discourage youthful cigarette smoking.\n  Young people who smoke cigarettes are much more likely to take up \ndrugs and alcohol.\n  Enrich education programs so that they reach all young people.\n  Those who have great difficulty in school are more likely to give up, \nto see little future for themselves and reach out for the escape \nmechanism of drugs or alcohol. That is why budget cuts that reduce \naccess to Head Start and other education programs are short-sighted. By \nthe second grade--at the latest--teachers know which students need \nspecial help. They should receive it then, not wait until they make it \nthrough high school--if they make it through high school.\n\n  Start jobs programs that put people of limited skills to work. Show \nme an area of high unemployment, and I will show you an area of high \ncrime, whether it is African-American, Hispanic, or white. Show me an \narea of high unemployment, and I will show you an area with a high drug \nuse rate and high alcoholism, whether it is African-American, Hispanic, \nor white.\n  Real welfare reform must include jobs. Without a jobs factor, \nanything called welfare reform is political public relations. We need \nsomething like the WPA of a half-century ago. It would be the most \neffective anti-crime and anti-addition program we could have.\n  Keep parents from giving up.\n  That's not a Government program, but it is vital. A parent living in \na tough neighborhood with drug sales visible in the area has a \ndifficult time, but must strive to give her--or his--child hope. And do \nsimple things like encouraging homework, use of the library, and \ncareful use of television.\n  And attending religious services.\n  Harvard University's Richard Freeman found that ``among black urban \nyouth, church attendance was a better predictor of who would escape \ndrugs, crime and poverty than any other variable, income, family \nstructure, and the church-going youth were more likely to behave in \nsocially constructive ways.''\n  Yes, there are some discouraging signals for the future, but if we \nare really concerned, and then act, the future will be brighter.\n  None of these items I have listed is dramatic, yet if we were to act \non all of them, there would be a significant change for the better in \nour future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19271-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19271-S19272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AWARD PRESENTED TO ARTHUR S. FLEMMING\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President. I want to share with my \ncolleagues the remarks made by William L. Taylor in presenting to Dr. \nArthur S. Flemming the American Civil Liberties Union's Human Rights \nAward. These thoughtful remarks outline the career of a man who truly \nrepresents the highest ideal of public service.\n  Antoinette and I have enjoyed a warm personal friendship with Dr. \nFlemming and his wife Bernice for many years. In addition to the number \nof significant Federal posts held by Dr. Flemming, he served for a time \nas the president of the University of Oregon. As someone who has \nfollowed Dr. Flemming's professional and personal life with interest \nand respect, I can say that no one is more deserving of the ACLU's \nHuman Rights Award than Dr. Flemming, as Mr. Taylor's fine remarks make \namply clear.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Taylor's remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n  Remarks of William L. Taylor in Presenting the ACLU's Human Rights \nAward to Arthur S. Flemming at the Annual Dinner of the Virginia ACLU, \n                            December 9, 1995\n\n       The American Civil Liberties Union does itself honor by \n     honoring Arthur Flemming and it does me a great honor by \n     asking me to introduce Arthur.\n       Arthur is, in my view, the greatest exemplar of public \n     service in this nation in the 20th Century. He served in the \n     federal government over a period of more than 40 years \n     beginning in 1939 as an appointee to the Civil Service \n     Commission of President Roosevelt and ending in the early \n     1980s when he was Deputy Chair of the White House Conference \n     on Aging, a member of the Commission on Wartime Relocation \n     and Internment of Civilians and Chairman of the U.S. \n     Commission on Civil Rights, a post from which he was fired by \n     President Reagan because Arthur believed in civil rights. But \n     after these 40 plus years--and at the age of 77, Arthur began \n     a new career serving the public in the private sector by \n     heading coalitions and groups that work for the goals Arthur \n     is most deeply committed to--preserving Social Security, \n     extending health care to all and advancing the civil rights \n     of all persons.\n       But it is not simply his longevity in public service that \n     makes Arthur Flemming's career remarkable. (although I cannot \n     refrain from noting that Arthur was born in 1905, 15 years \n     before the ACLU was founded--so they have been advocates for \n     justice for about the same period of time). It is also the \n     quality of his service that makes him a long distance runner. \n     Everybody who knows Arthur has his own story about Arthur's \n     readiness to travel whenever he hears the call (I can \n     remember in 1988 getting a call from an editor of the Yale \n     Law Journal who said he wanted to extend an invitation to \n     Arthur to speak at a symposium on the 20th Anniversary of the \n     Fair Housing Act. He called me because he wondered whether \n     Dr. Flemming would be able to make the trip to New Haven. At \n     the time I got this call, Arthur was preparing to travel, I \n     think to 28 cities in 30 days to speak on behalf of the \n     Republicans for Dukakis). But what is more impressive than \n     Arthur's seeming inability to stay away from airports is the \n     reason he travels. Other people of renown travel \n     to participate or be seen at international conferences, to \n     go to dinners with other famous people. Arthur travels to \n     attend meetings and rallys where he will have the \n     opportunity to communicate with everyday people on the \n     issues he most cares about--health care, civil rights and \n     civil liberties and other issues that affect the dignity \n     and well being of the American people.\n       And he is ready and willing to do the work in the trenches \n     that other people may spurn once they reach a certain \n     position. I remember in the 1980s going with him to a meeting \n     of State civil rights officers where he had been asked to \n     listen to the whole day's proceedings and then give a \n     summation. By mid-afternoon, as the sessions went on (and on) \n     most of us were flagging, but Arthur was still paying rapt \n     attention. At 5:30, Arthur gave not only a fine analytical \n     summary of what people had said--but he delivered an \n     inspirational speech, rallying the troops to keep the faith \n     during the hard times of the 80s.\n       And that talk was characteristic of so many I have heard \n     Arthur give during the years we have worked together at the \n     CCR. As Elliot Richardson has observed, Arthur speaks with \n     ``simplicity, force and deep conviction.'' He has, I might \n     add, the gift that all of the great advocates I have known \n     have--an ability to understand complex matters and then \n     reduce them to their essentials so that people will \n     understand what is at stake. And despite many years in \n     Washington, he has never become so jaded as to lose the \n     capacity to be angered at injustice. So, for example, when \n     the Reagan Administration pursued its policy of denying \n     people welfare benefits without affording them due process \n     and then ignored court orders to rectify the situation except \n     in the jurisdiction \n\n[[Page S19272]]\n     where they were issued--Arthur led the charge to expose and change this \n     heartless policy.\n       My time is growing short and I have barely scratched the \n     surface. But I could not close without mentioning Arthur's \n     contribution to other institutions that are fundamental to \n     the values and aspirations of the nation. In between his \n     periods of government service, Arthur was President of three \n     universities--Ohio Wesleyan (his alma mater), The University \n     of Oregon and Macalester College. In these posts among many \n     other things he promoted public service and helped extend \n     opportunity for minority students. Arthur's service is also \n     rooted in his religious convictions which he has made \n     manifest through work in the United Methodist Church and the \n     National Conference of Christians and Jews.\n       As for the institution of the family, Arthur and Bernice, \n     his wife of 60+ years, have raised a family of 5 children, \n     who have made contributions of their own--although you may \n     not be surprised to hear (after what I've said) that in this \n     area there are those who believe that the lion's share of the \n     credit belongs to Bernice.\n       So, for all these reasons and many more, Arthur has earned \n     the title bestowed on him by Bernice in her affectionate and \n     occasionally irreverent memoir--``Crusader At Large''. His \n     indominatable spirit and his unflagging optimism should serve \n     as an inspiration to all of us who think we may be suffering \n     burnout in these meanspirited times. Arthur has richly earned \n     this honor by the ACLU and the admiration of all who care \n     about social justice.\n\n          COMPLIMENTING THE POSTAL SERVICE ON A JOB WELL DONE\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in these days of budget crisis and \nheated rhetoric, it is very easy to become cynical or disillusioned \nabout government. In fact, some people around here would have you \nbelieve that the Government is simply incapable of playing a positive \nrole of any kind.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted to rise today and recognize one \nGovernment entity, the U.S. Postal Service, for the good work it is \ndoing for Americans.\n  Earlier this month, the State of Oregon completed the primary phase \nof the Nation's first mail-in congressional election. That's right, \nover a 3-week period, Oregon voters mailed in their ballots for the \nState's open Senate seat.\n  While vote-by-mail has its skeptics, the results in Oregon were \nimpressive. Some 52 percent of Oregon voters cast their ballots, as \ncompared to the 43 percent who took part in last year's primaries. On \nJanuary 30, the general election will also be conducted through the \nmail system.\n  Mr. President, whether or not vote-by-mail is the wave of the future, \nwe should certainly commend the Postal Service for its critical role in \nthis effort. The hard-working men and women of the Postal Service in \nOregon saw to it that the ballots were delivered and returned on time. \nWithout a postal system that could be counted on, neither Oregon nor \nany other State could even experiment with a mail-in election.\n  Oregon is not the only place where the Postal Service is getting the \njob done for Americans. Right now, millions of Christmas cards and \npackages are moving through the Nation's mail system. Believe it or \nnot, Postal Service officials are estimating that today, as many as 725 \nmillion pieces of mail will be delivered. This is the delivery volume \nfor just 1 day.\n  While these numbers may sound overwhelming, the men and women of the \nPostal Service are up to the challenge. As the latest on-time \nstatistics confirm, the vast majority of Americans can drop that card \nor letter in the box and be confident that their mailing will be \ndelivered on time. In fact, just yesterday, the Postal Service \nannounced that its on-time delivery scores had reached a record high of \n88 percent.\n  Mr. President, the Postal Service, like any organization, has its \nproblems. In the past, I have been critical of both its performance and \nmanagement decisions. But, I have never had cause to question the \ndedication of its people. From the Postmaster General on down, the men \nand women of the Postal Service are getting the job done during this \nChristmas season. They are a welcome reminder that government can work \nfor America.\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. \n1260, the Public Housing Reform and Empowerment Act of 1995. S. 1260 \nrepresents a major revision of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to \nreform and consolidate the public and assisted housing programs of the \nUnited States and redirect primary responsibility for those programs \naway from Federal bureaucracy toward the States and localities. This \nbill represents an important first step towards a complete overhaul of \nFederal housing programs to address the needs of low-income families \nmore efficiently and effectively.\n  This legislation addresses a growing crisis in the Nation's public \nhousing system. Over the years, micromanagement by both Congress and \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] have saddled \nhousing authorities with rules and regulations that make it difficult \nfor even the best of them to operate efficiently and effectively. Even \nmore important has been the destructive impact these rules have had on \nthe ability of families to move up and out of public housing and become \neconomically self-sufficient. In far too many places, public housing, \nwhich was intended to provide a housing platform from which lower \nincome families could achieve their own aspirations of economic \nindependence, have become warehouses of poverty that rob poor families \nof their hope and dignity.\n  Compounding the structural problems of public housing are the dual \nconcerns of budget and HUD capacity. Public housing agencies are facing \na significant decline in Federal resources. Given these limited \nresources, housing authorities need the increased flexibility to use \ntheir funds in a manner that helps to maintain decent, safe and \naffordable housing for their residents. In addition, HUD itself \npotentially faces a significant reduction in overall staffing over the \nnext 5 years. The prospect of diminishing staff resources means that \nHUD will lack the capacity to maintain the same degree of oversight and \ncontrol that it has exercised over the public housing system in recent \ndecades.\n  S. 1260 addresses the crisis in public housing by consolidating \npublic housing funding into two flexible block grants and transferring \ngreater responsibility over the operation and management of public \nhousing from HUD to local housing agencies. In addition, it creates a \nnew streamlined voucher program that is more market-friendly and \nprovides greater housing choices for low-income families.\n  The bill also ends Federal requirements that have prevented housing \nauthorities from demolishing their obsolete housing stock, \nconcentrated, and isolated the poorest of poor, and created \ndisincentives for public housing residents to work and improve their \nlives.\n  While allowing well-run housing authorities much more discretion, S. \n1260 also cracks down on those housing authorities that are troubled. \nAlthough small in number, these authorities with severe management \nproblems control almost 15 percent of the Nation's public housing \nstock. HUD would be required to take over or appoint a receiver for \nhousing authorities that are unable to make significant improvements in \ntheir operations. The legislation would also give HUD expanded powers \nto break up or reconfigure troubled authorities, dispose of their \nassets, or abrogate contracts that impede correction of the housing \nauthority's problems.\n  I would like to express my deep appreciation to Senators D'Amato and \nBond, who cosponsored this bill, for their keen interest and active \nsupport of this legislation. I also wish to express my appreciation for \nthe cooperation and support from Senators Sarbanes and Kerry. This bill \ntruly reflects bipartisan cooperation, and it specifically addresses \nmany of the concerns that have been raised by minority. Finally, I also \nwant to thank Secretary Cisneros for HUD's participation in the \ndevelopment of this bill. We have endeavored to accommodate the \nDepartment's concerns to the greatest extent possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19271-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19272-S19273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RETIREMENT OF BILL NORWOOD FROM UNITED AIRLINES\n\n Mr. SIMON.

As reported by the Judiciary Committee, and amended by the \nmanagers' substitute offered by myself and Senator Biden, this bill \nwill fill a tremendous gap in our criminal justice system. This \nlegislation represents an important step toward a criminal justice \nsystem in which the rights and needs of the victim are respected.\n  This legislation has a long history. Congress first enacted a general \nFederal victim restitution statute in 1982 as a part of the Victim and \nWitness Protection Act (Public Law 97-291). The 1982 act sought to \nremedy the unfortunate situation noted even then by the Judiciary \nCommittee that:\n\n       . . . restitution . . . lost its priority status in the \n     sentencing procedures of our federal courts long ago. As a \n     matter of practice, [restitution] is infrequently used and \n     indifferently enforced.\n\n  The 1982 act provided, for the first time, Federal courts with the \nauthority to order payments of restitution independently of a sentence \nof probation, and required the court to state its reasons for the \nrecord in instances in which restitution was not ordered.\n  The legislation enacted in 1982 has been the subject of modest \namendments in the years since, but remains substantially intact as \nenacted 13 years ago. Unfortunately, however, while strides have been \nmade since 1982 towards a greater respect for victims in the criminal \njustice system, much progress remains to be made in the area of victim \nrestitution. According to the 1994 Annual Report of the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission, during Fiscal Year 1994, Federal courts ordered restitution \nin only 20.2 percent of criminal cases. Data from the same report show \nthat restitution was ordered in only 27.9 percent of all murders, 28.2 \npercent of all kidnappings, 55.2 percent of all robberies, and 12.5 \npercent of all sexual abuses cases. That is simply not enough. It is \njust as important for a victim of violent crime to receive recompense \nfor her injuries as it is for a victim of property crime to have the \nproperty returned, or otherwise paid for. Restitution, as a concept of \njustice, extends far beyond the mere return of property.\n  Language substantially similar to H.R. 665 has passed the Senate on \nthree previous occasions. However, this language was never approved in \nlegislation presented to the President.\n\n  In 1994, Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act. That act \nincluded provisions requiring mandatory restitution in Federal cases to \nvictims of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and other abuse of \nchildren, and domestic violence.\n  The 1994 Crime Act also made restitution mandatory for victims of \ntelemarketing fraud, a provision I strongly supported as the chief \nauthor of the Senior Citizens Against Marketing Scams [SCAMS] Act. It \nis time now, however, to extend this important protection to victims of \nother crimes as well.\n  Far too often our criminal justice system appears to ignore the \nvictims of crime. It frequently seems that only criminals have rights \nin the system. Victims often seem to be marginalized once the criminal \njustice system shifts into gear. As a result, crime victims \n\n[[Page S19278]]\n\noften feel victimized twice--once by the criminal and then again by the \nsystem that seems to ignore their plight. Restitution to the victims of \ncrime is a critical component of the justice system. The order of \nrestitution represents the justice system's recognition that a real \nperson, not only society, has suffered a wrong. Too often lost in the \nmix is the fact that, when the United States brings a criminal \nprosecution, while it does so on behalf of all the people, there is \nfrequently a single person who has been victimized. While it is true \nthat society as a whole is aggrieved by any criminal act, it is not \nsociety that must cope with the most immediate costs--the burden of \nfear, the loss of a loved one, or the anguish of personal loss. These \nburdens are reserved to the victims and survivors of crime.\n  Restitution, moreover, can provide important closure to victims of \ncrime, even if it cannot turn back the clock and undo the loss itself. \nMany crime victims have told me that until the criminal is directed to \npay restitution, the wound of the crime is not completely healed.\n  Restitution has an important penalogical function as well, providing \na necessary reminder to the offender of the human consequences of his \nor her criminl act. Critics charge that most criminal defendants are \ntoo poor to pay restitution. But even if only a few dollars a month are \ncollectd, it forces the criminal to contemplate his criminal act and \ntruly pay for the crime.\n  As I have noted, the U.S. Sentencing Commission has reported that \njudges ordered restitution in only a small percent of Federal criminal \ncases during fiscal year 1994. This legislation addresses this problem \nwith solid victim restitution reform. For the first time, it will be \nmandatory that identifiable victims of violent crimes, property and \nfraud crimes under title 18, and product tampering receive full \nrestitution for their losses.\n  We nevertheless recognize and wish to avoid the danger that in \ncomplex cases the sentencing process could turn into a mini-civil \ntrial. For this reason, the legislation permits the court to decline to \norder restitution if the number of identifiable victims is so large as \nto make restitution impracticable, or if the determination of complex \nfactual issues would place burdens on the sentencing process that far \noutweigh the need for restitution.\n  This bill also recognizes the need of victims to have full \nrestitution ordered despite the sad fact that the defendant will often \nbe unable to make more than nominal payments. Our legislation gives the \ncourts the flexibility to order nominl installment payments in these \ninstances.\n  At the same time, we cannot ignore the costs that making orders of \nrestitution mandatory in all Federal criminal cases could impose on the \njudicial cases could impose on the judicial system. We have attempted \nto strike a balance in this legislation, and I believe we have largely \nsucceeded.\n  Our bill also provides one set of procedures for the issuance and \nenforcement of a restitution order under title 18. A single section of \ntitle 18, section 3664, will govern the issuance of all criminal victim \nrestitution orders, including those we enacted last year in the \nViolence Against Women Act and the SCAMS Act. I want to emphasize that \nthe scope of restitution orders authorized under those laws remains \nunchanged. We simply seek to reduce the burden caused by incompatible \nrestitution systems.\n  The bill will also utilize existing provisions for the collection of \nfines to enforce restitution orders. Moreover, it will improve our \nability to actually collect both restitution and fines by strengthening \ntools such as the revocation of probation, resentencing and other \nsanctions.\n  Finally, the bill strengthens victims assistance programs by \nincluding provisions that have already passed the Senate as a part of \nthe terrorism bill. A provision originally authored by Senator Leahy \nauthorizes victim's assistance to victims of terrorism and makes other \nimprovements to the Crime Victims Fund. Our bill seeks to enhance the \nresources available for victims assistance by including a McCain \namendment to the terrorism bill that doubles the special assessments on \npersons convicted in Federal cases.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my particular appreciation to \nSenator Biden, Senator Nickles, Senator McCain, and Senator Grassley \nfor their able assistance in crafting this important bill.\n  This bill is not perfect. All of us recognize that there is much we \nneed to do to streamline the collection of criminal debts, including \nrestitution. Nor is this the last step we need to take to restore the \nvictim to their rightful place in the criminal justice system. However, \nit is an important step. When enacted, our legislation will do much to \nrestore respect for the victims of crime and to recognize their loss. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the measures in last year's crime \nlaw that I am most proud of is the provision mandating restitution for \nvictims of sexual abuse and child abuse. This was part of the larger \npiece of legislation closest to my heart: The Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  The mandatory restitution provisions in that act sent out a strong \nand unequivocal message: we stand with the victims of family violence \nand sexual assault, and we will not stand for them being ignored by our \ncriminal justice system any longer.\n  Today, we are considering similar provisions to provide mandatory \nrestitution for all crime victims.\n  As we fight to make our neighborhoods safe and our communities \nsecure, we must not forget the often faceless and voiceless statistics \nof crime--its victims.\n  Millions of Americans each year must bear the unbearable--in 1993 \nalone, over 35 million people were victimized by crime in this country.\n  For many victims, the crime only marks the beginning of the ordeal--\nthere is the investigation, maybe a plea bargain, a trial that often \nputs the victim's truth and character on the stand, busy prosecutors, \naggressive defense lawyers, harried court officers.\n  And in the end, even if the defendant is convicted, the victim's \nlosses--emotional, physical, and financial losses--often go completely \nuncompensated.\n  It hasn't always been this way. During the colonial period, victims \nplayed a central role in our criminal justice system.\n  They apprehended their own wrongdoers--either by making the arrests \nthemselves or by hiring the local sheriff--and they hired their own \nlawyers to prosecute their cases.\n  In those days, victims were allowed to collect damages from \ncriminals, bind them into servitude, or pay the State to incarcerate \nthose who had wronged them.\n  In the 19th century, our concept of criminal offenses began to \nchange. Primarily to ensure that all citizens were protected--not just \nthe rich who could afford to hire the marshal--the State became the \nsurrogate for the victim, and undertook the prosecution of the crime.\n  What was once seen as a private dispute--the violation of one person \nby another--came to be seen as a crime against the State. Restitution \ngave way to incarceration as the chief form of punishment--and fines \nwere exacted by the State and paid to the State.\n  But this evolution in our thinking about crime gradually led to a de-\nevolution in our concern for victims. Compassion and humanity dictate \nthat we now try to restore to victims the rights, the respect, and the \nprotection that they deserve.\n  In this spirit, Congress enacted the Victim and Witness Protection \nAct, which, among other provisions, gave courts the discretion to \nprovide restitution to victims. I was also proud to coauthor the \nVictims of Crime Act in 1984, which established a crime victims fund \nfinanced by fines levied against convicted Federal criminals.\n  The Crime Victims Fund pays compensation to specific victims when the \ncriminal can't pay--and it also underwrites general victims assistance \nprograms, like courtroom victim advocates, and victims' counselors.\n  Still, however, there is much to be done. And this bill--which makes \nrestitution mandatory in Federal criminal cases--does something very \nimportant.\n  It says to victims: You are not alone. We will demand accountability \nfrom your wrongdoers, and we understand that criminals owe a debt not \nonly to society but to you.\n  This bill also sends an important message to criminals--you must \ntake  \n\n[[Page S19279]]\n\nresponsibility for our actions, and you will pay for the pain you have \ncaused.\n  Our Constitution is not a zero sum game. We do not diminish the \nrights of defendants by recognizing and defending the rights of \nvictims.\n  I defend the rights of criminal defendants because I am deeply \nconcerned about the rights of all Americans. And for that same reason, \nI defend the rights of victims--there is no contradiction, in my mind, \nbetween the two.\n  In our efforts to crack down on crime, we must never forget its \nvictims. And we must do all in our power to help, in what little way we \ncan, to ease their suffering.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill with Senator Hatch and I urge all \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the bomb exploded outside the Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City earlier this year, my thoughts and \nprayers, and I suspect that those of all Americans, turned immediately \nto the victims of this horrendous act. It is my hope that through this \nlegislation we will proceed to enact a series of improvements in our \ngrowing body of law recognizing the rights and needs of victims of \ncrime. We can do more to see that victims of crime, including \nterrorism, are treated with dignity and assisted and compensated with \nGovernment help.\n  Section 202 of the manager's substitute incorporates the Victims of \nTerrorism Act, which will accomplish a number of worthwhile objectives. \nI introduced these measures last June as an amendment to antiterrorism \nlegislation, they were previously adopted by the Senate as part of that \nlegislation, and most recently were adopted by the Judiciary Committee \nas section 112 of the committee-passed bill.\n  They include a proposal to increase the availability of assistance to \nvictims of terrorism and mass violence here at home. We in this country \nhave been shielded from much of the terrorism perpetrated abroad. That \nsense of security has been shaken by the bombing in Oklahoma City, the \ndestruction at the World Trade Center in New York, and recent assaults \nupon the White House. I, therefore, proposed that we allow additional \nflexibility in targeting resources to victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence and the trauma and devastation that they cause.\n  Thus, the manager's substitute includes provisions to make funds \navailable through supplemental grants to the States to assist and \ncompensate our neighbors who are victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence, which incidents might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a \nState's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance \nservices. I understand, for example, that assistance efforts to aid \nthose who were the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing are now $1 \nmillion in debt. These provisions should help.\n  The substitute will also fill a gap in our law for residents of the \nUnited States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur \noutside the borders of the United States. Those who are not in the \nmilitary, civil service or civilians in the service of the United \nStates are not eligible for benefits in accordance with the Omnibus \nDiplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. One of the \ncontinuing tragedies of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over \nLockerbie, Scotland, is that the United States Government had no \nauthority to provide assistance or compensation to the victims of that \nheinous crime. Likewise, the U.S. victims of the Achille Lauro incident \ncould not be given aid. This was wrong and should be remedied.\n  In its report to Congress in 1994, the Office for Victims of Crime at \nthe U.S. Department of Justice identified the problem. Both the ABA and \nthe State Department have commented on their concern and their desire \nthat crime victims compensation benefits be provided to U.S. citizens \nvictimized in other countries. This substitute is an important step in \nthat direction. Certainly U.S. victims of terrorism overseas are \ndeserving of our support and assistance.\n  In addition, I believe that we must allow a greater measure of \nflexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and \nsome greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to \nvictims programming will not wax and wane with events. Accordingly, the \nsubstitute includes an important provision to increase the base amounts \nfor States' victims assistance grants to $500,000 and allows victims \nassistance grants to be made for a 3-year cycle of programming, rather \nthan the year of award plus one, which is the limit contained in \ncurrent law. This programming change reflects the recommendation of the \nOffice for Victims of Crime contained in its June 1994 report to \nCongress.\n  I am disappointed that some have objected to an important improvement \nthat would have allowed any unspent grant funds to be returned to the \nCrime Victims Fund from which they came and reallocated to crime \nvictims assistance programs. I believe that we ought to treat the Crime \nVictims Fund and the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund and Violence \nAgainst Women Act funds with respect and use them for the important \npurposes for which they were created.\n  The Crime Victims Fund, for example, is not a matter of appropriation \nand is not funded through tax dollars. Rather, it is funded exclusively \nthrough the assessments against those convicted of Federal crimes. The \nCrime Victims Fund is a mechanism to direct use of those funds to \ncompensate and assist crime victims. That is the express purpose and \njustification for the assessments.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate for those funds to be used \nfor crime victims and, when not expended for purposes of a crime \nvictims program, they ought to be returned to the Crime Victims Fund \nfor reobligation. Instead, because of a technicality in the application \nof the Budget Act, the manager's amendment includes a change from the \nlanguage that I proposed and that was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee and previously by the Senate. My language would have returned \nall unspent crime victims grant funds to the Crime Victims Fund. The \nmanager's amendment will require that some of the money that came from \nthe Crime Victims Fund go, instead, to the General Treasury if it \nremains unobligated more than 2 years after the year of grant award. I \nam pleased that we have been able to obtain some concession in this \nregard and note that the unobligated funds must exceed $500,000 in \norder to revert to the General Treasury.\n  Fortunately, the Office for Victims of Crime has improved its \nadministration of crime victims funds and that of the States over the \npast 2 years to a great extent. While more than $1 million a year has \nin past years remained unobligated from grants made through the States \nacross the country, last year that number was reduced below $125,000. \nThe Director of the Office for Victims of Crime, Aileen Adams, should \nbe commended for this improvement. It is my hope that the \nadministration of Crime Victims Fund grants will continue to improve \nthrough the Department of Justice and the States and that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services will, likewise, improve its \noversight and grant administration and encourage the States to be more \nvigilant so that the change in the language of the bill from that \npreviously adopted by the Senate and by the Judiciary Committee will \nnot result in a significant diversion of Crime Victims Fund money to \nother uses.\n  Our State and local communities and community-based nonprofits cannot \nbe kept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement \nvictims assistance and compensation programs. They need to be able to \nplan and have a sense of stability if these measures are to achieve \ntheir fullest potential.\n  I know, for instance, that in Vermont Lori Hayes at the Vermont \nCenter for Crime Victims Services, Judy Rex at the Vermont Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse, and many others provide \ntremendous service under difficult conditions. They will be able to put \nincreased annual assistance grants to good use. Such dedicated \nindividuals and organizations will also be aided by increasing their \nprogramming cycle by even 1 year. Three years has been a standard that \nhas worked well in other programming settings. Crime victims' \nprogramming deserves no less security.\n  In 1984 when we established the Crime Victims Fund to provide Federal \nassistance to State and local victims compensation and assistance \nefforts, \n\n[[Page S19280]]\nwe funded it with fines and penalties from those convicted of Federal \ncrime. The level of required contribution was set low. Ten years have \npassed and it is time to raise that level of assessment in order to \nfund the needs of crime victims. Accordingly, the manager's substitute \nincludes as section 109 and the committee-passed bill included as \nsection 110 a provision that I worked on with Senator McCain and that \nthe Senate previously passed as an amendment to the antiterrorism bill \nthis past summer. It doubles the special assessments levied under the \nVictims of Crime Act against those convicted of federal felonies in \norder to assist all victims of crime.\n  I do not think that $100 to assist crime victims is too much for \nthose individuals convicted of a Federal felony to contribute to help \ncrime victims. I do not think that $400 is too much to insist that \ncorporations convicted of a Federal felony contribute. Accordingly, the \nCommittee substitute would raise these to be the minimum level of \nassessment against those convicted of crime.\n  While we have made progress over the last 15 years in recognizing \ncrime victims' rights and providing much-needed assistance, we still \nhave more to do. I am proud to have played a role in passage of the \nVictims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the victims \nprovisions included in such measures as the Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994. I look forward to prompt consideration by \nthe House of these provisions for aiding crime victims and to enactment \nof the Victims of Terrorism Act.\n  I continue to have some concern that the mandatory restitution \nprovisions of the bill, while improved in our Committee deliberation, \nmay not lead to the benefits to crime victims that we intended. I note, \nas well, that changes from the Committee-passed bill made by the \nmanager's substitute have not been fully explained.\n  We run a significant risk, in my view, that resources will be \ndiverted from programs that have been proven effective in providing \ncompensation and assistance to crime victims. I believe that the study \nand report required of the Attorney General and Administrative Office \nof the United States Courts by section 204 of the Manager's substitute \nis extremely important and urge them to report as soon as possible.\n  I also urge the Attorney General to approach the responsibilities \nimposed by section 201(a)(2) of the manager's substitute carefully so \nas not unnecessarily to burden State agencies and those entrusted with \nthe important responsibility for administering crime victims \ncompensation programs.\n  I thank the outstanding crime victims advocates from Vermont for \ntheir help, advice and support in connection with the Victims of \nTerrorism Act and the improvements it includes to the Victims of Crime \nAct. I also thank them for the work they are doing by developing and \nimplementing programs for crime victims in Vermont. In addition, I \nthank the National Organization for Victim Assistance, the National \nAssociation of Crime Victim Compensation Boards and the National Victim \nCenter for their assistance and support in the development of the \nVictims of Terrorism Act. Without their help, we could not make the \nimportance progress that its provisions contain.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, victim restitution is an important part of \nour criminal justice system. It can help make the victim of a crime \n``whole,'' while holding the offender accountable for the damage caused \nby his or her crime. While I certainly applaud the good intentions of \nits sponsors, I do not support this ``mandatory victim restitution'' \nproposal. This bill would replace the current system, which allows \njudges to order victim restitution in certain types of cases, with an \ninflexible mandate which requires restitution be ordered in such cases.\n  In general, I do not support placing mandates on judges. I oppose \nmandatory minimum sentences because they substitute inflexible \nformulas, which cannot account for individual circumstances, for \njudicial discretion. Similarly, the ``mandatory victim restitution'' \nproposal will require judges to order restitution in cases where they \nknow it can never be paid. The Judicial Conference of the United States \nreports that 85 percent of criminal defendants are indigent at the time \nof their conviction. And yet, according to the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission's 1994 Annual Report, judges order a fine or restitution in \n37.7 percent of cases sentenced under the guidelines. These statistics \nlead me to believe that Federal judges are already doing a good job of \nordering restitution when practicable.\n  I respect the motives of this proposal's sponsors, and agree that we \nmust do all that is practicable to help victims of crime. However, \nrather than placing another mandate on judges, which seems unlikely to \nincrease the amount of restitution actually paid to victims, we should \ninstead consider alternative permissive forms of restitution which \nwould enhance the current system. Included in this bill was an \namendment proposed by my colleagues, Senators Kyl and Feinstein, which \nwould allow judges to order those convicted of drug trafficking \noffenses where there is no identifiable victim to pay restitution to \nthe affected community or to drug treatment organizations. I would \nsupport such a proposal, and other similar measures, within a \npermissive system.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Victims \nJustice Act of 1995. Too often, our criminal justice system has \noverlooked the victim of crime in its zeal to protect the rights of the \naccused. This bill makes significant progress toward ensuring that the \nvictim is not forgotten.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for the work they have put into this bill, in moving it \nthrough the committee and ensuring that it creates a workable system \nfor awarding compensation to victims.\n  It is a sad fact that so many people in our society are affected by \ncrime. In my State of California, 318,946 violent crimes were reported \nlast year.\n  And yet, restitution to the victim is infrequently awarded. In fiscal \nyear 1994, restitution was only awarded in 20.2 percent of Federal \ncriminal cases.\n  The Victims Justice Act may well help this, by making restitution to \nthe victim mandatory in Federal criminal cases where restitution can \nreasonably be anticipated by a judge.\n  Victim restitution is a matter of simple justice. If somebody has \nbeen hurt by a criminal, they should be made whole.\n  Restitution does more than simply compensate the victim for a loss, \nhowever. It says to the victim, ``You matter. You have been hurt, and \nthis is wrong. We have not forgotten about you.''\n  It also speaks to the criminal. It reinforces to them that their \ncrime hurt another person, that they are responsible for the \nconsequences of their actions, and that they have a responsibility to \nthe person they harmed.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that most criminal defendants are \nindigent, and cannot make complete restitution. But it is important to \nsend this message of responsibility to all criminals. That is why I \nstrongly support mandatory restitution, even if it is only nominal \nrestitution, such as a few dollars a month. Even though this won't make \nthe victim whole, it still sends the message to them that they matter, \nand still reminds the criminal, every month, about the consequences of \nhis actions and his responsibility for them.\n  And should the criminal come into better financial circumstances \nlater, this will ensure that he is not allowed to sit comfortably while \nhis victim is left uncompensated.\n  I also want to highlight one aspect of the bill which I worked on \nwith Senator Kyl: community restitution in drug cases. Drug dealing is \nnot a victimless crime. As a former mayor, I have seen drugs ravage \nwhole neighborhoods, spurring other crimes, destroying property, and \ntearing apart communities. That is why I think it is important to \npermit restitution in drug cases, even where there is no identifiable \nindividual victim.\n  This section of the bill will allow judges to order restitution in \nthese drug trafficking cases. This restitution will go to the States in \nwhich the crime occurred, to their Victim Assistance Administration and \nto their entities which receive substance abuse block grant funds. By \nmaking restitution to these funds, drug dealers will be \n\n[[Page S19281]]\nforced to help crime victims and to fight the drug abuse which they \nhave fostered and from which they profited, targeted to the States \nwhich they have harmed.\n  I call on Federal judges to implement this section, and not to \ndisregard it. I am hopeful that they will do so, and that future \nlegislation to mandate this restitution will not be necessary.\n  Mr. President, the Victims Justice Act will help victims, will help \ncommunities, and may well help to rehabilitate criminals. I urge my \ncolleagues to pass it.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I strongly support this bill because it \nwill require the perpetrators of many Federal crimes to make \nrestitution to their victims in all cases, without exception. I also \nbelieve its enforcement mechanisms make significant improvements over \nthose in existing law. I believe, however, that these procedures can be \nimproved upon still further.\n  In discussions with restitution experts about what we can do to \nimprove the procedures in current law, the one suggestion I have heard \nuniformly is that restitution orders should be made civil debts, \npayable immediately.\n  Instead of having the sentencing judge essentially attempt to rewrite \ncivil debt collection procedures and require the Government to enforce \nthem principally through its criminal attorneys, it would make more \nsense to make available the civil debt collection procedures, which are \nestablished collection methods fully consistent with due process, and \nmake it easy for the Government to have its civil attorneys, who are \nwell versed in collection actions and procedures, take on a significant \nportion of the enforcement responsibilities. These are, after all, the \nsame procedures that we already apply to students who default on \nstudent loan payments and others who owe debts to the Government.\n  Accordingly, I am today introducing a bill that will pick up where I \nbelieve this bill leaves off.\n  My bill will improve on collection of victim restitution in four main \nareas. First, it would make restitution orders civil debts. Second, to \nenforce these orders it would make available to the U.S. Government the \nFederal Debt Collection Act and all other civil and administrative \ntools ordinarily used to collect debts owed the United States. The \nUnited States could use these tools to enforce restitution orders on \nits own behalf or on behalf of other victims. The bill also would allow \nvictims to use State civil enforcement mechanisms on their own behalf. \nThird, the bill would allow victims to obtain the full benefit of \ncollateral estoppel from judgments in Federal criminal cases giving \nrise to restitution orders in subsequent civil proceedings, regardless \nof state law limitations. And finally, it would allow the courts in \nappropriate cases to prevent defendants from dissipating the assets \nthat would otherwise be able to be used to pay victim restitution \norders.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member in formulating the current bill. I have \nworked with both of them in developing these additional proposals. \nBecause of the timetable on which my friend from Utah is operating, it \ndid not seem practical to include them in the legislation we are \ndebating here today. But both he and my friend from Delaware have \nassured me that they are planning on making additional improvements in \nour enforcement procedures in an upcoming bill dealing with criminal \nfines, and it is the hope of all of us that we will be able to include \nsome or all of these proposals, either in their current form or with \nmodifications, in the fines legislation next year.\n  Mr. HATCH. I very much appreciate my colleague from Michigan's \nefforts, and I also appreciate his willingness to forbear from offering \nhis proposals at this time. I know that he agrees with me on the need \nto act this session to make restitution mandatory in the Federal \ncourts. We all agree that more remains to be done to enforce these \ndebts. My colleague's proposals are both interesting and innovative, \nand I want to work with him and other Members to see that they are \nadopted by this body in some fashion when we take up our fines bill \nnext year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I too appreciate my colleague's efforts and forbearance. I \nbelieve many of his proposals are interesting and innovative, although \nI have reservations about some of them. I look forward to working with \nhim and others to see to it that we make our enforcement mechanisms as \nsimple and effective as possible, while maintaining a commitment to \nensure due process.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Senator Dole and Senator \nNickles, for their hard work and leadership in bringing this bill to \nthe floor.\n  The bill would amend the Federal criminal code to require that \ncriminals compensate their victims--an initiative that is long overdue. \nAccording to the Bureau of Justice statistics 2 million people in the \nUnited States are injured each year as a result of violent crime. The \ncost of personal and household crime is estimated to exceed $20 billion \nper year--a sum that does not include the incalculable cost in human \nterms. In relatively few cases are victims made whole for their losses \nby those who preyed upon them.\n  Mr. President, one needs only to read the morning paper or watch the \nevening news to know that violence and crime plague our Nation. We have \nbecome inured to the ghastly statistics. But, Mr. President, victims \nare not statistics. They are real people. They are our brothers and \nsisters, mothers and fathers, sons, daughters and neighbors. They \ndeserve our compassion and assistance. It's time that our criminal \njustice system no longer treat crime victims as second class citizens.\n  Passage of this bill will help achieve that goal by ensuring that \nvictims are compensated as part of the criminal sentencing process \nrather than forcing the aggrieved to seek remedy through time \nconsuming, costly and at times degrading and agonizing civil action.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Hatch and Senator Biden for \nincluding a number of provisions I requested to improve the bill. I \nwould like to review those provisions.\n  First, the committee included a provision to double the fine assessed \nto Federal felons from $50 to $100 and for criminal organizations from \n$200 to $400. This provision achieves the primary goal of a bill, S. \n841, which I introduced earlier this year. The revenues from the \nincreased assessment will be placed into the Crime Victim Fund to \nincrease support for State and local victim assistance programs.\n  Second, the committee included language to require offenders to pay \ntheir criminal fines, assessments, and restitution orders in full and \nimmediately if they have the resources to do so. If they cannot pay \nimmediately, then the court will be required to impose a reasonable and \nenforceable payment plan that ensures full payment within the shortest \ntime possible.\n  Third, language was inserted to ensure that when a criminal debtor \nbecomes delinquent, a hearing can be held to determine the reason. If \nthe offender has no resources with which to pay, then the payment \nschedule can be amended. If the delinquency is willful, however, \npenalties can be imposed, including an outright prohibition on criminal \ndebtors receiving moneys from the Crime Victim Fund.\n  Fourth, the committee added a provision I requested to require \noffenders to notify the court of any change in their economic \ncircumstances which might affect the offender's ability to pay their \ndebt so that the applicable payment schedule can be appropriately \nmodified. A Federal criminal whose financial circumstances improve \nshould not be able to duck his or her responsibility to the victim \nbecause they are subject to an insufficient or outdated payment plan.\n  Fifth, the bill will make procedures for assessing and enforcing \ncriminal debt uniform among the three major categories: mandatory \nassessments, discretionary fines and restitution which after passage of \nthis bill will be mandatory.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision to see that crime victim \nassistance will no longer be counted against a recipient as revenue in \ndetermining eligibility for Federal assistance programs.\n  Again, I want to thank the committee for their hard work. This is an \nimportant bill which I believe will not only assist victims but will \nprove to be a formidable deterrent to crime.\n  Mr. President, having said that, I must mention that the bill does \nnot include all the provisions I would like to see. I had intended to \noffer several \n\n[[Page S19282]]\namendments, but the committee has requested that Senators withhold to \nensure speedy consideration and passage of this vital bill this year. I \ncertainly want to cooperate in that effort and given assurances from \nthe committee that the initiatives I was going to offer will be \nconsidered next year, I have decided to withhold.\n  The first amendment I had intended to offer would have privatized the \ncollection of delinquent criminal debt. Mr. President, outstanding \nFederal criminal debt totals over $4 billion. A portion of that amount \nmay be uncollectible because in many cases court assessments exceed the \nability of the offenders to pay, but, I know of no one who disagrees \nthat hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding debt are quite \ncollectible.\n  It's a simple reality that U.S. attorneys who are responsible for \ninvestigating and prosecuting Federal crimes assign a lower priority to \nthe collection of delinquent debt. Privatizing such debt will ensure \nthat more assessments and restitution orders are enforced, collected \nand deposited into the Crime Victim Fund or provided to the victim.\n  The second amendment I planned to offer was to declare offenders who \nwillfully avoid their financial obligations, ineligible for Federal \ngrants, contracts, licenses, or other nonmandatory Government \nassistance. Willful delinquency should be dealt with firmly. We should \nnot provide Federal benefits to those who purposely evade their \nresponsibilities.\n  Third, I had intended to offer an amendment to the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act [ERISA] which would allow pension income \nto be garnished to pay outstanding restitution or criminal debt orders. \nUnder current law, retirement benefits can only be attached to pay \ndelinquent child support. The collection of victim compensation and \ncriminal debt should be priorities as well.\n  The final amendment I had intended to offer would have increased the \namount that the Federal Government is legally able to contribute to \nState victim compensation programs from the Crime Victim Fund. \nCurrently, Federal payments are restricted to 40 percent of the amount \nthat the State provides to its victim compensation fund. The pending \nbill will increase the Crime Victim Fund by doubling the special \nassessment against felons. We should increase the 40-percent ceiling so \nthat the direct compensation programs can benefit from these increased \nresources.\n  Senator Hatch has informed me that the committee intends to take up a \ncriminal debt enforcement bill next year, and that these four proposals \nwill receive consideration at that time. I would like to ask the \nSenator if that is the committee's plan.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Arizona is correct. The committee intends \nto take up an enforcement bill next year. The initiatives you have \noutlined deserve serious consideration and I look forward to working \nwith you on them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and I look forward to working with him on enforcement \nlegislation. Again, I congratulate Senator Hatch and the Judiciary \nCommittee for their efforts to develop and pass the pending measure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the \ndebate time previously ordered be yielded back, the bill then be deemed \nread a third time and passed as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements on the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The substitute amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 665) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act entitled the Victims \nJustice Act of 1995.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19273-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19282-S19284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REQUIRING CONVEYANCE OF CERTAIN PROPERTY\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, today I am pleased that we are \nconsidering H.R. 1358, legislation to authorize the conveyance of the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service laboratory located in Gloucester, MA, \nto the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This provision embodied in S. \n1142, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nAuthorization Act of 1995, was reported by the Commerce Committee on \nAugust 10, 1995.\n  The amendment that I have offered, cosponsored by Senator Stevens and \nSenator Kerry, adds several other noncontroversial sections of the \nreported NOAA bill to H.R. 1358. They include: the conveyance to NOAA \nof a pier located on the Charleston Navy Base in South Carolina; an \nauthorization concerning the cleanup of NOAA property located on the \nPribolof Islands of Alaska; and an authorization to construct and \nconsolidate fisheries research facilities at Fort Johnson, South \nCarolina, and in Juneau, Alaska.\n  Mr. President, the provisions in this bill address a number of \nnoncontroversial issues that have been reviewed and adopted by the \nCommerce Committee with bipartisan support. I have brought them to the \nfloor in this fashion simply to expedite their passage.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the adoption of the amended bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the passage of \nH.R. 1358, legislation which conveys the Gloucester laboratory of the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS] to the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. Under H.R. 1358, the Gloucester lab, which was built in \nthe 1960s and is now federal surplus, will receive a new mission, \ndirection and purpose. Under budget-mandated federal consolidations, \nthe NMFS activities formally carried out at the Gloucester lab have \nbeen transferred to newer facilities in other locations.\n  Loss of the NMFS programs will be mitigated by a plan to make \nproductive use of the now unused laboratory site as home to a state \nmarine fisheries laboratory and a new consortium of marine science \nprograms from Massachusetts's colleges, universities, and high schools. \nUnder the plan, the facility will be used primarily for education and \nresearch in the marine sciences. It will enable undertaking various \nmarine science projects and initiatives, and continue ongoing efforts \nto address the problems that face the traditional fishing industry of \nMassachusetts and all New England. With its fishing heritage and close \nties to the rhythms of the sea, the city of Gloucester is a natural \nlocation for such a facility.\n  The schools participating in the project include Salem State College, \nthe University of Massachusetts, Essex Agriculture College, Boston \nUniversity's City Lab program and Gloucester High School. Projects \nplanned for the facility include shellfish safety research and testing, \nthe development of aquaculture techniques, and introduction of high \nschool students to sophisticated science such as DNA sequencing.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nStevens, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, and \nthe Committee's ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, for preparing this \nbipartisan bill and bringing it to the floor.\n  I also would like to acknowledge the work by staff on both sides, \nincluding Penny Dalton and Lila Helms on the Commerce Committee \nminority staff and on the majority side, Tom Melius and Trevor McCabe. \nI would like to acknowledge the work of Kate English of my staff and \nSteve Metruck, a congressional fellow in my office.\n  This bill represents a win-win solution for Massachusetts and the \ntaxpayers--it gives renewed life to a site the Federal Government no \nlonger needs, and it makes available to State and local organizations \nlaboratory facilities that are needed for research into important \nhealth, economic, and marine science issues. Consequently, I hope that \nwe can complete action and send this legislation to the President for \nhis signature as soon as possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3113) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the measure be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1507, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1507) to provide for the extension of the Parole \n     Commission to oversee cases of prisoners sentenced under \n     prior law, to reduce the size of the Parole Commission, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parole \nCommission Phaseout Act of 1995. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Biden, \nas well as by Senator Thurmond and Senator Kennedy. This legislation, \nwhich is supported by both the administration and the Federal \njudiciary, provides for a reduction in size of the Parole Commission. \nAt the same time, it will ensure that the Commission's duties, which \nare required by the due process and ex post facto clauses of the \nConstitution, will continue to be carried out.\n  Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Congress eliminated parole \nfor persons convicted of offenses committed after November 1, 1987. \nPursuant to amendments to the Sentencing Reform Act, the Parole \nCommission is currently scheduled go out of existence on November 1, \n1997.\n  At that time, however, the Federal Government will retain custody \nover a significant number prisoners sentenced for crimes committed \nbefore 1987, and thus entitled to parole hearings. The Parole \nCommission estimates that as of November, 1997, there will be \napproximately 6,000 such so-called old law convicts remaining in \nprison. In addition, it is anticipated that another 6,000 such convicts \nwill have been released on parole, subject to reincarceration for \nparole violations.\n  Presently, no other agency of the Federal Government can adequately \nassume the duties of the Parole Commission with regard to these old law \nprisoners. Yet, these prisoners are constitutionally entitled to parole \nconsideration. Without the Parole Commission, these prisoners could \nclaim that their sentences were being unconstitutionally lengthened by \nthe application of a law enacted after their offense, and apply for \nimmediate release. Thus, were the Commission allowed to terminate as \nscheduled, public safety could be endangered by the immediate release \nof dangerous criminals who have not served their sentences.\n  The parole Commission is also commendably seeking to reduce its size \nto better accommodate its smaller workload. As the number of ``old \nlaw'' prisoners continues to shrink, the need for the Commission, as \npresently constituted, will disappear, and remaining functions will be \nable to be transferred to another agency of the government.\n  This legislation accomplishes the prudent phaseout of the Commission \nbe extending its mandate for an additional 5 years, until November 1, \n2002. Simultaneously, the bill reduces the size of the Commission. The \nCommission's size would be reduced by one member immediately upon \nenactment, and by another member in October 1996. Thus, the size of the \nCommission would be reduced by one-third by October 1996, with \nsignificant savings to the American taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense proposal, and look \nforward to the swift passage of this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 1507) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1507\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard Cherry, \n     Case No. FM-18145-91, pending in the New Jersey Superior \n     Court, a subpoena duces tecum for testimony at a deposition \n     and for the production of documents has been issued to \n     William Ayala, an employee of Senator Frank Lautenberg;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial process, be taken from such control or \n     possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the \n     privileges of the Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2) (1994), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent committees, Members, officers, and employees of the \n     Senate with respect to subpoenas or orders issued to them in \n     their official capacity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That William Ayala is authorized to testify in \n     the case of Cherry v. Cherry, except concerning matters for \n     which a privilege or an objection should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     represent William Ayala and Senator Lautenberg's office in \n     connection with the subpoena issued in ths case.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in the case of Cherry versus Cherry, a \ndivorce proceeding pending in New Jersey Superior Court, the plaintiff \nhas caused a subpoena to be served on an employee of Senator \nLautenberg, seeking documents and testimony concerning the employee's \nperformance of constituent services by contacting the IRS on behalf of \nthe plaintiff. The plaintiff's attorney has not been able to \ndemonstrate to Senator Lautenberg's office or to the Senate legal \ncounsel how the office's casework assistance is relevant to the issues \nin controversy in the divorce suit. Accordingly, this resolution would \nauthorize the Senate legal counsel to represent Senator Lautenberg's \nemployee in this matter, and to seek to quash the subpoena in order to \nprotect Senator Lautenberg's office from the burdens of complying with \na discovery request of no relevance to the underlying dispute. This \nresolution also would authorize the employee to testify and produce \ndocuments in the event that the court determines that the employee does \nhave any evidence somehow relevant to the divorce proceeding.\n\n                              S. Res. 204\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Charles Okoren, et al. v. Fyfe \n     Symington, et al., No. CV-95-2527-\n\n[[Page S19285]]\n     PHX-RCB, pending in the United States District Court for the District \n     of Arizona, the plaintiffs have named the United States \n     Senate as a defendant;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(1)(1994), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     defend the Senate in civil actions relating to its official \n     responsibilities: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent the United States Senate in the case of Charles \n     Okoren, et al. v. Fyfe Symington, et al.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the plaintiffs in Okoren v. Symington, No. \nCV-95-2527-PHX-RCB (D. Ariz.), have brought a civil action in Federal \ndistrict court in Arizona seeking two declarations from the court: \nfirst, a declaration that Arizona's indictment procedures violate the \nUnited States Constitution; and second, a declaration that the Civil \nJustice Reform Act of 1990 overrules the decision of the United States \nSupreme Court in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), that federal \ncourts will not enjoin pending state criminal prosecutions except under \nextraordinary circumstances.\n  In their suit, these plaintiffs have named, among others, the United \nStates Senate as a party. The Senate is not, however, a proper party to \nthis lawsuit. In fact, the plaintiffs assert no claim against the \nSenate. This resolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel to \nrepresent the Senate in this action.\n\n                              S. Res. 205\n\n       Whereas, in the case of United States of America v. Karl \n     Zielinski, Case No. F12187-94, a criminal action pending in \n     the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the United \n     States Attorney has caused a trial subpoena to be served on \n     Michael O'Leary, a Senate employee on the staff of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from \n     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate is needed for the promotion \n     of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote \n     the ends of justice consistent with the privileges of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to requests \n     for testimony made to them in their official capacities; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That Michael O'Leary is authorized to provide \n     testimony in the case of United States of America v. Karl \n     Zielinski, except concerning matters for which a privilege \n     should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent \n     Michael O'Leary in connection with the testimony authorized \n     by section 1 of this resolution.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in the case of United States of America \nversus Karl Zielinski, the United States Attorney for the District of \nColumbia has charged the defendant with threatening to do bodily harm \nto occupants of the Hart Senate Office Building in violation of section \n22-507 of the District of Columbia Code, during a visit in December \n1994 to the offices of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nPatents, Copyrights, and Trademarks.\n  Michael O'Leary, an employee on the Judiciary Committee's staff, \nwitnessed the incident and has been subpoenaed by the U.S. Attorney to \ntestify at the trial.\n  This resolution would authorize Mr. O'Leary to testify at the trial, \nwith representation by the Senate legal counsel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19284-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION SESQUICENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

GALE TO BE A JUDGE ON THE UNITED STATES TAX \n                                 COURT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise to \ncongratulate Joseph H. Gale of Virginia, who has just been confirmed by \nthe Senate to be a judge on the United States Tax Court for a term of \n15 years. Mr. Gale, who is well known to Members of the Senate, has \nbeen a good friend and trusted counsel to the Senator from New York for \n11 years now. He joined my personal staff in 1985 as Tax Counsel, just \nin time for the fundamental restructuring of the tax code in the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, with which he was intimately involved. Since then \nhe has been a major force in the development and passage of literally \nevery piece of tax legislation considered by the Congress.\n  In 1993, Mr. Gale became Chief Tax Counsel for the Senate Committee \non Finance, and in that capacity took a leading role in the drafting, \nand ultimately in the enactment, of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1993. In 1995, he became our Minority Staff Director.\n  Three weeks ago, when Mr. Gale appeared before the Finance Committee \nfor his confirmation hearing, Senators from both sides of the aisle \npraised him highly for his professionalism, his unmatched knowledge of \ntax law and the legislative process, and his dedication to public \nservice. At least one Senator attended the hearing solely for the \npurpose of making a statement in support of Joe Gale's nomination, and \nChairman Roth took the opportunity to declare that only our former \nChairman Lloyd Bentsen got through the Committee more easily.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased and gratified that the Senate has \nconfirmed Mr. Gale to be a United States Tax Court Judge. He is \nsuperbly qualified for this position, and I know he will be an \noutstanding jurist. Finally, I thank Joe Gale for his 11 years of \ndistinguished service to the Senate, and I wish him well in his new \ncareer as a member of the Federal judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/22/senate-section/article/S19288-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946 (2 USC 261 et \nseq.) is repealed on January 1, and certain other laws that regulate \nlobbying activities are amended, including the Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act of 1938 (22 USC 611 et seq) and the 1989 Byrd \nAmendment (31 USC 1352).\n\n  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: For further information, forms, and \ninstructions concerning the Lobbying Disclosure Act, contact the House \nLegislative Resource Center, 1036 Longworth House Office Building, \nWashington, DC 20515, (202) 225-1300, or the Senate Office of Public \nRecords, 232 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510, (202) \n224-0758.\n\n                           DESCRIPTION OF LAW\n\n  In general, the Lobbying Disclosure Act (``Act'') establishes broad \nrequirements that individuals and entities who seek to influence the \nFederal government register with the Secretary of the Senate and the \nClerk of the House of Representatives, and disclose their clients, \nissues, fees, and interests of foreign entities. All registrations and \nreports filed under the Act are public records. The key provisions of \nthe Act are summarized below; however, lobbyists, their employers, \nclients, and other interested persons should always consult the full \ntext of the new law.\n\n                              REGISTRATION\n\n  The Act requires registration of: 1) lobbying firms that employ \nlobbyists for clients; and 2) organizations that employ in-house \nlobbyists. Registration with both the Secretary and the Clerk is \nrequired no later than 45 days after a lobbyist first makes a lobbying \ncontact or is employed or retained to do so, whichever is earlier \n(e.g., a lobbyist who has a retainer agreement with a client in effect \non January 1, 1996, must register on or before February 14, 1996). \nLobbying firms must file separate registrations for each client, \nsubject to limited exceptions.\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n741 NOTE: 738Individuals and organizations currently registered under the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act should file their final quarterly reports under the former law with the Clerk and  \n the Secretary by January 10, 1996, to prevent a gap in the records. However, registrations under the former law will no longer be effective, and all lobbyists active after January 1, 1996,   \n must register under the new Lobbying Disclosure Act.                                                                                                                                           \n738    Registration forms and instructions will be available from the House Legislative Resource Center and the Senate Office of Public Records in early January 1996.                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n\n                                REPORTS\n\n  Lobbying firms are required to file semiannual reports of income, and \norganizations employing in-house lobbyists are required to file \nsemiannual reports of expenditures, by August 14 (covering the period \nJanuary 1 thru June 30) and February 14 (covering the period July 1 \nthru December 31). The first reports under the new Act will be due by \nAugust 14, 1996. Lobbying firms must file separate reports for each \nclient. Forms and instructions will be available from the House \nLegislative Resource Center and the Senate Office of Public Records.\n\n                            MAIN DEFINITIONS\n\n  A LOBBYIST is an individual who is employed or retained for \ncompensation to make more than one lobbying contact, and whose lobbying \nactivities constitute at least 20 percent of his or her services \nperformed for that client during a six month period.\n\n  A LOBBYING FIRM means a person or entity that has one or more \nemployees who are lobbyists on behalf of a client, other than that \nperson or entity, and also includes a self-employed individual.\n\n  A CLIENT is any person or entity that employs another person for \nfinancial or other compensation to conduct lobbying activities on \nbehalf of that person or entity. A person or entity whose employees act \nas lobbyists on its own behalf is both the client and employer of such \nindividuals. In the case of a coalition or association that employs or \nretains other persons to conduct lobbying activities, the client is the \ncoalition or association, not its individual members. Under the Act, \nthere is no requirement that coalitions or associations disclose \ncontributions or dues from the individual membership of such groups.\n\n  A LOBBYING CONTACT means any oral or written communication (including \nan electronic communication) to a covered executive branch official or \na covered legislative branch official that is made on behalf of a \nclient with regard to:\n\n      (i) the formulation, modification, or adoption of Federal \n        legislation (including legislative proposals);\n\n      (ii) the formulation, modification, or adoption of a Federal \n        rule, regulation, Executive order, or any other program, \n        policy, or position of the United States Government;\n\n      (iii) the administration or execution of a Federal program or \n        policy (including the negotiation, award, or administration of \n        a Federal contract, grant, loan, permit, or license); or\n\n      (iv) the nomination or confirmation of a person for a position \n        subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\n  The law provides for 19 specific exceptions from the definition of \nlobbying contacts (e.g. for contacts that are not considered lobbying, \nare routine in nature, are inherently confidential, are subject to \nformal procedural safeguards, or are the subject of a separate public \nrecord).\n\n  LOBBYING ACTIVITIES are lobbying contacts and efforts in support of \nlobbying contacts, including preparation and planning activities, \nresearch and other background work that is intended at the time it is \nperformed for use in contacts and coordination with the lobbying \nactivities of others.\n\n  COVERED EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS include the President, Vice \nPresident, employees of the Executive Office of the President, Level I-\nV of the Executive Schedule, Members of the Uniformed Services at a pay \ngrade above 0-7, or any officer or employee in a position of a \nconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating \ncharacter.\n\n  COVERED LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS include Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and Senate, their staffs, elected officers of either \nHouse of Congress, committee and leadership staff, joint committee \nstaff, a working group \n\n[[Page S19291]]\nor caucus organized to provide legislative services or other assistance \nto Members of Congress, and all legislative employees required to file \nFinancial Disclosure Reports under the Ethics in Government Act.\n\n                       IDENTIFICATION OF CLIENTS\n\n  Any lobbyist making an oral lobbying contact with a covered \nlegislative branch official or covered executive branch official is \nrequired, on request of the official, to state whether his or her \nlobbying firm or organization is registered, to identify the client, \nand to disclose any foreign interest regulated by the Act. A lobbyist \nmaking a written lobbying contact to a covered official for foreign \ninterests regulated by the Act must disclose that fact in the writing.\n\n                               EXEMPTIONS\n\n  A LOBBYING FIRM is exempt from registration with respect to a \nparticular client if total income from that client for lobbying \nactivities does not exceed or is not expected to exceed $5,000 in a six \nmonth period.\n\n  An ORGANIZATION whose employees engage in lobbying activities on its \nown behalf is exempt from registration if total expenses in connection \nwith lobbying activities do not exceed or are not expected to exceed \n$20,000 in a six month period.\n\n                               PENALTIES\n\nWhoever knowingly fails to--\n\n      (l) correct a defective filing within 60 days after notice of \n        such a defect by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of \n        the House, or\n\n      (2) fails to comply with any other provision of the Act,\n\nis subject to a civil fine of not more than $50,000.\n        \n        \n        \n\nKELLY D.
