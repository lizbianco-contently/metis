Mr. President, while the Supreme Court has issued decisions \nprotecting the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of \ntheir children, the lower courts have narrowly interpreted these \ndecisions to give them almost no value as precedent. As a result, \npublic school officials have been permitted to abuse their authority \nand compel students--at the objection of their parents--to participate \nin activities violative of deeply held religious beliefs. This must be \nof concern at a time when we are all seeking ways to strengthen \nfamilies and inculcate values in our children.\n  One case, which a respected Federal court judge brought to my \nattention,\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\nnot only demonstrates the courts' unwillingness to respect the \nconstitutional rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of \ntheir children, it illustrates a bizarre dichotomy that has developed \nbetween the first amendment religious clauses: the establishment \nclause, which prohibits an official religion in the United States, and \nthe free-exercise clause, which ensures every American's freedom of \nconscience. It is my sincere hope that this discussion will prod the \nCongress into considering ways we can assure that the Constitution will \nbe applied to protect the rights of parents committed to firm moral \nguidance of their children, and in the process repair the glaring \ninconsistency that now exists regarding enforcement of these religious \nclauses in our Constitution.\n  One Senator who has responded to this challenge is Senator Grassley, \nwho has introduced an important bill, the Parental Rights and \nResponsibilities Act, which would forbid Federal, State, and local \ngovernments from interfering with ``the right of a parent to direct the \nupbringing of the child of the parent.'' This could resuscitate the \nSupreme Court's pro-parental rights decisions. Senator Grassley cited \nthe case I am going to discuss as an example of why his legislation \ndeserves serious consideration.\n\n\n                              II. The Case\n\n  On March 4, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Brown v. Hot, \nSexy and Safer Productions, Inc., 68 F.3d 525 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. \ndenied, U.S. (1996), in which the district court ruled, and the circuit \ncourt upheld, that it is constitutional for a public school to compel \nstudents--some as young as 14--without notifying parents, to sit \nthrough an explicit AIDS awareness presentation. A ruling that permits \npublic school officials to force students--over the objections of their \nparents--to participate in activities that violate deeply held \nreligious beliefs should be of concern to us all.\n  School officials at Chelmsford High School in Chelmsford, MA, knew \nfull well what they were getting when they hired Suzi Landolphi, the \nowner of a company called Hot, Sexy, and Safer, to give presentations \nat two 90-minute assemblies at the school. They viewed a promotional \nvideotape of the organization's past presentations as well as \npromotional brochures and articles. The superintendent and the \nassistant superintendent attended the presentation. The principal \nintroduced the presenter to the students.\n\n  While school officials were busy securing what the principal \ndescribed as ``a very special program,'' no effort was made to alert \nparents about the assembly, and students were compelled to attend it. \nSome argue that public school officials cannot keep parents apprised of \nevery detail of their children's education. But Landolphi's \npresentation was not a calculus exposition. It was a highly charged \nevent, unrelated to subjects traditionally taught to high school \nstudents.\n  A videotape of the program reveals that the presenter concentrated on \npersonal matters and used language so graphic that it would make former \nSurgeon General Jocelyn Elders blush.\n  Abstinence was never discussed as an option to avoid contracting \nAIDS. The assemblies were, however, filled with lewd demonstrations of \ncrude sexual acts. Landolphi kicked off her presentation to 9th and \n10th grade students by saying, ``This is amaz[ing]--I can't believe how \nmany people came here to listen to someone talk about sex, instead of \nstaying home and having it yourself.'' This may have been the high \nwater mark for the show.\n  During the program, the presenter told the students that they were \ngoing to have a ``group sexual experience, with audience \nparticipation''; told a minor he was not ``having enough orgasms''; \ncommented about a minor's ``nice butt''; characterized the loose pants \nworn by a student as ``erection wear''; and had a male student lick an \noversized prophylactic, after which she had a female student pull it \nover the male's head.\n  Landolphi was also philosophical: ``When we are younger, we know \nabout our private parts. We're less embarrassed. Why is that? With all \nof us sitting in this room right now--I mean, have you ever really sat \ndown and thought about your private parts? Did you ever think about \nthem?''\n  She concluded her presentation by instructing the students to \n``Become sexually proud and confident people. Know how you work. Tell \nyour parents about sex.''\n  Not only was Ms. Landolphi's program salacious, it was astonishingly \ninaccurate. Example: ``When you find out someone you love has this \nvirus, you tell them they can fight this virus, and they might fight it \nso well that they may never get ill. That's a fact.'' She informed \nthese students that those infected with HIV could avoid AIDS by getting \nrid of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and stress. And what, according to \nLandolphi, relieves stress? ``Sex, of course.''\n  For school officials to hold such a controversial--to put it mildly--\nevent without parental notification suggests these officials may have \ndeliberately sidestepped the parents. Even if, on the other hand, this \nheedlessness was inadvertent, it begs a broader question: Have some \npublic school officials become so arrogant that they do not even give \nthought to the views of the people they serve--the community--when \nplanning school events?\n\n  Some Chelmsford parents believed that their constitutional right to \ndirect the upbringing of their children was violated. A Federal \ndistrict court judge and a court of appeals, however, ruled against the \nparents.\n  The district court judge, in granting the defendant's motion to \ndismiss, opined: ``Parents who send their children to public schools * \n* * daily risk their children's exposure, both inside and outside the \nclassroom, to ideas and values that the parents and the children find \noffensive.'' Memorandum and Order, Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer \nProductions, No. 93-11842, slip op. at 10 (D. Mass. January 19, 1995). \nThe effect of this brush off is to treat a convinced Christian, Jew, \nMuslim, or parent of other religious faith as insufficiently \nenlightened, deserving of exclusion from the educational process along \nwith other narrow-minded and ignorant people. The erosion of our values \nthat this kind of indiscriminate reasoning represents is truly \nbreathtaking.\n\n\n           III. Constitutional Protection for Parental Rights\n\n  The liberty clause of the 14th amendment, and the free exercise \nclause of the first amendment, should protect parents from overreaching \npublic school officials. The 14th amendment claim is stronger, but \nthere is also precedent for the first amendment to protect a religious \nperson from neutral government action hostile to his or her beliefs.\n\n\n                        A. Fourteenth Amendment\n\n  The Supreme Court firmly recognizes that certain practices are ``so \nrooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked \nas fundamental'' and therefore merit protection under the 14th \namendment. Palko v. State of Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937). I can \nthink of few rights as fundamental as the right of a parent to control \nthe religious upbringing of his or her children.\n  A troika of Supreme Court decisions have encouraged us to see this \nroute as potentially fruitful. In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 \n(1923), the Court ruled that the liberty clause of the 14th amendment \nprotects the fundamental right of parents to bring up children. The \nright of the parents to have their children instructed in a foreign \nlanguage was, according to the Court, ``within the liberty of the \namendment.'' Id. at 400.\n  The Court reaffirmed this right in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 \nU.S. 510 (1925). In Pierce the Court declared unconstitutional a State \nstatute that required public school education of children aged 8 to 16. \nThe Court reasoned that the statute ``unreasonably interferes with the \nliberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education \nof children under their control * * * The child is not the mere \ncreature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny \nhave the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare \nhim for additional obligations.'' Id. at 534, 535.\n\n  While decided primarily on free exercise grounds, Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972), a decision upholding the right of Amish parents to \nremove their children from public schools, acknowledged the liberty \ninterest of parents to control the upbringing of their children. ``The \nhistory and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition \nof parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children.\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\n This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children \nis now established beyond debate.'' Id. at 232.\n  In the Chelmsford case, the circuit court arrogantly dismissed the \n14th amendment claim of the parents, commenting that ``the Meyer and \nPierce cases were decided well before the current `right to privacy' \njurisprudence was developed, and the Supreme Court has yet to decide \nwhether the right to direct the upbringing and education of one's \nchildren is among those fundamental rights whose infringement merits \nheightened scrutiny.'' Hot, Sexy and Safer 68 F.3d at 533. For the \nCourt to suggest that decisions regarding fundamental rights, \nincluding, for example, the right to marry, are pre-empted until \nreanalyzed under the Supreme Court's constitutionally suspect privacy \ndecisions is, if not novel, absurd. But again, when cases involve \nreligion, the courts all too often come up with imaginative reasons to \navoid following good case law.\n\n\n                           B. First Amendment\n\n  At first blush, the first amendment's free exercise clause seems like \na weak instrument for those who seek relief from neutral State action \nthat inhibits the practice of religion. It was, after all, Justice \nScalia who wrote the decision in Employment Division, Department of \nHuman Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990), which \nannounced that a ``neutral, generally applicable'' law does not violate \nthe free-exercise clause even when it prohibits religious exercise in \neffect.\n  The free exercise claim advanced by the Chelmsford parents would have \nthe same problem, if Smith were to be our guide. While the school \nofficials at Chelmsford High School certainly offended religious \nchildren by offering the AIDS presentation, it does not seem that they \nintended to single out religious individuals for the offensive show. \nIndeed, they were equal opportunity offenders.\n  But for those ready to close the door on free exercise claims when \ngovernment, by application of a neutral mandate, coerces individuals to \nviolate their own religious practices, such as in the Chelmsford case, \nthe matter is not set. Relevant to Chelmsford, the Yoder Court held \nthat when a 14th amendment-based claim to protect the fundamental right \nto control the religious upbringing of their children is combined with \na free-exercise claim--a ``hybrid'' situation--the first amendment \nclaim is enhanced. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 233. Smith acknowledges Yoder \nhybrid claims. Smith, 494 U.S. at 881.\n  Also relevant to the Chelmsford case, Justice Scalia, in a useful \nconcurrence in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 559 (1993), questioned whether the rule he authored in \nSmith, which garnered five votes on the Court, and was the subject of a \nspirited attack by Justice O'Connor, merits adherence. Justice Scalia \nsuggests that Smith is deficient in resolving free-exercise claims when \n``Neutral, generally applicable' laws, drafted as they are from the \nperspective of the nonadherent, have the unavoidable potential of \nputting the believer to a choice between God and government.'' Id. at \n577. In chronicling the tensions in free exercise jurisprudence--the \nmechanistic approach of Smith, versus the more nuanced approach of \nYoder--the Justices concludes that neither line of cases is \ncontrolling: ``Our cases now present competing answers to the question \nwhen Government, while pursuing secular ends, may compel disobedience \nto what one believes religion commands.'' Id. at 559.\n  If the Court does reevaluate the free-exercise clause, and decides \nthat a more expansive reading is warranted--as it has already done with \ngusto for the other first amendment religious clause, the establishment \nclause--Justice Scalia offers some preliminary thoughts on a \nrevitalized free exercise clause more sympathetic to the plaintiffs in \ncoercion cases, such as that of Chelmsford, and a persuasive rationale \nfor why the Court should resolve this conundrum:\n\n       A law that is religion neutral on its face or in its \n     purpose may lack neutrality in its effect by forbidding \n     something that religion requires or requiring something that \n     religion forbids. A secular law, applicable to all, that \n     prohibits consumption of alcohol, for example, will affect \n     members of religions that require the use of wine differently \n     from members of other religious and nonbelievers, \n     disproportionality burdening the practice of, say, \n     Catholicism or Judaism.'' Id. at 560 (emphasis added).\n\n  What the Chelmsford school officials did, with the District Court's \nbacking, was require something that was against the religion of some of \nthe students. Thus this legal framework could provide relief for such \ncompulsion situations.\n  The circuit court in Chelmsford dismissed the free-exercise claim \nunder the Yoder scheme on two grounds: First, the free-exercise \nchallenge was not ``conjoined with an independently protected \nconstitutional protection,'' and Second, the free-exercise claim was \ndistinguishable because the parents did not ``allege that the one-time \ncompulsory attendance at the Program threatened their entire way of \nlife.'' Hot, Sexy, and Safer, 68 F.3d at 539. Neither rationale is \npersuasive. As mentioned above, the Supreme Court has firmly recognized \nthat parents enjoy certain constitutional protections in directing the \nupbringing of their children. And the hybrid situation developed in \nYoder, and noted in Smith, does not require that an individual's entire \nway of life be threatened for there to be constitutional recourse.\n\n\n           IV. Dichotomy in First Amendment Religious Clauses\n\n  While the courts have taken great pains not to disturb neutrally \ndrafted laws when considering free-exercise claims, and even Justices \nsympathetic to religious freedom, such as Justice Scalia, have agonized \nover these decisions, the courts are aggressive in restricting \nreligious activities under the establishment clause. The result: an \nextreme dichotomy in religious clauses jurisprudence.\n\n  Contrast the federal courts' refusal to recognize free-exercise \nclaims with their zeal in banning prayers at school ceremonies under \nthe establishment clause. In the same year the AIDS presentation at \nChelmsford High School occurred, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Lee v. \nWeisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992) that a prayer given by a rabbi during a \nmiddle school commencement program violated this clause. Let's take a \nlook at a part of the offending prayer:\n\n       God of the Free, Hope of the Brave: For the legacy of \n     America where diversity is celebrated and the rights of \n     minorities are protected, we thank You. May these young men \n     and women grow up to enrich it. . . . May our aspirations for \n     our country and for these young people, who are our hope for \n     the future, be richly fulfilled. Id. at 581,582.\n\n  In his opinion for the majority, Justice Kennedy reasoned that \n``heightened concerns [exist] when protecting freedom of conscience \nfrom subtle coercive pressure in the elementary and secondary public \nschools.'' Id. at 592.\n  But where is the concern for the subtle coercive pressure of a \nmandatory AIDS assembly, whose graphic details and panderingly hip \nattitude toward human sexuality, offend the core values of believers in \nthe great religions of the world? Consider that if one agrees with \nJustice Kennedy that students should not be coerced to listen to \nprayer, it is hard to understand why one wouldn't agree that the free-\nexercise clause should protect a school from coercing a student to \nparticipate in an activity which violates that students's religion. But \na double-standard has emerged that the Chelmsford case perfectly \nillustrates.\n  The offending prayer delivered by the rabbi in Weisman was less than \n2 minutes long, compared to the 90-minute presentation which took place \nat Chelmsford High School. The Court in Weisman did not require that \nthe student's life lie in ruin when invalidating a benign commencement \nprayer. Also consider that the prayer in Weisman is a religious \nstatement that is well within the tradition of benedictions at \ngraduation ceremonies, and that parents accompanied the students and \nhad notice that the rabbi was speaking.\n  We remove prayer because it's offensive to 1 out of 100, but don't \nremove--or at least make optional--material highly offensive to a \nstudent of faith. I believe that most Americans would agree that \nsomething is corrupt within our jurisprudence when an indecent \npresentation directed at minors is constitutional while a short \ncommencement prayer delivered by a member of the clergy is \nunconstitutional.\n\n\n                             V. Conclusion\n\n  When a public school presents controversial subjects, out of \ncourtesy, it should notify parents, and give them\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\nthe opportunity to have their children opt out. This isn't burdensome; \nit's the morally right thing to do. If public school officials \nexercised this courtesy in the first place, the Chelmsford controversy \ncould have been avoided.\n  I believe the courts should return to the spirit of the Supreme Court \ndecisions on parental rights, and recognize and protect the right of \nparents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The U.S. \nConstitution requires no less. Meanwhile, Congress should consider \nlegislation, such as Senator Grassley's parental rights bill, to prod \nthe courts to respect one of the most basic, and important fundamental \nrights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been presiding, and I know that we \nare going to be continuing with the defense appropriations bill later \non. I noticed something that I read just in the last couple days that \nwas in the Wall Street Journal under the title of ``Do We Need a \nMissile Defense?'' This has been a debate in this body for quite some \ntime during the Defense authorization bill. It is so obvious on its \nface, that virtually every strategist, in terms of strategic defense in \nthe country, agrees that we are under probably a greater threat today \nthan we have been maybe in the history of this country in that we no \nlonger are in a cold-war posture where there are two superpowers and \nyou can identify who the other one is, as it was in the case of the \ncold war.\n  Some of us, I think, may be looking back wistfully at the days when \nthere was a cold war and we could identify who the enemy was. I can \nrecall that back during the Nixon administration, Richard Nixon and Dr. \nKissinger put together the whole concept of the ABM Treaty, which was \nthere are only two superpowers that have weapons of mass destruction \nand the missile means to deliver them, at least part way. Therefore, if \nwe all agree not to defend ourselves, then the philosophy of mutual \nassured destruction would serve us all well. In other words, the \nSoviets fire at us, we fire at them, everybody dies and no one is \nhappy.\n  That is not the situation today. I did not agree with it back in \n1972. Back when we had the ratification of the START II agreement, I \nwas the only Senator halfway through the rollcall to vote against it. \nEveryone else was voting for it until a few others realized that what \nwe were doing is going back and reinstating or resurrecting that \nphilosophy of the ABM Treaty, except now it would be with Russia as \nopposed to the Soviet Union since it no longer exists.\n\n  I think it is insane that we would even consider something like that. \nIn fact, I had permission from Henry Kissinger himself to stand on the \nSenate floor and quote him when he said that he did agree at the time \nthat that was a good policy for America in 1972, but he said that now \nsome 25 nations have weapons of mass destruction, and he said, ``It is \nnuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.''\n  This article that I read--I will, without exceeding my time, just \nparaphrase a few of the comments here by some of the experts. Donald \nRumsfeld was the Secretary of Defense during the Ford administration. \nHe said:\n\n       Only someone deep in denial can contend that the U.S. \n     cannot be threatened by ballistic missiles. Rogue states like \n     Iran, Iraq and North Korea have made clear their \n     determination to acquire chemical, biological or nuclear \n     weapons and the missiles to deliver them. China and Russia, \n     if inclined, could threaten many countries, near and far, \n     with nuclear missiles. Missiles are a weapon of choice for \n     intimidation, precisely because the world knows that once a \n     missile is launched, the U.S. is not capable of stopping it.\n\n  Henry F. Cooper was the director of the Strategic Defense Initiative \nduring the Bush administration and the chief U.S. negotiator in the \nGeneva defense and space talks during the Reagan administration. He \nsaid--I will just quote this first sentence:\n\n       America's vulnerability to ballistic missile attack is a \n     leadership failure of potentially disastrous proportions.\n\n  Then it goes on to quote many others, including James Woolsey, who \nwas President Clinton's former Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency and now practices law in Washington. He was the one who 2 years \nago said that--this was 2 years ago--we now have 22, 25 nations that \nhave weapons of mass destruction or are in the final stages of \ncompleting those weapons and are working on the missile means of \ndeploying them, delivering them.\n  I think, Mr. President, if you update his statement, as he did the \nother day, it is now up to some 30 nations. Look at who these nations \nare. When you are dealing with the Middle East mentality of Iran, Iraq, \nand Syria and Lebanon and Libya, and, of course, people like Saddam \nHussein, who would murder his own grandchildren, we are not dealing \nwith people that we can predict, people who think like Westerners \nthink. Yet here we are today considering the defense appropriations \nbill and giving virtually no attention to our ability to defend \nourselves with a national missile defense system.\n  So, Mr. President, I am hoping, as we keep repeating this over and \nover again, that we can penetrate somehow this Eastern media who would \nlike to make people believe that the threat is not out there, this \nadministration that keeps saying over and over again that it will be 15 \nyears before we can be threatened by a missile attack, when in fact \nthere are intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach the United \nStates from as far away as China or Russia.\n  We have been held hostage. We were held hostage in the Taiwan Strait \nwhen the Chinese went over and were doing their missile \nexperimentation. One of the highest ranking Chinese officials at that \ntime said, ``We're not concerned about the Americans coming in and \ndefending Taipei because they would rather defend Los Angeles than they \nwould Taipei.'' That has to be at least an indirect threat at the \nUnited States.\n  The threat is real. The danger is real. We are living in a time when \nthe threat is greater than it has been at any time in this country's \nhistory. We, as a body, are trying to do something about it against the \nwishes of the administration, and we have to prevail in this effort for \nour kids' sake.\n  Lastly, I am from Oklahoma, and those who saw the Murrah Federal \nOffice Building and saw the television accounts of it--you almost had \nto be there to get the full impact of the tragedy that was there. It \nwas just indescribable. The power of that bomb that blew up the Murrah \nFederal Office Building in Oklahoma City was equal to 1 ton of TNT. The \nsmallest nuclear warhead known to man is 1 kiloton, 1,000 times the \nexplosive power. So the threat is there, Mr. President. We need to deal \nwith that and do something about it. After all, is that not what \nGovernment is for? I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S7924-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7924-S7927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CRISIS IN EDUCATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, you and some others in this body have \nheard me say that the one experience that took me out of the private \nsector and brought me back into public life was my term as chairman of \nthe Strategic Planning Commission for the Utah State Board of \nEducation. I was\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nhappily serving as the chief executive of a very successful, \nfunctioning corporation when I was asked to take that assignment in \npublic service. It brought me face to face with the current crisis in \neducation.\n  I have been interested in that issue ever since. I was interested in \nthis morning's Wall Street Journal where the following appeared. I \nwould like to call it to the attention of the entire Senate and, \nhopefully, through the Congressional Record and C-SPAN, as wide an \naudience as possible. In this morning's Wall Street Journal there is \nthe following article that I find incredible:\n\n       New York City's Cardinal John J. O'Connor has repeatedly \n     made the city an extraordinary offer: Send me the lowest \n     performing 5% of children presently in the public schools, \n     and I will put them in Catholic schools--where they will \n     succeed. The city's response: Silence.\n       In a more rational world, city officials would have jumped \n     at the cardinal's invitation. It would have been a huge \n     financial plus for the city. The annual per-pupil cost of \n     Catholic elementary schools is $2,500 per year, about a third \n     of what taxpayers now spend for the city's public schools.\n\n  Mr. President, I have had this debate with leaders of the Teachers' \nAssociation in Utah. Members of the National Education Association do \nnot come to see me because they apparently know that I have already \ncome to the conclusion that something must be done to break the \nmonopoly that current teachers' unions have on the way education is \nconducted in this country.\n  The author of this article goes on to tell us his own experience with \nhis own children. He tells us how he takes his children past the \nCatholic schools every morning, to enroll them in what are considered \nthe best public schools in New York City. One day he decided he would \ngo in and see what was going on in the Catholic schools, to compare it \nto what was happening in the public schools. He says, ``* * * I was \nimpressed. I sat in, for example, as fourth-grade teacher Susan Viti \nconducted a review lesson on the geography of the Western United \nStates.'' He goes on to describe the things that were done, and then he \nsays:\n\n       I found myself wishing that my own son's fourth-grade \n     teachers at nearby Public School 87, reputedly one of the \n     best public schools in the city, were anywhere near as \n     productive and as focused on basic schools as Miss Viti. Both \n     my boys' teachers have wasted an enormous amount of time with \n     empty verbiage about the evils of racism and sexism. By \n     contrast, in Miss Viti's class and all other Catholic school \n     classes I attended, it was taken for granted that a real \n     education is the best antidote to prejudice.\n       Miss Viti earns $21,000 a year, $8,000 less than a first-\n     year public-school teacher. ``I've taught in an all-white \n     affluent suburban school, where I made over $40,000. This \n     time I wanted to do something good for society, and I am \n     lucky enough to be able to afford to do it. I am trying to \n     instill in my students that whatever their life situation is \n     now, they can succeed if they work hard and study.''\n\n  Mr. President, monopoly is a terrible thing, whether it is in an \neconomy or in an intellectual circumstance. Establishing a monopoly \nthat prevents people from looking for other ideas or other ways of \ndoing something is the best way to guarantee stagnation. What we have \nin public education now is a monopoly, firmly enforced by the teachers' \nunions and geared to prevent any kind of intellectual competition.\n  We have seen it on the floor of this Chamber. Again and again last \nyear, we tried to pass an appropriations bill for the District of \nColumbia. Certainly, there is no place in the world that needs \nappropriations more than the District of Columbia. Mired down in \nfinancial disaster and management chaos the District needed that money \nas quickly as it could come. Yet because we put into that bill the \nopportunity for experimentation on just that situation described in \nthis morning's story in the Journal, there were people on this floor \nwho filibustered against that appropriations bill, willing to hold up \nneeded financial support for the District, all in the name of \npreserving an educational monopoly for the teachers' unions.\n  Now, I have very good friends in the Utah Teachers Association who \ncome to me and say, ``It is unconstitutional for you to spend public \nmoney on a private institution, particularly a private institution that \nhas connection to a religion.'' Mr. President, we crossed that line, \nsuccessfully, 50 years ago. All of us are familiar with the GI bills, \nconsidered by many to be the most successful Government program ever, \nthe most successful expenditure of Government money to help people's \nlives that has ever taken place in the history of the United States. I \nhave heard the GI bill being described thusly here on the floor by some \nof my colleagues. What do we do in the GI bill? We say to individuals, \n``Here is the money that we promised you to help you with your \neducation. Now you make the decision as to where that money will be \nspent.'' Is it unconstitutional to someone under the GI bill to take \nthat money and go to the University of Notre Dame just because the \nUniversity of Notre Dame is affiliated with the Catholic Church? Is it \nunconstitutional for you to take that money to go to Georgetown \nUniversity here in the District just because Georgetown University is \nrun by the Jesuits? Of course, not. We have long since come to the \nconclusion that the money follows the student, not that it goes to \nsupport the institution.\n\n  Would it be unconstitutional for the city of New York to take \nCardinal O'Connor up on his offer and say we will give you the 5-\npercent lowest students, we will give you the 5-percent worst problems \nwe have, allow the money to follow the students, and let you take care \nof it for us? No, the constitutional precedent has been firmly \nestablished. What are they afraid of? They are afraid of saving money? \nThey are afraid of doing better by the children? No, they are afraid of \nthe political retaliation of the teachers' union.\n  The article goes on to describe that retaliation in some detail. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there is no issue that we face in this \nbody more serious than the challenge of educating our young people. \nThat is not a cliche. That is a statement of our primary survival \nchallenge of the future. Talk to CEO's, talk to personnel directors \naround the country, and they tell you more and more the primary \nchallenge we have long term in this country is maintaining a work force \nthat can survive international competition. Talk to many of these CEO's \nand they tell you that more and more of their budget is going to pay \nfor remedial learning skills for their new hires. They are hiring \npeople who cannot read the instructions that they are given to carry \nout their work. They are hiring people who cannot figure enough to even \nmake change in a retail situation.\n  Recognizing that the schools will not teach these people to read and \nfigure, they are beginning to allocate more and more of their corporate \ndollars to give this kind of education themselves. It is potentially, \nas I say, Mr. President, the single most important issue we face. I \nthink with the collapse of the Soviet Union, this has become the long-\nterm survival issue for the United States. Yet we allow ourselves to \ninsist that the status quo, producing these kinds of results, is what \nmust be maintained at all costs. We allow ourselves to say we will not \neven experiment with a voucher system that might challenge the present \nmonopoly. We will not even allow an educational system that is willing \nto try and experiment with 5 percent of the kids who are doing the \nworst in our Nation's largest city, to see what might happen with that \nexperiment.\n  What are the teachers' unions afraid of, when challenged with the \nopportunity to have an experiment of this kind? They are afraid of \npeople like Miss Viti, described in the article, demonstrating to all \nof the world the bankruptcy of the present circumstance. Education is \nthe only place I know, Mr. President, where professionals--and I \nconsider teachers to be professionals--are willing to accept less money \nin order to avoid working for public payroll. In every other \ncircumstance, the professionals earn more money when they get out of \nthe public payroll. Lawyers in private practice earn more than lawyers \nwho work for municipalities and State governments and the Federal \nGovernment. Doctors in private practice earn more than doctors who work \nfor the Public Health Service. But in education, teachers earn less who \nwork in private schools than those who work for the public. Why do they \ndo it? Because as Miss Viti says, ``I wanted to do something\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\ngood for society. I am lucky to be able to afford to do it.''\n\n  Mr. President, I will return to this from time to time. I am not on \nthe appropriate committee for a variety of reasons which we understand \naround here. The committee assignments come by virtue of the State that \nyou represent and the interests that you have in seeing that State is \nproperly represented. But I could not pass the opportunity to call to \nthe attention of the Senate this incredible statement in this morning's \npaper, whereby the Nation's teachers' union, working through its \naffiliates in New York State, have denied the lowest 5 percent of the \ncity of New York the opportunity to try something new, and have thus \ncondemned those 5 percent to a continued future of bleakness and lack \nof opportunity.\n\n  A final demonstration of this, Mr. President, again, from the \ninformation contained in the article comparing what happens in New York \nCity schools--the public schools that are spending three times as much \nas the Catholic schools--in terms of the results. Here is the \nconclusion that comes from the New York State Department of Education. \nThis is not a conclusion that comes from the managers of the private \nschools, the Catholic schools. This is the conclusion that comes from \nthe New York State officials themselves:\n\n       Catholic schools with 81 percent to 100 percent minority \n     composition outscored New York City public schools with the \n     same percentage of minority enrollment in grade 3 reading . . \n     .\n\n  In grade 3 reading, they were 17 percent better; in grade 3 \nmathematics, 10 percent better; in grade 5 writing, 6 percent better; \nin grade 6 reading, 10 percent better; in grade 6 mathematics, 18 \npercent better.\n  A Rand Corp. study compared the performance of children from New York \nCity's public schools and Catholic high schools and came up with these \nstatistics. Again, this is not from the Catholic school system itself; \nthis is from an outside observer known for its excellence and its \nobjectivity, the Rand Corp.:\n\n       Only 25 percent of the public school students graduated at \n     all . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that statistic, Mr. President. It is staggering.\n\n       Only 25 percent of the public school students graduated at \n     all, and only 16 percent took the Scholastic Aptitude Test.\n       By shameful contrast, the small ``elite'' of public school \n     students who graduated and took the SAT averaged only 642 for \n     those in neighborhood schools and 715 for those in magnet \n     schools.\n\n  Here is the shameful contrast: 25 percent of the public school \nstudents graduated, and 16 percent took the SAT; and 95 percent of the \nCatholic school children graduated, and 75 percent took the SAT's. The \nCatholic school students scored an average of 815 on the SAT, compared \nto 642 of the public schools.\n  Once again, Mr. President, let me stress that these are in schools \nwhere the minority makeup is identical to the minority makeup in the \npublic schools. If there is ever a statistical case to be made for the \nfact that we need to experiment with this kind of education and break \nthe monopoly that the teachers' union has established and is \nmaintaining on public education, this is it.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence. As I said, I will return to \nthis subject from time to time because I consider it the Nation's No. 1 \nsurvival issue in the long term.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 17, 1996]\n\n                 Why the Catholic School Model Is Taboo\n\n                             (By Sol Stern)\n\n       New York City's Cardinal John J. O'Connor has repeatedly \n     made the city an extraordinary offer: Send me the lowest-\n     performing 5% of children presently in the public schools, \n     and I will put them in Catholic Schools--where they will \n     succeed. The city's response: silence.\n       In a more rational world, city officials would have jumped \n     at the cardinal's invitation. It would have jumped at the \n     cardinal's invitation. It would have been a huge financial \n     plus for the city. The annual per-pupil cost of Catholic \n     elementary schools is $2,500 per year, about a third of what \n     taxpayers now spend for the city's public schools.\n\n\n                             no idle boast\n\n       More important, thousands more disadvantaged children would \n     finish school and become productive citizens. For Cardinal \n     O'Connor's claim that Catholic schools would do a better job \n     than public schools is no idle boast. In 1990 the RAND \n     Corporation compared the performance of children from New \n     York City's public and Catholic high schools. Only 25% of the \n     public-school students graduated at all, and only 16% took \n     the Scholastic Aptitude Test, vs. 95% and 75% of Catholic-\n     school students, respectively, Catholic-school students \n     scored an average of 815 on the SAT. By shameful contrast, \n     the small ``elite'' of public-school students who graduated \n     and took the SAT averaged only 642 for those in neighborhood \n     schools and 715 for those in magnet schools.\n       In 1993 the New York State Department of Education compared \n     city schools with the highest levels of minority enrollment. \n     Conclusion: ``Catholic schools with 81% to 100% minority \n     composition outscored New York City public schools with the \n     same percentage of minority enrollment in Grade 3 reading \n     (+17%), Grade 3 mathematics (+10%), Grade 5 writing (+6%), \n     Grade 6 reading (+10%) and Grade 6 mathematics (+11%).''\n       Yet most of the elite, in New York and elsewhere, is \n     resolutely uninterested in the Catholic schools' success. In \n     part this reflects the enormous power of teachers' unions, \n     fierce opponents of anything that threatens their monopoly on \n     education. In part it reflects a secular discomfort with \n     religious institutions.\n       I myself have felt this discomfort over the years, walking \n     past Catholic schools like St. Gregory the Great, near my \n     Manhattan home. Every morning, as I took my sons to public \n     school, I couldn't help noticing the well-behaved black and \n     Hispanic children in their neat uniforms entering the drab \n     parish building. But my curiosity never led me past the \n     imposing crucifix looking down from the roof, which evoked \n     childhood images of Catholic anti-Semitism and clerical \n     obscurantism.\n       Finally, earlier this year, I ventured in, and I was \n     impressed. I sat in, for example, as fourth-grade teacher \n     Susan Viti conducted a review lesson on the geography of \n     the Western United States. All the children were \n     completely engaged and had obviously done their homework. \n     They were able to answer each of her questions about the \n     principal cities and capitals of the Western states--some \n     of which I couldn't name--and the topography and natural \n     resources of the region. ``Which minerals would be found \n     in the Rocky Mountains?'' Miss Viti asked. Eager hands \n     shot up. Miss Viti used the lesson to expand the students' \n     vocabulary: when the children wrote things down, she \n     insisted on proper grammar and spelling.\n       I found myself wishing that my own son's fourth-grade \n     teachers at nearby Public School 87, reputedly one of the \n     best public schools in the city, were anywhere near as \n     productive and as focused on basic skills as Miss Viti. Both \n     my boys' teachers have wasted an enormous amount of time with \n     empty verbiage about the evils of racism and sexism. By \n     contrast, in Miss Viti's class and in all the other Catholic \n     school classes I visited, it was taken for granted that a \n     real education is the best antidote to prejudice.\n       Miss Viti earns $21,000 a year, $8,000 less than a first-\n     year public-school teacher. ``I've taught in an all-white, \n     affluent suburban school, where I made over $40,000,'' she \n     says. ``This time I wanted to do something good for society, \n     and I am lucky enough to be able to afford to do it. I am \n     trying to instill in my students that whatever their life \n     situation is now, they can succeed if they work hard and \n     study.''\n       You might expect liberals, self-styled champions of \n     disadvantaged children, to applaud the commitment and \n     sacrifice of educators like Susan Viti. You might even expect \n     them to look for ways of getting government money to these \n     underfunded schools. Instead, they've done their best to make \n     sure the wall of separation between church and state remains \n     impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy groups tout an endless \n     array of ``prevention'' programs that are supposed to stave \n     off delinquency, dropping out of school and teen pregnancy--\n     yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools, which nearly \n     always succeed in preventing these pathologies.\n       Read the chapter on education in Hillary Clinton's ``It \n     Takes a Village.'' Mrs. Clinton advocates an alphabet soup of \n     education programs for poor kids, but says not a word about \n     Catholic schools. Similarly, in his books on education and \n     inner-city ghettos, Jonathan Kozol offers vivid tours of \n     decrepit public schools in places like the South Bronx, but \n     he never stops at the many Catholic schools that are \n     succeeding a few blocks away.\n       Why are Catholic schools taboo among those who talk loudest \n     about compassion for the downtrodden? It's hard to escape the \n     conclusion that one of the most powerful reasons is liberals' \n     alliance with the teachers' unions, which have poured \n     hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of \n     liberal candidates around the country. Two weeks ago I \n     attended the National Education Association convention in \n     Washington, a week-long pep rally for Bill Clinton punctuated \n     by ritual denunciations of privatization.\n       Before the teachers' unions rise to political power, it was \n     not unusual to see urban Democrats like former New York Gov. \n     Mario Cuomo support government aid to Catholic schools. Mr. \n     Cuomo's flip-flop on this issue is especially revealing. In \n     1974, when he first ran for public office, Mr. Cuomo wrote a \n     letter to potential supporters: ``I've spent more than 15 \n     years . . . arguing for aid to private\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n     schools,'' he wrote. ``If you believe aid is a good thing, \n     then you are the good people. If you believe it, then it's \n     your moral obligation, as it is my own, to do something about \n     it. . . . Let's try tax-credit plans and anything else that \n     offers any help.''\n       Mr. Cuomo soon learned his lesson. In his published diaries \n     he wrote: ``Teachers are perhaps the most effective of all \n     the state's unions. If they go all-out, it will mean \n     telephones and vigorous statewide support. It will also mean \n     some money.'' In his 1982 campaign for governor, Mr. Cuomo \n     gave a speech trumpeting the primacy of public education and \n     the rights of teachers. He won the union's enthusiastic \n     endorsement against Ed Koch in the Democratic primary. Over \n     the next 12 years, in private meetings with Catholic leaders, \n     Gov. Cuomo would declare that he still supported tax relief \n     for parochial school parents. Then he would take a completely \n     different position in public. For example, in 1984 he \n     acknowledged that giving tax credits for parochial-school \n     tuition was ``clearly constitutional'' under a recent Supreme \n     Court decision--but he refused to support such a plan.\n       Politically controlled schools are unlikely to improve much \n     without strong pressure from outside. Thus, the case for \n     government aid to Catholic schools is now more compelling \n     than ever, if only to provide the competitive pressure to \n     force state schools to change. And the conventional wisdom \n     that government is constitutionally prohibited from aiding \n     Catholic schools has been undermined by several recent U.S. \n     Supreme Court decisions.\n\n\n                             sucker's trap\n\n       Since the powerful teachers' unions vehemently oppose any \n     form of government aid to Catholic schools, reformers are \n     often skittish about advocating vouchers or tuition tax \n     credits, fearing that will end the public-school reform \n     conversation before it begins. But to abandon aid to Catholic \n     schools in the name of public-school reform is a sucker's \n     trap. We have ended up with no aid to Catholic schools and no \n     real public-school reform either.\n       Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not just \n     because they profoundly benefit the children who enroll in \n     them. They also challenge the public-school monopoly, \n     constantly reminding us that the neediest kids are educable \n     and that spending extravagant sums of money isn't the answer. \n     No one who cares about reviving our failing public schools \n     can afford to ignore this inspiring laboratory of reform.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, over the past several years there has been \na very extensive debate over ways to achieve more fairness for \ntaxpayers, especially small taxpayers, through reform of our tax \nsystem. Proposals are most often very complex and sometimes extremely \npartisan. But there is one simple, inexpensive, and I must say \nunanimously-agreed upon legislative package that helps make paying \ntaxes fairer to the taxpayer. Mr. President, we call this proposal the \ntaxpayer bill of rights 2, which passed the Senate by unanimous vote on \nThursday evening.\n  I am very proud we passed this particular piece of legislation by \nunanimous consent. The passage of this important piece of legislative \nwork is the culmination of over one decade of dedication to its \nphilosophy.\n  Many of our colleagues in the Senate today were not here in 1988 when \nCongress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the very first \ntaxpayer bill of rights. That bill was the first ever comprehensive \npiece of legislation enumerating the rights of the American taxpayer. \nFor example, in the taxpayer bill of rights 1 provided:\n  First, the right of the taxpayer to be informed of their respective \nrights;\n  Second, the right of the taxpayer to rely on written advice of the \nInternal Revenue Service;\n  Third, the right of the taxpayer to representation; and\n  Fourth, the right of the taxpayer to recover, for the first time, \ncivil damages and attorney's fees from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  These and other basic, commonsense provisions were codified by the \nfirst taxpayer bill of rights. The battle waged by a strongly \nbipartisan coalition for their codification was hard-fought, and their \nultimate enactment was a first giant step for the American taxpayer.\n  But, since 1988 Mr. President, we have learned much about the \nInternal Revenue Service and the needs of taxpayers. Now is clearly \ntime to more fully develop and expand those particular rights. With \nThursday's passage of the taxpayer bill of rights 2, we have taken a \nvery significant step forward, treating taxpayers more like customers.\n  This step follows the efforts taken in 1988 with the enactment of the \nfirst taxpayer bill of rights.\n  In 1992 I first introduced the taxpayer bill of rights 2 with \nconsiderable bipartisan backing of some 52 of our colleagues on each \nside of the aisle. The bill passed Congress twice that year. It was \nultimately vetoed because it was included as part of two large tax \nbills with which President Bush did not agree. Since these two bills \nwere vetoed at that time, the Senate has not considered taxpayer bill \nof rights 2 on its own merits until this past Thursday. In making its \nway to the Senate, this very important piece of legislation passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a unanimous 425 to 0 vote. I applaud the \naction of the House of Representatives, and I am proud that this \nThursday, because of a strong bipartisan coalition, the Senate has now \nfollowed suit by unanimously passing taxpayer bill of rights 2.\n  I am also proud to say I have had the privilege and honor of working \nvery closely with my colleagues in the Senate. Senator Chuck Grassley, \nof Iowa, has been a strong champion for years of increasing taxpayers' \nrights. He has been, certainly, a grand ally in this long fight. \nSenator Harry Reid, from Nevada, has also been a strong advocate for \ngiving additional rights to the taxpayer. He has been a strong advocate \nand supporter of taxpayer bill of rights 2. In fact, the very first \nspeech that Senator Reid made on the floor of the U.S. Senate, shortly \nafter his election, related to the necessity and the need of having a \ntaxpayer bill of rights.\n\n  I look forward to President Clinton signing this very important bill \nin the days ahead. The taxpayer bill of rights 2 builds on a foundation \nlaid by the original taxpayer bill of rights. It protects taxpayers by \nrequiring the IRS to achieve higher standards of accuracy, timeliness, \nand fair play in providing taxpayer service. It makes the Internal \nRevenue Service accountable.\n  The taxpayers bill of rights 2 achieves these new standards through \n27 new provisions--27 new protections for the American taxpayer, as a \nresult of the passage of the taxpayer bill of rights 2.\n  First, expansion of the authority of the taxpayer advocate to prevent \nhardships on taxpayers;\n  Second, creation of small taxpayers' rights to an installment \nagreement, and further rights when installment agreements are denied or \nterminated are specifically spelled out to benefit the taxpayer;\n  Third, the expansion of the reasons for which the IRS must abate \ninterest when it has delayed a taxpayers' case, and for the very first \ntime in our history, a grant of authority to the courts of the power to \nreview the interest abatement determination;\n  Fourth, an increase in the amount a taxpayer can recover in civil \ndamages from $100,000 to $1 million, when the Internal Revenue Service \nor an agent thereof has acted negligently or recklessly in the \ntaxpayer's case;\n  Fifth, provisions strengthening the code so the taxpayer may recover \nout-of-pocket costs;\n  Sixth, rules prohibiting the Internal Revenue Service from issuing \nretroactive proposed regulations unless the Congress provides \notherwise.\n  Mr. President, the taxpayer bill of rights 2 contains many more \ncommonsense provisions, designed to safeguard the rights of taxpayers. \nTaken together, these provisions will work to restore more faith in our \nsystem of taxation. It will provide more protection for the taxpayer in \ndealing with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I truly believe that in the long run, this very important, bipartisan \nlegislation will help bolster taxpayer confidence in dealing with the \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nby ensuring taxpayers that they are going to get fair treatment by the \ntax collector, the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to this morning pay a very, \nvery special tribute to a fine gentleman who has worked for years to \nmake certain that the taxpayers' bill of rights No. 2 became the law of \nthis land. This fine gentleman is Steve Glaze. He is a member of my \nstaff. He sits to my left at this moment on the floor, and I can say \nwithout reservation that without Steve Glaze's constant help and \nsupport, his inspiration many times when we thought the taxpayers' bill \nof rights 2 would never see the light of day and never become law, \nSteve Glaze was always that optimistic individual, knowledgeable, \ninspired and committed to making certain that the American taxpayer got \na fairer break.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank my very worthy staff member, Steve Glaze, \nfor his magnificent contribution to this bipartisan piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand morning business will be \ncompleted at 11 o'clock. I will attempt to keep my time to that. If you \nwill advise me when the time is up, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Morning business does \nexpire at 11 o'clock. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had contacted Senator Thurmond about the last 5 \nminutes, and he is not coming, so that is why I am using his time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S7927-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF U.S. TREASURIES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while much attention has been given to \nthe trajectory of our budget deficit in recent months, very little has \nbeen said about how we are financing this deficit. I think this latter \npoint is crucial because there are some very troubling trends in the \nownership of U.S. Treasuries which could spell trouble down the road.\n  Foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries has surged in the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. As a percent of the total private holdings, this ratio soared \nfrom 19 percent in 1992 to 25 percent by 1995. To put this in \nperspective, foreign treasuries and their holdings held within a fairly \nstable, and narrow range of 15 to 20 percent during the 12 years \nprevious to 1992.\n  Some may argue that this recent rise is not worrisome. Indeed, we \nshould be grateful, some would say, for foreign participation. However, \nthis ignores two very key facts.\n  One, this money must be paid back with interest at a future date, and \ninterest payments abroad are an unambiguous loss to American incomes. \nThis is not the case with interest paid to domestic residents and \ndomestic institutions. As such, continued purchases of Treasuries \namount to mortgaging away our future standard of living a little bit at \na time.\n  The second reason is that it is usually a bad sign to see a country \nfind itself predominantly with foreign central bank money, because when \nthey buy our Treasuries, they lend us their money. So it is usually a \nbad sign to see a country find that a foreign central bank is a \npredominant lender of money to us.\n  This usually bespeaks a lack of sufficient private investment and is \na warning of unsustainable fiscal policies. Witness Mexico in 1995. \nThat is why I view the first quarter's current data with such alarm. It \nshowed that foreign central banks bought $55 billion in U.S. Treasuries \nfrom January to March of this year alone--$55 billion. That is nearly \ndouble the amount that central banks bought in all of 1994 and is over \n80 percent of 1995's yearly total.\n  Let me put it another way. First quarter foreign official bond \npurchases amounted to 6.5 percent of the entire stock of foreign \ntreasury holdings which had been built up over time. This goes a long \nway toward explaining why the treasury market was so resilient \ninitially to the collapse of the balanced budget talks that we were \nhaving with the administration at the start of this year.\n  Why were central banks buying so many of our Treasury bills, so many \nof our IOU's? While some may have viewed United States debt as a good \ninvestment, the main player was the Bank of Japan. It was not buying \nour Treasury bills because it wanted to, but only did so to prop up the \ndollar and keep the yen weak as a way of aiding its ailing exporters \nand its banking sector.\n  The Bank of Japan has been forced into such defensive dollar buying \never since the Clinton administration forcibly devalued the dollar in \n1993. Since 1993, the Bank of Japan's reserves have tripled from $69 \nbillion, Mr. President, to $208 billion, underpinning our bond market \nwith those huge quantities of purchases.\n  Since these reserves are held in dollars, this translates into a \nsimilar amount of treasury purchases. At present, these Japanese \ntreasury purchases are very stable. The Bank of Japan cannot sell them \nwithout precipitating a fall in the dollar versus yen. However, once \nits banking sector reserves and its exporters adjust to the current yen \nlevel, there will be less need for the Bank of Japan to be buying \nTreasuries. Since the U.S. bond market has been accustomed to their \nsteady purchases, this will come as a blow to the Treasury market of \nthe United States. Indeed, we have already seen a mild example of what \nmight happen when foreign central banks scale back their dollar \npurchases.\n\n  In April through June of 1996, official Treasury purchases were only \none-tenth as large as in the first quarter. It was no accident that \nbonds fell sharply during this period, with the 30-year yield soaring \nfrom 6.6 to 7.2 percent.\n  The recent example stresses the importance of reducing the amount of \nU.S. debt issuance now. Only in this way will we be able to prevent a \nsharp future bond market selloff if foreign central banks scale back \ntheir enormous appetite for our securities, which appetite is not \nsingularly predicated upon their confidence in us but, rather, in this \ncase, the Japanese purchases are in their own self-interest for the \ntime being, for they are attempting to effect the value of the yen \nversus the dollar their way.\n  When that all gets stabilized, who will fill the gap as they begin to \ndispose of these inordinate holdings of American Treasuries?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senate for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I stand corrected. This is an amendment based upon a \nseries of amendments that I will articulate after we adopt this \namendment. This is a managers' amendment. It has been drafted and \nprepared by Senator Inouye. With his consent, I have called it up as an \namendment in the second degree to the pending amendment.\n  I want to give notice to all Senators that it is being brought up and \nit is a technical amendment. However, it does cover a series of \namendments that were filed in cloture. This amendment, if adopted, \ncovers amendments Nos. 4466, 4439, 4467, 4468, 4469, 4470, 4471, 4472, \n4473, 4474, 4475, 4476, 4477, 4478, 4481, 4482, 4483, 4484, 4485, 4486, \n4487, 4488, 4511, 4565, 4567, and 4576. I believe that is the list.\n  Because of the cloture requirements, we filed separate amendments to \nachieve the same objective as the managers' amendment we had worked out \nbefore the cloture motion was filed. These were a series, not totally \ntechnical, of amendments that had been worked out on both sides and \ncleared on both sides for inclusion in this bill by unanimous consent. \nIf we adopt this amendment, I will ask that the amendments I have just \nread be withdrawn.\n  I turn to my friend from Hawaii to seek his concurrence in this \nprocedure.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have no objection, and I wish to advise \nmy colleagues that this procedure and these amendments have been \ncleared by both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to wait a minute in total \nfairness. We are trying to contact one Senator. I want to make sure \nthere is no disagreement. We have the list here, if anyone who is \nobserving these proceedings is concerned. This will, in effect, adopt \nthe amendments that we were prepared, before the cloture motion was \nfiled, to recommend to the Senate as one managers' amendment. That is \nour proceeding now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I restate my request. I have an amendment \nat the desk. I ask unanimous consent that it be considered as a \nsubstitute for the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the plasma quench technology amendment will \nyield valuable results for our defense and aerospace industries in the \nnear future. I understand it has been accepted by the committee, so I \nwill keep my remarks brief. I sincerely appreciate the help and support \nof the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Stevens and the ranking \nmember, Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would provide $2 million from funds \navailable under title IV of the legislation before\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\nus, to support development of an innovative metallurgic technology \ncalled plasma quench developed at the Idaho National Engineering \nLaboratory, to be used in producing ultra fine titanium powder and \ndeveloping an injection molding of titanium metal.\n  Titanium metal is of critical significance to a wide variety of \nstrategically important manufactured products, and the need for \ntitanium in the production of such products is set to increase \ndramatically. In the transportation and aerospace areas the feasibility \nof many advanced products is predicated on a high-quantity, low cost \nsupply of titanium that simply does not currently exist. At the same \ntime that U.S. aerospace companies and other manufacturers are becoming \nmore dependent on titanium, the sources for processed titanium metal \nare increasingly moving offshore, becoming more expensive. High capital \nand operational costs, in addition to the waste disposal costs \nassociated with the standard Kroll process for titanium production are \nlargely to blame for this migration. This situation threatens to \nseriously diminish the leverage and control exercised by U.S. \nmanufacturers over this important strategic material.\n  The plasma quench process represents an alternative to the Kroll \nprocess that could have a radical impact on the world's titanium market \nby dramatically reducing the capital and process costs, and eliminating \nthe waste stream associated with titanium production. While commercial-\nscale production of other metals using this process has already been \ndemonstrated, much developmental work is necessary to prove the \nviability of the process with regard to titanium.\n  Mr. President, this is an important step in assuring the cost-\neffective, viable, and readily accessible production in the United \nStates. As I mentioned before, I thank the committee for accepting this \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now, Mr. President, I will announce, once again, that \nthis is the managers' amendment. It incorporates a series of amendments \nthat we had agreed to accept on both sides prior to the cloture motion \nbeing filed. It has been checked with the persons that had some \nquestion about it. I now believe that it is still cleared on both \nsides. With that concurrence from the Senator from Hawaii, I ask if he \nconcurs that it be adopted.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I concur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, amendment No. 4589 \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4589) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4439, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, amendment No. 4439, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4439), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I read the series of amendments that have \nbeen proposed in the cloture mode, and I recall all of those \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, those amendments are \nrecalled.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a series of amendments that have \nbeen filed, and we have been notified of a series that Members will \nseek to debate. We have an understanding with the leadership that a \ncloture motion will continue to be set aside so long as we proceed \nexpeditiously with this bill.\n  Senator Inouye and I are prepared to debate and consider any \namendments that Members have indicated they wish to bring before the \nSenate. We will announce to the Senate that if there are no Members \nthat wish to bring the matters before the Senate, we will go to third \nreading.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I will. Does the Senator from Hawaii have any \nremaining amendments he wishes to consider?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Not personally.\n  Mr. President, I want to advise my colleagues that the managers of \nthis measure are prepared to not only debate but to pass this measure \ntoday. If we cooperate, we should be able to do so by a reasonable time \nthis evening.\n  That would mean tomorrow and the weekend would be free for our \ncolleagues to do what they normally wish to do at this time of the \nyear. So, Mr. President, I hope that the staff on both sides will send \nthe message out to those who are interested in presenting amendments to \ncome forth to the floor and do so expeditiously.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I can have the indulgence of the \nChair, I have three small amendments that I will present.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4563\n\n   (Purpose: To require a study regarding the F-22 advanced tactical \n                                fighter)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4563.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 2, before the period, insert: ``: \n     Provided, That not less than $1,000,000 of the funds \n     appropriated in this paragraph shall be made available only \n     to assess the budgetary, cost, technical, operational, \n     training, and safety issues associated with a decision to \n     eliminate development of the F-22B two-seat training variant \n     of the F-22 advanced tactical fighter: Provided further, That \n     the assessment required by the preceding proviso shall be \n     submitted, in classified and unclassified versions, by the \n     Secretary of the Air Force to the Congressional defense \n     committees not later than February 15, 1997''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment allocates $1 million for \nthe Air Force to assess comprehensively the implications of the \nservice's recent decision to terminate development of a two-seat \ntrainer variant of the F-22 advanced tactical fighter.\n  I might state to the Senate that we have been informed that, if there \nwas a proposal to eliminate the two-seat variant of the F-22 advanced \ntactical fighter, that would leave us without a training vehicle for \nthis very sophisticated new aircraft.\n  We are not mandating that the decision be changed. We are mandating \nthat there be a study made of that decision with regard to safety and \ntraining problems, as well as budgetary and technical problems, and \nthat the Appropriations Committees and the Armed Services Committees of \nthe House and Senate receive this study by February 15, 1997.\n  The Air Force normally acquires fighter aircraft in single-seat and \ntwo-seat variants so that the latter may be used for pilot flight \ntraining. Although the twin-seat trainers cost more than the single \nseat aircraft, they are considered necessary for the effective and safe \ntraining of pilots in the demanding air-to-air and air-to-ground \ntactical environments. Should a student pilot experience difficulties, \nthe instructor pilot can assume control of the aircraft and safely \ndemonstrate the required procedures and maneuvers.\n  Recently, the Air Force decided to cease development of the two-seat \nF-22--known as the ``F-22B''--in order to constrain costs.\n  Mr. President, there are serious safety, operational, and training \nissues associated with this decision. The F-22 is the most complex \nfighter aircraft ever developed. The pilots flying it must be the best \ntrained to operate and fight the aircraft safely and effectively. The \nloss of a single pilot in a training accident would be a tragedy and \nwould deprive the nation of a talented Air Force officer needed to \naccomplish important military missions.\n  There also are major cost, budgetary, and technical issues associated \nwith the decision. Every F-22 fighter will cost at least $111 million \nto procure. The entire program will cost at least $70,092,947,000. In \naddition to the high cost of training a pilot, the loss of just a few \nF-22's in training or operational accidents caused by inferior training \nwould more than offset the savings generated by terminating the F-22B. \nIn retrospect, this decision may well come to be seen as penny wise and \nfiscally and militarily pound foolish.\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\n  The amendment I am offering is intended to provide the Congress with \nsufficient information to enable us to fully understand the many \nserious implications of the Air Force decision. Congress should have \nthe opportunity to consider, and to act on, this decision in a timely \nmanner.\n  The amendment mandates that the required report be submitted in \nclassified and unclassified versions.\n  Does this have my friend's support?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by both \nsides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4563) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4489\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce by $100 million the maximum amount allowed for \n                          Pentagon renovation)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4489 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4489.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 70, line 8, strike out ``$1,218,000,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$1,118,000,000''.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment will bring the defense \nappropriations bill into conformance with the authorization bill on the \ntotal cost of the renovation of the Pentagon reservation. My amendment \nreduces the cost cap in the bill by $100 million to a total of $1.118 \nbillion. This is identical in purpose to the amendment passed by the \nSenate on June 25 during debate on the defense authorization bill.\n  The amendment is very simple and straightforward. It reduces the \nfunds for the Pentagon renovation project by $100 million. As we have \nrealigned our defense programs to meet changing needs, funds for many \nprojects have been reduced or eliminated. Despite big reductions in \ndefense spending and defense personnel, the Pentagon renovation project \nhas enjoyed a steady flow of cash.\n  The time has come to impose greater financial discipline on the \nPentagon, just as the Pentagon has asked other military organizations \nto be more frugal. This would be the first reduction in funds for this \nexpensive project since its inception half a decade ago, and it amounts \nto less than 10 percent of the total.\n  Many things have changed since this 15-year project began, and I \nbelieve Pentagon renovation plans can be better aligned with today's \nrealities. There are many factors which ease the impact of a reduced \nrenovation budget. For example, the Department of Defense is \ndownsizing. As the civilian and military workforce is steadily reduced, \ndemands on workspace have eased. Construction costs in the Washington \nDC area have fallen and contract costs for the renovation have turned \nout to be considerably lower than the original estimates. On one \nconstruction contract alone, for example, costs were 36 percent less \nthan anticipated. Also, modern communications technology makes it \nunnecessary to have large staffs at the Pentagon to manage dispersed \noperations.\n  Mr. President, in 1990 Congress transferred responsibility for the \noperation, maintenance, and renovation of the Pentagon from the General \nServices Administration to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. \nCongress recognized that the serious structural problems of the \nPentagon building had to be addressed without further delay, and we \ntook this action to get the long overdue project moving forward. \nCongress earmarked the $1.2 billion DoD would have paid to GSA in rent \nfor the next 12 or 13 years as a break even way to pay for the \nrenovations. This $1.2 billion was not based on projected renovation \ncosts; it was simply a sum that was available and seemed a logical way \nto fund the renovation. Congress also provided the Department of \nDefense great flexibility in managing this large and complex project.\n  Since fiscal year 1994, the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nrequired the Secretary of Defense to certify that the total cost of \nPentagon renovation will not exceed $1,218 million. But this \n$1.2 billion cap does not include all the renovation costs. In fact, \nthere are four catogories of expenses which add substantial amounts to \nthe total. For example, the Pentagon estimates the cost of buying and \ninstalling information management and telecommunications equipment is \n$750 million. This amount is not part of the $1.2 billion cap. Neither \nis the heating and refrigeration plant, the classified waste \nincinerator, the furniture, or the 780,000 square feet of leased spaces \nfor people who must be moved during the construction. A figure of $1.2 \nbillion is misleading; the expense of renovating the Pentagon easily \nexceeds $2 billion.\n\n  Last year the Senate passed my amendment to cut Pentagon Renovation \nexpenses by $100 million. During conference, however, the conferees \nagreed to eliminate that requirement and instead directed the Defense \nDepartment to review the Pentagon's renovation plans and recommend cost \nsaving options. In fact, this review had been underway since March of \n1995. A March, 1995 Pentagon press release stated:\n\n       This review will include re-examination of all lower cost \n     options. At a time when the Secretary has initiated efforts \n     to improve housing for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \n     marines, we need to do all we can to insure that dollars \n     being spent for other infrastructure projects are not being \n     taken away from the very high priority of improving the \n     lifestyles of our men and women in uniform.\n\n       I agree with this sentiment, and now I'd like to ensure \n     that we turn these words into actions.\n  This well publicized review was supposed to produce a report which \nwas due in February of this year. We didn't get that report, but on \nJune 5 the Armed Services Committee staff did receive a one-page memo \nwhich states the Defense Department has found a savings of $37 million \nand will continue to look for more. A reduction of $37 million out of a \ntotal of $1.2 billion is not what I consider an aggressive response to \nour call to reduce costs.\n  Mr. President, 15 months ago the Pentagon itself publicly announced \nthe intent to reduce the cost of this project. The Defense Department \nidentified a new spending target only after last year's threat of a \nreduced cap and after I announced at the Readiness Subcommittee markup \non April 30 that I would introduce a similar amendment this year if I \nwas not convinced by the Pentagon's long-overdue report. Well, that \nreport is not here. I am not convinced that $37 million is the best the \nPentagon can do in the way of savings. The only way in which we can \nforce additional savings is to keep up the pressure. That is what my \namendment does.\n  Mr. President, Americans have been asked to tighten their belts and \nthey expect no less from their Government. The Pentagon must be \nexpected to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment conforms to the Senate-\npassed authorization that places a ceiling on the Pentagon renovation \nfund. It has been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we do support this to conform with the \nauthorization bill as passed by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment No. \n4489 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4489) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4566\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the funding level available to continue the \n  Maritime Technology program to $50,000,000 within available RDT, \n      Defense-Wide appropriations and provide appropriate offsets)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call before the Senate amendment No. \n4566.\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4566.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Before the period on page 30, line 13, insert: ``: Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading, \n     $50,000,000 shall be available for the Maritime Technology \n     program and $3,580,000 shall be available for the Focused \n     Research Initiatives program''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is to increase the funding level \navailable to the Maritime Technology Program to $50 million within the \navailable research and development funds of the defensewide \nappropriations to provide for appropriate offsets, and it is an item \nthat I have introduced on behalf of Senator Lott, and I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This amendment has been cleared and approved by both \nsides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection to amendment No. \n4566, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4566) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, I ask \nunanimous consent that Michael Montelongo be admitted to the floor \nduring the consideration of this Defense appropriations bill. He is a \ncongressional fellow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4490\n\n    (Purpose: To set aside $10,000,000 for the United States-Japan \n                      Management Training Program)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of Senators Bingaman, Domenici, \nand Santorum, I call for the immediate consideration of amendment No. \n4490.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Bingaman, for \n     himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Santorum, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4490.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 13, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided, That, of such amount, $10,000,000 is \n     available for the United States-Japan Management Training \n     Program''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment would allocate $10 \nmillion within the DOD university research initiatives program element \n61103D for the United States-Japan Management Training Program.\n  This program was begun in fiscal year 1991 at my initiative. It has \nenjoyed the support of both the Armed Services and the Appropriations \nCommittees since its inception and I have been very grateful for the \nsupport of the senior Senators from Alaska and Hawaii. The goal of the \nprogram is to train American scientists and engineers and business \nmanagers in the Japanese language as part of their graduate educations \nand then place them in Japanese research institutions for internships \nor fellowships where they could learn firsthand how the Japanese \nresearch and development system--second only to our own at more than \n$100 billion per year--functions. They could then later in their \ncareers in American industry and government help tap and build bridges \nto the Japanese research efforts in their areas of expertise. \nEssentially, this was an effort on a modest scale to learn from the \nJapanese success in tapping our research enterprise through such \nfellowships at our universities.\n  By all reports--and there have been several thorough reviews of this \nprogram--the program, as run by the Air Force Office of Scientific \nResearch [AFOSR], has done an impressive job of achieving its \nobjectives. Nineteen universities from around the country have received \ngrants under the program and there has been significant cost-sharing \nfrom non-Federal sources to match funds provided by AFOSR.\n  Unfortunately, in fiscal year 1996, AFOSR was only able to fund the \nprogram at $2 million from its own resources after several years in \nwhich DARPA had provided AFOSR $10 million per year for the program. \nEssentially, the program got caught up in the politics of the \nTechnology Reinvestment Project [TRP], even though the Japan program's \nfocus was only peripherally related to the TRP's focus on government-\nindustry technology partnerships.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate Armed Services Committee in its report \nprovided discretion for the Pentagon to allocate up to $10 million to \nthe Japan program from either PE61102F, the Air Force's defense \nresearch sciences program element, or PE61103D, the Office of Secretary \nof Defense's university research initiatives program element. The Armed \nServices Committee also directed AFOSR to ensure that cost-sharing from \nnon-Federal sources should match AFOSR funds to the maximum extent \npracticable in future grant awards.\n  The Appropriations Committee in its report on the pending bill also \nurged the Pentagon to fund this program up to the $10 million level in \nits report language on the university research initiatives program \nelement. I agree with the Appropriations Committee that the university \nresearch initiatives line is the more appropriate source for funds for \nthis program, although the Air Force Office of Scientific Research \nshould continue to manage it. I very much appreciate the Appropriations \nCommittee's continuing support for the program. My amendment would take \nthe extra step of insuring the full $10 million is really available to \nthe program. I believe that taking this step is warranted in light of \nthe great success the program has enjoyed in achieving its goals. I \nhope that the managers of the bill can support taking this additional \nstep in supporting the Japan program.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This amendment earmarks $10 million for the U.S.-Japan \nManagement Training program. Both authorization and appropriations \ninclude supporting report language, and it has been cleared by both \nsides, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I concur with the statement of the \nSenator from Hawaii. This is a matter that needs to be adopted to \nconform with the action taken by the authorizing committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4490 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4490) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4462\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $4,000,000 for the procurement of a real-time, \n              automatic cargo tracking and control system)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of Senator Feinstein, I call up \namendment No. 4462 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4492.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 29, line 10, strike out ``1998.'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``1998: Provided, That of the funds appropriated \n     in this paragraph, $4,000,000 shall be available for the \n     procurement of a real-time, automatic cargo tracking and \n     control system.''.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my \namendment to make $4 million from the Army's Research, Development, \nTest and Evaluation available to acquire a real-time,\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\ndemonstrated, automatic cargo tracking and control system. This cargo \ntracking and control system is designed to assure that the smooth flow \nof cargo and to reduce the occurrence of misplaced cargo at Army ports. \nThis demonstrated cargo tracking mechanism makes it possible for the \nmanager of a port, rail yard, or other cargo distribution area to know \nwhere each container is and to move those containers without risk of \nbeing lost.\n  The Army has already witnessed massive unreported but costly loss of \ncargo location in storage following Vietnam and Desert Storm. The Army \nmade previous attempts to purchase this tracking system but was unable \nto do so due to funding constraints. It is my understanding that the \nArmy Material Command would like to use $4 million from Army Research, \nDevelopment, Technology, and Evaluation budget line PE0603804A.\n  I am pleased that this amendment is acceptable and I thank the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This amendment appropriates $4 million to be made \navailable for the procurement of a real-time, automatic cargo tracking \nand control system. It has been cleared by both sides, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do concur in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4462 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4462) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4442\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call before the Senate amendment No. \n4442.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4442.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have called this amendment before the \nSenate on behalf of Senator Bond and Senator Ford. It is an amendment \nthat will prevent the reduction of the funds that are available under \nauthorized program activities for the National Guard, and it has been \ncleared on both sides. It does indicate that if additional funds are \nrequired for a program, project or activity of a higher priority than \nany other in future acts, they should be submitted to Congress under \nsection 1997 of the Defense Authorization Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4452\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to inactivate or \nreduce any unit of special operation forces of the Army National Guard)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senate. The number \nshould have been 4452. I mistakenly called up 4442. I ask the previous \namendment be set aside. We do not want to call it up or recall it, just \nnot bring it before the Senate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And that the amendment we consider now be the amendment \nfor Mr. Bond, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Lott, which is 4452.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Bond, for \n     himself, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4452.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be obligated or expended--\n       (1) to reduce the number of units of special operations \n     forces of the Army National Guard during fiscal year 1997;\n       (2) to reduce the authorized strength of any such unit \n     below the strength authorized for the unit as of September \n     30, 1996; or\n       (3) to apply any administratively imposed limitation on the \n     assigned strength of any such unit at less than the strength \n     authorized for that unit as of September 30, 1996.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as cochairman of the Senate National Guard \nCaucus, I join with my colleague, Senator Bond, to thank my good friend \nSenator Stevens and his ranking member Senator Inouye for including our \namendment prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to inactivate any \nunits of Special Operation Forces of the Army National Guard in the \nmanagers amendment.\n  This issue has just been brought to Senator Bond's and my attention. \nFrom all indications, the U.S. Special Operations Command has decided \non their own to inactivate two Army National Guard Special Forces \nbattalions by September 1998.\n  This inactivation represents a loss of 802 individuals--or one-third \nof the Army National Guard Special Forces structure. This is not only a \ncomplete surprise to me and Senator Bond, but also to the Department of \nDefense.\n  Upon hearing of this plan, I asked my staff to check with the \nPentagon to see if they knew of this proposal and had given their \napproval. Much to my dismay, I found out this was new to them as well.\n  The Special Operations Command tells us that these National Guard \nunits are excess. However, a closer examination of the facts indicates \nthat the actual motive behind this proposal is to harvest moneys to be \nspent on active forces. It is my understanding that the Special \nOperations Command did not even bother coordinating these proposed \nreductions with the leadership of the National Guard Bureau, the Army \nNational Guard, or the active duty Army.\n  I believe this is the first step by the Special Operations Command \nfor the total elimination of Special Forces in the National Guard.\n  The National Guard Special Forces units--the 19th and 20th Groups--\nare made up from the following States: Alabama, Utah, Mississippi, \nFlorida, West Virginia, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, \nVirginia, Washington, Ohio, Rhode Island, California, and Kentucky.\n  These Special Forces groups are at the highest personnel readiness \nlevels in history. Just recently, they proved their mission readiness \nduring Operation Uphold Democracy when they made up over one-half of \nthe U.S. Special Forces presence in Haiti.\n  Mr. President, the Special Operations Command's proposal to reduce \nthese National Guard units does not appear to be based on any thorough \nanalysis of force structure required or cost comparison savings between \nActive Components and Reserve Components units.\n  It was because of decisions like this that Senator Bond and I joined \nSenator Lieberman, Senator McCain and others to co-sponsor an amendment \nto the 1997 Defense authority bill calling for a complete review of our \nmilitary force structure needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from \nthe adjutant general of the State of Kentucky, Gen. John Groves, be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the chairman and ranking member and \ntheir staffs for their assistance in this matter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Commonwealth of Kentucky, Department of Military Affairs, \n           Office of the Adjutant General,\n                                      Frankfort, KY, July 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: I have just become aware of a proposal \n     by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to \n     inactivate two Army National Guard Special Forces Battalions \n     by September 1998. This represents 802 ARNG spaces or one-\n     third of the Army National Guard Special Forces structure.\n       As you may recall, USSOCOM conducted a comprehensive review \n     of requirements during the 1990-92 timeframe. This review \n     identified that two SF Groups were excess to requirements in \n     light of the end of the Cold War. At that time, a \n     determination was made to inactivate one group each from the \n     Guard and USAR. The 1993 Offsite Agreement resulted in a \n     determination that both USAR groups would inactivate and both \n     Guard groups would remain in the structure.\n       Upon inactivation of the two USAR groups, the Adjutants \n     General, with the full support\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\n     of the National Guard Bureau, committed to ensuring that the \n     readiness levels of these two groups were appropriately \n     maintained. This was accomplished by absorbing highly \n     qualified SF soldiers from the inactivating USAR units and \n     intensively managing and resourcing the other shortfalls. \n     Today, the 19th and 20th Groups are at the highest personnel \n     readiness levels in history. Further evidence of their \n     mission readiness was proven during Operation Uphold \n     Democracy, when one-half of the U.S. Special Forces presence \n     in Haiti was from the National Guard.\n       This proposal by USSOCOM to reduce these SF units does not \n     appear to be based on any thorough analysis of force \n     structure required or cost comparison savings between Active \n     Component and Reserve Component units. It seems to be an \n     attempt by USSOCOM to capture dollars at the expense of the \n     Reserve Component without regard to any hard facts. These \n     reductions will most likely jeopardize the ninety-five SF \n     positions in Kentucky. However, the most critical aspect of \n     these reductions is the loss of highly skilled/trained \n     soldiers/units at a considerable savings in OPTEMPO and \n     PERSTEMPO costs at a time when the probability of extensive \n     participation in military operations other than war, such as \n     in Haiti, is at an all-time high. The skills and equipment \n     these soldiers possess to accomplish state and federal \n     missions at minimum costs cannot be overstated.\n       Your assistance in stopping any further reduction in \n     Special Forces Units would be very much appreciated. I am \n     available to discuss this matter or answer any questions you \n     may have either personally or by telephone at your \n     convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John R. Groves, Jr.\n\n                                          Brigadier General, KYNG,\n                                                 Adjutant General.\n       P.S. In order to lose no time, I directed that background \n     materials be sent to you by Fax on 3 July. This letter is my \n     position relative to those materials.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again, this is the same item discussed before. It is \nwhat I would call a preventive amendment and really instructs that the \nfunds cannot be obligated to reduce the number of units of Special \nForces in the Army National Guard for the year 1997, and we believe \nthat it is consistent with existing law. It just indicates that those \nfunds shall be expended for the purpose authorized only.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that \nthis amendment has been cleared and approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4452 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4452) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4572\n\n      (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Army to establish \n subcontracting goals for certain procurement using funds appropriated \n                              by the bill)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Shelby and Mr. Heflin, I \ncall up amendment No. 4572 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Shelby, for \n     himself and Mr. Heflin, proposes an amendment numbered 4572.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a) The Secretay of the Army shall ensure that \n     solicitations for contracts for unrestricted procurement to \n     be entered into using funds appropriated for the Army by this \n     Act include, where appropriate, specific goals for \n     subcontracts with small businesses, small disadvantaged \n     businesses, and women-owned small businesses.\n       (b) The Secretary shall ensure that any subcontract entered \n     into pursuant to a solicitation referred to in subsection (a) \n     that meets a specific goal referred to in that subsection is \n     credited toward the overall goal of the Army for subcontracts \n     with the businesses referred to in that subsection.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment \ndesigned to aid small business in this time of consolidation and \nreduced Federal spending. Over the last few years, as the Army has \nreduced its contracting personnel strength, I have seen larger and \nlarger small business set-aside contracts. This process is known as \nbundling. Unfortunately, when the bundled contract values approach $50 \nmillion annually, the number of firms eligible to compete is greatly \nreduced. The pressure on small businesses is further increased by the \nArmy's failure to place firm small business subcontracting targets in \nits unrestricted requests for proposals.\n  My amendment would, therefore, require the Army to place firm small \nbusiness, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business \nsubcontracting targets in appropriate unrestricted RFP's. These \nsubcontracts would then count toward the Army's small business set-\naside goal. This amendment would not, however, increase the percentage \nof work being set aside for small business.\n  As this amendment is beneficial to small business and will not affect \nthe Army's procurement workload, I hope my colleagues will fully \nsupport it.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared. It \nrelates to small business activities and contracts, and provides \ndisadvantaged businesses and women-owned small businesses a slight \nadvantage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have examined the amendment. There is \nno objection to this amendment from this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4572 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4572) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4564\n\n (Purpose: To require a report from the Secretary of the Air Force and \n          the Director of the Office of Personnel Management)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the clerk to lay before the Senate \nmy amendment No. 4564.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4564.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following \n     general provision:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Secretary of the Air Force and the \n     Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall submit a \n     joint report describing in detail the benefits, allowances, \n     services, and any other forms of assistance which may or \n     shall be provided to any civilian employee of the Federal \n     government or to any private citizen, or to the family of \n     such an individual, who is injured or killed while traveling \n     on an aircraft owned, leased, chartered, or operated by the \n     Government of the United States.\n       (b) The report required by subsection (a) above shall be \n     submitted to the Congressional defense committees and to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of \n     Representatives not later than December 15, 1996.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a general provision which \nrequires the Secretary of the Air Force and the Director of the Office \nof Personnel Management to submit a joint report describing in detail \nthe benefits, allowances, services, and other forms of assistance which \nmay or shall be provided to any civilian employee of the Federal \nGovernment or to any private citizen, or to the family of such an \nindividual, who is injured or killed while traveling in an aircraft \nowned, leased, chartered, or operated by the Government of the United \nStates.\n  This report is to be submitted to the congressional defense \ncommittees, the Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate, and the \nCommittee on Governmental Reform Oversight of the House, no later than \nDecember 15, 1996.\n  This report is needed because we have had some recent accidents--the \nterrible accident involving Commerce Secretary Brown and other \naccidents--of military aircraft on which civilians who were not \nemployees of the Federal Government were killed, as a result of the \naccident.\n  I am seeking a study to determine the fairness of the situation with \nregard to people who may be asked, invited, by the Government to \nperform\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\nwhat amounts to semiofficial tasks, and they are involved in missions \nthat are undertaken on behalf of the United States, and they are killed \nas a result of an aircraft accident.\n  There has been some indications that some of these people do not have \nthe coverage of benefits and other assistance that employees of the \nGovernment have, and that their survivors do not have the assistance of \nthe laws that are in effect for survivors of those who were official \nemployees. I wish to present to the Senate and the Congress next year \nlegislation to see if we can correct this situation.\n  There was a similar concept in World War II that I recall. We called \nthem the dollar-a-year persons. They were placed on the payroll and \nreceived $1 in order that they might be considered government employees \nso their survivors, in the event of disaster, were given the same \nconsideration as the survivors of those who were government employees.\n  I do not ask the Senate, the Congress, at this time, to try to \ncorrect this, because I think there is sort of a patchwork quilt out \nthere of benefits for survivors. I want to be able to consider this \nmatter in the next session, as I indicated.\n  The difficulty is that, in almost all instances, these aircraft are \nmilitary aircraft, but some of them, now, are leased and some of them \nare actually leased for the United States but operated under other \ndepartments than the Department of Defense. So this has to be a \ncomprehensive report for us to see what is, really, the situation under \nthis patchwork quilt that I mentioned, and see if we can find some way \nto be fair and treat these survivors honorably, without regard to which \nagency of the Federal Government was in charge of the aircraft and \nwithout regard to whether or not they were, in fact, employees of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that \nthis measure has been cleared and approved by both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, amendment No. 4564 \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4564) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4550\n\n    (Purpose: To require a report on meeting Department of Defense \n               procurements of propellant raw materials)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n4550 be called up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4550.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a) Not later than March 1, 1997, the Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the defense Committees a \n     report on Department of Defense procurement of propellant raw \n     materials.\n       (b) The report shall include the following:\n       (1) The projected future requirements of the Department of \n     Defense for propellant raw materials, such as nitrocellulose.\n       (2) The capacity, ability, and production cost rates of the \n     national technology and industrial base, including \n     Government-owned, contractor-operated facilities, contractor \n     owned and operated facilities, and Government-owned, \n     Government-operated facilities, for meeting such \n     requirements.\n       (3) The national security benefits of preserving in the \n     national technology and industrial base contractor owned and \n     operated facilities for producing propellant raw materials, \n     including nitrocellulose.\n       (4) The extent to which the cost rates for production of \n     nitrocellulose in Government-owned, contractor-operated \n     facilities is lower because of the relationship of those \n     facilities with the Department of Defense that such rates \n     would be without that relationship.\n       (5) The advantages and disadvantages of permitting \n     commercial facilities to compete for award of Department of \n     Defense contracts for procurement of propellant raw \n     materials, such as nitrocellulose.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the \nmanagers of this bill in approving this amendment. The amendment is \nstraightforward. It asks the Deputy Secretary of Defense to provide a \nreport, not later than March 1, 1997, to the Defense committees on \nexamining the advantages and disadvantages of allowing commercial \nfacilities to compete for future contracts of propellant raw material \nrequirements, such as nitrocellulose.\n  The report shall include an assessment of first, the projected future \nprocurement requirements for propellant raw material, such as \nnitrocellulose; second, the capacity, ability, and production cost \nrates of the national technology and industrial base to satisfy DOD \nrequirements; third, the national security advantage of preserving \ncontractor owned, contractor operated facilities as part of the \nindustrial base; and finally, the extent to which government owned, \ncontractor operated rates for nitrocellulose are reduced as a result of \ntheir relationship with the DOD.\n  Nitrocellulose is the basic chemical in the propellant mixture that \nprovides the propulsion power for a projectile or cartridge, such as \nfor the 120 millimeter target practice cartridge used on the M1A2 tank \nfor gunnery training.\n  Because of the shrinking Defense procurement budget, the Department \nof the Army had directed the production of propellant to its Government \nowned, contractor operated facility located at the Radford Army \nAmmunition Plant in Virginia in order to keep its industrial base \noperating. However, this decision has precluded a commercial facility \nin my home State from competing for certain grades of nitrocellulose. \nThis commercial facility wants to compete for future contracts \nbeginning in fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. President, this study is intended to make information available \nto help the Congress and the administration make an informed decision \non this issue in the future. Therefore, Mr. President, I am pleased \nthat my colleagues support this amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment calls for a report on DOD \nprocurement of propellant raw materials such as nitrocellulose.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have examined this. There have been \nsome technical changes made at our request. We do not object to the \namendment offered on behalf of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4550 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4550) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4534\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Air Force to carry out a \n       cost-benefit analysis of consolidating the ground station \n          infrastructure supporting polar orbiting satellites)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call before the Senate amendment No. \n4534, offered by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4534.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Not later than six months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force shall \n     submit to Congress a cost-benefit analysis of consolidating \n     the ground station infrastructure of the Air Force that \n     supports polar orbiting satellites.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment \nthat deals with requiring a report from the Air Force on the cost-\nbenefit analysis of consolidating the ground station infrastructure of \nthe Air Force that supports polar orbiting satellites. At present, \nthere are several. We seek\n\n[[Page S7936]]\n\nto discover whether it would be cost effective to consolidate those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared and \napproved by both managers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, amendment No. 4534 \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4534) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have just completed a series of \namendments that would have taken about--well, about 12 hours under \ncloture. So I am grateful to the Senate for an opportunity to proceed \nwith our bill.\n  I would now like to announce to the Senate we would like Members who \nhave amendments that they wish to present that have not been cleared to \ncome to the floor. We will be pleased to consider any amendment and see \nif we can handle it as expeditiously as we have these that we have \npresented to the Senate. I might add, many of those amendments were \nmodified substantially before we agreed to them.\n  So we look forward to that opportunity with regard to the rest of \nthese amendments that have been filed before cloture. The leaders, I am \ninformed, will look at this situation somewhere around 1 o'clock to \ndetermine whether we should proceed with our cloture vote.\n  At present, I think we could announce to the Senate, from the way we \nlook at the amendments that have been submitted to us for review and \nwere submitted to the Senate under the cloture procedure, if we work \ncooperatively we should be able to finish this bill by 7 or 8 o'clock \ntonight. We can do that by limiting the amount of time a Member might \nseek for the debate of an amendment or by assuring Members we will be \nmore than pleased to attempt to work with them to alter the form of the \namendments so we could agree to an amendment and take it to conference.\n  I am sure my friend from Hawaii joins me in urging Members now to \ncome to the floor to present controversial amendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S7928-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7936-S7937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING DR. LEROY T. WALKER\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides. I \nask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of a Senate resolution that I submitted earlier today, \nSenate Resolution 279.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 279) to commend Dr. LeRoy T. Walker \n     for his service as President of the U.S. Olympic Committee \n     and his lifelong dedication to the improvement of amateur \n     athletic opportunities in the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have submitted this Senate resolution to commend and \nthank Dr. LeRoy T. Walker, the current president of the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee, for his contribution to amateur sports in the United States.\n  Dr. Walker has been the USOC president since 1992, and has been \ninvolved with the USOC since 1977. He is the first African-American to \nbe the USOC President in the 100-year history of the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee.\n  Dr. Walker started working for the U.S. Olympic Committee the year \nbefore the Congress enacted the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. That was a \nbill I introduced in the Senate, Mr. President.\n  That act marked the beginning of the modern Olympics in the United \nStates.\n  Dr. Walker has been the leader in carrying out Congress' vision for \nthe modern Olympic movement through the Amateur Sports Act.\n  He has brought the U.S. Olympic Committee from an era where its \nbudget was in the tens of millions to its most recent budget in the \nhundreds of millions.\n  Athletes in the late 1970's were a different kind of amateur than \ntoday's Olympians who are able to earn millions of dollars in \nendorsements, and whose fame is far greater due to the substantial \ntelevision coverage that we now enjoy.\n  The Olympics have gone from being held once every 4 years to once \nevery 2 years, with the staggered Summer and Winter Olympics schedule.\n  Dr. Walker has guided the Olympic movement in the United States and \nin the world through these significant changes and growth.\n  The resolution that I have submitted mentions many of Dr. Walker's \naccomplishments with the U.S. Olympics and with other amateur sports \norganizations over the years.\n  Let me speak briefly on some of the remarkable things Senators may \nnot know about my friend, Dr. Walker.\n  Dr. Walker was the youngest of 13 children raised in Harlem during \nthe Great Depression. He was the first person in his family to earn a \ncollege degree in 1940.\n  Not only did he earn the degree, but he graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Benedict College in just 3\\1/2\\ years. During that time, he earned \n12 varsity letters in football, basketball, and track and field during \nthat same time.\n  Dr. Walker was selected as an All-American quarterback in 1938, but \nkept the fact that he even played football a secret from his mother \nuntil his commencement because she was worried he would get hurt.\n  He earned a masters degree from Columbia in 1941. Columbia did not \nallow African Americans to earn doctoral degrees at that time, so Dr. \nWalker went to New York University to earn his Ph.D.\n  He was only the second African American to earn a Ph.D. at New York \nUniversity.\n  Before Dr. Walker became involved with the U.S. Olympic Committee, he \nhad one of the most remarkable coaching careers in the history of \nsports in the United States.\n  In all, he has coached football, basketball, and track teams that \nproduced over 80 All-Americans, 40 national champions and 10 Olympians.\n  He coached or consulted the Olympic track teams of Israel in 1960, \nEthiopia in 1960, Trinidad-Tobago in 1964, Jamaica in 1968, Kenya in \n1972, and served as the head men's coach of the U.S. Olympic track and \nfield team in Montreal in 1976.\n  Any one of Dr. Walker's achievements--whether his own athletic \nsuccesses, his coaching accomplishments and his academic endeavors--not \nto mention his service with the U.S. Olympic Committee--would be a \ngreat achievement for most of us.\n  Dr. Walker has made those achievements look routine.\n  We commend him today for his leadership in preparing the United \nStates for the 1996 Olympics and for preparing the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee for the challenges of the 21st Century.\n  Dr. Walker is the 23d president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and \ntruly is one of the founding fathers of amateur sports in the United \nStates.\n  His tenure as U.S. Olympic Committee President, and his long and \ndistinguished career in amateur sports, will be capped off with the \n1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, GA, which begin shortly.\n  It will be my pleasure to go to Atlanta on Wednesday to deliver to \nDr. Walker the resolution I am presenting to the Senate today.\n  I hope the Senate will join me in support of this resolution \ncommending and thanking Dr. Walker for all that he has done for amateur \nsports in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution \nS. Res. 279.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a) Consideration of Percentage of Work \n     Performed in the United States.--None of the funds \n     appropriated to the Department of Defense under this Act may \n     be obligated or expended to evaluate competitive proposals \n     submitted in response to solicitations for a contracts for \n     the procurement of property or services except when it is \n     made known to the Federal official having authority to \n     obligate or expend such funds that--\n       (1) a factor in such evaluation, as stated in the \n     solicitation, is the percentage of work under the contract \n     that the offeror plans to perform in the United States; and\n       (2) a high importance is assigned to such factor.\n       (b) Breach of Contract for Transferring Work Outside the \n     United States.--None of the funds appropriated to the \n     Department of Defense under this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to procure property or services except when it is \n     made known to the Federal official having authority to \n     obligate or expend such funds that each contract for the \n     procurement of property or services includes a clause \n     providing that the contractor is deemed to have breached the \n     contract if the contractor performs significantly less work \n     in the United States than the contractor stated, in its \n     response to the solicitation for the contract, that it \n     planned to perform in the United States.\n       (c) Effect of Breach on Contract Awards and the Exercise of \n     Options Under Covered Contracts.--None of the funds \n     appropriated to the Department of Defense under this Act may \n     be obligated or expended to award a contract or exercise an \n     option under a contract, except when it is made known to the \n     Federal official having authority to obligate or expend such \n     funds that the compliance of the contractor with its \n     commitment to perform a specific percentage of work under \n     such a contract inside the United States is a factor of high \n     importance in any evaluation of the contractor's past \n     performance for the purposes of the contract award or the \n     exercise of the option.\n       (d) Requirement for Offerors to Perform Estimate.--None of \n     the funds appropriated to the Department of Defense under \n     this Act may be obligated or expended to award a contract for \n     the procurement of property or services unless the \n     solicitation for the contract contains a clause requiring \n     each offerer to provide an estimate of the percentage of work \n     that the offeror will perform in the United States.\n       (e) Waivers.--\n       (1) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with \n     respect to funds appropriated to the Department of Defense \n     under this Act when it is made known to the Federal official \n     having authority to obligate or expend such funds that an \n     emergency situation or the national security interests of the \n     United States requires the obligation or expenditure of such \n     funds.\n       (2) Subsections (a), (b) and (c) may be waived on a \n     subsection-by-subsection basis for all contracts described in \n     subsection (f) if the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense--\n       (A) makes a written determination, on a nondelegable basis, \n     that--\n       (1) the subsection cannot be implemented in a manner that \n     is consistent with the obligations of the United States under \n     existing Reciprocal Procurement Agreements with defense \n     allies; and\n       (2) the implementation of the subsection in a manner that \n     is inconsistent with existing Reciprocal Procurement \n     Agreements would result in a net loss of work performed in \n     the United States; and\n       (B) reports to the Congress, within 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, on the reasons for such \n     determinations.\n       (f) Scope of Coverage.--This section applies--\n       (1) to any contract for any amount greater than the \n     simplified acquisition threshold (as specified in section \n     2302(7) of title 10, United States Code), other than a \n     contract for a commercial item as defined in section \n     2302(3)(I); and\n       (2) to any contract for items described in section \n     2534(a)(5) of such title.\n       (g) Construction.--Subsections (a), (b), and (c) may not be \n     construed to diminish the primary importance of \n     considerations of quality in the procurement of defense-\n     related property or services.\n       (h) Effective Date.--This section shall apply with respect \n     to contracts entered into on or after 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that tries to make our \npresent Buy American Act effective on defense contracts. What it says \nis that when a defense contractor submits a bill, the defense \ncontractor should indicate what percentage of that contract is going to \nbe manufactured here in the United States, and then that should be a \nhigh factor in the determination by the Defense Department in \nconsideration for that contract. And we also make clear that this is \nnot to violate any agreement, any treaty we have with any other country \nand any memorandum of understanding we have with any other country.\n  The reality is that the Buy American Act just has not worked. I had \nthe experience of being on an American base and seeing a truck made in \nanother country, a U.S. military truck there, and I thought, you know, \nwe really ought to be buying trucks made in the United States of \nAmerica. That is just one small illustration.\n  I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the Maritime Trades Department, from the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, from the International \nUnion of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture \nWorkers, from the AFL-CIO, and a letter from the Timken Co.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\n\n         Maritime Trades Department, American Federation of Labor \n           and Congress of Industrial Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate takes up the FY97 defense \n     appropriations bill, it will consider an amendment designed \n     to provide preference to Department of Defense (DOD) \n     contractors who maintain significant domestic production \n     capabilities. The Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO (MTD) \n     urges adoption of this amendment, which will be offered by \n     Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) to help maintain the defense \n     industrial base.\n       If adopted, this provision will provide a mechanism for \n     assuring the American public that the nation's defense \n     dollars are being utilized to provide the highest possible \n     level of domestic employment. This is an important point to \n     consider. Since 1987, over one million skilled American \n     workers in the defense industry have lost their employment. \n     These job losses resulted from military downsizing and, to a \n     growing extent, American defense firms' expanding use of \n     overseas outsourcing to fulfill their contractual \n     obligations. In 1995, over $1.3 billion in foreign \n     subcontracts and purchases were made as part of DOD \n     contracts.\n       The Simon amendment requires the DOD to consider projected \n     levels of domestic production when evaluating competitive \n     procurement proposals. Defense firms are expected to reach \n     stated domestic targets. In the event foreign outsourcing is \n     significantly higher than declared, they may be deemed \n     ineligible for renewal of that contract. The amendment also \n     contains appropriate waivers for national security and \n     international emergencies and provisions to guarantee the \n     primacy of product quality in defense procurement decisions.\n       These requirements are hardly onerous when one realizes \n     what is at stake. Americans working in this strategic field \n     possess unique industrial skills that are vital to our \n     nation's future, but their employment opportunities are being \n     jeopardized by unfair trade and low-cost, heavily subsidized \n     foreign competition. The aerospace industry, long considered \n     the linchpin of our defense industrial system, may suffer the \n     loss of 250,000 jobs by the year 2000.\n       Aside from the economic consideration involved, it simply \n     is unacceptable for the DOD to allow defense contractors to \n     increase their dependence on foreign-source military \n     equipment and services. It is in this nation's vital interest \n     to maintain a viable network of skilled defense workers so \n     that our armed forces can respond to any contingency in an \n     increasingly unstable world. Other nations understand this \n     need, and until recently, so did America. Essentially, the \n     Simon amendment would provide the necessary framework to \n     insure that precious defense dollars be use to underwrite a \n     competitive American base.\n       In closing, the MTD and its affiliates urge you to support \n     the Simon amendment when it is considered as part of the FY97 \n     defense appropriations measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Michael Sacco,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                             Machinists and Aerospace Workers,\n\n                                Upper Marlboro, MD, June 24, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing on behalf of the International \n     Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to voice our \n     strong support for an amendment to defense appropriations \n     sponsored by Senator Paul Simon. The amendment, which has \n     already passed the House of Representatives, is needed to \n     maintain the integrity of defense spending by enabling U.S. \n     taxpayers to know how much of their money is used to retain \n     and create jobs in the United States.\n       Specifically, the Simon amendment would require contractors \n     to state during the bidding process what percentage of work \n     performed under a defense contract would be kept in the U.S. \n     The amendment further provides that if a contractor is \n     awarded the contract and fails to honor its commitment, it \n     would be considered to be in breach of the contract and \n     render itself ineligible for contract renewal.\n       This amendment makes good sense. American taxpayers should \n     know whether they are funding defense programs that result in \n     jobs at home. The current practice which permits defense \n     contractors to operate in a shadow by engaging in the \n     practice of seeking subcontractors outside the U.S. to \n     perform portions of their contracts must be put to a stop. \n     This practice has resulted in increased profits for the \n     defense contractor with no savings passed along to the U.S. \n     taxpayer. Most importantly, it has resulted in the loss of \n     major opportunities for U.S. workers.\n       As jobs in the defense industry continue to be drastically \n     reduced, this issue has become even more important. Total \n     employment in the private sector defense industry declined by \n     more than one million workers between 1987 and 1995. Defense \n     related employment for aircraft, missiles, space vehicles, \n     and related parts today is less than half of what it was in \n     1987. At the same time defense related employment is \n     declining, government expenditures on defense and defense \n     related projects involving work performed abroad continues to \n     soar.\n       Defense contractors should not be in the business of \n     subcontracting technology and shipping work, funded by U.S. \n     taxpayers, offshore. Senators should, at the very least, be \n     aware of the economic impact that large defense contracts \n     will have on local communities and this impact should be a \n     major factor in awarding contracts.\n       The Simon amendment accomplishes this goal by merely \n     obligating a defense contractor to state what percentage of \n     the contract's work will be performed in the U.S. It serves \n     as a ``truth in lending'' provision and will force a \n     contractor to be honest with itself and the United States \n     taxpayer before it submits a bid on federal government \n     defense work.\n       The American people have a right to know--will their money \n     be going to create good and decent jobs at home, or will it \n     be going to pay for subcontracted defense work abroad? Once \n     again we urge your support for the Simon amendment.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               George J. Kourpias,\n     International President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, \n           Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the working men and women of the \n     International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, \n     Machine & Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO, I urge your support for \n     an amendment to defense appropriations to be offered by \n     Senator Paul Simon. This amendment, which has already passed \n     the House of Representatives, will enable the American public \n     to know whether their tax dollars are creating good-paying \n     defense jobs here in the United States, or whether they are \n     subsidizing foreign operations.\n       Specifically, the Simon amendment would require contractors \n     during the bidding process to disclose what percentage of \n     work to be performed under a given defense contract would be \n     kept in the United States. It further provides that this \n     percentage be a factor in the awarding of the contract, and \n     that the failure of a contractor to honor its commitment, \n     constitutes a breach of the contract, rendering the \n     contractor ineligible for contract renewal.\n       This amendment makes good common sense. American taxpayers \n     should have the right to know whether they are funding \n     defense programs which result in jobs at home. This amendment \n     would put an end to current practice which permits defense \n     contractors, without the public's knowledge, to ship work to \n     subcontractors outside of the United States. While defense \n     contractors have been the beneficiaries in the form of \n     enormous profits, the American worker has been the loser.\n       Indeed, as defense work continues to decline in this \n     country, this issue will become of increased importance. \n     Between 1987 and 1995, total employment declined by more than \n     one million workers in the private sector defense industry. \n     Today, defense-related employment for aircraft, missiles, \n     space vehicles, and related parts today is less than half of \n     what it was in 1987.\n       With jobs and job stability a major concern of all workers \n     in this country, the American people should have the right to \n     know whether their hard-earned tax dollars will be used to \n     create good-paying jobs at home, or whether they will be used \n     to subsidize operations overseas. I strongly urge your \n     support for the Simon amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William H. Bywater,\n     International Union President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                      Washington, DC July 1, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) will offer an \n     amendment to the DOD appropriations bill, S. 1894, that would \n     help retain defense manufacturing capacity in the United \n     States. A similar amendment has already passed the House of \n     Representatives. The AFL-CIO strongly supports the Simon \n     amendment.\n       Offshore production of United States defense products is an \n     increasing concern to defense workers as well as defense \n     strategists. The Simon amendment would give a contract \n     preference to manufacturers who promise to build in the \n     United States. Contracts would be required to disclose what \n     percentage of their product would be manufactured in the \n     U.S., and they would be held accountable for that percentage \n     for the duration of that contract. If a contractor failed to \n     meet its domestic production commitment, it would be \n     ineligible to renew that contract.\n       The Simon amendment makes good sense by protecting defense \n     jobs, retaining the United States defense industrial base and \n     enhancing protection for advanced technologies by keeping \n     them in the United States. It also provides reasonable waiver \n     authority and excludes contracts under $100,000.\n       At a time of defense downsizing, it makes little sense to \n     continue hollowing out our defense manufacturing capability. \n     Therefore the AFL-CLO strongly endorses the Simon amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Peggy Taylor,\n     Director, Department of Legisltion.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               The Timken Co.,\n\n                                                     July 9, 1996.\n\n       I am writing to express the strong support of the Timken \n     Company for an amendment to be offered by Senator Paul Simon \n     during consideration of the Defense Appropriations\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\n     bill for Fiscal Year 1997. The provision is similar to the \n     Durbin amendment accepted by the House in their FY97 spending \n     bill and would provide accountability by U.S. Government \n     agencies in defense procurement contracts.\n       Under existing law and regulation, Americans are guaranteed \n     that their tax dollars will be used by the Department of \n     Defense in the procurement of goods and services in a manner \n     that maintains the ability to produce certain products \n     critical to our nation's defense. The purpose of these \n     statutes is to sustain our national security and economy by \n     helping to preserve the defense industrial base and the high-\n     skilled, high wage jobs associated with it.\n       Unfortunately, there is no mechanism, now under law, the \n     enforce these laws. Foreign producers consistently violate \n     the statute by including products in U.S. defense systems \n     that were mandated by Congress to be produced within the \n     United States. The effect is a short term cost savings of the \n     Pentagon with a permanent weakening of or industrial base. \n     Such foreign sourcing of key products causes American \n     producers to discontinue needed research and development, as \n     well as reduce domestic capacity. We slowly become vulnerable \n     by losing our long-term ability to produce critical defense \n     systems.\n       For example, in late June, Defense Secretary Perry \n     announced that the department would conduct an internal \n     review of the possible illegal use of foreign high technology \n     bearings in U.S. missile systems (such as the patriot missile \n     and various air to air missile systems). Because these \n     bearings are essential for the systems to work, U.S. law \n     requires U.S.-made bearings to be used, when available, in \n     missiles procured by the U.S. government. It is only after \n     widespread abuse that this case received the attention \n     necessary within the Congress and the Administration to \n     prompt action. How many other situations simply go unnoticed \n     and unreported? Clearly, the law must be better enforced.\n       The Simon amendment addresses the issue, by providing that \n     the percentage of work a defense contractor plans to perform \n     in the U.S. will be an important factor in the evaluation of \n     bids; a defense contract will be deemed to have been breached \n     if a contractor performs significantly less work in the U.S. \n     than promised in its contract solicitation; and such a \n     contractor will also be ineligible to have that contract \n     renewed.\n       The amendment can be waived in a national emergency or for \n     national security reasons. Also there is specific reference \n     to not construing the provision in a manner that diminishes \n     the primary importance of quality in the product being \n     procured.\n       Your strong support of the Simon amendment is requested for \n     a strong America. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Robert Lapp.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, here is a defense contractor. Let me just \nread one paragraph here.\n\n       I am writing to express the strong support of the Timken \n     Company for an amendment to be offered by Senator Paul Simon \n     during consideration of the Defense Appropriations bill for \n     Fiscal Year 1997. . . .\n       Unfortunately, there is no mechanism, now under law, to \n     enforce these [Buy American] laws. Foreign producers \n     consistently violate the statute by including products in \n     U.S. defense systems that were mandated by Congress to be \n     produced within the United States. The effect is a short term \n     cost savings for the Pentagon with a permanent weakening of \n     our industrial base. Such foreign sourcing of key products \n     causes American producers to discontinue needed research and \n     development, as well as reduce domestic capacity. We slowly \n     become vulnerable by losing our long-term ability to produce \n     critical defense systems.\n\n  I think this is a security issue.\n  What would happen, practically, when a company submits a bid, they \nwould have to submit that they are going to spend 70 percent, 80 \npercent, or whatever percent of this contract in the United States. \nThen, when the Defense Department reviews the contract, that should be \na high factor--not the sole factor, but a high factor--in determining \nwhere the manufacturing should go.\n  If a company submits a bid saying, ``We are going to produce 80 \npercent in the United States,'' and then they produce 20 percent in the \nUnited States, that would be considered a breach of contract, and it \nwould have to be considered in any future contracts by that company. I \nthink it makes sense.\n  A recent GAO study in April of 1996 found that other countries are \nmuch more pressing in terms of their defense establishment in how they \ninsist their defense money is spent within their own country. The GAO \nfound out, among other things, that U.S. companies have entered into \noffset agreements totaling more than $84 billion since the mid-1980's. \nIn order to get a contract in another country, we have agreed to $84 \nbillion in manufacturing and purchasing of their products in another \ncountry.\n  I understand why some companies want to go abroad. China pays an \naverage of $50 a month. Wichita, KS, now makes part of what it made in \nWichita, KS, in China. I understand the cost savings there. We are not \nsaying that cost savings cannot be a factor, but that a high factor has \nto be how much is manufactured in the United States.\n  As the president of Timken Company said, there is a security factor \nhere. We need to maintain our industrial base, our research. I am told \nthat the McDonnell Douglas facility in St. Louis, where 500 employees \nhave just been laid off, the company is subcontracting work to Finland, \nSpain, Australia, Germany and Switzerland for the F-18.\n  Now, we are not saying that none of this work can go abroad. We are \njust saying it ought to be upfront in the contract.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Specter and Senator Harkin as \ncosponsors of this legislation. I hope it will be adopted by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am sad to announce to the Senate that \nthe Department of Defense has requested that we oppose this amendment \nbecause it would impose a burdensome and relevant complication on the \nevaluation process. This is a very difficult process to work out.\n  The United States sells over $14 billion in military equipment \noverseas. We import about $1.3 billion. It is obvious that we have a \nsubstantial interest in continuing exports which lower the unit cost of \nour production that we must buy to maintain our own defense. The \ndefense industry that is engaged in the export also has asked us to \noppose this amendment.\n  If a contractor selects a U.S. contractor and the U.S. contractor \ngoes out of business or cannot perform and there is no other U.S. \nsource, the net effect of this amendment would prohibit the prime \ncontractor from seeking a subcontractor abroad from the country of one \nof our allies.\n  This is a similar provision to the House bill. It will be in \nconference, and we will work out some of this issue in conference. \nContrary to some of the reports I read in some of the papers this \nmorning, the Defense Subcommittee does still confer, and we confer at \nlength and ad nauseam sometimes, but we will confer on the issue \nbecause it is a House bill.\n\n  One of the basic problems that we have is if we interfere with the \nprime contractor's ability to select the best subcontractor available, \nwe are not only imposing a burden on the contractor to respond to a \nsolicitation that he has presented based upon availability of \ncompetitive bidding from subcontractors, the net result, Mr. President, \nwill be the increase in costs of the defense efforts of the United \nStates, to the taxpayers of the United States.\n  I view this amendment as being one which is very difficult to deal \nwith because it is so appealing. What we are saying is the DOE policy \nwith regard to evaluation factors would be legislated by Congress in \nsuch a way as to eliminate the ability of a contractor to look to a \nforeign source for a portion of the work that contractor commits to do \non behalf of the Department of Defense at the taxpayers' expense and, \nby definition, a competitive contract.\n  I believe this will nullify existing procurement agreements that we \nhave. We have some 20 longstanding allies who buy a considerable amount \nof their military products from us. To a great extent, we see enormous \nentities in the industrial base. In the United States, many of the \nsubcontractors are from overseas.\n  This Senator and other Senators have been criticized for going to \nthings like air shows, for instance. We go to trade shows and air shows \nto see who is out there, what is the strength of the United States vis-\na-vis the foreign supplier, and are we correct to the extent that we \nare even buying the $1.3 billion that we buy from overseas through the \nuse of taxpayers' funds, and directly by our contractors who do buy \nfrom subcontractors overseas.\n  I personally believe this is a very strong export business. Let me \nsay, it is a $14 billion export we are looking\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nat. That export is a strong, strong portion of our industrial base. It \nrepresents a strong portion of our industrial base. If we were to adopt \nthe approach of the Senator from Illinois and the approach represented \nin the House bill totally, in my judgment, we would place at risk this \nstrong export business. Therefore, I am sad to say I intend to move to \ntable the amendment, subject to the comments of my friend from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at first blush, one must conclude this is \na good amendment. In general, it says we Americans will purchase \nAmerican goods. It is a very patriotic amendment. However, Mr. \nPresident, it is not a realistic amendment.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee has pointed out, we sell our \nallies and other friends over $14 billion worth of defense products. In \nreturn, we have purchased $1.8 billion. As everyone in this Chamber \nwill say, trade is a two-way street. We cannot insist our allies \npurchase everything from us and we not purchase anything from them. If \nwe were the only producers in the world, we may be able to dictate \nterms and impose our will on the rest of the world, but there are many \nother countries that are involved in defense production.\n  This amendment of my friend from Illinois does provide the Secretary \nof Defense the authority to waive provisions of this amendment for NATO \nallies--for Israel, for Egypt, for Japan, and for Korea. But we do a \nlot of business with countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, \nIndonesia, all of South America, and all of Central America, and we may \nreach a point where we may find these friends of ours responding to our \nstrict restrictions by saying: Well, if that is the way you feel about \nit, Mr. U.S., we will buy our aircraft from France. The Mirage is just \nas good. Or we might buy it from Britain. They are just as good.\n  So, Mr. President, though at first blush this may seem like a very \npatriotic amendment, the effect may be one that none of us would want \nto happen to our industry. We may be the loser. So I join my chairman \nin this motion to table this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas--\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will withhold. I know the Senator from \nIllinois may want to speak. We are trying to work out a time to stack \nvotes for a later time because there are some meetings going on that \nthe leaders are involved in, as I understand it.\n  I will just add this comment to my friend from Illinois. We now are \nbecoming an industrial center for investment by foreign producers, \nwhether it is in automobiles, aviation parts, or other types of \nproduction. We are reducing our industrial base. After all, we have \nreduced the amount of money spent by the taxpayers of the United States \nfor procurement of military goods by 60 percent in the last 10 years. \nWe have reduced it 60 percent. Now our industrial base is shrinking. As \nit shrinks, some of the foreign investors and foreign manufacturers are \ncoming into our country and opening plants to take advantage of the \nexpertise of our labor force, and they are producing some of the parts \nthat we are exporting. This is saying to those same people who are \ninvesting in this country, creating jobs and preserving jobs here in \nour industrial base: That is fine. You can produce it here and we will \nexport it, but you cannot bring into this country and compete with this \ncountry on subcontractors. I really think that is not the right policy.\n  So while it will be a very difficult thing to convince the Members of \nthe House to modify this, that is what we intend to do. We will not be \nable to do that if this amendment is adopted. We will have no \nnegotiating room with the House at all. The export business of the \nUnited States is of sufficient importance that we must find a way. I do \nbelieve that, with the good will that exists in the House, we will find \na way to reflect the concept that the House seeks, which is that we \nknow what we are doing when these contracts are let, and that there \nliterally be competition. But as long as we are insisting on \ncompetition, I do not think we ought to say we only want competition \nfrom U.S. sources when we are providing so much of the overseas market, \nas far as these military acquisitions are concerned.\n  I urge Members to travel with us and look at this. It is an enormous \nmarket that we serve. Our military-industrial complex not only serves \nthe military market abroad, but by producing the parts for aircraft, \nand parts for various types of vehicles we use, parts for our \nsubmarines, we are the parts supplier of the world.\n  This amendment would put that in great jeopardy, and I think it \nshould be tabled at the appropriate time. I will make the motion to \ntable at the appropriate time. I want to defer that until I get an \nindication from the leadership of the proper time to request that the \nvote take place.\n\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I buy many of the arguments that my friends \nfrom Hawaii and Alaska used. I voted for NAFTA. I voted for GATT. In \ngeneral, we have to have reciprocity in terms of trade. But we also \nhave, in theory, a Buy American Act, which is, frankly, toothless. So I \nthink we need something that is a little stronger.\n  Let me add that this amendment is more narrowly crafted than the \nHouse amendment. The House amendment introduced by my House colleague, \nCongressman Dick Durbin, is stronger than this amendment. But this \namendment at least says, let us find out what percentages are made in \nthe United States and what percentages abroad.\n  In response to my friend from Alaska, who said this is going to mean \na lot of work, I have a news release--and it is fairly typical--from \nthe Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense about various \ncontracts. Here is a contract awarded to McDonnell Douglas that says, \n``Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri, 70 percent, and in the \nUnited Kingdom, 30 percent.'' So they are doing some of this right now. \nAll we are saying is that the percent that is manufactured in the \nUnited States should be of high importance--not the sole consideration, \nbut should be of high importance.\n  Here is another one. Refinery Associates of Texas. ``Work will be \nperformed in overseas locations.''\n  Here is another contract that says, ``Work will be performed 43 \npercent in Germany, 30 percent in Alabama, 22 percent in Michigan, 4 \npercent in California.''\n  So they are doing these things now. What we are doing is just \nignoring how much is made in the United States. Here is another \ncontrast as to how much would be done in the United States, how much in \nGermany, how much in England, how much in Italy, how much in Korea, how \nmuch in Australia. So they are doing this now. This is not an undue \nburden.\n  Now, one argument they make is that this may cost a little more. It \nmay cost a little more. I do not know what they pay for that foreign \ntruck on an American base. Maybe we save a few dollars. But I think \nthat when it comes to defense dollars, insofar as practically possible, \nwe ought to be spending that money here at home. That is the reality. \nAgain, I stress that there is a waiver where we have agreements with \nother countries and memoranda of understanding with other countries for \nany kind of emergency. I think this makes sense, and I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me just list some major sales in the \ntime we have. As we listened to the Senator from Illinois, I made a \nlist. These are recent major sales:\n  C-130J to Britain, AH-64 Apache to Britain, AH-64 Apache to \nNetherlands, F-16 to South Korea, Corp-San development with Germany, F-\n18 to Australia, F-18 to Spain, AV-8B co-production with Britain and \nSpain. That is the British area being built in the United States, a co-\nproduction with Britain and Spain. And the MLRS rockets, which are so \nimportant to the Senator from Arkansas, to Germany and to Britain.\n  Now, that is just 5 seconds of thinking about what we are doing. The \nimpact of this amendment places those in jeopardy.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I am constrained to say that, the other night, a \ngood friend of mine, who is a very intelligent person from academia, \ntold me, ``You know, as we reduce our industrial base, if you in \nCongress continue to put restrictions on our American industry\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nso it cannot enter into cooperative agreements abroad, we will see the \nday come when we will be procuring all of our systems from abroad, \nbecause technology follows production.''\n  Technology follows production. As we produce, we refine our systems, \nwe develop new technology. If we are not involved in this production, \nwe will not be able to afford the development costs and research costs \nto refine it. If we want to remain a leader in terms of production--\nparticularly now of aircraft, submarine, and military vehicles--we are \ngoing to have to understand that our allies throughout the world, who \nare buying our major projects, are going to insist that they be \ninvolved somehow in this overall business.\n  Today, as I indicated, the balance is over $14 billion that we export \nversus about $1.3 billion we import. I do not believe that this \namendment in its present form is in the best interest of the United \nStates, and therefore I oppose it.\n  Mr. President, I will put the Senate on notice that unless the leader \ndisagrees, we will call for the vote in 10 minutes, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum in the meantime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4569\n\n   (Purpose: To impose additional conditions on the authority to pay \n             restructuring costs under defense contracts.)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in behalf of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Bradley], I ask for the immediate consideration of amendment No. \n4569.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The amendment will be considered.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Bradley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4569.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (1) Not later than April 1, 1997, the \n     Comptroller General shall, in consultation with the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Secretary of Labor, submit to Congress a \n     report which shall include the following:\n       (A) an analysis and breakdown of the restructuring costs \n     paid by or submitted to the Department of Defense to \n     companies involved in business combinations since 1993;\n       (B) an analysis of the specific costs associated with \n     workforce reductions;\n       (C) an analysis of the services provided to the workers \n     affected by business combinations;\n       (D) an analysis of the effectiveness of the restructuring \n     costs used to assist laid off workers in gaining employment;\n       (E) in accordance with Section 818 of 10 U.S.C. 2324, an \n     analysis of the savings reached from the business combination \n     relative to the restructuring costs paid by the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (2) The report should set forth recommendations to make \n     this program more effective for workers affected by business \n     combinations and more efficient in terms of the use of \n     federal dollars.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I offer an amendment regarding a \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] policy of paying restructuring costs to \ncompanies that are involved in a merger.\n  Mr. State of New Jersey is currently feeling the effects of a \ndefense-industry merger. As a result of the Lockheed-Martin merger, a \nsatellite plant in East Windsor, NJ, will close, causing substantial \njob loss. I have therefore taken a strong interest in the current DOD \npolicy.\n  Under this policy, DOD reimburses restructuring costs to contractors \nthat are involved in mergers that lead to savings for the DOD. DOD \npayments can be used for, among other things, worker and plant \nrelocation, severance pay, early retirement incentives, and continued \nhealth benefits. This policy has been called payoffs for layoffs and \nblamed by some for the mergers in the industry.\n  It is my belief that layoffs in the defense industry do not result \nfrom this DOD policy. Rather, due to the end of the cold war, defense \nlayoffs have become inevitable. While we are no longer faced with a \nSoviet threat, we must now come to terms with our runaway debt. These \nmajor transformnations--the end of the cold war and a spiraling budget \ndeficit--have made job loss in the defense industry a reality and \nnecessity.\n  It is my belief that this policy makes good sense. Defense cuts have \nled to overcapacity, which encouraged mergers and cost cutting. It is \nnot the reimbursement but the defense cuts that lead to layoffs, and it \nis appropriate for DOD to pay a fraction of those savings for \nassistance to workers laid-off from the merger.\n  In light of the end of the cold war, our priorities must be twofold. \nFirst, we should encourage the Defense Department and defense \ncontractors to reduce the excessive buildup from the cold war era. Our \nsecond priority must be to determine how to best help workers in the \ndefense industry who have been downsized.\n  I have come to believe that the DOD policy meets the priorities I \nhave stated. Indeed, it encourages contractors to achieve savings for \nthe DOD while providing the affected workers with benefits they \ndesperately need. In a perfect world, companies that downsize would \nprovide their employees with a respectable severance package that would \ninclude extended health care benefits. All to often, though, laid-off \nemployees find themselves without these benefits, struggling to put \nfood on the table, or make the next mortgage payment.\n  In order to clarify the confusion regarding this policy, I would urge \nthe Defense Department to continue to ensure that the payments made are \nused solely for restructuring costs, with a strong emphasis on the \nemployees laid off. I would also urge the DOD to continue to monitor \nthe savings certified by the companies, ensuring that the savings are \ngreater than the restructuring payments.\n  My amendment therefore calls for the GAO to analyze the restructuring \ncosts paid by the DOD and to consult with the Secretary of Labor to \ndetermine the effectiveness of the assistance provided to laid off \nworkers. The report should ensure that the payments are being used for \njustified costs and that the workers laid off are treated fairly.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will help my constituents in East \nWindsor and those around the country affected by defense downsizing. \nThis amendment assures that these workers will not be ignored.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This amendment is in response to the great number of \nmergers that we have found in the business community, and this \namendment calls for a report to be issued by the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of Labor, and that report shall include an analysis \nand breakdown of restructuring costs paid by or submitted to DOD, \nanalysis of the specific costs associated with work force reductions, \nanalysis of the services provided to the workers affected by business \ncombinations, an analysis of the effectiveness of the restructuring \ncosts used to assist laid-off workers in gaining employment.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, has been approved by both managers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii is correct. We \nhave approved it. I hope, however, that the study requested will cover \nadditional factors. I am one who believes that, if we had not had some \nof these restructurings and some of these consolidations of basic \ncompanies in the defense industrial base, we would have had the \npossibility of a loss of all of the companies involved in those \nconsolidations. Because of the competitive aspect of our acquisitions, \nI think that more and more companies would have found they could not \nperform and meet the competition of those that were equally sharpening \ntheir pencils trying to think they could beat out the other company.\n  I think it has been in the best interests of the United States that \nwe have had selective consolidations and restructuring to preserve the \nindustrial base. I hope a portion of this is directed toward the \npotential loss to the United States of the industrial base had the \nconsolidations not taken place. But under the circumstances, I think \nthe directions are broad enough to cover that, and I will pose no \nopposition to the amendment. It is a study we need; there is no \nquestion about it. But I hope it is balanced.\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\n  Obviously, there are jobs lost and obviously there are costs from the \nreduction in the amount of procurement we are making. I just said we \nhave reduced procurement by 60 percent. Anyone who thinks we are going \nto get the resultant production for the same costs or less than we were \ngetting when we had the competition from a full industrial base is \nmistaken. Costs of industrial production are going up because the \nsources are being more limited, and there is additional cost to the \ntaxpayer because of the inability of the limited number of companies to \nprovide the competitive edge we used to have in terms of the industrial \nprocess. But I accept the amendment, and I am prepared to agree to it \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4569) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on amendment No. 4591.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4480\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that it be temporarily set aside to \ntake up another amendment, which is amendment No. 4480.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4480.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 29, line 20 before the period, insert: ``: Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading \n     $46,600,000 shall be made available only for the Intercooled \n     Recuperated Gas Turbine Engine program''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the cloture \nproceedings for Senator Specter. It is a limitation to comply with a \nlimitation in the authorization bill with regard to the availability of \nfunds for the Intercooled Recuperated Gas Turbine Engine Program, and I \nbelieve it is a technical amendment that should be offered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, both managers approve the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4480) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to whether the Senator \nfrom Illinois wishes to make any further statement before I make a \nmotion to table?\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may have 3 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4591\n\n  Mr. SIMON. It was mentioned that other countries buy a great deal \nfrom us. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record right \nnow the requirements of Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Norway, \nSweden, and the United Kingdom, all of which are more severe than the \nrequirements that I suggest in this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nForeign Government ``Local Content'' Requirements for Defense Contracts\n\n\n                       Local Content Requirements\n\n       A company in the United States that wants to sell defense-\n     related marine equipment to governments in many other \n     industrialized nations must comply with offset or other \n     requirements that include a ``local content'' obligation to \n     produce 50% or more of the system within the customer's \n     country. ``Local content'' means that a U.S. company must \n     substitute its own production with sourcing and engaging \n     subcontractors in the target country. Also, the U.S. company \n     frequently is required to conduct free transfer of technology \n     to achieve the required local content. Liquidated damages can \n     be assessed if the local content requirements are not \n     fulfilled.\n\n\n   Examples of Specific ``Local Content'' and other requirements of \nselected foreign Governments, including mou signatories with the United \n                                 States\n\n       Australia: The Australian Industry Involvement office \n     within the Department of Defense coordinates the offset \n     policies. Guidelines are contained in the Defense Australian \n     Industry Involvement Program, published in July 1995. Actual \n     requirements are program specific. For example, the Ocean \n     Patrol Combatant Project suggests that the local content be \n     65%. Liquidated damages assessment for unfilled local content \n     requirements also vary with the contract. For the Australian \n     Ocean Patrol Combatant project, the liquidated damages \n     assessment is 20%. Another example is the Australian ANZAC \n     Frigate project in which U.S.-based Bird-Johnson Company is \n     participating. Bird-Johnson is required to manufacture its \n     ship propeller system with at least 80% local Australian \n     content.\n       Canada: The Director of Industrial Benefits Policy, \n     Industry Canada agency, is the coordinator of offset \n     authority. The Canadian term for offset is Industrial Benefit \n     (IB). IB Managers are assigned to individual projects. It is \n     normal for major programs to have at least 100% Canadian \n     content requirement. Liquidated damage assessments are 10% of \n     the unfulfilled amount of the IB commitment.\n       The Netherlands: The Coordinator of Offset Authority is the \n     Commissioner for Military Production and Crisis Management \n     within the Ministry of Economic Affairs with input from \n     advisors for the Navy, Air Force, or Army. 100% offset is \n     required. Offset valuation credits vary, but in general, 85% \n     or more local content would result in an 100% offset credit.\n       Norway: The Coordinator of Offset Authority is the Royal \n     Norwegian Ministry of Defense, assisted by the Director \n     General of the Section for Industrial Cooperation. For \n     contracts over $7 million, 100% offset is required, with 80% \n     or more local content equal to 100% offset credit. A 10% \n     penalty is assessed on any unfulfilled offset amount.\n       Sweden: At least 50% of the total value of a Swedish \n     defense procurement with an offshore company must be in local \n     content. The offshore bidder must sign a Draft Contract for \n     Industrial Cooperation with the Swedish Defense Material \n     Administration (FMV) detailing how the bidder will meet the \n     binding industrial cooperation (I.C.) commitment. The \n     commitment constitutes ``a vital part of the decision \n     process'' concerning the acceptability of the bid. I.C. is \n     ``valued on the basis of the production of goods and services \n     that is achieved in Sweden.'' Both the ``economical volume'' \n     and the ``qualitative contents'' of the bidder's commitment \n     are considered. I.C. credits, which must be ``accepted by the \n     Swedish industry concerned,'' are evaluated and monitored by \n     the FMV, in consultation with Swedish industry.\n       United Kingdom: The U.K. Ministry of Defense (MOD) \n     Procurement Executive DESO is charged with providing \n     Government support to increase UK defense business. When \n     offshore defense companies seek to compete, the MOD-DESO \n     assesses the U.K. Industrial Participation (IP) proposal of \n     an offshore defense company seeking to compare. Although IP \n     proposals are not mandatory, in reality, the IP is a key \n     element in whether or not the offshore company gets the MOD \n     contract. 100% offsets are encouraged. The IP obligation must \n     be met at no extra cost to MOD. The DESO negotiates a Letter \n     or Agreement on the IP proposal which is not legally binding, \n     but is considered a ``Gentlemen's Agreement.''\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Again, what I am suggesting in this amendment is that when \na contractor submits a bid, that contractor has to say what percentage \nof the work will be done in the United States and it be a matter of \nhigh importance, not the only consideration, but a matter of high \nimportance for the Defense Department. We do not suggest and we make \nclear that it would be waived for countries where we have agreements or \nmemoranda of understanding.\n  So I think it makes sense. I hope that the motion to table will be \nrejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall make a motion to table this \namendment at 1 p.m.. I now ask that it be set aside temporarily so that \nI might deal with some other matters here, if that meets with the \napproval of the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                       Photonics Research Report\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, last year, during the consideration of the \nfiscal year 1996 defense appropriations measure, the Congress approved \nthe Center for Photonics Research at Boston University. I am pleased to \nshare with my colleague an interim report that was just submitted by \nthe president of Boston University, advising us of the progress being \nmade in this technology.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Boston University,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: It was a pleasure to meet with you to \n     discuss the Center for Photonics Research at Boston \n     University, and to have an opportunity to thank you in person \n     for your support and leadership in the Congress. I also want \n     to thank you again for your very generous offer to be of \n     assistance if possible in the future, and to help put the \n     Center on the road to self-sufficiency.\n       Boston University has invested over $60 million of its own \n     funding to create and establish the Center, and we are \n     committed to its long-term mission and success. Photonics \n     technology will, as you have observed, be one of the keys to \n     our nation's ability to defend itself from external threats; \n     it will also become a driving force in all sectors of our \n     economy. It is truly the technology of the future.\n       Few, if any, of our current weapons, weapon systems or \n     platforms do not depend on photonics for their effectiveness. \n     It was not by coincidence that photonics was declared as one \n     of our most critical technologies needed for the future in \n     the Critical Technologies Report to the Congress.\n       Research alone cannot meet the defense needs of our \n     country. We must develop the ability to move from the \n     research to the actual product and product-manufacturing \n     requirements of our country. Meeting these requirements is \n     central to the mission of the Center. The funding your \n     Committee made available has allowed us to move the Center \n     forward, and the actual construction is moving forward on \n     budget and on schedule.\n       The Center for Photonics Research is already actively \n     contributing to the nation's defense. To illustrate this, I \n     enclose a brief report, prepared by Dr. Donald Fraser, the \n     Center's Director, which summarizes the defense-related \n     applications that are now under development.\n       The Center's building will be completed and ready for \n     formal dedication next spring. We very much hope that you the \n     Members of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee will be \n     able to join us at that event.\n       Again, thank the Subcommittee on behalf of Jon Westling and \n     all of Boston University for its leadership and vision. I can \n     only imagine the number and variety of difficult choices it \n     faces every day, but I know how much I admire the service of \n     you and your fellow Subcommittee members and what it has \n     meant to the American people.\n       With warm personal regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Silber.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4666\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment I offer \non behalf of Senator Cochran and Senator Lott. If I may first just \nexplain it, this entitles the Secretary of Navy to lease to the State \nof Mississippi 5 acres of the property located at the naval air station \nat Meridian, MS, for use only by the State to construct a reserve \ncenter of approximately 22,000 square feet and ancillary supporting \nfacilities. This will be for the co-use of the State and Federal \nGovernment, as I understand it. It does provide for the renting of this \nfacility by the United States, once it is contracted by the State, at a \nrate not to exceed $200,000 a year.\n  We have examined this lease-back concept of the reserve center and \nbelieve it is in the interests of the taxpayers of the United States to \nproceed in this fashion because it will mean we will have the facility \nand have it at an annual lease cost which is a substantial advantage to \nthe Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for Mr. Cochran, for \n     himself and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered 4666.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the bill, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . LEASE TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION OF RESERVE CENTER, \n                   NAVAL AIR STATION, MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI.\n\n       (a) Lease of Property for Construction of Reserve Center.--\n     (1) The Secretary of the Navy may lease, without \n     reimbursement, to the State of Mississippi (in this section \n     referred to as the ``State''), approximately five acres of \n     real property located at Naval Air Station, Meridian, \n     Mississippi, only for use by the State to construct a reserve \n     center of approximately 22,000 square feet and ancillary \n     supporting facilities.\n       (2) The term of the lease under this subsection shall \n     expire on the same date that the lease authorized by \n     subsection (b) expires.\n       (b) Leaseback of Reserve Center.--(1) The Secretary may \n     lease from the State the property and improvements \n     constructed pursuant to subsection (a) for a five-year \n     period. The term of the lease shall begin on the date on \n     which the improvements are available for occupancy, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (2) Rental payments under the lease under paragraph (1) may \n     not exceed $200,000 per year, and the total amount of the \n     rental payments for the entire period may not exceed 20 \n     percent of the total cost of constructing the reserve center \n     and ancillary supporting facilities.\n       (3) Subject to the availability of appropriations for this \n     purpose, the Secretary may use funds appropriated pursuant to \n     an authorization of appropriations for the operation and \n     maintenance of the Naval Reserve to make rental payments \n     required under this subsection.\n       (c) Effect of Termination of Leases.--At the end of the \n     lease term under subsection (b), the State shall convey, \n     without reimbursement, to the United States all right, title, \n     and interest of the State in the reserve center and ancillary \n     supporting facilities subject to the lease.\n       (d) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the leases under this section as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared and \napproved by both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 4666 is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4666) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a \nquorum as we go through our files to see if there are any other \namendments we can go through in the manner we have thus far. I \ncongratulate the Chair and clerk for assisting us in this manner. \nAgain, I will announce the vote on the motion to table the Simon \namendment will take place at 1 p.m.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have now, since we started on this \nbill, whether Senators realize it or not, disposed of almost 50 \namendments. In the process of doing that, under the circumstances, \nagain having to deal with the cloture problem, we filed the amendments \nso they only hit the bill at one point. We have been able to \nconsolidate those. As we consolidated them, we may have made some \ntechnical errors. I ask unanimous consent that the staff and the clerk \nbe authorize to make technical, clerical changes in numbers, et cetera, \nthat might be required.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the unanimous-consent agreement we \nhave concerning these technical changes to our amendments apply to all \namendments we accept by unanimous consent today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4528\n\n    (Purpose: To require certification of competition prior to the \n                 appropriation of funds for the T-39N)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Now I ask the Chair lay before the Senate amendment No. \n4528.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mrs. Frahm, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4528.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  .None of the funds provided for the purchase of the \n     T-39N may be obligated until the Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Acquisition certifies to the defense committees that\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\n     the contract was awarded on the basis of and following a full \n     and open competition consistent with current federal \n     acquisition statutes.\n\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, my amendment is quite simple. It requires \nthe Secretary of Defense for acquisition to certify to the Congress \nthat he has conducted a full and open competition, consistent with \ncurrent acquisition policies prior to awarding any contract for \npurchasing the T-39N or its replacement. This amendment reflects the \nstated position of the Navy, the Department of Defense, and it reflects \ngood government.\n  The Navy is currently using a 1950's technology aircraft to train our \npilots. This aircraft is expensive to fly and maintain, thus wasting \nprecious defense resources. Further, the T-39N does not provide the \nkind of state-of-the-art training or pilots need and deserve. I believe \nthat the Navy, our pilots, and the Nation can be better served with a \nmore modern and cost-effective aircraft for this purpose.\n  With that said, I believe that the Navy should be left to make their \nown choice and that their choice be based upon a full and open \ncompetition. It is through the competitive process that we can best \nmeet the needs of our future pilots. And it is through competition that \nthe taxpayer will be best served.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to address the issues raised by \nSenator Frahm's amendment. I must first note that the T-39N aircraft \ncurrently in use by the U.S. Navy has been performing its duties for \nover 5 years and it will perform the same duties in the future. This is \nnot a new program nor a new aircraft. I also understand the concern of \nsome that the aircraft may be too old, however Navy analysis indicates \nthis aircraft will provide valuable service through 2025. The \nSabreliner T-39N has a mission completion rate of 98 percent. The U.S. \nAir Force in fact has consolidated its tactical navigator and weapon \nsensor operator training under the Navy umbrella with the understanding \nthat the T-39N would be the trainer aircraft. Our allies who conduct \nthe same type of training have also elected to use the U.S. Navy's T-39 \nFlight Officer Training Program.\n  Future concerns of system upgrades would be the same regardless of \nthe aircraft flown and any other modernization upgrades would also be \nfigured into any new aircraft purchase.\n  So, how does the T-39N stack up to the Navy's mission requirements?\n  First, the men and women who fly it, love it. The aircraft possesses \nthe speed and range they desire and the swept wing design makes it much \nmore adaptable to the harsh conditions of low level flight required in \ntheir training. Straight wing aircraft experience a much rougher ride \nat low level and may have lower mission completion rates.\n  In terms of flight characteristics the T-39N has been and is closest \nto the rise and performance of the jets the Navy, U.S. Air Force, and \nallied Air Force personnel will find in their inventories. I would also \npoint out that this aircraft has had years of ``fly before you buy'' \nexperience without complaint.\n  The aircraft has performed superbly as opposed to other aircraft used \nin the program in the past. As I noted before, this aircraft is \ncurrently in use as we speak, turning out the finest tactical flight \nofficers in the world. These men and women will be going to the same \naircraft they have been going to since the current contract began over \n5 years ago.\n  There are no new design aircraft on the drawing boards which require \na new airframe; any avionics systems upgrades or radar upgrades can be \naccommodated by the T-39N. This is the right aircraft, at the right \ntime, and for the right cost.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is to require certification of \ncompetition prior to appropriation of funds for the T-39N. We have \ndiscussed this matter with the Senator from Kansas and are prepared to \nrecommend to the Senate we adopt this amendment. We will consider it in \nconference. There are similar provisions--the matter is discussed in \nthe House bill, and it will be a controversy in conference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. There is no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4528) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Repair and Maintenance of Cargo and Personnel Parachutes\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it would be helpful if I can discuss, for \nthe Record, with the distinguished chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, a matter of importance concerning the \nreadiness of the Airborne units of my State.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be delighted to discuss this matter with my \ncolleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the able Senator. At the outset, let me state I am \nproud that my State is home to several important military installations \nand thousands of fine members of the Armed Forces of our Nation. North \nCarolinians are especially proud that the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne \nCorps and the 82d Airborne Division call Ft. Bragg home. These men and \nwomen are the front line of our Nation's defense and they are among the \nbest trained, most dedicated and professional soldiers in the world.\n  When there is a need for equipment or technology to make these \nsoldiers' tasks easier or safer, it is the responsibility of the \nCongress to provide for it. The modification of the Army's T-10R \nreserve parachute is an example of one such initiative. A study showed \nthat a modified design would increase effectiveness to almost 100 \npercent. This modification was developed by the Army through a \npartnership between the Army and a private company. As a result of this \nsuccessful partnership, Airborne troops now have a highly effective, \nlow cost parachute that should help save lives.\n  I ask the able Senator from Alaska if my understanding is correct \nthat there is a backlog in the performance of repair and maintenance \nwork on cargo and personnel parachutes. To alleviate this backlog and \nthereby enhance readiness, would it be a wise use of Army resources to \ncontract out the repair and maintenance of these chutes to a qualified \nmanufacturer of similar parachutes? Would this not allow the backlog to \nbe addressed in a cost-efficient manner?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from North Carolina is correct. In the \ncurrent fiscal environment, it is important that each service seek \ninnovative, cost-saving ways to provide support for our men and women \nin uniform. The Army Airborne has experienced an increase in training \nrequirements. While the T-10R reserve parachute modification work has \nbeen successful, the Army is required to repack the parachutes after \nthe modifications are performed and, as a result, the repair and \nmaintenance of personnel and cargo parachutes has fallen behind. \nTherefore, I agree that repair and maintenance work, as well as cargo \nparachute repacking, would be excellent candidates for contracting out.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished Senator. I think it is obvious \nthat my goal is to make certain that the Army has the ability to use \nthe operations and maintenance funds appropriated within this bill to \ncontract for parachute repair and maintenance work, as well as the \ncargo repacking efforts. Can the Senator give me that assurance?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, nothing in this bill will prevent the Army from \nusing funds in the operations and maintenance account. These funds are \nnot earmarked because the committee frowns upon earmarking this \naccount. However, I will bring this issue to my House colleagues during \nconference to gain their support for this initiative.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his support. I \nwill, of course, work with him as he\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nconsiders this issue with Members of the House.\n\n\n                              Raid Funding\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention \ntwo items in this bill that relate to the Reconnaissance and \nInterdiction Detachment, RAID, funding that fall within the budget of \nthe Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Activities of the Department of \nDefense, DOD.\n  Vermont, as a border State, is in a very strategic position in the \ncountry's efforts to combat drugs. Since 1991 the Vermont State Police \nhave been successfully working with the Army National Guard for the \ninterdiction and eradication during the comparatively short but very \nproductive marijuana growing season. The efforts of the Vermont Army \nNational Guard have contributed to the eradication of approximately 70-\n80 percent of all confiscated marijuana reported by the Vermont State \nPolice.\n  Thanks to the cooperation of my colleague from Alaska, this bill will \nhelp Vermont's law enforcement community continue its successful \ncounterdrug and interdiction efforts. I appreciate the Senator's \nconcurrence with me and other Senators who believe the National Guard \nhas made important and valuable contributions to the Nation's \ncounterdrug efforts. Mr. President, this issue has bipartisan support. \nBoth sides recognize the National Guard's efforts to interdict and \neradicate illegal drugs deserve sufficient funding and have wisely \nindicated this in their bill. Language in the committee report states \nthat the DOD should ensure the RAID program is fully funded and \nsupported.\n  More specific to Vermont's needs, the committee included my request \nfor $500,000 to assist in the implementation of a more focused RAID \nprogram. These funds will directly benefit Vermont's RAID program by \nmaking available two OH-58 helicopters, as well as the necessary \npersonnel and infra-red equipment to carry out the mission. I greatly \nappreciate the chairman's cooperation and accommodation of my request. \nI also understand his feeling that the allocation of these funds should \nbe postponed until the present National Guard Review of the State \nGovernors' programs is completed. As it appears the review is very \nclose to completion, there should be little delay once the \nappropriations bill is enacted.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleague from Alaska has joined \nme in a discussion of this important matter on the floor of the Senate, \nand I commend him for including these important items in the bill \nbefore us.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was very pleased to accommodate my \ncolleague's request on RAID. I agree with my colleague from Vermont on \nthe importance of providing adequate funding for the National Guard \nGovernors' State Counterdrug Plans and will keep his request in mind \nwhen the House and Senate go to conference on the Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4591\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois, the pending amendment, and state, again, that \nthe Senator from Hawaii and I have opposed this amendment at the \nrequest of the Department of Defense, the defense industrial base and \non our own behalf based on our analysis of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

(a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \n     of State shall jointly conduct an audit of security measures \n     at all United States military installations outside the \n     United States to determine the adequacy of such measures to \n     prevent or limit the effects of terrorist attacks on United \n     States military personnel.\n       (b) Not later than March 31, 1997, the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of State shall jointly submit to Congress a \n     report on\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\n     the results of the audit conducted under subsection (a), \n     including a description of the adequacy of--\n       (1) physical and operational security measures;\n       (2) access and perimeter control;\n       (3) communications security;\n       (4) crisis planning in the event of a terrorist attack, \n     including evacuation and medical planning;\n       (5) special security considerations at nonpermanent \n     facilities;\n       (6) potential solutions to inadequate security, where \n     identified; and\n       (7) cooperative security measures with host nations.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors to the bill Senators Moseley-Braun, Murkowski, Warner, \nCoats, Inhofe, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lugar, Smith, Helms, D'Amato and \nCoverdell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am going to have a total of four \namendments. I believe that three of them will be acceptable to the \nmanagers of the bill. The fourth one, I understand, will require a \nvote. On the fourth one, I would be more than happy to enter into a \ntime agreement of 20 minutes on each side. When I get to it, perhaps we \ncan get the managers' agreement at that time.\n  Mr. President, just over 2 weeks ago, 19 young men and women of the \nU.S. military were killed in a brutal terrorist attack on a housing \ncomplex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. There is nothing we can do to bring \nthese men and women back to life, but it is our responsibility to make \nevery effort to ensure this tragedy does not occur again.\n  Today, I am introducing an amendment that requires the Secretary of \nDefense and Secretary of State to jointly conduct an audit of security \nat all U.S. military installations overseas. Currently there are eight \ncosponsors including Senators Moseley-Braun, Murkowski, Warner, Coats, \nInhofe, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lugar, and Smith.\n  Specifically, the audit will focus on the adequacy of security \nmeasures currently in place to prevent or limit the effects of \nterrorist attacks on U.S. military personnel. The Secretaries would be \nrequired to report to Congress an assessment of the adequacy of \nexisting security measures at our permanent bases overseas, including \nboth physical and operational security measures, and any recommended \nremedial action where necessary.\n  The report would also provide information regarding cooperative \nsecurity measures with host nations. Finally, the report would provide \nan assessment of the special security considerations at temporary \nbasing locations, like the Khobar Towers complex, and possible \nsolutions to these unique problems.\n  In these times of peace in this post-cold-war world, the No. 1 threat \nto our servicemembers, in addition to the normal hazards and risks \nassociated with the job, is terrorism. This is the most difficult \nthreat to predict, as well as prevent.\n  Prior to the tragedy of June 25, measures to protect our forces from \nterrorist attacks were clearly inadequate. The President waged war \nagainst terrorism by means of a summit meeting in a resort town in \nEgypt where there were 240 minutes of opening statements, 40 minutes of \ndiscussion, and a photo opportunity.\n  The summit produced a lot of symbolism, but little in the way of \nconcrete recommendations to combat terrorism. Syria--identified by the \nState Department as one of the world's leading sponsors of terrorism--\ndid not attend the meeting. The participants couldn't even agree to \nspecifically condemn Iran for aiding and abetting terrorist groups. The \nonly result of the summit was a lofty joint statement by President \nClinton and Egyptian President Mubarek, condemning terrorism and \npromising future cooperation and consultation on ways to halt these \nterrorist attacks.\n  And, now, little more than 3 months after the summit in Egypt, and \nafter another couple of international get-togethers to talk tough on \nterrorism, 19 more Americans have been killed by a terrorist bomb.\n  Now is the time to act. We must stop all of this talking and act on \nwhat we say we must accomplish. This amendment is designed to protect \nour troops who continue to make the sacrifices on a daily basis. I \nbelieve this measure deserves our careful and full review, and I hope \nthat you will all support me on this very important issue.\n  Just today I received a letter from the Military Coalition offering \nstrong support for this amendment. They stated:\n\n       Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines deserve the best \n     we can provide and it is our continuing responsibility to \n     provide for their safety and well being. This legislation \n     remains consistent with that objective.\n\n  As I stated previously, it is our responsibility to provide for our \nmen and women stationed across the globe. It is our responsibility \nbecause we, the Congress, are accountable to not just those men and \nwomen serving in the military, but to their families and the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment, No. 4440, is a requirement that \nthe Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State jointly conduct an \naudit of security measures at all U.S. military installations overseas. \nIt requires a report to Congress on March 31, 1997.\n  The specific requirements of the audit include adequacy of physical \nand operational security measures; access and perimeter control; crisis \nplanning in the event of a terrorist attack, including evacuation and \nmedical planning; special security considerations at nonpermanent \nfacilities; potential solutions to inadequate security, where \nidentified; and cooperative security measures with host nations.\n  Mr. President, there is no sense in rehashing the tragic events that \ntook place 2 weeks ago on June 25. The terrorist attack in Dhahran in \nSaudi Arabia, which killed 19 brave young Americans, is well known to \nall of us. But it is important for us to, again, reaffirm our \nresponsibility to ensure that we have made every effort to prevent this \ntragedy from occurring again.\n  Mr. President, this amendment calls for the audit of security \nmeasures at all U.S. military installations overseas. I am aware that \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State have made efforts \nin this direction.\n  I believe Congress needs to be more involved in knowing the results \nof those audits, and, very frankly, the American people need to know it \nas well.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Military Coalition supporting this \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Military Coalition, a consortium \n     of military and veteran organizations representing more than \n     five million current and former members of the uniformed \n     services, supports your efforts to ensure the safety of our \n     military men and women serving overseas. Providing the best \n     possible security and assuring those measures are never \n     compromised should be, and always remain, a top priority.\n       The recent terrorist attack in Dhahran that claimed the \n     lives of 19 American service members emphasizes the need for \n     Congress and the Department of Defense to address the \n     adequacy of protective measures afforded our troops serving \n     outside the country. Questions raised about the security of \n     U.S. foreign military installations further indicates the \n     need to audit and assess current safety and security \n     standards practiced at U.S. overseas facilities.\n       The Military Coalition is pleased to offer its strong \n     support for your legislative initiative to protect American \n     service members. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \n     deserve the best we can provide and it is our continuing \n     responsibility to provide for their safety and well being. \n     This legislation remains consistent with that objective.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Military Coalition:\n       Air Force Association.\n       Assn. of Military Surgeons of the United States.\n       Commissioned Officers Assn. of the U.S. Public Health \n     Service, Inc.\n       CWO & WO Assn.

Mr. President, as I stated previously, it is our \nresponsibility to provide for the men and women stationed overseas the \nmaximum amount of security that we can provide. We ask them to embark \non very difficult and sometimes dangerous missions, and obviously our \nobligation to them in return for that service and sacrifice is that we \nprovide them with the maximum amount of security possible.\n  Again, Mr. President, I do not think it is either necessary or \nparticularly appropriate at this time for me to go through the entire \ntragedy that took place a few weeks ago. Suffice it to say, this and \nthe next amendment I will be proposing are very modest steps in trying \nto ensure the goal that all of us seek, and that is that there never is \nrepetition of such a tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we concur in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4440) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4444, as Modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide $14,000,000 for anti-terrorism activities of the \n                         Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4444 and send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 4444, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 34, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n                   Anti-Terrorism Activities, Defense\n\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For anti-terrorism activities of the Department of Defense, \n     $14,000,000, subject to authorization for transfer to \n     appropriations available to the Department of Defense for \n     operation and maintenance, for procurement, and for research, \n     development, test, and evaluation: Provided, That the funds \n     appropriated under this heading shall be available for \n     obligation for the same period and for the same purposes as \n     the appropriation to which transferred: Provided further, \n     That the transfer authority provided under this heading is in \n     addition to any other transfer authority contained in this \n     Act.\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Beginning with fiscal year 1997, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall establish a program element for the Office \n     of the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of funding \n     emergency anti-terrorism activities. Funds available for that \n     program element for fiscal year 1997 shall be in addition to \n     funds appropriated under other provisions of this Act for \n     anti-terrorism and are available for the Secretary of Defense \n     to respond quickly to emergency anti-terrorism requirements \n     that are identified by commanders of the unified combatant \n     commands or commanders of joint task forces in response to a \n     change in terrorist threat level.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a natural follow-on to \nthe previous amendment. It provides $14 million to the Department of \nDefense specifically for antiterrorism measures.\n  Mr. President, the threat of terrorism to Americans living overseas \nhas never been greater. In particular, our men and women serving in the \narmed forces are at great risk as they are targeted by various \nterrorist organizations and activities. This continues to be a reality \nour troops must face when we send them to lands far away from our great \nNation. This was never more evident than the brutal attack in Dhahran, \nSaudi Arabia just over 2 weeks ago when 19 young men and women were \ntragically killed when a truck loaded with explosives detonated within \n100 feet of their housing complex.\n  Today I am introducing an amendment that will provide $14 million in \nadditional funding to the Department of Defense for antiterrorism \nmeasures. These funds will be specifically used for intelligence \nsupport, physical security measures, education, training, and any other \nadditional measures the Secretary of Defense determines are necessary.\n  A report recently conducted by the Department of Defense noted that \nantiterrorism funding is not specifically identified in many instances \nsince it is a part of a larger effort, primarily in physical security \nprograms. There was an 82-percent--$8.7 million--reduction in Air Force \nfunding, 55 percent--$43.4 million--in Army funding, and 62 percent--\n$4.5 million--in Navy funding.\n  On Tuesday, the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff appeared before the SASC and testified in both open and closed \nsessions that the Department of Defense lacked sufficient funds for \nantiterrorism measures as a result of poor decisions by this \nadministration to cut funds in this area. During this hearing Secretary \nPerry confirmed, ``I think that was a bad cut. I have directed the \nservices to increase the funding in antiterrorism.'' Additionally, \nGeneral Shalikashvili stated,\n\n       The antiterrorism study identified two issues pertaining to \n     funding of antiterrorism things. One, that the services \n     increased their funding and secondly, . . . that we create a \n     program line under the Secretary of Defense with which he can \n     fund high priority antiterrorism programs that need to be \n     funded.\n\n  As a result of this review, the Secretary has recommended the \nestablishment of a separate OSD program of $7-$14 million annually as a \ncontingency account to be available for antiterrorism requirements. \nThese funds would be used to ensure adequate funding for intelligence \nsupport, physical security measures, education, training, and any other \nadditional measures the Secretary determines are necessary.\n  Mr. President, if we cannot afford to provide adequate protection for \nour men and women serving overseas, then we should not put them in \nthose areas with high threats of terrorism. We must give them every \nmeans available to prevent, protect, and defend against terrorist \nattacks. It is our responsibility.\n  This amendment is designed to provide additional funds for the \nDepartment of Defense to protect our troops. I believe this measure \ndeserves our careful and full review, and I hope that you will all \nsupport me on this very important issue.\n  I note the presence of Senator Levin, who is an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment, in the Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the McCain \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment, and I \nwant to just ask my friend from Arizona as to the modification. I have \nnot had a chance to review it. Is this modification that was sent to \nthe desk the language which I had suggested to him might be an \nimprovement in terms of the nature of the funds and how the funds would \noperate? I have not had a chance to review the language which was \nactually sent to the desk. Is this the language which I spoke to his \nstaff about?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much support this amendment. We are \ntoo often fighting in our appropriations and the add-ons to the \nappropriations the battles of the cold war instead of the future \nbattles which we are all going to face in the area of terrorism. Many \nof us had an opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs this morning, and the efforts which are \nbeing made in the fight against terrorism, particularly in the Middle \nEast, were outlined in some detail to us. It is also becoming more and \nmore clear that too much of our defense dollar is being spent on \nrefighting battles which are no longer looming before us and on buying \nequipment and investing in equipment which is no longer as relevant as \nit once was, adding on things which may or may not have been useful 5 \nyears ago but which are not now as much needed as are new weapons in \nthe war against terrorism, which is going to be a growing battle. The \nnew cold war is the war against terrorism.\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\n  There was a request of the Secretary of Defense for an analysis of \nhow many dollars are being invested in the war against terrorism, and \nwe got a letter back addressed to Senator Nunn from the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, Sandra Stuart, outlining some of the \nantiterrorist activities. I want to just quote two paragraphs from that \nletter dated July 16, and then I will ask unanimous consent that the \nentire letter be printed in the Record.\n  The first paragraph I want to quote is the following:\n\n       Anti-terrorism activities deal with traditional defensive \n     measures such as barriers, fences, detection devices and \n     Defense personnel who have as part of their mission \n     protecting DOD personnel and facilities against the threat of \n     terrorism. The Defense Department spends nearly $2 billion \n     annually on such anti-terrorism activity overall. \n     Traditionally we have not budgeted anti-terrorism activities \n     in a single program because force protection is part of each \n     individual commander's responsibility and is therefore \n     budgeted by every installation in, for example, their \n     operation and maintenance accounts.\n\n  The second paragraph from this letter that I will quote is the \nfollowing:\n\n       In the area of counter-terrorism, DOD has many programs and \n     activities which are more often associated with proactive \n     activities undertaken to neutralize the terrorist threat or \n     respond to terrorist acts. All combatant forces in Defense \n     potentially have as part of their mission a counter-\n     terrorism function; however, these activities are more \n     commonly associated with special operations forces, which \n     have annual budgets in excess of $3 billion. That amount \n     is in addition to the considerable sum spent from our \n     intelligence portion of the budget to counter terrorism.\n\n  Mr. President, the letter does point out something which our \namendment is aimed at correcting, and that is that a report which has \nbeen given some notice faulted DOD procedures relative to the funding \nof unanticipated contingencies. And the Secretary has directed \ncorrective action in this area, according to Assistant Secretary of \nDefense Stuart.\n  So I commend the Senator from Arizona for the amendment, which I \ncosponsored, because it does address this question of a fund for \nunanticipated contingencies which I think we have to focus on more and \nmore. We can spend the $3 billion which is referred to in terms of \ncounterterrorism efforts and the $2 billion annually which is referred \nto on antiterrorism activities which are described, but we still have a \nneed for funding unanticipated contingencies in the fight against \nterrorism.\n  This amendment is just a beginning in terms of funding that kind of a \nfund for unanticipated contingencies in the fight against terrorism. I \nam happy to cosponsor this amendment. While it is just a small \nbeginning in that unanticipated contingencies effort, I hope we will be \nable to supplement it later. But it is an important step, and I commend \nthe Senator from Arizona. I am happy to cosponsor that amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the entire letter I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Office of the Assistant\n\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking member, Senate Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: The Secretary is looking forward to \n     having breakfast with you and your colleagues to discuss the \n     tragic terrorist bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and also \n     to have an opportunity to talk about the broader issue of \n     terrorism and the consequences in the Persian Gulf. Force \n     protection is the number one priority of Secretary Perry and \n     General Shalikashvili. This is a responsibility that they \n     take very seriously and is central to every deployment \n     decision they approve.\n       Prior to the breakfast, I wanted to mention a few issues \n     which have been reported in the press and which we feel need \n     some clarification.\n       As you know, shortly after the bombing, Secretary Perry \n     appointed retired General Wayne Downing to conduct a thorough \n     investigation of the security situation in Dhahran, Riyadh \n     and the balance of the U.S. Central Command facilities in the \n     AOR. General Downing's charter empowers him to make findings \n     and conclusions about pertinent acts or omissions on the part \n     of individuals. In the event General Downing makes such \n     findings and conclusions, they will be transmitted to the \n     cognizant supervising officials for action. General Downing \n     has assembled a qualified team who have already begun this \n     review and will depart for Dhahran to continue his \n     investigation by mid-week.\n       The Secretary has further directed General Downing to \n     assess immediately the situation regarding moving the \n     perimeter fence. There has been a good bit of speculation as \n     to who spoke with the Saudis about moving this fence, what \n     their reply was and whether this information was passed up \n     the chain of command. Once General Downing reports his \n     findings to Secretary Perry, we will inform you of the \n     details.\n       There are two other matters which we believe need to be \n     clarified.\n       The first involves the June 17 DIA Military Intelligence \n     Digest (MID) that has been referred to in the press as an \n     ``alert''. The MID is a daily publication that covers a wide \n     array of topics of interest to policy makers, force planners, \n     and operational forces. Additionally, the MID is delivered, \n     also daily, to the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House \n     National Security Committee, and the two Intelligence \n     committees. While the MID is a classified document, there are \n     several points that can be made for the record concerning \n     this particular article.\n       Contrary to press reporting, the MID article on June 17 was \n     not an ``alert''. Rather it was a compilation of previously \n     reported security incidents that had occurred in the Khobar \n     Towers area over the past several months. The value of this \n     particular article was that it provided intelligence \n     confirmation that security had been increased outside the \n     complex and that the threat was taken seriously.\n       There was no warning in the article of an impending \n     terrorist incident. When such warnings exist, they are \n     provided to Defense decision makers immediately and directly, \n     rather than through a publication like the MID which goes \n     through an extensive editorial review and follows a days-long \n     publication timeline. The article did recommend that, due to \n     the incidents that had occurred over the past several months, \n     security should be further increased and, indeed, \n     approximately 130 distinct security enhancements were being \n     implemented at Khobar Towers.\n       The second remaining issue deals with the level of funding \n     within the Pentagon budget for anti-terrorism activities. \n     Unfortunately, there is a misperception about the amount of \n     money the Department spends. This misperception resulted from \n     a review of one document, a JCS report which dealt with only \n     a fraction of the total DoD funding which supports anti-\n     terrorist activities. A portion of the report described some \n     program funding reductions, which resulted from personnel \n     reductions, domestic base closings, completed construction \n     projects or program completions, but those items were just a \n     minor portion of the overall DoD expenditures on anti-\n     terrorism. There are two categories normally associated with \n     Defense activities to combat terrorism: anti-terrorism and \n     counter-terrorism.\n       Anti-terrorism activities deal with traditional defensive \n     measures such as barriers, fences, detection devices and \n     Defense personnel who have as part of their mission \n     protecting DoD personnel and facilities against the threat of \n     terrorism. The Defense Department spends nearly $2 billion \n     annually on such anti-terrorism activity overall. \n     Traditionally we have not budgeted anti-terrorism activities \n     in a single program because force protection is part of each \n     individual commander's responsibility and is therefore \n     budgeted by every installation in, for example, their \n     operation and maintenance accounts.\n       In the area of counter-terrorism, DoD has many programs and \n     activities which are more often associated with proactive \n     activities undertaken to neutralize the terrorist threat or \n     respond to terrorist acts. All combatant forces in Defense \n     potentially have as part of their mission a counter-terrorism \n     function; however, these activities are more commonly \n     associated with special operations forces, which have annual \n     budgets in excess of $3 billion. That amount is in addition \n     to the considerable sums spent from our intelligence portion \n     of the budget to counter terrorism.\n       The JCS report was commissioned by Secretary Perry and CJCS \n     Shalikashvili following the Riyadh bombing. Its purpose was \n     to identify and assess all of the anti-terrorism programs, \n     actions and preparedness of the DoD and possible areas for \n     additional action. The report did fault DoD procedures for \n     funding unanticipated contingencies, and the Secretary \n     directed corrective action in this area. It is unfortunate \n     that a minuscule portion of the JCS review is now being used \n     to draw wider, and inappropriate, conclusions in light of the \n     Dhahran bombing.\n       I hope this information is helpful. Secretary Perry looks \n     forward to seeing you soon and discussing the issues of Saudi \n     Arabia and terrorism in the Persian Gulf area.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Sandra K. Stuart,\n\n                                    Assistant Secretary of Defense\n                                            (Legislative Affairs).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4444), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4441\n\n  (Purpose: To require the submittal to Congress of the future-years \ndefense programs prepared by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau and \n                 the chiefs of the reserve components)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 4441 to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration. I ask unanimous consent Senator \nGrams of Minnesota be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Grams, proposes an amendment numbered 4441.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Section 221 of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) The President shall submit to Congress each year, at \n     the same time the President submits to Congress the budget \n     for that year under section 1105(a) of title 31, the future-\n     years defense program (including associated annexes) that the \n     Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the chiefs of the \n     reserve components submitted to the Secretary of Defense in \n     that year in order to assist the Secretary in preparing the \n     future-years defense program in that year under subsection \n     (a).''.\n       Effective Date. This section shall take effect beginning \n     with the President's budget submission for fiscal year 1999.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would require the President \nto submit, with his annual budget request, the future years defense \nplans of the National Guard and Reserve components. The Chiefs would \nprepare their long-range spending plans, which would then be forward to \nthe Congress.\n  For years, the Congress has added billions of dollars to the defense \nbudget for equipment and building projects for the Guard and Reserve \ncomponents. These add-ons are usually based on the assertion that the \nDepartment of Defense does not provide sufficient resources for the \nGuard and Reserve in its annual budget requests and long-term funding \nplans, and that is an assertion that I cannot dispute.\n  The problem, however, is the Congress does not now have the necessary \ninformation to properly prioritize among the requests of individual \nMembers of Congress for added funding for the Guard and Reserve units \nin their States and districts. As a result, we have earmarked billions \nof dollars for construction projects and procurement items based on \ntheir location, not their priority and utility to the missions of the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate passed a military construction \nappropriations bill containing $700 million for unrequested projects, \nthe majority of which were for guard and reserve projects. The bill \nbefore the Senate today contains $759.8 million for unrequested \nequipment for the Guard and Reserve. For the most part, the allocation \nof this funding to meet the requirements of the Guard and Reserve is \nleft to the appropriate officials in those organizations.\n  Again this year, I applaud Senators Stevens and Inouye for resisting \nthe temptation to earmark these funds, unlike the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the House defense committees. I wish they had also left \nout the earmark for six additional C130-J aircraft, but, unfortunately, \nthis bit of perennial pork is in the bill.\n  Mr. President, a few weeks ago I met with the Chief of the Guard \nBureau, representatives of the Reserve components and officials from \nthe Department of Defense responsible for oversight of the Guard and \nReserve. In this meeting, we discussed the need to provide adequate \nfunding for the Guard and Reserve components. We discussed the \nperception that the Department of Defense does not include sufficient \nfunds in its budget requests for the Guard and Reserve, relying instead \non the Congress to add these funds each year.\n  Unfortunately, we do not come up with a clear way of dealing with \nthis problem, leaving the Congress in a catch-22 situation. If we \nsupport a strong national defense which requires the Guard and Reserve \nbe appropriately equipped and trained for their assigned missions, we \nhave to add money for the Guard and Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate: The problem is that over the years, the \nDepartment of Defense is shortchanging the Guard and Reserve in their \nbudget request because they know--they know--the Congress will add on \nthe funding necessary to adequately equip the Guard and Reserve in \ntheir military construction projects. So we are in a terrible situation \nwhere everybody knows. It is kind of a dirty little secret. The \nDepartment of Defense knows we will add the money, so they do not \nrequest the money. And, therefore, the Guard gets the money.\n  Mr. President, that is not any way to run a railroad, much less a \ndefense appropriations process.\n\n  This amendment would address this problem with respect to the \nCongress by ensuring we have full information on the long-range plans \nof the Guard and Reserve components. Basically, we are saying the Guard \nand Reserve need a future years defense plan just as the active duty \nforces will as well. In this way, as we evaluate the Department's \nbudget request for the Guard and Reserve, we will also have before us \ninformation on the long-term requirements of the Guard and Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I think this amendment will serve the best interests \nof the Guard and Reserve in two ways. First, the Department of Defense, \nknowing that the Congress will have full access to long-range \nrequirements of the Guard and Reserve, will perhaps feel compelled to \nbetter accommodate these requirements in the Department's annual budget \nrequest. Second, if Guard and Reserve programs are still underfunded, \nthe Congress will be better informed in making allocations of any \nadditional funds for equipment and construction projects.\n  I believe this amendment is a positive step forward. I believe it \nwill reduce some of the add-ons that, frankly, have more to do with \nlocation and geography as opposed to national security needs. I believe \nthis will give us a much better blueprint to make the very difficult \ndecisions as to how we spend the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars which \nare earmarked for defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I understand the amendment, it will \nrequire the President to submit to Congress the request of the Chiefs \nof the National Guard Bureau and respective Reserve components which \nwas submitted to the Secretary of Defense that year, in order to assist \nthe Secretary in preparing the defense program.\n  I might say to the Senator from Arizona, there is not a similar \nprovision with regard to the Marines or the Air Force or the Army or \nthe Navy. They all submit requests, really, to the President through \nthe Secretary of Defense.\n  I do believe that the Senator from Arizona is right about his \nassertion that the Congress does respond to the requests of the \nNational Guard Bureau and the Reserve components in a unique way. I do \nbelieve they are closer to the people and they are closer to the \nMembers of Congress because, when we all go home we see our Reserve \ncomponents, we see the members of our National Guard, and they tell us \nwhat they have asked of the National Guard Bureau. When we come back, \nwe inquire what is in the budget. We find it is not there, so we seek \nit. He has a point there. But the same point might be valid as to the \nrequests that the Chief of Naval Operations made to the Secretary, or \nto the Chief of Staff of the Air Force or the Army.\n  I do not argue with the Senator about his proposition. I am prepared \nto take the amendment to conference and see what the will of the House \nwill be in that regard. I think we will probably work out something \nthat will require an annex to the report, to have all of the requests \nof the various Chiefs be provided to Congress.\n  Let us explore that, if the Senator will, but I am happy to recommend \nwe take it to the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the effort on the part of the Senator from \nAlaska to help solve this dilemma. I believe it is a dilemma, as I \nstated before. The Department of Defense--and I must\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\nplace great responsibility on them--know full well Congress is going to \nadd this money on. So, therefore, they will request funding for, \nperhaps, less popular and certainly programs with less constituent \nsupport, knowing full well the Congress is going to add on additional \nmoney. That is what I am trying to do. The Senator from Alaska \nobviously appreciates what I am trying to get at.\n  Basically what I am asking for, in some respects, is a future years \ndefense plan for the Guard and Reserve to try to identify and \nprioritize their requirements.\n  If there is a way I can work with the Senator from Alaska and the \nother conferees and the Senator from Hawaii in trying to achieve this \ngoal--I am not saying this amendment is the best way, but I think it is \nan issue that must be addressed, and I believe the amendment addresses \nit.\n  I, again, appreciate the understanding of the dilemma on the part of \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the McCain \namendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Arizona for this \namendment. This is a subject which has been discussed at some length in \nthe Armed Services Committee. He has consistently fought for and has \nbeen on the side of trying to identify what the priorities of the Guard \nand Reserve are so that we could at least consider those priorities \nwhen it comes time to identifying the items in the authorization bill. \nAs a matter of fact, he was very forthright in his support of that \nposition on the authorization bill.\n  We did adopt an amendment which I offered, I believe, on the \nauthorization bill a few weeks ago. The question I would like to ask of \nthe Senator from Arizona is this: Is the approach in this amendment \neither similar to or, at a minimum, consistent with the requirement \nthat we added to the authorization bill on the floor, that the Guard \nand the Reserve components identify, prior to submission of the budget, \nwhat their priorities are so that they could be considered by the \nCongress when the time comes, if we add money to identify what those \nitems are?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan, indeed, \nI believe this amendment is complementary to the amendment--a very \nthoughtful and important amendment--that the Senator from Michigan \nadded to the defense authorization bill.\n  I also express my appreciation to the Senator from Michigan who has \nalso fought against this earmarking of funds. Again, I would like to \npoint out, the Appropriations Committee has simply added the money and \nthey have not earmarked those funds, which I think is a significant \nimprovement over what the authorizing committee has been doing. But in \nresponse to the question from my friend from Michigan, I believe this \nis a complementary amendment to that which the Senator from Michigan \nhad added to the authorization bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think it would be useful, assuming this \namendment is adopted, for the appropriators to harmonize this language \nwith the language that is in the authorization bill, to make sure we \nhave precisely the same requirement, whatever it ends up being, \nassuming that it remains in the two bills following conference.\n  I also want to commend the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, for following the generic approach on this Guard \nand Reserve issue. They have taken the correct position in terms of \ngiving the Guard and Reserve components the greatest flexibility to do \nwhat is most needed by those components, rather than just some add-ons \nby Members of the Congress.\n  This is an important issue. It has been raised with great frequency \non this floor. The Senate has generally taken the approach that we are \ngoing to give them the greatest flexibility rather than doing the \nearmarking.\n\n  I hope we prevail both in conference on the authorizing bill and on \nthe appropriations bill. I join my friend from Arizona in thanking the \nAppropriations Committee for taking the position that they have and for \naccepting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan that our \nflexibility in this bill is hampered by the earmarking in the \nauthorization bill. I am not sure that we will survive conference so \nlong as the authorization bill insists on pinning down the limited \namount of money. It will lead to demands from both the House and Senate \nappropriators to challenge that.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Michigan, \nMr. President, but we have to have it in both committees in order to \nsucceed. I do urge acceptance of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Alaska will yield on that point, I do \nhappen to agree with him in terms of his comment on the authorizing \ncommittee. Some of us made an effort in committee to totally eliminate \nthose earmarks. We failed by, I think, one vote in committee. We ended \nwith a sort of hybrid: some of the money earmarked and some not.\n  I agree, the fact some of it is earmarked in the Senate authorization \nbill does make your work more difficult in conference. I happen to \nregret that because I am on the generic side of this debate, but it is \na fact of life.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4441, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The amendment (No. 4441) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on the next amendment, I understand the \nSenator from Arizona would like a time agreement. Will he state that \nagain, please?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am more than happy to agree to any time agreement. I \nsuggest 20 minutes equally divided on the amendment, if that is \nagreeable to the Senator from Alaska, or any other time agreement that \nhe chooses to enter into.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to enter into that agreement. That means \nthis amendment will be voted on at quarter after 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The vote \nwill be taken at quarter after 2.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4442\n\n    (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for programs, projects, and \n    activities not included in the most recent future-years defense \n                                program)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4442.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended for any program, project, or \n     activity which is not included in the future-years defense \n     program of the Department of Defense for fiscal years 1997 \n     through 2002 submitted to Congress in 1996 under section 221 \n     of title 10, United States Code, unless the Secretary of \n     Defense certifies to Congress that--\n       (1) the program, project, or activity fulfills an existing, \n     validated military requirement;\n       (2) the program, project, or activity is of a higher \n     priority than any other program, project, or activity \n     included in that future-years defense program for which no \n     funds are appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act; and\n       (3) if additional funds will be required for the program, \n     project, or activity in future fiscal years, such funds will \n     be included in the future-years defense program to be \n     submitted to Congress under such section in 1997.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we amend the \nunanimous consent agreement to include that it not be subject to an \namendment in the second degree.\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment would require an assessment \nby the Department of Defense programs included in the appropriations \nbill which are not in the administration's future years defense plan. \nThe Secretary of Defense would be required to certify that the program \nfulfills a military requirement, that it is a higher priority than any \nother unfunded program in the future years defense plan, and any future \nfunding requirement associated with the program will be included in \nnext year's future years defense plan. Until the assessment is complete \nand the certification provided to Congress, no funds for these programs \ncould be obligated or expended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a time agreement \nof 20 minutes equally divided, if that has not already been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is needed. The amendment \nwould impose some degree of restraint on the Congress' seemingly \nunlimited desire to waste scarce defense resources on unnecessary \nprojects.\n  This Congress has succeeded in increasing the President's inadequate \ndefense budget requests of the last 2 years, adding a total of $18 \nbillion. I fully supported these increases which have slowed, although \nnot halted, the too-rapid decline in the defense budget over the past \ndecade. Failure to provide adequate funding for defense will seriously \nhinder the ability of our military services to ensure our future \nsecurity and have a deleterious effect on our Nation's ability to \ninfluence world events and maintain peace.\n  However, much of this additional $18 billion is devoted to \nunnecessary and unwarranted projects. Last year, the Congress wasted $4 \nbillion of the defense budget on unnecessary projects. These included \n$700 million for unrequested, low-priority military construction \nprojects, $1.2 billion for B-2 bombers and Seawolf submarines, another \n$2.2 billion for unrequested projects of special interest, such as \nearmarks for specific universities, centers, or other entities; \nnondefense activities, such as Coast Guard operations, support to the \nAtlanta Olympics, medical research education and programs; and \nunrequested Guard and Reserve equipment.\n  Mr. President, that adds up to $4.1 billion, which did little or \nnothing to enhance the readiness of our forces today or to modernize \nour forces. This year, while it appears the Senate may be exercising \nrestraint, I have identified only $2 billion in this year's as opposed \nto last year's budget.\n  I know this is sometimes an unpleasant experience, but I have to \nidentify some of these projects that honestly have no relation to \ndefense spending. There is nonauthorized add-ons and earmarks--I am not \ngoing to go through all of them:\n  A $3.4 million add-on for ``Med teams'';\n  A $14 million add-on for Akamai program, to continue telemedicine \nefforts at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii;\n  Earmarks $2.7 million for development of ``dual-mode hyperspectral/\nfluorescence imaging technology'';\n  The sum of $8 million for the mitigation of environmental impacts on \nIndian lands;\n  A $477,000 grant to Kansas Unified School District 207 to integrate \nschools at Fort Leavenworth into post-fiber-optic network;\n  There is $100 million for prostate cancer research; $93 million of \nthat is earmarked in the bill. The report specifies a total of $100 \nmillion for research to be conducted in conjunction with the Center for \nProstate Disease Research.\n  There is a $2 million add-on for the National Automotive Center; a \n$5.4 million add-on for Hawaii Small Business Development Center; a $4 \nmillion add-on for Instrumented Factory for gears; $900,000 earmarked \nfor National Center for Physical Acoustics for research on ocean \nacoustics for purchase of special equipment; $7 million add-on for \nCenter of Excellence for Research in Ocean Sciences in Oregon.\n  There is an $8 million add-on to support Pacific Disaster Center; a \n$3 million add-on for Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research; \n$4.75 million earmarked for Charleston Navy Hospital for a cancer \ncontrol program conducted in conjunction with a State-owned cancer \ncenter serving coastal South Carolina.\n  There is a $350,000 add-on for a DOD-State-local government joint \ntask force studying wastewater treatment, management, and disposal; $10 \nmillion earmarked for joint Army-Tennessee Valley Authority project to \n``develop, demonstrate, and validate a plasma energy pyrolysis system * \n* * to render hazardous, chemical, and medical waste into an inert \nglass slag byproduct.''\n  There is $1 million for brown tree snake control; again, a $2 million \nadd-on for natural gas boiler demonstration; $2.5 million add-on for \ncarbon reinforced recycled thermoplastic engineered lumber; $7 million \nearmarked for evaluation of a multithread architecture experimental \ncomputer; a $26.8 million add-on to initiate program using DOD \nsatellite capabilities in support of civil needs, such as detecting \nforest fires and volcanic activity; a $20 million add-on for Electric \nand Hybrid Electric Vehicle Consortia program.\n  There is a $25 million add-on for Optoelectronics consortia. By the \nway, only $20 million was authorized. There is a $13 million add-on for \noceanographic partnership programs.\n  Mr. President, I know that the argument can be and will be made that \neach of those programs I talked about are worthy and important \nprograms. Most of those that I identified have little, if anything, to \ndo with national defense. They were not requested by the Department of \nDefense, nor in many cases were they authorized in the authorizing \nbill.\n  I think this amendment is a necessary starting point for curbing this \nkind of spending. It is aimed only at projects that are not included in \nthe spending plans of the military services until after the year 2002.\n  Perhaps my colleagues are unaware of what a future years defense plan \nis. It is the plan the Department of Defense documents which specifies \nthe programs, projects, and activities that are planned for a 6-year \nperiod. The current FYDP was submitted to Congress earlier this year \nand covers fiscal years 1997 through 2002. The services' highest \npriority programs are included in that document.\n  Mr. President, I point out that the total funding for defense in the \ncurrent future years defense program is $1.5 trillion--$1.5 trillion--\nwhich means there are lots and lots and lots of projects in there. Lots \nof those projects are not funded in the decisions made by the Congress \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, I understand the opposition to this amendment and have \nvery few illusions as to its chance of passage, but I feel that it is \nmy obligation to seek its passage.\n  I also ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a letter from the \nCitizens Against Government Waste in support of this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Council For Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I \n     am writing to endorse your amendment to the FY 1997 \n     Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations bill (S. 1894). \n     Your amendment prohibits the use of funds for projects not \n     included in the DOD's Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) \n     unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that those programs \n     are a higher priority than the unfunded FYDP items and will \n     be included in the following year's FYDP. S. 1894 contains \n     over $2 billion worth of items not included in FYDP.\n       As you know, DOD submits a FYDP every year which specifies \n     programs, projects, and activities that are planned for a \n     six-year period. Only items of the highest priority are \n     included by DOD. The current FYDP was submitted this year and \n     covers FYs 1997 through 2002. This FYDP contains $1.5 \n     trillion worth of spending items, many of which were ignored \n     by Congress and replaced with wasteful items.\n       Some of the items included in S. 1894 have been listed in \n     our Congressional Pig Book:\n       $1 million for Brown Tree Snake control.\n       $15 million for High Frequency Active Auroral Research \n     Program (HAARP). While it was authorized, it is an \n     objectionable add-on.\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n       $4 million add-on for the instrumented factory for gears. \n     In FY 1996,this program received a $5 million add-on in \n     conference.\n       Wasteful spending crowds out valuable resources for high \n     priority projects. Your amendment would help stop pork-barrel \n     spending hidden under the cloak of defense spending. We urge \n     your colleagues to support this amendment, which will be \n     considered for inclusion in CCAGW's 1996 Congressional \n     Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, unfortunately, this is one amendment that \nwe have to disagree with the Senator from Arizona on in regard to his \nproposal. It would prohibit the obligation of any congressionally \napproved funds, by definition, funds approved by the President, too, \nunless those funds were in the President's original plan.\n  The budget resolution that we have adopted in the Congress is $27.5 \nbillion more than the President's plan. That is the 5-year plan. I \nstood here listening to the Senator from Arizona, and I was remembering \nbattles that this Senator has been involved in. Three times other \ncommittees zeroed out the C-17, and the President did not request it. \nOur committee insisted on it. Our committee insisted on upgrading the \nPatriot missile when it had not been requested, was not in anyone's \nauthorization bill. We believed it should have been upgraded. It had a \nsignificant role, I think, in the Persian Gulf war.\n  On the V-22, the Osprey, it was never recommended by the President or \nby the Secretary of Defense. We had met with the Marines, and they gave \nus their concept of a new order of battle, really, if they could have \nthis new system. And our subcommittee again battled. I remember the \nbattles here on the floor with some of my former friends about our \nadding money to the bill that was not authorized or requested. Today \nthe V-22 is the signal part of our defense effort. I think this will be \none of the few items of new technology, really innovative technology, \nin the overall field of aviation. I predict that within 20 years, it \nwill be a significant part of commuter airline transportation \nthroughout the world.\n  I do not disagree with the Senator from Arizona that we do at times \nagree to money that has not been requested that could be considered in \na subsequent year. But I do not believe we should abandon the total \nflexibility that Congress has. Congress has the authority to initiate \nspending in areas where it feels it is necessary to meet the national \ndefense requirements, our national security requirements. Our \nobligation is to provide for the common defense under the Constitution. \nI keep repeating that here on the floor.\n  I must oppose the Senator's amendment because we would have no \nflexibility whatsoever. Under the current budget resolution, we have \nprogrammed even this year $266.362 billion for defense. The President \nasked for $255.1 billion for defense. Over the period of 5 years, as I \nsaid, we asked for $27.5 billion more than the President.\n  Senator McCain's amendment would say, even if we provided it, the \nSecretary of Defense would uniquely have impoundment authority, the \nauthority to prioritize spending. In our opinion, it is not the right \nthing to do. So at the appropriate time, I will make a motion to table \nthe amendment.\n  This language, as I understand it, would require that the Secretary \nof Defense, after Congress has passed an act and the President has \nsigned it, that the Secretary of Defense must certify that the program \nmeets valid military requirements. The Osprey stands out in my mind, \nMr. President. No Secretary of Defense that I knew ever supported the \nOsprey, V-22. I do not wish to give the Secretary of Defense a veto \npower that I would not give to the President of the United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 33 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nrequest for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand how this vote would come out. \nI will be satisfied with a voice vote on it. I want to assure the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii that I am very \nappreciative of their very hard work and efforts. I am very \nappreciative of the fact that we have gone from $4 billion to $2 \nbillion of, in my view, unnecessary and unwarranted and unauthorized \nspending.\n  However, Mr. President, I do not intend to quit in trying to stop \nadd-ons such as those that I described before. I believe that the \nAmerican people deserve to have a thorough ventilation and thorough \nhearing of the requirements and the appropriations that are included in \nthis bill. I do, as I said before, appreciate the reductions in \nunauthorized earmarks and spending, and I think we will continue to \nmake progress. At the same time, I have to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues areas that I feel are absolutely unnecessary and wasteful \nprojects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, of course, I commend my colleague from \nArizona for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. Every \nMember of this body is desirous of providing the finest defense at the \nleast cost.\n  There are a few things that we should remind ourselves. First is the \nConstitution of the United States. Mr. President, it is not the \nPresident who is responsible to declare war, to raise and support \narmies, to provide and maintain a Navy, to make rules for the \nGovernment on regulations of land and naval forces. That is the power \nof the Congress of the United States. We, the Members of the Congress, \nwere not elected by our constituents to serve as rubber stamps of the \nSecretary of Defense or, for that matter, of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Alaska pointed out, if it were not \nfor the initiative taken by this committee, the C-17 would not be in \nexistence, the V-22 would be a thing of the past, the Patriot upgrade \nwould not have helped our troops in Desert Storm.\n  For that matter, I think we should recall, in early 1990, when the \nseas were calm and the Middle East seemed to be a tranquil place, the \nPentagon was considering doing away with the central command. That is \nfact, Mr. President. They were about to break up the central command \nand retire General Schwarzkopf. When this subcommittee heard about \nthat, we called upon the Secretary of Defense to delay that decision \nfor at least a year because we, on this subcommittee, felt the seas \nwere not tranquil in the Middle East, that the air was not calm in the \nMiddle East, that something was brewing, and within 8 months, we were \nshooting and they were shooting at us. If we had served as rubberstamps \nfor the President of the United States and the Department of Defense, \nGeneral Schwarzkopf would now be retired and Desert Storm would have \nbeen a disaster.\n  The weapon that most people credit with the great successes of Desert \nStorm is the F-117, the stealth fighter, the fighter that was able, in \na stealthy fashion, to knock out all of the radar positions of the \nIraqis. I believe we should recall that the administration did not want \nany more F-117's. For that matter, our companion committees in the \nCongress of the United States did not favor the F-117. Thank God for \nthis subcommittee; we got the F-117.\n  Mr. President, I think we should always remind ourselves that the \nCongress shall have the power to raise armies, to support armies, to \nprovide and maintain a Navy, to provide for calling forth the militia \nto execute the law of the Union against suppressions and insurrections, \nand to repel invasions. We are the people who are responsible for the \nDefense Department. We are the people who are responsible to declare \nwar.\n  Mr. President, we take our responsibilities very seriously. We will \ndo our very best to help our Senator from Arizona to bring down the \ncosts of defense. This is not the way to do it, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4442) is rejected.\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4582, as Modified\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for preparing the application for renewal of \n          the use of the McGregor Range at Fort Bliss, Texas)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of \namendment No. 4582.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Gramm, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4582, as modified.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n       Sec.   . Of the funds appropriated in title II of this Act, \n     not less than $7.1 million is available to perform the \n     environmental impact statement and associated baseline \n     studies necessary to prepare an application for renewal of \n     use of the McGregor Range at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. As amended, this makes funds available for a project in \nTexas which the Senator from Texas wishes to be certain is authorized \nand the moneys are available for.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that the \nmanagers have approved this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4582), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4883\n\n    (Purpose: To provide $7,5000,000 to fund 1.5 ship years in the \n   university research fleet under the Oceanographic and Atmospheric \n                          Technology program)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have an amendment, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4883.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, line 20, strike out ``Forces.'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``Forces: Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated in this paragraph, $7,500,000 shall be available \n     for 1.5 ship years in the university research fleet under the \n     Oceanographic and Atmospheric Technology program.''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this has to do with the military \noceanographic research survey administered by the Dept. of the Navy. I \nunderstand it has been cleared by both of the distinguished managers. I \nwant to tell them how much I appreciate their cooperation in this \nrespect.\n  Mr. President: today I am offering an amendment which will increase \nfunding for the Navy's military oceanographic research survey \ncapabilities. With enhanced survey capabilities, university research \nfleets will be able to help the Navy in the important work of \noceanographic research.\n  This amendment will reduce an approximately 240 ship-year backlog in \nmilitary oceanographic survey vessels which are operated by the \nOceanographer of the Navy. It allows the Navy to use non-military \nresearch ships as a supplement to its own fleet.\n  Most of the Navy's surveys are overseas; some are in American waters. \nClearly, the Navy Oceanographer's eight ships cannot, by themselves, do \nall the work for 240 ship-years of backlog. They need help. The \nUniversity Oceanographic Laboratory System [UNOLS], an umbrella \norganization of oceanographic research ships, can provide that help. \nThese research ships are owned and operated by a variety of agencies \nand private organizations, including the University of Washington in \nSeattle. With the additional funds provided by this amendment, the Navy \ncan enlist the aid of UNOLS in reducing its backlog.\n  This initiative will bring military and civilian oceanographers, \ntogether, in a spirit of partnership, for exchanges of ideas and \ncapabilities. I thank the committee for agreeing to this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Washington has identified that \nimmediate attention be paid to this activity. We support his position \nthat it should be maintained at the current level, and urge adoption.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the managers are pleased to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4883) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of my \namendment to authorize $12 million for the development of a pulse \ndoppler upgrade to the AN/SPS-48E radar system.\n  The AN/SPS-48E is currently the only surveillance radar capable of \ndetecting low flying cruise missiles coming out of the severe ground \nclutter that is typical of littoral warfare over water or land. Given \nthe proper funding, the Navy agrees that the AN/SPS-48E pulse doppler \nupgrade would re-initiate clutter reduction engineering activities, \nthereby improving their ability to meet current and emerging threats. \nPresent lack of funding for this one-of-a-kind, superior radar system \nleaves our large deck amphibious ships and the new LPD-17 class ships \nand their crews unprotected and vulnerable to attack.\n  I am pleased that this amendment is acceptable and I thank the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared by both \nsides. We are pleased to support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I concur in adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see that my esteemed colleague, Senator \nInouye, the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nis on the floor. I wonder if the Senator from Hawaii would be willing \nto engage in a colloquy with my friend from North Dakota and me over a \nmatter of importance to our State and the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. As my friend from Hawaii may recall, \nthe internationally recognized Center for Aerospace Sciences [CAS] at \nthe University of North Dakota [UND] has been conducting intensive \nhelicopter flight training for U.S. Army Reserve Officer Training Corps \n[ROTC] scholarship recipients for the past decade and a half. The 1995-\n96 school year was the last year of a 5-year test program designed to \nproduce 15 second lieutenants every year for the Army Aviation branch \nwho are ready for tactical aircraft training and further assignment as \ncombat-ready aviators upon graduation from UND. Because of the unique \nflight training students receive at CAS, the entire UND class has \nalmost always received active duty helicopter assignments upon \ngraduation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, I am aware of this program. Has this training been \ncost-effective for the Army?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, it has. In fact, it costs approximately 40 percent \nless to train helicopter pilots at UND than at the Army's usual \nfacility at Fort Rucker.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If my senior colleague from North Dakota would yield for \na moment, I would also like to note that the recent proposal for \nprogram continuation forwarded to the commanding general at Fort Rucker \nsuggests that we will save even more than that. My friend from Hawaii \nand all Senators should also be aware that the Army has consistently \npraised UND graduates for their excellent performance and superior \nairmanship. The CAS program is unique in the United States, and \nconsequently its aviator graduates in the Air Battle Captain Program \nare better trained than any other ROTC graduates seeking Army aviation \nassignments. Appropriately, the entire UND Air Battle Captain class has \nconsistently received active duty helicopter assignments upon \ngraduation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Considering both the cost savings and the excellent \nperformance of UND's graduates, this program appears to be an excellent \nbuy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is, and consequently I and my colleague from North \nDakota were very surprised to learn that only 2 of this year's class of \n15 graduates were assigned to active duty aviation. Clearly, many \nprograms within the Armed Services are undergoing reorganization as \npart of the defense-wide effort to cut costs, but to reject the \ngraduates from the aviation program at UND Aerospace does not make any \nsense to me. After all, these young officers have been handpicked and \nwell trained. To reject these young men and women after this special \ntraining seems wasteful.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I understand the concern of my friends from North Dakota. \nFrom what I have heard today, rejecting these fine young men and women \nfor the positions for which their country has trained them does not \nappear to make much sense.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is also our thinking, and Senator Dorgan and I, with \nour friend from the other body, Congressman Earl Pomeroy, wrote to the \nSecretary of Defense on May 31, asking that the assignments given to \nthis year's graduates be reexamined. We are hopeful that it is not too \nlate for the members of class of 1996 to receive the assignments they \nhad every right to expect when they enrolled in the program over 3 year \nago. Every member of this year's ABC class made time-consuming, costly \ncommitments to this excellent program. In addition, the funds spent by \nthe Army over the past 3 years on their training is in danger of going \nto waste if current orders are not reviewed. All 15 students are \nuniquely qualified to be Army helicopter pilots, and we believe it is \nonly right to give these young people the opportunity to serve their \ncountry in this capacity, especially now that significant tax dollars \nhave been invested in their training.\n  It is our hope that any procedural error which may have hindered \nUND's graduates during this year's selection process can be corrected \nfor this year's class. We are also concerned, however, about future \nclasses. We hope that UND students will be able to benefit from this \nexcellent program for many years to come.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Has the Defense Department responded to your letter or \ntaken action in light of your very understandable concern?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, we have not yet received a substantive \nresponse.\n  Mr. INOUYE. In light of the stress that this delay must be inflicting \non this year's graduates, I would hope that the Defense Department \nwould expedite action in this matter. I look forward to a favorable \nresponse to the letter my friends from North Dakota have sent to \nSecretary Perry, and would hope that Senators Conrad and Dorgan would \nnot hesitate to let me know if I can be of assistance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank my esteemed colleague from Hawaii. We will be \nsure to do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also thank the distinguished ranking member for his \ntime and support. I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n\n\n                              last center\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention \nan item in this bill which is listed under the heading of Industrial \nPreparedness, namely the Lithographic and Alternative Semiconductor \nProcessing Techniques [LAST] Center. This Center will play a major role \nin the development of a critical technology for our national defense. \nAs you know, our national defense is heavily dependent on the \nelectronics industry, in which there are certain critical tools and \ntechnologies. Of these, lithography is pivotal to our Nation's \ncontinued success. This is the technology used to create the ever-\nshrinking patterns found on integrated circuit chips and is an area \nwhere we face fierce international competition. The United States must \nretain leadership in this dual-use technology area through the \ncontinued investments by government, industry, universities, and \nindustrial associations.\n  Since 1988, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [DARPA] has \nbeen working with the Naval Air Systems Command and the Naval Research \nLaboratory to develop alternative lithographic technologies. Proximity \nx-ray lithography is considered to be the primary backup to the optical \nlithography technologies currently used, and to have the most promise \nfor manufacturing future generations of chips. Yet by fiscal year 1998, \nDARPA plans to curtail the bulk of its funding in proximity x-ray \ntechnology.\n  This technology is at the delicate point where DARPA believes it is \ntoo mature to meet its development investment profile, yet the \nindustrial infrastructure is not yet sufficient to sustain it. \nTherefore, DOD investment is needed to continue development of x-ray \nlithography and other mask technologies and to demonstrate how \nsemiconductor processes can be used in leading edge military \napplications. This work more clearly fits the needs of the services \nthan the mission of DARPA.\n  The bill the Senate is considering today begins a smooth transition \nof the results of DARPA's Advanced Lithography Program in proximity x-\nray lithography to the Navy in fiscal year 1997. It establishes a \nManufacturing Technology Program Center of Excellence, which would be \nbased at the IBM research facility in Essex Junction, VT.\n  The bill provides for the extension of efforts begun in the DARPA \nAdvanced Lithography Program through transition to the Lithographic and \nAlternative Semiconductor Processing Techniques [LAST] Center and funds \nthe Center at $15 million in fiscal year 1997, from the manufacturing \ntechnology budget, PE78011N. It increases the request in that line by \n$15 million. This increase is in addition to any other planned \nincreases.\n  The Naval Air Systems Command should manage this Center since it \ncurrently is the agent for most of the DARPA contracts in this \ntechnology area. As the LAST Center's programs are part of a larger \nongoing government, university, industry effort to\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\nnurture advanced lithography, both the Center's program and DARPA's X-\nray Proximity Printing Program must be viewed as an ongoing effort. A \ncoordinating effort for the LAST Program should be established and the \nNavy should chair a coordinating panel including representatives of \nDARPA and the three services, as appropriate.\n  This is extremely important in light of recent developments in Asia, \nin particular, NTT's announcement of .07 micron device demonstrations \nusing proximity x-ray technology and Mitsubishi's recent announcement \nthat it is proceeding with a $1 billion semiconductor fabrication \nfacility built around synchrotron x-ray lithography technology. These, \nalong with the fabrication of the Pohang beam line for x-ray \nlithography in Korea, underscore the worldwide investment being made in \nthis critical technology.\n  The LAST Center will allow DOD to begin the insertion of x-ray \ntechnology and alternative semiconductor processing techniques into \nmilitary applications. This Center will be of high value to military \nsystems. I believe the Secretary of the Navy should support its \ncontinuation for a period of 5 years beginning in the Navy's fiscal \nyear 1998 budget request.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from Alaska for \njoining me in a discussion of this important matter on the floor of the \nSenate, and I commend him for including this important item in the bill \nbefore us.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to agree with my colleague \nfrom Vermont on the importance of maintaining the defense investment in \nadvanced lithography, including proximity x-ray lithography. In \nparticular, the research and development that would be undertaken at \nthis LAST Center should provide advanced electronics manufacturing \ncapabilities, which are essential to our national defense.\n\n\n          uh-60 air ambulance companies for the national guard\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to briefly share my \nconcerns about an issue of importance to National Guard medical \noperations and capabilities in New Mexico and Nevada.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the Senator coming to the floor to share \nhis concerns on this issue with his colleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that at the end of fiscal year 1997, the \nNational Guard bureau will only have four National Guard UH-60 air \nambulance companies throughout the United States. I am greatly \nconcerned about the overall lack of air ambulance capability supporting \nour National Guard Forces.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In order to address this shortfall, it would be \nappropriate for the Department of Defense to assess the requirements \nfor additional UH-60 air ambulance companies beyond what currently \nexists in the current DOD plan for the National Guard. This review \nshould identify the procurement profile for this aircraft, as well as \nassociated funding and number of aircraft, in order to satisfy these \nrequirements over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wholeheartedly endorse this review by the Department \nof Defense, which should be completed and submitted to the \nCongressional Defense Committees no later than April 30, 1997. I \napplaud the Senator from New Mexico for Bringing this issue to the \ncommittee's attention.\n\n\n                  MILITARY USE OF A METAL CONDITIONER\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an important \nmatter with my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I bring to the chairman's attention a \nremarkable product called MILITEC-1, which is manufactured by a small \nVirginia company. The product is a synthetic metal conditioner that \nmakes machines run better, and makes weapons more reliable. This \npermits smoother running machines that consume less power, are more \nreliable, and require less maintenance and parts replacement. MILITEC-1 \ncan help our military forces save money and human resources on repairs, \nwhile at the same time have equipment that runs better.\n  Tests and extensive experience by both government and commercial \nusers have proven MILITEC-1's effectiveness. The Department of Defense \nhas issued national stock numbers to facilitate purchase of the product \nby all Federal Government activities, including military units, as well \nas by state and local law enforcement agencies.\n  In fact, several Federal law enforcement agencies direct the use of \nMILITEC-1. Indeed, in a recent issue of the Washington Post, a \nspokesman for the U.S. Secret Service was quoted as saying,\n\n       ``Our 2,000 agents and 1,200 officers are issued a small \n     bottle of the stuff with their guns. We've found that it \n     repels water extremely well and keeps weapons operating \n     smoothly. Obviously, that is a high priority for us.''\n\n  I appreciate the Service's concern for its special mission, and I \nbelieve our troops should have that same advantage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have heard of the Virginia product my distinguished \ncolleague describes, and I concur with his interest in giving our \nmilitary the opportunity to have the advantage that many law \nenforcement agencies already enjoy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that some officials in the \nDefense Department have been hesitant to employ a synthetic metal \nconditioner, even for testing, preferring to use only traditional \nlubricants. This is in spite of the fact that a great many field users \nin the military services strongly prefer it over standard-issue \nproducts. Would the chairman agree that, if the Department requires \nformal performance testing to determine the value of a synthetic metal \nconditioner before approving services-wide use, they should provide \nadequate resources from appropriated funds to conduct such performance \ntesting?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nthat if the Department of Defense wishes to conduct performance tests \nto determine the merit of a synthetic metal conditioner for military \nuse, the Department should consider funding such tests from within \navailable funds.\n\n\n                        PCB AND ASBESTOS REMOVAL\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska help me \nunderstand a part of the bill. Within the Formerly Used Defense Site \nProgram you have added $25,000,000 for PCB and asbestos removal. We \nhave a situation out at the University of Nebraska where the Department \nturned over some land and buildings to the university in the 1960's. \nThe problem is that the buildings contained ammunition and are \ncontaminated. We now need to tear them down. However, the cost of \nstructural demolition and removal of the asbestos and contamination \nwithin these buildings is considerable. Is the purpose of this \n$25,000,000 for problems like we have at the University of Nebraska?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is exactly the kind of problem we have heard about. \nThat is why we added this funding. We want to accelerate the cleanup of \nthese sites wherever possible.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will work with the Department to help the University of \nNebraska to demolish these structures and remove this asbestos. I thank \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                            eoa-type systems\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to enter \ninto colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, my friend, \nMr. Stevens.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would be pleased to enter into a \ncolloquy with my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. First let me compliment the Senator on the excellent work \nthe committee has done this year. This is an outstanding bill. I would \nalso like to thank staff for their hard work and dedication. As you \nknow, I have a keen interest in the Army's electronic maintenance \nprograms. I would, therefore, appreciate a clarification of the \nguidance provided in the committee report dealing with the purchase of \nelectro optic test equipment.\n  The report directs the Army not to procure any sole-source off-\nvehicle E-O test equipment until the results of a study have been \nprovided to the defense committees of Congress. My question is, Does \nthis guidance restrict the procurement of variants of the Electro Optic \nAugmentation System, an on-vehicle tester?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me assure the Senator that the committee's guidance\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\nwas not intended to restrict the purchase of EOA-type systems.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I appreciate the clarification of this important matter. \nI thank the Senator.\n\n\n                   white house communications support\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, historically the White House \nCommunications Agency, commonly referred to as WHCA, has provided \ntelecommunications support for the President in his role as Commander \nin Chief. WHCA, as part of its mission, has provided radio \ncommunications, telephone, and other telecommunications resources to \nthe Secret Service under the authority of the Presidential Protection \nAssistance Act of 1976. This act states that the assistance is provided \nto the Secret Service without reimbursement provided that the \nassistance is on a ``temporary basis''.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. This WHCA support to the Secret Service \nhad been provided on a non-reimbursable basis for 15 years, absent a \nclear definition of ``temporary basis.'' As I understand the issue, \nthis support which is provided to the Secret Service is essential and \nmust be provided regardless of the funding source.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Absolutely, the support is essential in order for the \nSecret Service to effectively carry out their protective mission. The \n15-year practice of providing this support under the Presidential \nAssistance Act has worked well. Recently, because of strict \ninterpretations of that act it has been suggested that the funding to \ncover the cost of this support be transferred to the Secret Service so \nthat they can then return the funds to the Defense Department to cover \nthe cost.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In other words, there is no savings and there is \nincreased redtape. This appears to be a typical bureaucratic solution--\nfix something that is not broken.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Exactly. For 15 years this essential support is provided \nby WHCA and funded through the Defense Department. Now, because after \n15 years someone has decided to interpret guidelines differently, we \nmust alter the funding process and add bureaucratic redtape to the \nprocess that works just fine. Providing the funds to the Secret Service \nso that they can return it to the White House Communications Agency is \na waste of time and effort. There are no savings, just added redtape.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Was this change requested by the Secret Service or WHCA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. To my knowledge, these agencies did not request such a \nchange. The system which existed for 15 years was fine. Certainly, if \nrequired to proceed with this reimbursement procedure they will comply. \nThe support services are essential. Once again, however, if it isn't \nbroke, don't fix it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree. If the support is essential and has been \nprovided for so many years there is no need to create more \nadministrative redtape. Not only won't this process save taxpayer \ndollars, it will cost more money due to the increased administrative \nprocesses. The support is essential and should be funded in the most \nstreamlined of methods. We should continue to fund this support \ndirectly to WHCA and their support of the Secret Service should \ncontinue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I understand that the House has included \nlanguage in their bill regarding this issue. I would hope that we can \nexamine this issue closely in conference to ensure that the most \nefficient and cost-effective procedure to address this issue will be \nimplemented.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will certainly address it, and hopefully continue to \nfund this support program without added redtape.\n\n\n                             b-52h bombers\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note that the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee are on the \nfloor, and I would like to engage in a colloquy for the purposes of \ndiscussing the subcommittee's intentions regarding B-52H bombers.\n  As my colleagues are aware, during floor consideration of the fiscal \nyear 1997 Defense Authorization bill, I offered an amendment with my \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota which clarified the Senate's \nintent regarding B-52's by instructing the Secretary of the Air Force \nto retain the entire inventory of these battle tested, dual-capable \nbombers in active status, and to ensure that aircraft in attrition \nreserve would receive the standard maintenance and upgrades just like \nother B-52's. Our amendment was unanimously approved by the Senate with \nthe full support of the Armed Services Committee, which again this year \nhas clearly instructed the Air Force not to retire, or to prepare to \nretire, any B-52's during the fiscal year.\n  With passage of an amendment offered by Senator Stevens to the \ndefense appropriations bill, a total of $69,500,000 will have been \nadded to the fiscal year 1997 defense budget request to maintain the \nentire fleet of 94 B-52H aircraft. In light of this additional funding, \nis my understanding correct that the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee agrees that the Defense Department should not retire, or \nprepare to retire, any B-52's during fiscal year 1997?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. Additional funds have been \nprovided for operations and maintenance, militaray personnel, and \nprocurement at levels considered appropriate to allow all B-52's to be \nretained in active and attrition reserve status.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the chairman also agree that all the B-52's should \nreceive standard maintenance and upgrades?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the subcommittee's intent. Depriving the \nattrition reserve bombers of the maintenance and modifications required \nfor them to operate in combat would be inconsistent with the \nsubcommitte's understanding of what attrition reserve status entails.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman for this strong statement of \nsupport. Might I ask the distinguished ranking member whether he shares \nthis understanding?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I certainly do. I am pleased that we were able to provide \nthe funding necessary to ensure that there be no question that B-52's \nshould not be retired, or prepared for retirement, during fiscal year \n1997.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nhelp on this extremely important matter, and would like to clarify a \nlast point for the Record. As my friends on the Defense Subcommittee \nare aware, the Air Force's estimates of the additional funding required \nto maintain these aircraft have fluctuated over the past several \nmonths. Would the subcommittee be willing to reallocate B-52 funds \nbetween appropriations accounts in conference, or to describe in the \nconference managers' statement, the subcommittee's understanding of how \nthe additional $69,500,000 is to be spent, should clarification be \nnecessary?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand my friend's concerns, and, if necessary, we \ncould raise these matters in the conference with our House \ncounterparts. I also would add, in recognition of my friend's interests \nin this matter, that we will do our best to come out of conference with \nthe full $69,500,000 we have allocated for the B-52's.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator from North Dakota raises a valid point, and I \nknow that the chairman and I will try to accommodate him should it \nbecome clear that some reallocation of B-52 funds between \nappropriations accounts, or further language clarification, is \nadvisable.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Once again I thank the Defense Subcommittee's \ndistinguished leadership for their strong support. I greatly appreciate \ntheir cooperation throughout this process and the hard work of their \nable staff members, and am pleased that we have been able to work \ntogether to maintain our entire fleet of B-52's.\n\n\n                              telemedicine\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof engaging my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, in a colloquy regarding support to the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and other branches of the military in their \nefforts to promote and utilize the innovative delivery of telemedicine \nprocesses and techniques which improve the responsiveness and quality \nof care.\n  A coordinated and innovative telemedicine system designed to enhance \nthe medical and behavioral care provided to personnel who have been \nexposed to high-trauma events would be of considerable benefit to the \nU.S. military. It would expand the knowledge\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\nbase needed for successfully delivering both emergency and disaster \nmanagement services and would also expand the applications of \ntelemedicine and enhance diagnostic and treatment coordination and \ndelivery. Given the experience of the U.S. military during and since \nthe Persian Gulf war and the increased threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction the military could benefit greatly from such a resource.\n  I would further note that the northeast region of the United States \nis inadequately represented in national telemedicine research. I urge \nthe conferees to consider directing the Department of Defense to \nallocate a portion of the $20 million for telemedicine in the Defense \nappropriation's fiscal year 1997 bill, to an organization in the \nnortheastern United States with lengthy experience in organizing and \nproviding comprehensive medical and behavioral services. A not-for-\nprofit health care organization engaged in the delivery of medical \ncare, in medical and allied health education and training, and in \nmedical research would be the most appropriate type of entity for \nachieving expanded applications and coordination of telemedicine \nefforts. Both the U.S. military and the northeast region would benefit \nfrom allocating funds to a qualified entity in the region.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania that I have long been a supporter of \ntelemedicine and its application to military medicine. I believe that \ntelemedicine can significantly enhance medical readiness and I \nencourage the Department of Defense to seek innovative opportunities to \nexpand those capabilities. I will be happy to work with the senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Department of Defense to ensure that \nsuch proposals, especially those qualified proposals being put forward \nin the northeast region of the United States, receive a thorough review \nfor possible inclusion into the fiscal year 1997 Department of Defense \ntelemedicine programs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa is here. We \nhave discussed an agreement concerning an amendment he is to offer.\n  He is going to offer an amendment to the bill pertaining to the \nnumber of general officers, I believe, in the Marine Corps.\n  I just simply want to ask unanimous consent that his amendment not be \nsubject to a second-degree amendment but that he be permitted to modify \nthat amendment during the debate if he so wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have an amendment I am going to offer, but I do not \nwant to send it to the desk at this point. I hope we will be able to do \ntoday what we were not able to do in late June when I discussed this \nvery same issue on the Defense authorization bill. I hope that I have a \nchance to have some dialog in a very formal way of educating our \ncolleagues about this issue I am raising, and I hope to have that with \nsome members of the Senate Armed Services Committee as well as \nprominent members of the Senate Appropriations Committee who are in the \nChamber.\n  To remind my colleagues, this is the issue of whether or not we need \n12 more Marine generals. This issue, I admit, appears to be \nmicromanaging the Defense Department. Most of my speeches on the \nDefense Department come during the budget debate, the budget resolution \ndebate which is very much a macro-approach on defense expenditures.\n  I think, however, that in the sense of micromanaging we raise a point \nof how money is being spent because if my amendment which I will offer \nwould be adopted, I do not pretend to subtract big dollars from the \nappropriations bill that is before us. The issue here is a broader \nissue of what are the priorities within our military establishment. We \nhear from the Secretary of Defense, we hear from the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and maybe we all agree, of the need for \nmodernization of the military, the updating of our capabilities, that \nspending money on that is a very high priority. And so we are seeing in \nthe days now beyond the cold war era and also in the era of efforts to \nreduce the deficit and hopefully to balance the budget, a military \nforce structure that is downsizing.\n  So if it appears to be micromanaging, it is only because it is so \nvery obvious that when you have a downsizing taking place, why are we \n``topsizing'' the administrative overhead in the form of more brass at \nthe top. The Marines like to say--and I think they have every right to \nsay this--they are looking for ``a few good men.'' Obviously, today we \namend that, that the Marines are looking for a few good men and women.\n  I think most of us remember that slogan on TV or we saw it in a \nmagazine or we even saw it on bumper stickers. For me, these words \nalways spoke the truth, because even though I have not been in the \nmilitary I had a brother that proudly served in World War II in the \nMarines, and I remember as a teenager putting as many of his Marine \nemblems on as I could because I wanted to be just like my brother. And \nso I have great admiration for any branch of military service, but if \nthere is one that I always thought most of it was the Marines because \nof my brother. And whether then in World War II, when they had 485,000 \ntroops with 70 generals, or today, when they have 173,000 with 68 \ngenerals, you can only conclude that the Marine Corps is small but it \nis very tough, it is very disciplined, and, quite frankly, in every \nsense it is very different from the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. \nThe Marines are proud of it, and Americans ought to be proud of it.\n  But when I see these proposals that come before us, I think something \nhas changed, that the Marines are not just looking for a few good men \nand women anymore. With this appropriation bill, and with the \nauthorization bill, they are looking for a few more generals, 12 to be \nexact. The Marines want the extra generals at a time when the Marine \nCorps is getting smaller.\n  Let me say, I hoped to have dialog with the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on this. But this issue that is included in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee bill was very hotly debated in the deliberations of \nthe House Armed Services Committee, and the House Armed Services \nCommittee rejected--rejected--the Marine Corps' attempt to authorize 12 \nmore generals. So, even within this Congress there is a diverse opinion \non whether or not this is justified. So they want extra generals.\n  The other services downsizing like the Marine Corps. The Department \nof Defense has cut the number of general officers in the other services \nby 20 percent. You will see from the chart here how this is divided up, \nbut a total figure has dropped by 204 since we have had the downsizing \nof the military, from 1,055 in 1987 to 851 in 1995. So, why does the \nMarine Corps need a few more generals to lead fewer men and women?\n  You see here, the Army has gone from about 400 in 1987 down to this \nfigure that is under 300. The Air Force has gone from 335 down to just \na little over 300. The Navy, at 250-plus admirals, down just a little \nbit, but down some. The Marine Corps has been very steady right here--\nvery steady during this period of time. I am not arguing here that the \nMarines should have downsized in the number of general officers. I am \nnot arguing that at all. I am just arguing for the point of view that \nthe downsizing has gone on and there has been a downsizing in the \nnumber of generals and admirals. The Marines have been very steady. I \nam arguing that they should not be going up.\n  While this is going down, why, then, do we raise this up \nconsiderably, by 12,\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\nby another 20 percent, more generals to lead fewer men and women? Why \nis the Marine Corps trying to have more brass at the top when the \nbottom is getting smaller? Why is the Marine Corps top-sizing when, in \nfact, throughout the branches it is downsizing? Why does the Marine \nCorps want more generals when junior officers and sergeants are getting \nthrown out?\n  Of course, Mr. President, the heart and soul of the Marine Corps are \nits 27 infantry battalions. This is what the Marine Corps is all about. \nEverything the Marine Corps does is focused on moving, protecting, and \nsupporting these 27 battalions. If those 27 battalions are not healthy, \nthen the Marine Corps is not strong.\n  A doctor has been examining the vital signs of the 27 battalions, and \nthey are not up to snuff. There are, in fact, critical shortages within \nthe Marines. It does not happen to be whether or not they need 12 more \ngenerals. The critical shortage is of platoon commanders and sergeants. \nLieutenants and sergeants are the ones who train the force and keep it \nready to go. If war broke out, they would lead these units in battle. \nSo why is the Marine Corps adding generals when there is a critical \nshortage of sergeants? The Marine Corps could buy the sergeants it \nneeds at the price of the 12 generals it is asking for.\n  I raised, as I said before, these questions on June 26 when the \nDefense authorization bill was on the floor. Senator Warner responded \nto my question on June 28. I did not have an opportunity to have a \ndialog with him on the floor of the Senate on it, but he spent a great \ndeal of time, I am sure, putting together a statement. It was in the \nRecord, and I have had a chance to study that. Frankly, I still do not \nunderstand the answers. So that is why I am here today.\n\n  I raise these questions again for one reason. The Defense \nauthorization bill as approved by this body on July 10 contains a \nspecial provision. That special provision is section 405. Section 405 \nincreases the number of generals from 68 to 80. That is 12 more \ngenerals. The House-passed version of the bill contains no such \nauthority. As I said, there was very heated debate on this in the House \nArmed Services Committee. The House rejected the request for more \nMarine generals.\n  In 1987, as you can see here, the end strength of the marines was, to \nbe exact, 199,525. At that time, the Marine Corps had a total of 70 \ngenerals, 2 more than what they have right now. Those 70 generals led \nthe Marine Corps through the gulf war, which would have been here in \n1990-91. And then, like every other branch, the Marine Corps began \ndownsizing. The number of generals during this period of time dropped \nby just 2, to 68. But marine end strength continued a gradual decline \nuntil fiscal year 1994, right here, when it got down to 174,158. This \nyear it dropped off again to, to be exact, 172,434. That is a reduction \nof 27,091 marines since fiscal year 1987. Despite the continuing drop \nin end strength, the number of generals stayed, as I said here--the \nnumber of generals has been very constant during this period of time, \nand it is still constant over here at 68 to 70; 68 right now is the \nexact number.\n  Despite the continuing drop in end strength, we see this level at 68 \nprovided for until section 405 came along, to authorize 80 Marine \ngenerals. That would cause this figure to head north. My question is, \nwhy?\n  I am sure we are going to have an answer to that. I hope it is an \nanswer that will negate my need for this amendment. But, frankly, I \nthink I have had a chance to study several documents. I have had a \nchance to study several documents that I am going to make some \nreference to in further debate on my amendment, that tell me that, \nfirst of all, some of the things that have been told to Senators about \nwhy these additional Marine generals are needed, are simply not true. I \nwill also try to demonstrate where the real need in the military is.\n\n  I said more sergeants and more commanding officers. We have evidence \nof that. There are papers prepared by a Marine Corps major that raise \nquestions about the need for certain redundant commands and the extra \ngenerals to run them, and also the issue of the layers of command that \nwe have, unnecessary duplication.\n  Then there is a KAPOS study referred to by Senator Warner in his \nstatement that I think shows me something different than what it showed \nto Senator Warner that I want to discuss with my colleagues.\n  So why do 27,000 fewer Marines need more generals giving them orders? \nThese are the reasons that I have heard so far, and I am going to lay \nthese out, but my colleagues on the opposite side of this issue will \ndiscuss these as well.\n  First, we have the explanation given on page 279 of the Armed \nServices Committee report:\n\n       This increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to \n     have greater representation at the general officer level on \n     the Department of Navy/Secretariat staff and in the joint \n     arena. . . .\n\n  So, are these folks then, by that explanation, to become bureaucratic \nwarriors?\n  The second argument that is given is that technology has changed the \nnature of warfare. More generals are needed to run the battle. Some \nwould say this is an exact outgrowth of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of \n1986, and that is why this is necessary. I think there is an awful lot \nabout Goldwater-Nichols that we need to look at that is very \nlegitimate. But it is in regard to the efficiency that comes as a \nresult of Goldwater-Nichols, not the administrative overhead and waste \nthat Goldwater-Nichols might generate if misinterpreted and used as an \nexcuse for in justifying 12 additional generals at this point.\n  Last, another rationale given. Some contend that the Marines need the \nadditional 12 general officers to fill critical war-fighting billets. \nWho is going to argue with that one?\n  But I have some points I want to make about that. I think we will \nshow, at most, a very, very small minority of these might go to that \npurpose, because we want to make sure that we maintain the war-fighting \ncapability of every service. National defense is a primary \nresponsibility of the Federal Government, and no other level of \ngovernment in the United States contributes to that.\n  So, as I said, we have these four arguments, and many more, that \nmight be given. I do not understand these arguments. Why do the Marines \nneed more generals when the Marine Corps is downsizing, as you see what \nhas happened since 1986. Why increase the number of generals when there \nis a critical shortage of sergeants and lieutenants in the infantry \nbattalions? These critical war-fighting billets need to be filled \nbefore we add wasteful and unnecessary brass at the top.\n  I want to yield the floor now, because I hope to encourage discussion \non this. I will have some further responses, but I hope I have more \nspecific comments from the other side. I do not mean the Democratic \nside, I mean people presumably on the Armed Services Committee, both \nRepublican and Democrat, who disagree with my point of view, and then I \nwould like to speak again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am not going to take but just a few \nminutes. The point that has been raised by the able Senator is in \nconference now. This is not an appropriations matter. It is in the bill \nwe passed in the Senate. It will be decided in conference. This is not \nan authorization bill, this is an appropriations bill. The \nauthorization bill that the Senate passed includes certain figures for \nthe Marine Corps and the number of generals. The House is different. So \nthey will decide that issue there.\n  This is an appropriations measure, and I think it will be a mistake \nto even consider this here, because it will be settled in conference. \nThe conference will determine this matter, and since it is not an \nappropriations matter, I suggest that we not consider it here, and I \nask the able Senator if he will withdraw his amendment and let it be \nsettled in conference?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You have asked a very legitimate question, but I was \nhoping to have discussion on it on the floor during the debate on the \narmed services bill. I had asked Senator Warner, who offered to respond \nto it, but on that particular day I was speaking, he could not respond \nbecause he did not have the answer right then, he wanted to study it. \nAnd that is legitimate.\n  I asked him if he would call me to the floor the next day and to give \nme\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nan opportunity to respond. He probably did not have time, so I am not \nstating there is fault. I am simply stating what I believe to be a \nfact. So we did not have a discussion of this.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I assure the Senator, it will receive careful \nconsideration in the conference.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know that, but I think the conference will benefit \nfrom a discussion of this issue on the floor of the Senate that we did \nnot have during the authorization bill. That is why I bring it here. I \nlegitimately bring it here because I am not trying to cut out x number \nof dollars to take it away from the Defense Department, I am only \nasking my colleagues to choose the necessity of 12 additional generals \nin the Marine Corps versus the needs of modernization and a lot of \nother needs of the military and have the money spent on those needs \nthat Secretary Perry has put forth.\n  So I hope that you will agree with me that even though this does \ninvolve the priority of money within the Defense Department, and that \nmakes it an appropriations issue, as I see it, I say to my \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina, I do not want to withdraw \nit at this point.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the ratio of general officers to enlisted \nranks in the Air Force is 1 to 1,380; in the Army, it is 1 to 1,552; in \nthe Navy, it is 1 to 2,143; in the Marine Corps, it is 1 to 2,558.\n  There are 57 members of the headquarters staff who are of general \nrank; they are admirals in the Navy. There are 51 in the Army, 45 in \nthe Air Force and 18 in the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps has the \nlowest number of generals. That is the lowest number of generals per \nenlisted ranks, and it has the lowest number of generals in the service \nheadquarters. They are more with their troops than the others. The \nothers have probably more sweeping responsibilities in terms of \nheadquarters staff. I am not being critical to the alignment.\n\n  I say, I do agree with the Senator from South Carolina. We have never \ntried to regulate through the appropriations process the number of \ngeneral officers. The time might come when we take that battle on. But \nwe have not done it so far. I see no reason to do it now.\n  The Senator's amendment would say that none of the funds appropriated \nby this act could be used to support more than 68 general officers on \nactive duty in the Marine Corps. It is opposed by the Marine Corps, \nobviously, because they have this, what we call, the tooth to tail \nratio of 1 to 2,568, which is almost twice that of the Army. And they \nhave one-third of the general officers in their headquarters staff than \nthe Army does.\n  So I really urge the Senator again to not persist. This matter was \ndebated on the Armed Services bill. It is in conference.\n  I see the Senator from Idaho, who is the chairman of that \nsubcommittee, is here now. I will be happy not to make a motion to \ntable yet if he wishes to speak to the matter. But it is my feeling \nthat this is not an appropriate debate for an appropriations bill.\n  We do not deal with force structure. We do not deal with the \nallocation between the generals and the enlisted, and officers in \ngeneral, between officers and the enlisted corps, except at the request \nof the Armed Services Committee when we do fund separate items they \nhave requested.\n  So I believe, I say to the Senator, this is not a proper debate for \nthe appropriations process. I do not say that in the sense of judging \nthis Senator's right to bring the matter to the floor. But I intend to \nmake a motion to table as soon as the Senator has completed his \nstatement.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to say this again. This is \nnot an authorization bill. This is an appropriations bill. This very \nitem is in conference now between the Senate and the House, because \nthey did not agree with this. I want to assure the Senator that his \npoint will be carefully considered and given every consideration in \nthat conference. I will see, myself, that it gets careful \nconsideration.\n  The House and the Senate differ. They can arrive at a conclusion as \nto what decisions should be made. But to bring it up on the floor on \nanother bill, an appropriations bill, is really not appropriate. I \nassure the Senator again that we will give it careful consideration \nwhen we have a conference. And the conference will begin in a few days. \nIn fact, the chairman of the House committee and I have talked today \nabout starting this conference right away. We expect to meet tomorrow \nto begin this conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I inquire of the Senator from Iowa, does he wish to \nmake any further statement in this regard?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, to comment on the figures, the ratio, \nthat the Senator from Alaska gave. I do not think these numbers are \nexactly like what he gave, but I think they are very close. I have a \nchart here because I want to make the very point that the Senator was \nmaking.\n\n  But what the Senator is suggesting, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, is that we should solve this problem that the Marines have--\nand the Marine ratio is not a problem, the fact that they have one \ngeneral for 2,568 Marines. That is good. That is lean.\n  There has been a downsizing here. And it seems to me that you keep \nthe Marine ratio where it is. You do not solve the problem by making \nthe Marine Corps chubby with generals like the Navy is chubby with \nadmirals.\n  This is what should happen in this normal downsizing. The number of \nMarines go down, as we have seen here from 199,000 down to 172,000. The \nArmy has been downsized. The Air Force has been downsized and the Navy \nhas been downsized. You have seen a reduction in the number of general \nofficers. You have seen the Marines keep constant during this period of \ntime of downsizing.\n  I do not find fault with that. I am not saying that should be \nnecessarily reduced like the Army, Navy, and Air Force. But more \ngenerals would bring the Marine Corps number down. At a time of budget \nconstraints and at a time when the Secretary of Defense is advising us \nhe has to have more money for the modernization of our military force, \nI just think that this is a very wise expenditure of money or a good \nway to set our priorities in the Defense Department.\n  So, as I said, I was hoping that there would be a willingness on the \npart of the Armed Services Committee to discuss these issues. I see one \nof the subcommittee chairman of the Armed Services Committee here. I \nwould like to defer to the Senator to speak on this point because \nobviously he is here because he disagrees with me. But I want to answer \nsome of the points he brings up, if the Senator has strong opposition \nto my amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am here to affirm what the chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee has stated, what the chairman of \nthe Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations has stated, and the \nranking member. This is not the appropriate bill for this type of \nlegislation to be attached to.\n  In the subcommittee dealing with military personnel, which I am the \nchairman of, we are dealing with this very issue. I will tell the \nSenator, without going into all the details, because, again, I say to \nmy friend from Iowa, we are right in the midst of the very discussions \nthat he is suggesting should take place, we are having them, both among \nthe Senate conferees and the House conferees, as to whether or not this \nis an appropriate proposal, and also what the appropriate number should \nbe.\n  I tell the Senator, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Navy, \nthey all support this proposal. In fact, we have a letter from the \nSecretary of the Navy to Congressman Sonny Montgomery discussing this \nwhole issue. Part of the rationale for this is because of the \nGoldwater-Nichols joint operation. We have situations where, in joint \ncommand, the marines have had to forego\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\ntheir responsibility because they do not have the generals to fulfill \nthat role in that joint command.\n  So we have some legitimate reasons why the marines have asked for \nthis. And you do have, again, the Navy and the Secretary of Defense \nthat support this. But as the chairman of the full Armed Services \nCommittee has said, we are in conference discussing this on the \nappropriate bill, which is the defense authorization bill, not the \nappropriations bill. So, again, I just say to the Senator from Iowa, I \nthink it would be in our best interest if we could remove this \namendment from the discussion on the appropriations bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEMPTHORNE). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Iowa wish to respond to that \nagain?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will take some time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Alaska is going to move to table the \nSenator from Iowa's amendment, but I want to be courteous.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have not sent the amendment to the desk yet. I will \ngo ahead, if that is what the Senator wants me to do. I think the \nstatement by the Senator from Idaho, the statement by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina indicate that they want to discuss this on the basis of \nprocedure and not on the basis of substance. So if we cannot have a \ndebate on this, then I guess I will take advantage of the time for \noffering my amendment to express my views in the way of informing my \ncolleagues in this body why I think some of the arguments that have \nbeen used in support of these 12 additional Marines are not legitimate \narguments. I appreciate the attention of people who are involved in \nthis debate.\n  There is only one point of procedure that I will take advantage of \nnow before I save some time on the substance of my amendment. That is, \nremember, this bill that is before us has the appropriations for the \npersonnel accounts of the Department of Defense.\n  The point being made by my two colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee that this is not something legitimately discussed in a bill \nthat provides the money for the salaries of the people in the military, \nincluding whether or not we ought to have 12 additional marine \ngenerals, just is not legitimate. There is no more legitimate point of \ndiscussing appropriations and the number of slots you are going to fund \nthan in the very bill that has the appropriated money for the personnel \naccounts.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who is now in the chair, \nstated the rationale of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation. I will \nrespond to that because I think that if that is the reason for this, \nthen the rationale behind the Goldwater-Nichols legislation of reducing \ninterservice conflict and the duplication between services for getting \nto the mission of each service is not being properly met, because the \nGoldwater-Nichols Act placed special emphasis upon joint operations, \njoint staff, and joint duty.\n  Now, we agree on that, I am sure. The present Goldwater-Nichols \nlegislation presently exempts 12 joint general officer billets from \nstatutory service seals. So there is already consideration in \nGoldwater-Nichols for the needs of joint command, joint operations, \njoint staff, and all of that. We should not consider Goldwater-\nNichols--which, by the way, was passed in 1986--as constituting a \nlicense to expand joint and service headquarters when the force \nstructure is shrinking.\n  Now, I quoted in June quite liberally from Marine Gen. John Sheehan. \nI am sure the Marine command has gotten to General Sheehan and said to \nhim, ``General Sheehan, call up some Senators and tell them that \nGrassley might be misquoting you or using your statement out of \ncontext.'' Let me assure you, I have studied what General Sheehan has \nsaid and what I said in June, and I am going to say that what General \nSheehan said is not out of context. It is a voice within the Marines \narguing that we not have a lot of waste on overhead and command, so \nthat the Marines can fulfill their responsibility. General Sheehan \ntalks about excess headquarters, but the need for excess headquarters \nis generated by general officers who occupy those headquarters that \nGeneral Sheehan is so worried about.\n  He said this: ``Headquarters in defense agencies should not be \ngrowing as the force shrinks. At the end of the day, we need combat \ncapability in the field.'' He is--General Sheehan--is commander and \nhead of the U.S. Atlantic Command.\n  Headquarters should shrink as the force shrinks. I believe that is \nwhat he is saying. The joint headquarters should replace redundant \nservice headquarters. This should happen as the joint headquarters \nbegin to perform the missions previously done by service headquarters. \nJoint headquarters were not formed to create another redundant layer of \nbureaucracy. Service headquarters should be reduced or eliminated as \njoint headquarters take charge. That was the whole idea behind the \nGoldwater-Nichols reform: to fuse, to integrate, and to consolidate, \nget rid of wasteful, overlapping commands, headquarters, operations, \nand equipment.\n  Marine Corps commands in North Carolina are prime examples of \nredundancy. There are four layers of command headquarters for the 2d \nMarine Division and the 2d Marine Air Wing based in North Carolina. \nEach layer has command headquarters, generals, large staff, buildings, \nvehicles, airplanes--the whole works. The four layers are as follows: \nLayer 1 is the 2d Marine Division and the 2d Marine Air Wing; layer 2 \nis the 2d Marine Expeditionary Force colocated with the division; layer \n3 is the Marine Corps Forces Atlantic colocated with the division; and \nlayer 4 is the U.S. Atlantic Command at Norfolk, VA, under Marine Corps \nGeneral Sheehan.\n\n  Mr. President, how many of these layers are really needed? Each layer \nexists to command and control ground air teams of the 2d Marine \nDivision and the 2d Marine Air Wing. Two layers will get the job done. \nSo, two layers are redundant.\n  I am not alone in that view. Maj. David A. Anderson--and, of course, \nI do not know Major Anderson, but he wrote an article called \n``Stretched Too Thin,'' raising questions about our shrinking budget \nand about the challenges before us to do more with less. This is an \nissue from the U.S. Naval Institute proceedings, July of this year, \nright now, in fact.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article of this Marine Corps major be \nprinted in the Record. It is from inside the Marines, another very good \ndocument for my colleagues if this thing is going to be considered in \nconference, that my colleagues ought to take into consideration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Stretched Too Thin\n\n            (By Major David A. Anderson, U.S. Marine Corps)\n\n       Realigning to meet the nation's changing needs will require \n     a painful reorganization--to include standing down the III \n     Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa--but the Marine Corps \n     that emerges can provide a better capability for the nation \n     and an improved quality of life for the troops.\n       The Marine Corps has embarked on a journey into a new era, \n     filled with much uncertainty. This is not new for us; our \n     history is filled with such times of challenge and duress \n     that we as Marines have overcome--a time-honored tradition \n     that we have come to expect of ourselves and our nation of \n     us. This time, however, our challenge is made greater by the \n     environmental turbulence within which we operate; global \n     political uncertainty, downsizing, shrinking defense budgets, \n     changing and competing roles and missions, increasing \n     societal expectations, the ever-increasing pace of \n     technology, and the upswing in jointness and operations other \n     than war.\n       The challenge before us is to do more with less. We have \n     done this and continue to do so with uncommon vigor and \n     resourcefulness. In fact, no other organization--military or \n     otherwise--does a better job of allocating scarce resources \n     to competing needs and maximizing the benefits than the \n     Marine Corps. In spite of this, we are approaching our \n     threshold of effectiveness, because our strategy and \n     capabilities are not in sync with today's environment.\n       The Marine Corps is affected by two environments--external \n     and internal--each of which consists of five broad elements; \n     political, economic, physical, technological, and societal. \n     The external factors influence the internal policies and \n     practices, which in turn influence our values, attitudes, and \n     behavior.\n       Political Elements. The Department of Defense is in the \n     midst of a congressionally mandated reduction in force. But \n     what we have discovered is that because of the unstable \n     nature of global politics, U.S. willingness\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\n     to intervene, and additional requirements to operate in joint \n     arenas and conduct operations other than war, operational \n     tempo has not been reduced in proportion to force reductions. \n     The Marine Corps' response has been to improve existing \n     capabilities within the reduced force structure and to \n     operate smarter, using advanced technology and our inherent \n     ingenuity.\n       The nut that has yet to be cracked, however, is the one \n     that balances operational training, operational deployments, \n     and the morale and welfare of our Marines within current \n     personnel and budget restraints. It is well documented that \n     10-25% of our active-duty force is operationally deployed at \n     any one time. The Marine Corps currently is at approximately \n     87% manning from its peak years of the mid-1980s. It has the \n     longest training pipeline of all the armed services, along \n     with requisite school requirements, joint billet \n     requirements, the manning of a joint task force headquarters, \n     and an inordinately high first-term attrition rate \n     (approximately 30%). This leaves an effective operating force \n     of 50-70% of total personnel strength.\n       In an effort to minimize the impact on the operational \n     force, we have established personal staffing goals, prorate \n     distributions of critical military occupational specialties \n     (MOSs) and ranks, and out-of-hide tables of organization (T/\n     Os). This has created a phenomenon I call ``peg-holing.'' \n     Let's say there are six people qualified to fill ten billet \n     requirements. Essentially what happens is that respective \n     monitors chase these billets through continuous reassignment, \n     with the squeaky-wheeled command getting the grease, leaving \n     some other command bone dry. As an extreme example, consider \n     the shortage of 0402 logistics majors within the 2d Force \n     Service Support Group. While I was assigned to 2d Landing \n     Support Battalion--from August 1993 to July 1995--the \n     battalion's T/O called for six majors; the staffing goal was \n     two; one was on hand. Another example within the same \n     battalion is 0481 landing support specialists. The T/O calls \n     for 312; on hand were 277, of whom 119 were deployed. The \n     remaining 158 Marines then must support day-to-day II Marine \n     Expeditionary Force operations, meet annual training \n     requirements, fill out-of-hide T/O requirements, and maintain \n     an Air Contingency Force detachment (and also squeeze in \n     schooling or annual leave).\n       As additional challenge to our operational force has been \n     the establishment of such new military occupation \n     specialities as computer small systems specialists and the \n     adoption of systems such as the MAGTF Deployment Support \n     System II, which reflect our incorporation of advanced \n     technologies. They have come at the expense of other MOSs, \n     because we have imposed the requirement without increasing \n     overall force strength or compromising mission capabilities. \n     The result--once again--is an overextended operational force.\n       Economic Element. Ever deeper defense cuts have come at \n     great expense to the Marine Corps, despite our ability to \n     squeeze more value out of every dollar spent. Those who \n     entered active service after 1 August 1986, upon retiring at \n     20 years, will receive 40% of their base pay instead of the \n     50% received by those who entered prior to this date. \n     Dependent health care is costing active-duty members more \n     each year. Collectively, our equipment has exceeded it \n     service life. The Marine Corps procurement budget is \n     averaging only 50% of the $1.2 billion it needs annually. \n     Prepositioned war reserves have been depleted to offset \n     nonrepairable equipment, and a growing portion of our budget \n     is being spent to repair aging equipment. The Army is \n     acquiring additional bigger, faster, more capable ships in \n     support of its maritime prepositioning force. We are forced \n     to buy and fix less-capable ships.\n       Most of our shrinking budget, out of necessity, is being \n     spent to sustain operational forces. This leaves little money \n     to maintain or upgrade existing facilities, including base \n     housing (which is substandard, inadequate, or un-inhabitable \n     in several locations), or to purchase garrison property. Most \n     alarming is the backlog of military construction projects the \n     Marine Corps has accumulated. During a recent visit to the 2d \n     Force Service Support Group, Major General B. Don Lynch noted \n     that at current funding levels, it could take another 100 \n     years to fund our current military construction requirements.\n       Physical Element. Many of the facilities in which we work \n     and live require extensive renovation or replacement. \n     Complicating our housing problems is the shortage of base \n     quarters in high-cost geographical areas such as Washington, \n     D.C., Southern California, and Hawaii. Often the wait for \n     quarters is as long as 12-24 months, and the best off-base \n     housing locations are well beyond the means of most Marine \n     families. Many Marines must deal with an excessive commute \n     time because they cannot find affordable off-base housing \n     close to work. Those who can afford to buy homes often are \n     reluctant to do so, because they fear having to sell or rent \n     when they are transferred after their typical three-year \n     tours. Furthermore, housing allowances often fall short of \n     the true cost of housing.\n       Technological Element. In our rapidly changing age of \n     technology, the accumulation of technology doubles every \n     seven years--faster in some fields. The Marine Corps is doing \n     its best to sort through what it can and cannot use or \n     afford. We are discovering that what we can afford will not \n     keep us at the forefront in operational readiness. In many \n     instances, we are able to buy only enough promising \n     technologies to keep our foot in the door. Often by the time \n     we can afford and fully implement a technology it has become \n     obsolete.\n       We are even having difficulty assessing the value of \n     technologies because of personnel shortages. A significant \n     part of adopting new technologies is recognizing the \n     personnel requirements to operate and maintain them. This has \n     placed us in the situation of having to create new MOSs at \n     the expense of others--and thus continue to expand the \n     mission requirements of our Marines.\n       Social Element. The word's out on the street that what you \n     will get from the Marine Corps is demanding work, frequent \n     deployments, substandard living quarters, little free time, \n     slow promotions, and fewer reenlistment opportunities. These \n     impressions, the abolishment of the draft, and eroding \n     benefits are making it difficult for the service to attract \n     society's best and brightest young men and women. It is \n     showing in the Marine Corps' first-term enlistments: one-\n     third fail to complete their enlistment contracts. This \n     problem probably is multifaceted: there is a prevailing \n     societal attitude of ``If it doesn't feel good, don't do \n     it''; many young people are growing up without healthy role \n     models; and some become disillusioned with the Marine Corps \n     when it fails to meet their expectations. But the most \n     serious contributing factor is that more than 45% of our \n     first-termers enter under some type of enlistment waiver--and \n     not just for minor traffic violations. They include admitted \n     and frequent drug use, serious offenses, juvenile felonies, \n     and medical (to include psychological) waivers.\n       I found this figure appalling and unbelievable, so I \n     decided to put it to the test. I randomly surveyed 125 of my \n     first-termers. To my surprise, 57--or 45.6%--had entered with \n     waivers other than for minor traffic violations. As many as \n     49 of the 57 waivers were given at individual recruiting \n     stations. We are having to compromise our institutional \n     standards to meet our enlistment goals. In addition, I found \n     a direct positive correlation between those enlisting with \n     waivers and those who were subject to nonjudicial punishment \n     and first-term attrition.\n       Societal pressures and expectations add to our challenge. \n     For example, we must allow for and accommodate marriages of \n     our junior Marines, further exacerbating our leadership \n     challenge and our need to stretch a dollar. Many of these \n     young marriages fail, adding to an already inordinately high \n     divorce rate among Marines. As these marriages deteriorate, \n     we spend significant time providing counseling and dealing \n     with issues such as bad debts and alcohol or spousal and \n     child abuse.\n     Reshaping for the Future\n       This picture leaves much to be desired, but it is not all \n     gloom and doom. The short answer to our problems is a lot \n     more money and many more quality young men and women with \n     moral fiber and a strong work ethic. Unfortunately, the \n     reality is that our budget most likely will be cut further, \n     our force will get smaller, and societal values and \n     expectations will not change anytime soon. What remains for \n     the Corps to do is to assess more realistic options--those \n     that meet the needs of our nation, preserve our integrity, \n     and stay in line with our Commandant's planning guidance--and \n     choose the one that best meets the challenges of current and \n     future environmental turbulence and is responsive and quickly \n     adaptable to both new threats and emerging opportunities.\n       The first step in the process is to re-identify ourselves. \n     Who are we, and what is our role/mission? As the Commandant \n     has stated, ``The Marine Corps is the nation's naval, \n     combined arms, expeditionary force in readiness. Our reason \n     for being is what it always has been--warfighting.'' He \n     further states, ``It is vital that our organization be \n     designed with one goal in mind: success on the battlefield.'' \n     To this end, the Marine Corps should be measured by the \n     return on investment it offers the nation. The two key \n     factors that determine return on investment are competitive \n     effectiveness and strategic responsiveness.\n       Competitive effectiveness is a measure of how well we \n     operate. It can be divided into two submeasures: efficiency \n     in swiftly and decisively responding to our nation's needs, \n     and effectiveness in getting the job done. Strategic \n     responsiveness is a measure of how well we relate to the \n     environment. It also can be divided into two submeasures: \n     attractiveness, that is, being the force of choice; and \n     capability responsiveness, or whether capabilities match \n     battlefield needs.\n       I believe that our force can be structured and equipped \n     better--to meet the changing needs of our nation and our \n     Commandant's vision for the future, to preserve the integrity \n     of our institutions, improve quality of life for our Marines, \n     and maximize return on investment--within current operating \n     restraints. The proposal is a painful one, but it can \n     preserve our future as the force of choice. We cannot sustain \n     today's Marine Corps and meet tomorrow's needs. A leaner, \n     better-equipped, and more-prepared force should be our \n     objective.\n       Our warfighting capabilities should focus on:\n       One warfighting Marine expeditionary force (MEF) capable of \n     organizing a Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) in support \n     of a major regional contingency.\n       One warfighting MEF capable of organizing a MAGTF in \n     support of a small-scale regional contingency.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n       One MEF maintaining a fully capable, expeditionary, joint \n     task force headquarters.\n       One MEF capable of executing the full range of operations \n     other than war.\n       The capability to employ three forward operating Marine \n     forces in the form of Marine expeditionary units (special \n     operations capable) (MEU/SOCs).\n       The capability to employ forward operating maritime \n     prepositioning squadrons (MPSs) as part of the Marine Corps \n     Maritime Prepositioning Force as logistics support to a \n     contingency MAGTF.\n       A fully integrated indivisible reserve force.\n       A force built around this concept could look something like \n     this:\n       Commander, Marine Forces Pacific/I MEF, with a colocated \n     headquarters at Camp Pendleton, California, capable of \n     organizing a MAGTF in support of one major regional \n     contingency; employing two forward operating Marine forces in \n     the form of a MEU(SOC), with one in reserve; and employing \n     one operating MPS--with current staffing goal force \n     structure.\n       I MEF (Forward), located in Guam or Australia and capable \n     of orchestrating Asian/Pacific Rim contingency operations; a \n     forward logistics base in support of regional contingencies \n     and joint training operations; employing one forward \n     operating MPS.\n       III MEF would be stood down entirely (personnel and \n     equipment), with equipment redistributed to I MEF, II MEF, \n     and prepositioned war reserves; personnel reassigned as \n     needed to support I MEF (Forward) mission and to fill I MEF \n     and II MEF shortfalls, as well as joint task force \n     headquarters, joint, and critical non-FMF billets; remaining \n     forced reduced through end-of-active-service and retirement \n     attrition.\n       Commander, Marine Forces Atlantic/II MEF/Joint Task Force \n     Headquarters, with co-located headquarters at Camp Lejeune, \n     North Carolina, and joint headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia, \n     tasked with employing one warfighting MEF capable of \n     organizing a MAGTF in support of a small-scale regional \n     contingency; employing a fully capable, expeditionary, joint \n     task force headquarters; executing the full range of \n     operations other than war; employing one forward-operating \n     Marine force in the form of a MEU(SOC) with one in reserve; \n     employing one forward-operating MPS. This includes standing \n     down one infantry-regiment equivalent and proportionate \n     support personnel/equipment, reassigning personnel and \n     reducing strength equivalent through end-of-active-service \n     and retirement attrition and redistributing equipment.\n       Non-FMF/Support Commands capable of sustaining or improving \n     current FMF support within the present command structure, \n     with a reduction of personnel strength in line with FMF force \n     reduction and an increased number of joint billets, as \n     required.\n       This plan reduces our force strength by 17,000-22,000, with \n     the following advantages:\n       It complies with the Commandant's planning guidance.\n       It reduces force strength 10-12 percent without \n     significantly compromising operational capabilities.\n       It reduces overseas deployments by 40-60%, thus saving \n     money and improving force morale.\n       It allows us to divert dollars previously committed to \n     support deployments and procurement dollars planned for \n     replacing aging equipment to other areas historically \n     neglected because of funding shortages, as well as to \n     innovative technologies and concepts that will put us at the \n     cutting edge in expeditionary force readiness.\n       It makes the Marine Corps more appealing to young men and \n     women, which eventually will allow for more selective \n     recruiting.\n       It increases the nation's return on its investment in the \n     Marine Corps.\n       It shrinks the strategy-capability gap.\n       This is not a panacea for all our ailments, nor does it \n     completely close our strategy-capability gap. It is, however, \n     a necessary step in the right direction, when coupled with \n     initiatives to get more Department of the Navy/Defense \n     dollars, divest ourselves of unproductive areas, streamline \n     processes, lengthen tours, shorten promotion time, and \n     improve reenlistment incentives.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. By eliminating redundant commands, more marine generals \nwould be available for joint duty. Unfortunately, that is not what the \nMarine Corps has in mind. The Marine Corps wants, obviously, to have it \nboth ways. They want to keep generals in the old redundant marine \nheadquarters. In fact, the Marine Corps would like to place at least \nthree of these 12 new generals in these overlapping commands.\n  Get this: We have 12 more generals. You say we need them because of \nGoldwater-Nichols. They want to place three of these new generals in \nthese overlapping commands. They want to assign more generals to the \nnew joint headquarters, too. I think the Marine Corps needs to make a \nchoice and to place priorities where they belong. That is the argument, \nmy comment, on Goldwater-Nichols.\n  The second is the use by the Senate Armed Services Committee of the \nrationale in its report language where it wants to make very clear that \nthe extra generals are not needed for war-fighting jobs. It kind of \nbacks up what I said in regard to the supposed argument that we need \nmore generals because of the requirements of Goldwater-Nichols. The \nArmed Services Committee says they are not needed for war-fighting \njobs. Remember, the purpose of our defense is the defense of the \ncountry. That involves the potential of going to war. That is war \nfighting.\n  I want to read the language one more time:\n\n       The increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to have \n     greater representation at the general officer level on the \n     Department of Navy Secretariat staff and in the joint arena.\n\n  Now, that is not war fighting. The committee is saying that these \ngenerals are needed for bureaucratic infighting. That is the way I read \nit. And where? Maybe in the Pentagon budget wars.\n  Now, the Marine Corps tells an entirely different story. The Marine \nCorps has provided a list of 14 positions that might be filled with new \ngenerals.\n  Now, I know the legislation only called for 12, but the list covers \n14 slots. I ask unanimous consent to have the list of these 14 generals \nfor the Marine Corps printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 USMC Additional authorization request\n\n       CG, II Marine Expeditionary Force.\n       DepCG, I Marine Expeditionary Force.\n       DepComdr, MarForLant.\n       ADC, 1st Marine Division.\n       ADC, 2d Marine Division.\n       AWC, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.\n       CG, MCRC/ERR.\n       CG, MCRC/WRR.\n       Dir, Warfighting Development Integration Division.\n       ADC/S P (Programs).\n       Joint (NMCC-4).\n       Joint (USPACOM).\n       Joint (USCentCom).\n       Joint (USSouthCom).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Marine Corps says that 12 additional generals are \nneeded to fill vacant war-fighting positions. To the members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, you say in your report that they are \nnot needed for war fighting, that they are needed because of the needs \nwithin the Pentagon, within the bureaucracy. The marines themselves say \nthey need the additional generals to fill vacant war-fighting \npositions.\n  Now, it seems to me that we ought to be able to have the Armed \nServices Committee and the Marine Corps talking off the same song sheet \nif there is a need for it. Those are the Marine Corps' own words. I \nunderscore in this effort the word ``vacant''--to fill vacant war-\nfighting positions.\n  First, if you look at these, to say that these are war-fighting \npositions--and I am using the Marine Corps' rationale, not the Armed \nServices Committee's rationale--I think that would really be stretching \nthe point. Three of the positions, by the Marine Corps' own request, \nare in the Pentagon. I hope I do not insult people when I say that is \nnot war fighting. I understand that the entire military is dedicated to \nwar fighting, yes, but close to the battlefield, no.\n  Two of these generals are for recruiting. That is not war fighting. \nThree are high-level joint headquarters positions. That is not war \nfighting. Five or six are connected with Marine combat forces, and that \nis getting close to war fighting. But now, just reading the request of \nwhat the marines want to do with 14 additional generals does not fully \nexplain the issue. So you have to dig deeper.\n  When you get down to the nitty-gritty, Mr. President, you see that \nfew, if any, of the new generals would actually fill vacant--emphasis \non ``vacant''--war-fighting positions. Now, that is, again, the Marine \nCorps rationale for these generals, not the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee rationale for generals. So to back up the assertion I just \nmade, you need to examine each proposed billet. I have done that. To do \nthat, you need two documents. You need the Department of Defense \ndirectory entitled ``General Officer Worldwide Roster.'' I have it \nhere. This is the March 1996 issue. And you also need the ``United \nStates Marine Corps General Officers Position List,'' provided by the \nDirector of Personnel Management on July 9, 1996.\n  If you go down the list--and I am not going to go through all these \npositions\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nbecause I do not think I have to in order to justify my statements--you \ncan look at the first position at the top of the list. No. 1, \ncommanding general of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force. Now then, \nif you consult the Department of Defense directory, they say the \nposition is already filled by Lt. Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm. General \nWilhelm wears a second hat as commander of the Marine Corps Forces \nAtlantic.\n  If you look at the second position on the list, it is deputy \ncommanding general, First Marine Expeditionary Force. If you look at \nthe directory in the Department of Defense, that position is also \nfilled. It is filled by an acting brigadier general, Edward R. \nLangston, Jr., a senior colonel doing a general's job. He wears a \ngeneral's insignia but is paid as a colonel. In military language, he \nis ``frocked.'' General Langston is the deputy under Gen. Anthony C. \nZinni, the commanding general. Mr. President, I could go through all \nthe positions, but the results are the same.\n  Bottom line: All but one of the existing positions is filled. Only \none is actually vacant. That is why I have said that the marines say \nthey want an additional 14 marines to fill vacant war-fighting \npositions. The Senate Armed Services Committee says they need them not \nfor war fighting, but for other purposes.\n  I want to place in the Record the status of each of the proposed \nposts that I have referred to. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Possible Assignments for New Generals\n\n       Main argument: The Marine Corps says it needs the \n     additional 12 generals to fill critical billets as follows:\n       No. 1.

These are senior colonels who occupy a general's \n     billet. He or she wears the insignia of a brigadier general \n     but is paid as a colonel. The Marine Corps refers to this \n     status as ``frocked.''\n       Source: Department of Defense, General/Flag Officer \n     Worldwide Roster, March 1996; Updated and verified by Marine \n     Corps document dated July 9, 1996.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I have said, 9 of the 14 proposed \ngeneral officers positions are already occupied. Of the nine occupied \npositions, one is filled by a lieutenant general, one is filled by a \nmajor general, one is filled by a general selectee, and six are filled \nby acting brigadier generals.\n  So, Mr. President, it seems like these vacant--again, I emphasize the \nword ``vacant''--war-fighting positions are already well covered. They \nare filled.\n  Mr. President, there is one thing about all this that really bothers \nme, and that is the one vacant position. I want to talk about that one \nvacant position. Of all of the positions, the vacant one seems like the \nmost important one, and ought to be filled: assistant commander of the \n2d Marine Division. It is not like there is a gaping hole in the \ncommand structure. As I understand it, the division's chief of staff is \ndoing the job. He is a senior colonel, who is getting excellent \nexperience, experience that is preparing him for promotion to general. \nBut if this position is as important as I think it is, why is this \nposition not filled? Why is the Marine Corps fattening up headquarters \nstaff with generals when one of its three divisions is short a general \nofficer?\n  If war fighting is the top priority--and that is what the Marines \nsay, not what the Senate Armed Services Committee said--why are so few \ngenerals assigned to war-fighting billets? Only 25 percent of all \nMarine generals are in combat posts. About 50 percent of the Marine \ngenerals are in the Washington, DC, area. Are these misplaced \npriorities? Are Marine generals in the wrong place? If the Marine Corps \nis short of generals in war-fighting commands, then some generals \nshould be moved. They should be moved from lower priority command \nheadquarters to top priority combat jobs.\n  Mr. President, war fighting is not the driving force behind the \nproposal for additional Marine generals. If it were, the proposal would \nbe linked to force structure. But it cannot be linked to force \nstructure because, as I have shown so many times with my charts--and I \nwill not get them out again--the structure is shrinking. This happens \nto be the Marines--down from 199,000 in 1987 to 172,000 right now.\n  So it seems to me that might not argue for fewer generals, but it \nsurely does not argue for 12 more generals. So it had to be hooked up \nto something else. That something else is vacant headquarter billets. \nThat is what is driving this.\n  The Marine Corps commissioned an independent study to figure out \nexactly how many more generals were needed to fill these posts. The \nstudy was conducted by Kapos Associates, Inc. That study is fairly \nthick, and it was referred to by Senator Warner in his response to my \nstatement in June. I do not know whether he actually labeled it as the \nKapos study. But I think it is the only one he could have been \nreferring to. It is entitled ``An Analysis of U.S. Marine Corps General \nOfficers Billet Requirements.'' It is dated March 20, 1996. The Kapos \nstudy concluded--this study that I just held up--that the Marine Corps \nneeded--get this. This study recommended 37-to-95 more generals to fill \nkey positions. I suppose I ought to look at that 37 to 95 and say to \nmyself, ``Well, heavens. If they are only going to suggest 12 more, we \nought to be happy, and just sit down and shut up.'' But the Kapos study \ndid not look at the war-fighting requirements. That is very basic to \nwhy I think you had better be careful when you quote from this study. \nIt did not look at force structure. It had one goal--fill those big, \nfat headquarter jobs sitting out there. The question was not in this \nstudy: How many generals do we need? Instead it was: How many positions \ndo we fill? In no way did this Kapos study address the threat. It did \nnot look at future force requirements or the need to downsize. This was \na study about how to take and hold important bureaucratic real estate--\npure and simple. That is the engine driving the mushrooming \nheadquarters problem that is so much of a concern to General Sheehan of \nthe Atlantic Command.\n  As a force shrinks, generals are flocking to the headquarters. That \nis my response to the second argument. The first one was the Goldwater-\nNichols rationale.\n  The second is what is stated in the U.S. Senate Armed Services \nCommittee report saying that these are not needed for war-fighting \ncapability, and that is opposite what the Marine Corps said in this \ndocument that I put in the Record, where they want these 14 Marine \ngenerals, that that is for war fighting.\n  It also sounds like the Marines want to be top-heavy with rank like \nthe\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\nother services. As I said, the other services are top-heavy. The \nMarines, from the standpoint of general to marine ratio, is a lot more \nefficient and effective. It's less top-heavy but if this goes through, \nthen that means that the Marine Corps will be chubby with general \nofficers the same way the Navy is chubby with admirals at a time of the \nforce is shrinking. I suppose the Marines feel like they have been \nshortchanged.\n  The other services have far more generals. They probably want a place \nat the negotiating table in the Pentagon, too. The Army has 291 \ngenerals, or 1 general for every 1,748 soldiers. The Navy has 218 \nadmirals, or 1 admiral for every 1,994 sailors. The Air Force has 274, \n1 general for every 1,461 airmen. The Marine Corps, 68 generals, or 1 \nfor every 2,568 Marines. Big is good. Small is bad. The Air Force is \nthe smallest, or the fattest. The Marine Corps is the leanest. But we \ndo not fix this problem by making the Marine Corps chubby like the \nNavy, for example. But that is what happens if we give the Marine Corps \n12 additional generals. We fix this problem by making other services \nlean like the Marine Corps.\n  In other words, I am suggesting that, at a time when the Secretary of \nDefense is saying that our primary responsibility is improvement and \nmodernization of our capability, we ought to be very cautious about \nwasting money on administrative overhead. The Marine Corps used to be \nreally lean and mean.\n  You will see here, at the height of World War II, there were 485,000 \nmarines, 72 generals. The 72 generals is about the same as today, 68 to \nbe exact. But the Marine Corps was three times bigger back then--1 \ngeneral for every 6,838 marines.\n  Clearly, the other services are top-heavy compared to the Marines. \nYou do not balance the load by making the Marine Corps top-heavy like \nthe other services. You fix it by making the others less top-heavy, by \nreducing the number of generals. You fix it by giving them the right \nnumber of generals, a number that matches force structure.\n\n  Lastly, the proponents for more Marine generals suggest that \ntechnology creates a need for more generals. That is possible. But the \nreverse is also possible. Technology could reduce the need for so many \ngenerals and admirals.\n  When it comes to technology, you ought to take, for instance, CCCI. \nThat stands for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence. \nBillions of dollars are going to be spent for CCCI. That technology \ngives the top generals and admirals the capability to run the battle \nfrom the Pentagon. It gives them the ability to communicate directly \ndown to the smallest units operating anywhere in the world. Just read \nColin Powell's book ``My American Journey,'' and you can see how he did \nit. He just by-passed all the redundant service headquarters in \nbetween.\n  So CCCI could reduce the need for having so many generals forward \ndeployed with the infantry battalions.\n  So I do not understand the need for more Marine Corps generals when \nthe Marine Corps is downsizing. The number of generals should be \ndecreased as the Marine Corps gets smaller.\n  The request for more generals reminds me of the recent words of \nMarine Corps Gen. John Sheehan, Atlantic Command. I quote him \nextensively on June 18 in my case to freeze the defense infrastructure \ncosts. General Sheehan argues that ``Headquarters should not be growing \nas the force shrinks.''\n  Continuing to quote, ``The growth in headquarter staff jobs is \nthreatening the military's war-fighting capabilities.''\n  So I think General Sheehan from inside the Marines hits the nail on \nthe head. He has identified the root cause of the problem. He helps me \nunderstand why the Department of Defense cannot cut infrastructure \ncosts. The growth in headquarter staff is being driven by one powerful \nforce--excess generals and admirals searching for a mission. Each \nsenior officer needs a place to call a home and to hoist a flag. Every \nsenior officer needs a command, a headquarters, a base, a staff, or a \nlarge department of some kind somewhere someplace. Each new general \nfunded in this bill will need some new piece of real estate.\n  All of this makes me think that more Marine generals now is not a \ngood idea. Responding instead, as the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Perry, \nsays, modernization is our greatest need.\n  So the amendment that I am going to offer this afternoon would put a \nlid on the number of Marine generals at 68 where it is today, not \nmaking a decision for the authorization committee, as the distinguished \nmembers of the authorization committee are saying that I am impinging \nupon their decision. You go ahead and make whatever decision you want. \nBut should we spend money on 12 more Marine generals when the force \nstructure has shrunk by 27,000? Or should that money instead be spent \non modernization, as the Secretary of Defense says? It seems to me that \nis where it belongs.\n\n  I am going to yield the floor. I still have some other pieces of \nsupporting information and documentation I want to put in the Record, \nand I ask to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4453\n\n   (Purpose: To provide $150,000,000 for defending the United States \n    against weapons of mass destruction, and to provide offsetting \n               reductions in other appropriation amounts)\n\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as I understand it, there is no amendment \npending at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if it is satisfactory with the Senator from \nAlaska, the chairman of the committee and manager of the bill, I will \npresent an amendment at this time, but I would like to make sure it is \nsatisfactory to him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared for the Senator's amendment and welcome \nit.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Lugar, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Warner, Senator Harkin, and others, is filed \nat the desk as amendment No. 4453, so I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4453.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that minority staff \nmembers on the Armed Services Committee and two congressional fellows--\nand I send a list to the desk--be accorded privileges of the floor \nduring the Senate's consideration of votes relating to the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that is now the pending \nbusiness provides funding for Defense Department activities authorized \nby the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act which was \naccepted by a 96-to-0 vote 2 weeks ago in this Chamber. That program \ndeals with one of the most urgent national security problems America \nfaces today, and this amendment funds the DOD part of that \nauthorization. We have worked very carefully and constructively with \nthe appropriations staff, our friends from Alaska and Hawaii, Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye. They have both been very strong supporters \nof this overall initiative, and they have been very cooperative in \nworking with us. We did not have the authorization bill drafted in time \nto get that to the appropriators for their consideration in their \nnormal markup activities. Therefore, we have this amendment in the \nChamber today.\n  This amendment, as I have said, deals with one of the most urgent \nnational security problems facing America today. I have just come from \na press conference with Bob Ellsworth and General Goodpaster and \nothers, Dr. Rita Hauser, where they have spent a number of months with \na very distinguished panel, including the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain; the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham; Congressman Pat Roberts; \nBrent Scowcroft; and others.\n  That report, which sets forth America's vital interests and \ndistinguishes those vital interests from extremely important interests \nand distinguishes both of those categories from less important \ninterests, makes an enormous contribution to the dialog we should have \nin this country about what is truly in the vital interests of America.\n  By the term ``vital,'' I mean interests that are so strong and have \nso much effect on the American people, their security and their well-\nbeing that we are willing to fight if necessary and send our young men \nand women to war if necessary to protect those interests.\n  It is very clear in reading that report that one of the top vital \ninterests of the United States is to prevent this country from being \nthe victim of attacks with weapons of mass destruction from terrorist \ngroups and, in order to do that, to do everything we can possibly do to \nget ready for that and to deter it and prevent it by stopping these \nweapons at the source before they get to this country and, if they do \nget here, God forbid, doing something about it and being prepared to \ndeal with it.\n  This threat of attack on American cities and towns by terrorists, \nmalcontents, or representatives of hostile powers using radiological, \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, in my view, is a top and \nvital national security interest of this country.\n  This threat is very different from the threat of nuclear annihilation \nwith which our Nation and the world dealt in the cold war after World \nWar II. During the cold war, both we and the Soviet Union recognized \nthat either side could destroy the other within a matter of hours but \nonly at the price of its own destruction.\n  Today, this kind of cataclysmic threat is greatly reduced, but \ntragically the end of the cold war has not brought peace and stability. \nAs a matter of fact, I think we can describe the period of the cold war \nas being one where we had very high risks because of the likelihood of \nescalation, and escalation would mean the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction when two superpowers confront each other all over the \nglobe. But during that period of high risk we also had high stability \nbecause both superpowers understood the consequence of getting into a \nnuclear war and therefore did everything they could to prevent it, \nincluding controlling clients and allies so that we would not have wars \nthat could escalate involving the two superpowers.\n\n  We have moved into another era now. We are in a period of much lower \nrisk, but because we do not have those superpowers contending and \nconstraining, we are in a period of lower stability, lower risk but \nlower stability. Some of those States that we call rogue nations, \nfanatic groups, small disaffected groups, and subnational factions or \nmovements that hold various grievances against the U.S. Government have \nincreasing access to and knowledge about the construction of weapons of \nmass destruction. Individuals and groups are not likely to be deterred \nfrom using weapons of mass destruction by the classical threat of \noverwhelming retaliation. Most of them do not have a return address so \nwe do not know where they are in many cases, let alone have a real fix \non how to deter them. These groups are not deterred by the threat of a \nnuclear counterstrike, and a national missile defense system, no matter \nhow capable, is irrelevant to them. These subnational groups and \nterrorist groups are the primary focus of our threat today.\n  Mr. President, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a \nseries of hearings over the last year, the subcommittee chaired by \nSenator Roth. I have chaired it in the past and am now the ranking \nDemocrat member on it. We had hearings, a whole series of hearings over \nthe last year. Senator Lugar has had hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the hearings have been about the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. At those hearings, we heard from \nrepresentatives of the intelligence and law enforcement communities, \nthe Defense Department, private industry, State and local governments, \nacademia and foreign officials. These witnesses described the threat \nthat we cannot ignore and which we are, without any doubt, unprepared \nto handle. CIA Director John Deutch, for one, candidly observed, ``We \nhave been lucky so far.''\n  The release of deadly sarin gas in the Tokyo subway was a warning \nbell for America. Prior to those attacks in Japan, the sect that \ncarried out those attacks was unknown to United States intelligence and \npoorly monitored by Japanese authorities.\n  We received a louder warning bell in the World Trade Center bombing \nin New York. It was here in the United States, not half a world away. \nThe trial judge at the sentencing of those responsible for the New York \nTrade Center bombing pointed out that the killers in that case had \naccess to chemicals to make lethal cyanide gas. According to this trial \njudge, they probably put those chemicals into that bomb that exploded. \nFortunately, the chemicals appeared to have been vaporized by the force \nof the blast. Otherwise, the smoke and fumes that were drawn into and \nup through the tower in New York would have been far, far more lethal.\n  So according to this opinion by the trial judge, Mr. President, we \nhave already had a major chemical attempt in this country.\n  We had a third warning bell in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City. This showed yet again the ease of \naccess to simple, widely available commercial products that, when \ncombined, can provide powerful explosives.\n  This kind of knowledge can also give us the threat of chemical \nweapons. This knowledge and much more is available over the Internet \ntoday to millions and millions of people.\n  Our purpose here today is not to frighten anyone, certainly not to \nfrighten the American people. It is to persuade the Congress that we \nface a new and a very severe national security threat for which \nAmerican Government at all levels--State, local and Federal--are at \nthis stage woefully and inadequately prepared. We must begin now, \ntoday, to prepare for what surely threatens us already. To do this \neffectively we must take the expertise that has been built up over the \nyears in both the Department of Defense and Department of Energy and \nmake it available to Federal, State and local emergency preparedness \nand emergency response teams. There is much to do to prepare our State \nand local governments for this threat. Doing it will require leadership \nfrom the people who know about it and who have expertise in it, that is \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. There is simply \nno other practical source.\n\n  In the authorization bill we make it clear we hope to move this \nfunction over a period of time to the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency or\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nother appropriate agencies, but today we have no choice. If we are \ngoing to deal with this problem, it has to be dealt with by people who \nhave the training and equipment and know-how and expertise, and that is \nthe Department of Energy and the Department of Defense.\n  The time to do this is now, not after we suffer a great tragedy. Like \nmany of my colleagues, I believe there is a high likelihood that a \nchemical or biological incident will take place on American soil in the \nnext several years. I hope and pray that does not happen. But we do not \nwant to be in a posture of demanding to know why were we not prepared.\n  This training and equipment function is the heart of the act, but it \nis not the whole act. Other parts are designed to beef up our \ncapability to detect and interdict weapons of mass destruction and \ntheir components before they reach the United States. In addition, the \nauthorization act allocates some funds for expansion and continuation \nof the original Nunn-Lugar concept through very important high-priority \nprograms run both by the Department of Energy and by the Department of \nDefense.\n  Finally, the act establishes a coordinator in the office of the \nPresident of the United States, to address serious deficiencies in the \ncoordination of activities across the many Federal, State and local \nagencies who have some responsibility for portions of the overall \nprogram.\n  The amendment I propose today, with my colleague and partner, Senator \nLugar, and Senator Domenici, provides funds for the portions of this \nact that are conducted by the Department of Defense. It is certainly my \nhope the Department of Energy funding will be in the appropriate \nappropriation bill when it comes forward. Specifically, these \nactivities include the training of local first responders on dealing \nwith a chemical or biological terrorist incident; providing assistance \nto the U.S. Customs Service and customs services in the former Soviet \nUnion, Baltics, and Eastern Europe in interdicting such materials; \nstepping up research and development efforts--and this is enormously \nimportant--in developing technologies that can detect chemical and \nbiological weapons and materials; and bolstering programs in the \noriginal Nunn-Lugar program that are designed to stop these materials \nat their source, which is by far the best way and most efficient way \nand the safest way to protect our own country and prevent the use of \nsuch materials here in America.\n  Mr. President, when I use the term ``first providers,'' I am talking \nprimarily about firemen, policemen and health officials who would rush \nto the scene and, in virtually every exercise we have had, the second \ntier fatalities have come in these categories, people who rush to the \nscene to help the victims and end up being victims themselves because \nthey are not equipped or trained to deal with this kind of threat.\n\n  This amendment is fully offset in achievable savings from various \nDepartment of Defense accounts. The total here is $150 million, which \nis completely offset so this does not increase the bill in terms of \ntotal amount. I am convinced we must address this issue before the \nunthinkable happens in this country.\n  Can we afford to dismiss the possibility that another World Trade \nCenter or Oklahoma City bombing could involve chemicals, biological \nweapons, or radioactive materials? If we do ignore this threat, we do \nso at our own great peril. The trends are clear. More nations and \ngroups are exploiting the increased availability of information, \ntechnology and materials to acquire mass destruction or mass terror \ncapabilities. There is no reason to believe that they are not willing \nto use them. I have heard too many experts, whose opinions and \ncredentials I respect who have vast experience in this area, tell me it \nis not a question of if, but only of when.\n  I believe this legislation, while only a beginning, responds to a \nvery urgent national security concern of our Nation and I believe it is \na strong beginning. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I see my colleague and friend on the floor, the Senator from Indiana, \nso I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield just one moment? Would he be \ninterested in a time agreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would say, we can enter into a time agreement very \neasily. I think we could also simply make a couple of more speeches and \nhave a vote or order a vote and stack the vote, whenever the Senator \nfrom Alaska would like to do so.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are prepared to accept the amendment without a vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I would like to consult and talk with the Senator from \nIndiana on that, but I appreciate the Senator's expression.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we agree to another 20 minutes on this amendment?\n  Mr. NUNN. I have concluded my remarks. I think the Senator from \nIndiana indicates that will be acceptable to him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be a vote \non this amendment--we will not make a motion to table it--if desired by \nthe sponsors, at no later than 4:15 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will withhold that request for a minute.\n  Mr. NUNN. Just reserving the right to object, whatever the Senator \nwants to do on a rollcall vote will be fine. I would like to have a \nrollcall vote but I will consult with him on that. But in terms of the \norder, if the Senator prefers to order this at some later time and \nstack it with some other amendment if we do have a rollcall, that is \nfine with the authors.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are using rollcall votes, when we do have them, to \nsort of flush out other amendments, so I would be pleased to have a \nvote or not have a vote but we will discuss it and I will withhold the \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, prior to the Fourth of July recess, the \nSenate passed an amendment to the DOD authorization bill offered by \nSenators Nunn and Domenici and myself that was entitled the ``Defense \nAgainst Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996.'' The vote on that \namendment was 96 to 0.\n  Last week, the Senate voted final passage of the Defense \nauthorization bill, that contained our amendment.\n  The amendment we are offering to the DOD appropriations bill is \ndesigned to appropriate the resources to implement the programs \noutlined in our amendment to the DOD authorization bill, and to provide \noffsetting reductions in other appropriation amounts.\n  To refresh the memories of my colleagues, our amendment to the \nauthorizing legislation dealt with one of the most urgent national \nsecurity problems America faces. That is, the threat of attack on \nAmerican cities and towns by terrorists or representatives of hostile \npowers using radiological, chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.\n  The current state of our domestic readiness to deal with these kind \nof attacks is woefully inadequate. Our amendment sought to begin today \nto prepare for what surely threatens us already.\n  There were three basic elements or components to our amendment to the \nDOD authorization bill. The first component stemmed from the \nrecognition that the United States cannot afford to rely on a policy of \nprevention and deterrence alone, and therefore must prudently move \nforward with mechanisms to enhance preparedness domestically not only \nfor nuclear but chemical and biological incidents as well.\n  Our hearings over the past year demonstrated that the United States \nis woefully unprepared for domestic terrorist incidents involving \nweapons of mass destruction. Although recent Presidential decision \ndirectives address the coordination of both crisis and consequence \nmanagement of a WMD incident, the Federal Government has done too \nlittle to prepare for a nuclear threat or nuclear detonation on \nAmerican soil, and even less for a biological or chemical threat or \nincident.\n  This is particularly true with regard to the training and equipping \nof the local first responders--the firemen, police, emergency \nmanagement teams, and medical personnel who will be on the frontlines \nif deterrence and prevention of such incidents fail. Our amendment sets \nforth several common-sense measures that could greatly improve\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nour readiness to cope with a domestic incident involving weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Almost all of the expertise in defending against and acting in \nresponse to such chemical and biological threats and their execution \nresides in the Department of Defense which has worked to protect our \nArmed Forces against chemical and biological attack. It is our belief \nthat this expertise must be utilized and can be utilized without \ninfringing on DOD's major missions or on our civil liberties.\n  The second component addressed the supply side of these materials, \nweapons, and know-how in the states of the former Soviet Union and \nelsewhere. Building on our prior Nunn-Lugar/CTR experience, and \nrecognizing that it is far more effective, and less expensive, to \nprevent proliferation in the first place than to face such weapons on \nthe battlefield or the school playground, our amendment included \ncountermeasures intended to firm up border and export controls, \nmeasures to promote and support counterproliferation research and \ndevelopment, and enhanced efforts to prevent the brain-drain of lethal \nknow-how to rogue states and terrorist groups.\n  We seek to capitalize on the progress achieved in dismantling nuclear \nweapons of the former Soviet states and in preventing the flight of \nweapons scientists over the past 5 years and to expand the core mission \nof the program so as to address strategically the emerging threats that \ncompromise our domestic security. The resources that will be required \nto implement programs proposed in the amendment are not intended to \nsupplant, but rather to supplement, current Nunn-Lugar funding levels.\n  In addition to enhanced efforts to secure the weapons and materials \nof mass destruction, we must recognize that the combination of \norganized crime, porous borders, severe economic dislocation, and \ncorruption in the states of the former Soviet Union has greatly \nincreased the risk that lethal materials of mass destruction as well as \nthe know-how for producing them can pass rather easily through the \nborders of the former Soviet Union. While much of the risk still \nresides in the four nuclear states of the former Soviet Union, there is \nalso great risk in the states of the southern tier and the Caucasus. \nThis region shares common borders with nations in the Middle East and \nposes a substantial smuggling threat.\n  Although Nunn-Lugar programs have begun to offer training and \nequipment to establish controls on borders and exports throughout the \nformer Soviet Union, much more needs to be done.\n\n  The last and major component of our amendment to the Department of \nDefense authorization bill stemmed from the recognition much of the \ncurrent effort to deal with the NBC threat crosscuts numerous Federal \ndepartments and agencies and highlights the need for the creation of a \nnational coordinator for nonproliferation and counterproliferation \npolicy in order to provide a more strategic and coordinated vision and \nresponse.\n  This portion of our amendment addressed three serious deficiencies in \nplanning for contingencies at home occasioned by the threats posed by \nweapons of mass destruction. First is the lack of coordination of \nactivities across the many Federal agencies who have some \nresponsibility for some portions of the overall problem. Second is the \nlack of coordination of Federal agencies and activities with those of \nthe States and local governments who will be the first to bear the \nbrunt of any attacks.\n  Third, is the lack of national security funding in many of the \nFederal agencies whose actions must ultimately be integrated with those \nof the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy.\n  To support a comprehensive approach to nonproliferation, our \namendment provided that a national coordinator should chair a new \nCommittee on Proliferation, Crime, and Terrorism, to be established \nwithin the National Security Council. That committee should include the \nSecretaries of State, Defense, Energy, the Attorney General, the \nDirector for Central Intelligence, and other department and agency \nheads the President deems necessary. This committee within the National \nSecurity Council should serve as the focal point for all government \nnonproliferation, counterproliferation, law enforcement, intelligence, \ncounterterrorism, and other efforts to combat threats to the United \nStates posed by weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, our colleagues in the Senate gave overwhelming support \nlast month to our amendment by a vote of 96 to 0.\n  This amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill \nprovides the resources to carry out the critically important programs \nestablished in our amendment to the authorization bill.\n  We hope for an equally overwhelming vote in support of this amendment \nto fully fund these programs.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators Nunn, \nLugar, and Domenici, for developing this amendment which is a good \nfirst step in addressing the principal security threat facing the \ncitizens of the United States today. I am pleased to join them in \nsponsoring this important antiterrorism proposal. I have always been in \nfavor of the wise use of taxpayers' funds and this amendment meets that \ntest. We have to be prepared to combat terrorism.\n  Currently we have precious few means to deal with the threat of a \nterrorist attack of any kind, let alone nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological terrorism. This amendment focuses on that vacuum.\n  Events from Oklahoma City to Tokyo show that there is a major \nsecurity risk in the ordinary--a rental truck or a subway. Training \nlocal emergency officials to recognize the signs of weapons of mass \ndestruction in these mundane circumstances will help prevent these \ninsidious attacks in the first place. Further training will allow local \nofficials to ameliorate the impact should such a tragedy occur.\n  Mr. President, this is the right amendment at the right time for the \npeople of Iowa and the United States. If my colleagues care about \nprotecting Americans on American soil, I urge them to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we concur in the statements made by the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Indiana. The Senator from \nHawaii and I support the amendment. We are prepared to either accept it \nor to have a rollcall vote. What is the desire of the Senator from \nGeorgia?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would like to have a rollcall vote, if that is \nsatisfactory with the floor managers, but I will do it at whatever time \nis convenient.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall \nvote on this amendment take place at 4:15 and not be subject to second-\ndegree amendments; that the rollcall start at 4:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withhold that.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, do we need the yeas and nays on the \namendment? I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4885\n\n (Purpose: To provide $3,000,000 for the Operational Field Assessment \n                                Program)\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Heflin, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Heflin, for \n     himself, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 4885.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 31, line 6, strike out ``1998.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``1998: Provided, That of the funds appropriated in \n     this paragraph, $3,000,000 is available for the Operational \n     Field Assessment Program.''.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nDefense appropriations bill to enable the Department of Defense to \ninitiate a program called Operational Field Assessments. The \nwarfighter, as a result of lessons learned from Desert Storm, Desert \nShield, and Bosnia, needs this quicker way of evaluating joint tactics, \ndoctrine and procedures.\n  The Operational Field Assessment is a nontraditional, field executed \nevaluation that pits the warfighter, that is the pilot, ship driver, or \ntank commander, against multiple threat hardware pieces, operated with \nchangeable technical parameters, as would be encountered in a specific \nunified command's combat environment. The requirements to be satisfied \nand the scenarios to be executed are driven primarily, by a command \nintelligence element, working in concert with the command's operations \npersonnel. It is patterned after the threat, conducted with a ``human-\nin-the-loop'' approach, and has no preconceived outcomes. The object is \nto learn from the experience.\n  The Operational Field Assessment can be conducted on a large scale \nwith multiple weapons and complex scenarios, or on a small scale with a \nfew weapons and simple scenarios as required by the command. It can be \nexecuted jointly or in a combined environment with our allies. It \ninvolves a host of expert organizations; ranging from the various \nScientific and Technical Intelligence Centers, owners of foreign \nmaterial hardware, test ranges, research and development entities, and \nthe services, to name a few. The DOT has assumed OSD advocacy for the \nOFA because the critical experience and expertise necessary to plan, \nexecute, and evaluate the results of joint operational field \nassessments resides primarily in the DOT Office. The OFA program will \nalso be invaluable in improving the future acquisition oversight of \njoint OT The Director, OT, has created a MOU with Defense \nIntelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the National \nReconnaissance Office to assist in support of this program. It is a new \napproach to provide our warfighters with valuable, needed, and usable \nintelligence information in an era when we must be smarter with our \nfiscal resources. Our warfighters need it and I fully support it. Due \nto the urgent requirement of this program, I urge my colleagues to \nfully support this amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment earmarks funds for the \nOperational Field Assessment Program. It is to provide our commanders \nan innovative, flexible and timely response in the innovation of \nsolutions to war-fighting identified deficiencies.\n  This has been cleared by both sides, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We support the amendment, Mr. President, and I ask for \nthe adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kerry and McCain, I \nask for the immediate consideration of amendment No. 4451.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Kerry, for \n     himself, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4451.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. Of the total amount appropriated under title II, \n     $20,000,000 shall be available subject to authorization, \n     until expended, for payments to Vietnamese commandos captured \n     and incarcerated by North Vietnam after having entered the \n     Democratic Republic of Vietnam pursuant to operations under a \n     Vietnam era operation plan known as ``OPLAN 34A'', or its \n     predecessor, and to Vietnamese operatives captured and \n     incarcerated by North Vietnamese forces while participating \n     in operations in Laos or along the Lao-Vietnamese border \n     pursuant to ``OPLAN 35'', who died in captivity or who \n     remained in captivity after 1973, and who have not received \n     payment from the United States for the period spent in \n     captivity.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment appropriates $20 million \nfor payments to Vietnamese commandos who were captured and incarcerated \nby North Vietnamese forces while they were engaged in covert activities \npursuant to United States operations.\n  These operations were joint United States-South Vietnamese \nintelligence-gathering operations. And approximately 500 Vietnamese \noperatives, some civilians, some members of the Army, were recruited by \nthe Government of South Vietnam. And we provided training and funding, \nincluding salaries, allowances, bonuses and death benefits. The \nmajority of these operatives were captured. They were tried for treason \nby the north, and imprisoned in North Vietnam until the 1980's.\n  Declassified Department of Defense documents suggest that the Defense \nDepartment systematically wrote off the commandos known to be in \ncaptivity as dead in order to avoid paying monthly salaries. The death \nbenefits were paid to the next of kin. Many of the commandos spent 20 \nyears or more in prison. This amendment would provide the funds to \nrepay each commando a lump sum of $40,000. This amendment has been \ncleared by the managers of this measure. It has the approval of the \nadministration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment, as I understand it, is \ncosponsored by Senator Kerrey and Senator McCain, two of our Members \nwho should know more about this subject than anyone else. I am pleased \nto support it, but I point out it is limited. It is limited to the \nauthorization. I do not think it ought to be expanded beyond the scope \nas defined in the original authorization. I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4451) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4887\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment for the \nSenator from Utah, [Mr. Bennett].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for Mr. Bennett, \n     proposes amendment numbered 4887.\n       On page 29, line 20, strike ``Forces'' and insert in lieu \n     therefore ``Forces: Provided further, That of the funds \n     available under this\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\n     heading, $1,000,000 is available for evaluation of a non-\n     developmental Doppler sonar velocity log''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the amendment of the Senator from \nUtah. It seems to be very much in order as far as we are concerned. It \nis for an investigation of an entirely new concept. I believe the \nSenator from Hawaii has also cleared this.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We have no objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I send to the \ndesk an amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4888.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 2, before the period at the end insert: \n     ``: Provided, further, That of the funds appropriated under \n     this heading, $10,000,000 shall be available for scientific \n     research to be carried out by entities independent of the \n     Federal Government on possible causal relationships between \n     the complex of illnesses and symptoms commonly known as \n     ``Gulf War syndrome'' and the possible exposures of members \n     of the Armed Forces to chemical warfare agents or other \n     hazardous materials during service on active duty as a member \n     of the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of \n     operations during the Persian Gulf War''.\n\n                         Persian Gulf Syndrome\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering will \ndesignate $10 million from within the funds allocated to the Defense \nHealth Program to investigate the possible links between exposure to \nchemical warfare agents and what has come to be called ``Gulf War \nSyndrome.'' I understand that the amendment has been cleared by the \nmanagers of the bill, and I thank them for their assistance. On June \n21, 1996, the Department of Defense announced that between 300 and 400 \nU.S. soldiers may have been exposed to the chemical warfare agents \nsarin and mustard gas when they destroyed an Iraqi ammunition storage \nfacility in March, 1991. The Department of Defense further announced \nthat other events and locations would be examined to determine whether \nor not additional military personnel were exposed to chemical warfare \nagents. Up to this point, the Department of Defense had maintained that \nno personnel were exposed to chemical warfare agents, so no scientific \nresearch on the link between the soldier's illnesses and these agents \nhad been conducted. My amendment would remedy that situation by \nproviding $10 million for badly needed independent scientific research \non this topic.\n  Many soldiers have maintained that their illnesses resulted from \ntheir wartime service in the Gulf, whether from chemical warfare agents \nor from other hazardous exposures. Some of these soldiers suffer an \nadditional, tragic, problem. Their children born after the war have \nbirth defects or catastrophic illnesses that these soldiers believe are \nthe result of their wartime exposures. No independent scientific \nresearch has been conducted on this link, although medical literature \nsuggests that chemical warfare agents are teratogens. That is, they are \nbelieved to cause birth defects and other problems in children of \nexposure victims, according to the Institute of Medicine and the \nStockholm International Peace Research Institute. In the Defense \nAuthorization bill, I offered an amendment that would provide medical \ncare for these children until scientific evidence determines whether \nthis link is verified. So, I expect that the Department of Defense will \nmove quickly to obligate these funds, and to include in the research an \nexamination of the possible link between chemical warfare agent \nexposure and birth defects.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment provides $10 million within \nthe funding available for defense health programs to research the gulf \nwar syndrome. This measure has been authorized by the Senate, and it \nhas been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is money earmarked within existing \nfunds as was previously ordered by the authorization bill, and we \nbelieve it is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4888) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe it is in order now for us to \nproceed with the recorded vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4453\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has 30 seconds before the vote. I ask the \nSenator, could I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was not here when Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar \nspoke on this amendment. I have been part of preparing the amendment. \nIt has more facets than that which we are talking about here. But I \nwant to thank Senator Stevens. He attended a session where these ideas \nwere thrashed around by some of America's experts and concerned people \nfrom the laboratories and various branches of the military.\n  I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I hope the Senate will adopt \nit. It is obvious to most of us, who are looking around this world, \nthat America's most serious security problem has changed dramatically, \nand it is now the threat of biological and chemical weapons of mass \ndestruction. It will be very hard to contain them and locate them and \nto get a management scheme with high technology and science to find out \nmore about them and to be able to defend ourselves, but I think this is \na step in the right direction getting our communities prepared. I \nwholeheartedly support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment No. 4453 offered by the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn].

The leadership is committed to getting \nthe defense appropriations bill done today. If we continue to have good \ncooperation, we can get it done at a reasonable hour. I thank the \nSenators for what they have been doing, and I urge them to continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S7937-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7971-S7983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE NATIONAL GAMBLING IMPACT STUDY COMMISSION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Gambling Impact \n     Study Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The application may be made within the judicial \n     district in which that person is found, resides, or transacts \n     business. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be \n     punished by the court as civil contempt.\n       (c) Information From Federal Agencies.--The Commission may \n     secure directly from any Federal department or agency such \n     information as the Commission considers necessary to carry \n     out its duties under section 4. Upon the request of the \n     Commission, the head of such department or agency may furnish \n     such information to the Commission.\n       (d) Information To Be Kept Confidential.--The Commission \n     shall be considered an agency of the Federal Government for \n     purposes of section 1905 of title 18, United States Code, and \n     any individual employed by an individual, entity, or \n     organization under contract to the Commission under section 7 \n     shall be considered an employee of the Commission for the \n     purposes of section 1905 of title 18, United States Code. \n     Information obtained by the Commission, other than \n     information available to the public, as the result of a \n     subpoena issued under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) \n     shall not be disclosed to any person in any manner, except--\n       (1) to Commission employees or employees of any individual, \n     entity, or organization under contract to the Commission \n     under section 7 for the purpose of receiving, reviewing, or \n     processing such information;\n       (2) upon court order; or\n       (3) when publicly released by the Commission in an \n     aggregate or summary form that does not directly or \n     indirectly disclose--\n       (A) the identity of any person or business entity; or\n       (B) any information which could not be released under \n     section 1905 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 6. COMMISSION PERSONNEL MATTERS.\n\n       (a) Compensation of Members.--Each member of the Commission \n     who is not an officer or employee of the Federal Government, \n     or whose compensation is not precluded by a State, local, or \n     Native American tribal government position, shall be \n     compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the \n     annual rate of basic pay prescribed for Level IV of the \n     Executive Schedule under section 5315 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for each day (including travel time) during \n     which such member is engaged in the performance of the duties \n     of the Commission.

TERMINATION OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n       The Commission shall terminate 60 days after the Commission \n     submits the report required under section 4(b).\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 704, \nthe National Gambling Impact Study Commission Act, and I urge my \ncolleagues to approve this important legislation.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Stevens, Senator Glenn, \nand the Governmental Affairs Committee for their commitment and careful \nattention to this important issue. Senator Stevens and the committee \nhave made significant improvements to the original bill, providing \nadditional resources and appropriate authorities to\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nallow the Commission to conduct a meaningful study of gambling. I also \nwant to thank the author of bill, Senator Simon, for his steadfast \nleadership and dedication to this effort.\n  I want to share with my colleagues some of my thoughts about this \nimportant issue and about why I believe the Nation would be served by a \nnational study of gambling.\n  The rapid spread of legalized gambling in the United States in recent \nyears has raised concerns in Congress and elsewhere about the social \nand economic impacts of gambling on our States and communities. \nThroughout our Nation's history, the popularity of gambling has come \nand gone, and returned again. Public outcry against casinos and State \nlotteries during the post Civil War period led to a ban on gambling \nthroughout the United States by 1920. During the past 20 years, \nhowever, the gambling industry in the United States has experienced \nunparalleled growth and expansion. In 1978 only two States allowed \ncasinos and a handful of others sponsored lotteries. But today some \nform of gambling is legal in 48 States.\n  Gambling revenues grew more than twice the rate of our Nation's \nmanufacturing industries in 1990. Americans wager almost a half a \ntrillion dollars a year and industry profits are estimated to have \nreached $40 billion annually.\n  A major reason for this astronomical growth of gambling is that State \nand local governments facing budget shortfalls are desperate for \nrevenue. State and local government officials all too often accept \ngambling as the silver bullet solution to balancing their budgets \nwithout raising taxes. Even if a State or community is reluctant to \nhost a gambling establishment, it can be drawn over the edge by the \nthreat that gambling operations may locate in a nearby town or \nneighboring State. For many local officials, the legalization of \ngambling becomes an economic survival issue rather than a question of \ndeveloping sound public policy.\n  The actions of State and local governments that hope to use gambling \nas a solution to financing the needs of their cities and communities \nare understandable. Yet, the quick-fix, ready-cash approach can be a \nshaky foundation upon which to base an economic development strategy.\n  As mayor of Indianapolis during a difficult period of economic \nuncertainty and social unrest in the late 1960's, I learned that a \ncommunity must be built in living rooms, classrooms, and churches.\n  To strengthen the city's economy, we launched a comprehensive \nreorganization of local government, consolidating our city and county. \nWe cut property taxes 5 times in 8 years, attracted businesses, and \nmade Indianapolis the amateur sports capital of the world. Indianapolis \nis a dynamic and successful city, and it has reduced poverty and crime \nthat plagues many urban areas.\n  Long-term growth and prosperity for our communities are most often \nearned the old-fashioned way--through hard work, dedication and \ncommitment to common purpose.\n  The folks facing the toughest decisions on whether to permit gambling \nare leaders at the local level. These officials are frequently \noverwhelmed by the size and complexity of proposals made for casinos \nand other establishments promising jobs and solutions to local \nfinancial dilemmas. They are often forced to make decisions about \ngambling in a vacuum of reliable, unbiased information--information \ndesperately needed to make sound choices that will affect both the \nsocial and economic future of their communities. This is one area where \nthe resources of the Federal Government can help communities by \nproviding them objective, unbiased information they can use to make \ntheir own informed decisions about gambling.\n  Mr. President, while history is replete with examples of communal \ndifficulties associated with gambling, it is difficult to determine the \ncosts--especially in certain human factors related to problem gambling \nthat include alcoholism, divorce, suicide, family dysfunction, and \ncriminal activity.\n  A number of studies have attempted to address the social costs of \ngambling; however, they are often regional in focus, limited in scope \nor funded by subjective interests. A Federal study commission will \nprovide a broad-based, authoritative report on this important aspect of \nthe gambling issue that deserves closer examination.\n  As a society we appear to have made a piecemeal decision to legalize \na wide variety of gambling activities. But this does not obviate the \nneed to be mindful of the underlying problems associated with gambling \nthat lead most of the country to keep it illegal for decades.\n  We know that the presence of legalized gambling can exacerbate \nnumerous social problems, including crime, alcoholism, corruption, \nsuicide, bankruptcy, family dysfunction, and compulsive or addictive \nbehavior. These side effects can represent an enormous moral and \nfinancial cost to communities.\n  The gambling industry does not choose to confront these moral \nquestions. The gambling industry frequently asserts that what it is \nproviding is an adult entertainment option. Undoubtedly, many adults \ncan gamble responsibly, have a good time, and sustain the financial \nlosses that they incur. But we should not deceive ourselves that \ngambling is no different than any other entertainment option. Gambling \nis a complex and problematic activity both in terms of its economic and \nsocial impact on communities and its economic and psychological impact \non individuals and families.\n  Gambling-related employment is not comparable to other forms of \nemployment such as manufacturing. Gambling does not produce a value-\nadded product or reinvestment in the market economy. Although gambling \noperations can contribute lower-paying jobs to a local economy, other \nbusinesses in the region often lose as a consumer spending for goods \nand services shifts to a small number of casinos and casino-related \nactivities.\n  One does not have to be a gambling prohibitionist to conclude that \nour Nation needs to know more about where we are headed.\n  Mr. President, this legislation creates a 2-year, 9-member commission \nappointed by Congress and the President to conduct a comprehensive \nlegal and factual study of the social and economic impacts of gambling \non States and communities. S. 704 does not propose to further tax, \nregulate or limit gambling activities.\n  The Commission will be charged with compiling all Federal, State and \nlocal laws pertaining to gambling. The Commission also will assess the \nimpact of gambling on local businesses; the relationship between \ngambling and levels of crime; and the impact of problem and \npathological gambling on individuals, families, and the economy.\n\n  The Commission will examine electronic gambling involving use of the \nInternet. Internet gambling is a new and rapidly growing activity in \nthe United States and elsewhere. It allows people using personal \ncomputers and credit card accounts to gamble across State lines and \nnational borders. Internet gambling could have serious international \npolicy implications for the United States. Very little is known about \nthe risks associated with citizens who gamble in ``virtual'' casinos \nlocated outside U.S. jurisdiction. We need to learn more about the \nInternet.\n  After 2 years, the Commission will submit a comprehensive report to \nthe President, the Congress, Governors, and Native American Tribal \ngovernments on its findings. This report will provide objective, \nunbiased data and analysis that States and communities can use to make \ntheir own informed decisions about gambling.\n  Providing the Commission with adequate resources and authority to \nperform its duties is essential to developing an authoritative report. \nAllowing the Commission to conduct hearings, provide recommendations \nand have a limited, but effective level of subpoena power are essential \nto achieving this goal. To reduce the cost of the Commission, S. 704 \nuses existing Government entities--the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations and the National Research Council of the \nNational Academy of Sciences--to assist in the Commission's efforts to \ncompile existing laws and conduct research on problem and pathological \ngambling.\n  Senator Stevens and the Governmental Affairs Committee have worked to \nestablish a balanced and effective commission that will conduct a \nthorough review of the social and economic impacts of gambling. At the \nsame time, the committee worked to ensure that information gathered by \nthe Commission would not be misused nor exceed\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\nthe common sense bounds of our Federal system. The bill incorporates \nexisting privacy laws under title 18 to ensure protection for \nindividual privacy and for business trade secrets.\n  The bill allows the Commission to subpoena certain documentation \nnecessary to carry out its duties as outlined in the bill. The \nCommission is allowed subpoena authority to gather additional \ninformation to help the Commission understand documentation received \nunder subpoena.\n  I have worked with Senator Simon, Senator Stevens, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and Representative Frank Wolf to gain approval of \nthis legislation in the Congress because I believe the country would be \nserved by a Federal study. The House of Representatives approved \nsimilar legislation this year, and the President has indicated his \nsupport for establishing a commission to study gambling. It is my hope \nthe Senate will give swift approval to this important measure to \nexamine this pressing national issue. I believe the Commission's work \nwill be helpful to State and local leaders as they make their own \ninformed decisions about whether or not to allow gambling in their \ncommunities.\n  Information is the goal of this Commission. Information will \nstrengthen the democratic decision-making process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me to support passage of S. 704.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 704 as amended \nby the Governmental Affairs Committee. The bill establishes a national \ncommission to study the social and economic impact of legalized \ngambling in the United States.\n  S. 704 was originally introduced on April 6, 1995, by Senator Paul \nSimon and Senator Richard Lugar. Currently, there are 25 Senate \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  On November 2, 1995, the Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing on S. 704. At that time, concerns were raised about the \nadequacy of the funding levels and the scope of the original bill.\n  On May 14, 1996, the Governmental Affairs Committee approved a \nsubstitute which was drafted in consultation with the sponsors of the \nSenate and House bills and the representatives of various groups.\n  This bill, as reported by the committee, attempts to address a wide \nrange of concerns, including balancing the needs of the commission to \nget access to information and protecting the rights of individuals to \ntheir personal privacy.\n  S. 704 as amended creates a nine-member commission--three appointed \nby President, three by the Speaker of the House, and three by the \nSenate majority leader. The commission has 2 years to conduct the study \nand issue a report, which may include findings and recommendations, to \nthe President, the Congress, the Governors, and native American tribal \ngovernments.\n  Under this bill, the commission will utilize the expertise of the \nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and the National \nResearch Council. This will avoid duplicating work already done by the \nGovernment, reduce the cost of the commission, and ensure that the \nStates are not left out of the process.\n  The bill specifies a number of topics that the commission will study, \nencompassing many aspects of gambling and its effects, including \nproblem gambling and gambling on the Internet. It authorizes ``such \nsums as may be necessary''--the original bill introduced in the Senate \nonly provided $250,000 for the commission. Funding for the commission \nwould be subject to appropriations. The commission will terminate after \ncompleting its 2-year study.\n  The most recent Federal study of the effects of gambling was \npublished 20 years ago--the 1976 Commission on the Review of the \nNational Policy Toward Gambling. At that time, that study cost $3 \nmillion--which would be the equivalent of $8.1 million today.\n  In 1976, only two States--Nevada and New Jersey--had legalized \ngambling. Currently, 48 States have some form of legalized gambling, \nand since 1988, 21 States have legalized casino gambling.\n  There has been rapid growth recently in the gambling industry--it is \nnow a $40 billion industry which includes casinos, riverboats, Indian \nreservations, State and interstate lotteries, and electronic gambling. \nDespite the growth in this industry, not much current objective data \nexists on the impact of legalized gambling in the United States.\n  Other concerns that the committee addressed include: specifying the \nareas to be studied; problem gambling; electronic gambling--such as \ngambling on the Internet; requiring the report to be issued to \nGovernors and native American tribes so that they could make use of the \ninformation; and providing a clear definition of gambling.\n\n  The House version introduced by Representative Frank Wolf on January \n11, 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on March 5, 1996, \nafter some modifications by the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Unlike the House bill, the original Senate bill did not include \nsubpoena power. The House bill allowed the commission to subpoena both \nindividuals and documents. The Congressional Research Service has \nindicated that based on a review of commissions created in recent \nyears, it is unusual to grant broad subpoena power to this type of \ncommission.\n  However, recognizing the short period of time in which the commission \nhas to complete its work and the need to be able to obtain relevant \ninformation, S. 704 as amended grants the commission the power to \nsubpoena documents.\n  In order to protect the privacy of individuals, however, information \ngathered by the commission must be kept confidential. The bill provides \ncriminal penalties under section 1905 of title 18 of the United States \nCode for the unauthorized disclosure of any confidential personal or \nbusiness information.\n  Any information obtained by the commission--whether voluntarily \nprovided or provided under subpoena--may not be disclosed to any person \nin any manner, except to authorized commission employees; upon court \norder, or when released by the commission in aggregate or summary form \nthat does not directly or indirectly disclose the identity of any \nperson or business.\n  In addition, individuals falsifying information to the commission are \nsubject to criminal penalties under section 1001 of title 18 of the \nUnited States Code.\n  The commission may serve a subpoena throughout the United States, and \nmay go to a U.S. district court to enforce it. All subpoenas must \ncomply with the requirements for subpoenas under the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. The commission is required to notify the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral at least 10 days in advance of issuing a subpoena. This will \nallow the Attorney General time to raise objection if the subpoena is \ngoing to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects S. 704 as amended will cost \n$5 million, roughly equal to their revised estimate for the House \nversion, H.R. 497. CBO also projects that the costs to State, local, \nand tribal governments for complying with information-gathering \nrequests will be minimal. Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous \nconsent that the CBO's letter on this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 704, the National \n     Gambling Impact Study Commission Act.\n       Enactment of S. 704 would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply \n     to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 704.\n       2. Bill title: National Gambling Impact Study Commission \n     Act.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs on May 14, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: This bill would establish a commission to \n     study the impact of gambling in the United States. The study \n     would cover many issues related to gambling, including the \n     relationship between gambling and crime and the extent to \n     which gambling provides revenues to state, local, and Native \n     American tribal governments. The commission, consisting of \n     nine members, would have two\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\n     years after it first meets to conduct the study and to \n     present its findings to the Congress. In addition, the \n     chairman of the commission would have the authority to \n     appoint an executive director and other personnel to assist \n     the commission in performing its duties. The bill would \n     require that the commission contract with the Advisory \n     Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and the National \n     Academy of Sciences for assistance in conducting its study. \n     Finally, the bill would grant the commission the authority to \n     hold hearings and subpoena documents.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: As shown in \n     the following table, CBO estimates that enacting S. 704 would \n     increase discretionary spending by about $5 million over the \n     next two years, assuming appropriation of the necessary \n     funds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS ACTION               \n                                                                        \nEstimated authorization level.      2      3  .....  .....  .....       \nEstimated outlays.............      2      3  .....  .....  .....       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The costs of this bill fall within budget function 750.\n       6. Basis of estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that S. 704 will be enacted by the end of fiscal year \n     1996, and that the estimated amounts will be appropriated for \n     each of the next two years. We projected outlays based on the \n     historical rate of spending for similar commissions.\n       To estimate the cost of S. 704, CBO assumed that the \n     commission would hire about 20 people to provide technical \n     and administrative support, and that the commission would \n     have other costs similar to those incurred by the first \n     commission established to study gambling in 1974--the \n     Commission on the Review of the National Policy Toward \n     Gambling. In total, CBO estimates that the proposed \n     commission would cost about $5 million over the next two \n     years. This cost would cover per diem and travel expenses of \n     the commission's members and witnesses, salaries of the \n     commission staff, contract expenses and other administrative \n     costs.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: Public Law 104-4, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act of 1995, defines an intergovernmental mandate as an \n     enforceable duty imposed on state, local, or tribal \n     governments, except a condition of federal assistance or a \n     duty arising from participation in a voluntary federal \n     program. CBO has determined that providing documents and \n     information, and answering questions about such information \n     under threat of a subpoena, constitutes an enforceable duty \n     on these entities as defined by the law.\n       Based on information provided to us by eight states with \n     significant gaming operations and from interest groups \n     representing state, local, and tribal governments, CBO \n     estimates that the cost to states, localities, and tribal \n     governments of providing documents and information to the \n     commission is unlikely to exceed, on average, $100,000 per \n     state. Total costs are thus unlikely to exceed $5 million. \n     They would be incurred over the two-year period during which \n     the commission is preparing its study.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: Public Law 104-\n     4, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, defines a \n     private sector mandate as an enforceable duty imposed on the \n     private sector, except a condition of federal assistance or a \n     duty arising from participation in a voluntary federal \n     program. S. 704, the National Gambling Impact Study \n     Commission Act, contains provisions that require the gaming \n     industry and individuals to provide documents and \n     information, and to respond to questions about such \n     information under threat of a subpoena. Those provisions \n     constitute a private sector mandate. Although the demand for \n     information by the commission from individual operators could \n     impose substantial compliance costs in some cases, CBO \n     estimates that the aggregate annual impact on the private \n     sector would fall well below the $100 million threshold \n     specified in Public Law 104-4.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On November 17, 1995, CBO \n     transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 497, the National \n     Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on November \n     8, 1995. The two estimates are similar; we now estimate \n     federal costs of $5 million over the 1997-1998 period, \n     whereas our previous estimate for H.R. 497 was $4 million \n     over the 1996-1998 period. The increase in estimated cost is \n     attributable primarily to S. 704's provision authorizing \n     reimbursement of expenses incurred by witnesses at commission \n     hearings.\n       11.

Estimate approved by: Robert R. Sunshine for Paul N. \n     Van de Water, Assistant Director, for Budget Analysis\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Clinton administration states that it supports \nlegislation creating a commission to study the effects of gambling, but \nhas stopped short of endorsing any specific bill. The Department of \nJustice has stated that the substitute addresses many of the agency's \nconcerns, and have asked that their views be included in the Record. \nMr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Justice \nDepartment letter outlining the administration views on the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in regard to S. 704, the \n     National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, which the \n     Committee ordered reported last week. I especially want to \n     express my appreciation to you for your staff's cooperation \n     in resolving several concerns expressed by the Department.\n       As President Clinton recently stated in letters to Senators \n     Simon and Lugar, the Administration supports the \n     establishment of this Commission. One of the duties of this \n     panel is to conduct a comprehensive study, which will include \n     an assessment of the relationship between gambling and levels \n     of crime.\n       The Committee-approved version of S. 704 addresses a number \n     of issues of concern to the Department of Justice. For \n     example, section 5(b)(1) gives the Commission the power to \n     subpoena certain information, but also provides that the \n     ``Commission shall transmit to the Attorney General a \n     confidential, written notice at least ten days in advance of \n     the issuance of any such subpoena.'' This provision would \n     allow the Department to learn in advance who is being \n     subpoenaed and the subject matter of the subpoena. In \n     addition to keeping us abreast of what the Commission is \n     doing, this would permit the Department to object or make our \n     views known regarding such subpoena.\n       However, we understand that this provision does not \n     constitute any kind of approval process. No inference should \n     be drawn if the Department is notified of the pending \n     issuance of a subpoena and does or does not object or \n     comment. For example, such silence should not be construed as \n     approval or endorsement of the subpoena or its subject \n     matter. Nor should the presence or absence of a comment be \n     construed to indicate the presence or absence of a criminal \n     investigation, on which the Department as a matter of policy \n     does not comment.\n       We understand that Section 5(b) does not grant the \n     Commission authority to subpoena federal agencies. However, \n     section 5(c) of the bill gives the Commission the authority \n     to obtain information directly from federal agencies. This \n     provision says that ``[u]pon request of the Commission, the \n     head of such department or agency may furnish such \n     information to the Commission.'' This language is intended to \n     preserve the ability of a federal agency, including the \n     Department of Justice, to use its discretion and judgment in \n     withholding privileged and sensitive information.\n       We would appreciate it if you would include this letter in \n     the record of consideration of this legislation. Again, we \n     thank you and your staff for your cooperation in resolving \n     these important issues.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the presentation of this report.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may be of \n     assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong in support of the Stevens \nsubstitute to S. 704--legislation to set up a national commission to \nstudy the growth of legalized gambling in America and its relevant \nsocial, economic, and legal impacts.\n  Gambling is an industry that is growing rapidly. In 1976--the last \ntime we studied this issue on a national basis--legalized wagering in \nthe United States totaled $22 billion, while legalized gaming \napproached $3 billion. In 1994, legal wagering exceeded $482 billion, \nwhile legal gaming reached $40 billion. We now have riverboat and land-\nbased casino gambling in a number of States, and most States operate \ntheir own lotteries. In addition, Indian tribes are increasingly \nturning to casino and other forms of gaming as a tool for economic \ndevelopment. Finally, the gambling industry is looking toward the \nInternet and other electronic media as the markets for the future.\n  This kind of explosive growth in an industry that brings with it both \nserious economic and social costs along with benefits is at least a \ncause for further study. So I support the establishment of a national \ncommission. This issue has not been examined on a national or Federal \nlevel for nearly 20 years and I believe that it is time we looked at \ngambling in America in greater depth.\n  The 1976 commission concluded that the regulation of gambling should \nbe a State responsibility. With the exception of gambling on Indian \nlands where\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nthere is a shared Federal-State role, that is currently the case. But \ngiven the rapid growth of the industry in America in recent years, the \nproper role of the States and the Federal Government on this issue \nneeds study and examination. There are important federalism and \nsovereignty questions that need to be answered. I don't have the \nanswers--I'm not sure any of my colleagues do either. That's why \nestablishing a commission to study gambling and to advise Federal, \nState, local, and tribal policymakers is both necessary and worthwhile. \nSome might argue that this commission represents an intrusion on states \nrights. I don't agree. This commission does not have the power to \nregulate, only to make recommendations. It is a study commission, not a \nregulatory body.\n  This substitute represents a considerable improvement from the \noriginal S. 704. The commission's charter has been strengthened. It \nwill assess: the impact of existing policies and practices concerning \nlegalized gambling; the impact of pathological gambling on individuals \nand families; the relationship between gambling and levels of crime; \nthe growth of electronic or Internet gambling; and the extent to which \nalternative sources of revenues could be developed for State, local, \nand tribal governments. Based on its examination of these issues, the \ncommission will then make appropriate recommendations to policymakers \nat all levels of government.\n  The substitute includes my proposal that the commission contract with \nthe National Academy of Sciences [NAS] to assist in producing the \nstudy, with a particular emphasis on employing the NAS to study the \nproblem of pathological gambling. This may be the most pernicious \naspect of the growth of legalized gambling and we don't have much \nknowledge about it. We read the occasional story in the newspaper about \nsome of the elderly cashing their social security checks to play the \nslot machines; teenagers gambling on the internet; the poor getting \nhooked on the lottery or keno; or others committing suicide under the \nweight of crushing casino debts. But we don't have much national or \naggregate information on problem gambling and how it is being affected \nby the rapid growth of the industry. With its scientific expertise, the \nNAS is the ideal organization to gather and analyze this information.\n  The commission is also directed to utilize the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations [ACIR] to review existing State and local \nlaws and policies on gambling, including existing enforcement and \nregulatory practices that address crime and gambling. Earlier drafts of \nthe substitute had ACIR carrying out all the responsibilities of the \ncommission. I thought that was too much for ACIR to do, first, because \nsome of the aspects of the study are outside the scope of ACIR's \nexpertise and second, because some in Congress have unfortunately \nsucceeded in nearly zeroing out ACIR's appropriation, thus making it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for ACIR to carry out the commission's \nwork. This version wisely focuses ACIR to look at the Federalism \naspects of the gambling issue, where ACIR's expertise would be most \nhelpful and where it will need less funding to do the work.\n  The Stevens substitute does grant the commission limited subpoena \nauthority. Some have argued that subpoena power gives the commission an \nopen license to conduct a witchhunt in a legitimate industry. These \narguments have been raised in discussing the House version, which \ngrants the commission unlimited subpoena authority and charges it with \nsuch missions as investigating organized crime and political \ncorruption. The Senate bill is different. We don't have the commission \nlooking into organized crime or political corruption. Its mission is to \nfocus on the broader socio-economic impact of gambling, with the only \nmatter relating to crime that the commission is to look at is the \ncorrelation between gambling and crime rates. This would be valuable \ninformation for states or communities who are considering legalizing \ngambling in their jurisdictions.\n  The Stevens substitute does grant the commission power to subpoena \ndocumentary information. I think such subpoena authority is needed to \nensure that the commission has access to all the documents it needs to \ncarry out its work in a thorough and independent manner.\n  I would point out that the 1976 commission had subpoena authority. I \nwould like to read an excerpt from a letter from Charles Morin, \nChairman of the 1976 Commission, to Congressman Frank Wolf, sponsor of \nthe House bill.\n       The 1972-76 commission had subpoena power and, because of \n     that, we never had to use it--in other words, when you have \n     the power you will get cooperation. Obviously, the power need \n     not be unrestricted and Congress may see fit to provide \n     safeguards and, if the power were to be abused and there were \n     non-compliance, the commission would be forced into court to \n     compel compliance--something it would be most reluctant to \n     do. On the other hand, if it were used legitimately, it would \n     mean that information had been withheld for a reason--which \n     is why you must have the power! And in the normal instance, \n     as we found out from our years of experience, the knowledge \n     that we had the power and would not hesitate to use it \n     provided all the persuasion we needed.\n\n  I think Mr. Morin sums up pretty well why subpoena power is needed. \nBut he does note that Congress may wish to put some parameters and \nlimits around the commission's subpoena power. We've done that. The \ncommission may only subpoena documentary information, and that is only \nafter those who possess the materials fail to supply them as requested \nby the commission. The commission cannot subpoena witnesses to compel \npublic testimony. This should satisfy those who are concerned that the \ncommission might misuse its subpoena authority to create some sort of \npublic spectacle. The commission may also issue a subpoena in order to \nhelp it understand the materials already obtained pursuant to that \nauthority, and the choice is given to the respondent to submit answers \neither through a sworn deposition or written interrogatories under \noath. Finally, we require the commission to issue written notice to the \nAttorney General at least 10 days in advance of issuing any subpoena.\n  Still, some remained concerned that the commission would misuse its \nsubpoena authority to publicly disclose confidential business \ninformation, or violate the privacy of certain individuals who gamble. \nSo we added an additional safeguard. We placed the commission under the \nTrade Secrets Act, Federal law which carries with it both civil and \ncriminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of confidential \nbusiness information by any Federal employee. Serious violations of the \nact can lead to a jail sentence of up to one year. The Trade Secrets \nAct applies to all Federal employees and officers of the Federal \nGovernment and we would extend its application to the members and \nemployees of the commission.\n  So we have put some limits on the commission and set up penalties if \nthose limits are violated. Those who might argue that we have created \nsome renegade commission are misguided. We have granted the commission \nthe powers it needs to carry out its mission, but we've also ensured \nthat penalties exist for those who abuse those powers.\n  There are a couple of points I would like to clarify in the \nlegislation since we did not file a report on it. First of all, we are \nmaking one change to the bill since the markup. We are correcting \nlanguage in Section 5 to ensure that the Trade Secrets Act covers not \nonly subpoenaed information, but information voluntarily supplied to \nthe commission. Without this change, people would be discouraged from \nvoluntarily supplying confidential business information to the \ncommission as it would otherwise not be protected. Our change also \nincludes a provision that ensures that the Trade Secrets Act applies \nonly to confidential business information. Business or other \ninformation that is currently available to the public or already in the \npublic domain, such as information in trade publications, journals, \nmagazines, 10(k) filings, etc., would not be covered by the act. The \ncommission should be able to publicly discuss and release information \nthat is already in the public domain without fear of facing some \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n\n  The commission, under section 5(b)(2), is allowed to issue additional \nsubpoenas to further its understanding about materials already produced \nby that means. The respondent, again, has the choice as to how to \ncomply--either by a sworn deposition or through written interrogatories \nunder oath. In my view, it is crucial to discuss what the\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\nverb ``to understand'' means in this regard. Indeed, it is a relatively \nnew term of art in defining subpoena authority. A very narrow reading \nwould limit such a subpoena to helping the commission understand only \nwhat is written on a page. I do not subscribe to this very restrictive \ninterpretation and certainly do not think it is our intent to do so. \nQuestions about the facts and circumstances beyond the four corners of \na document--how it was developed, who was responsible for writing and/\nor approving it, and under what context--may be well necessary and \ncrucial to augment the commission's understanding of the materials at \nhand and carry out its duties. I think the commission should have such \nauthority and use it, if necessary, to clarify and supplement the \ninformation contained in the documents themselves. That's the only way \nthe commission will be able to fully comprehend the meaning and context \nof any subpoenaed documents.\n  This commission will be closely watched by many, including those with \nthe power and resources to tie the commission up in costly litigation. \nIt is subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act [FACA], a statute \nwhich requires compliance with open meetings and public access, but \nalso a statute that allows litigation, something we've seen a \nsignificant amount of in the last several years with various executive \nbranch commissions and taskforces. So I would urge the commission at \nits first meeting to read FACA and to closely adhere to its \nrequirements.\n  We've given the commission significant latitude in establishing its \nown rules and procedures of operation. I would urge that at its very \nfirst meeting that the commission establish those procedures, and not \nwait until later when some issue arises and the commission has not set \nappropriate rules to deal with it. In particular, the commission should \nestablish its rules for the issuing of subpoenas in their first \nmeeting, and not wait to establish those rules just before the \ncommission is actually considering issuing a subpoena.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senators Simon, Lugar, and Lieberman and \ntheir respective staffs for working with Senator Stevens and I to \ndevelop this legislation. It is a well thought out proposal that will \nensure a thorough, balanced, and fair examination of gambling in \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Stevens in \na colloquy regarding the enforcement of a subpoena issued by the \nGambling Impact Study Commission. The vast majority of Federal \ncommissions created by Congress in recent years have not possessed \nsubpoena power. Of the few commissions in the past that have been \ngranted subpoena power, and in this case I support it, the authority to \nenforce a subpoena was typically placed with the U.S. Attorney General. \nFor example, legislation which established the National Indian Gaming \nCommission, the Commission on Civil Rights, the Commission on \nGovernment Procurement, and the President's Commission on Organized \nCrime expressly specified the Attorney General's involvement in any \naction to enforce a subpoena.\n  The language of S. 704, the Gambling Impact Study Commission Act, \nprovides that ``* * * the Commission may apply to a U.S. district court \nfor an order requiring that person to comply with such subpoena.'' It \nis my understanding that the Attorney General, which has expertise in \nthis type of matter, could be asked by the commission to seek \nenforcement of a commission subpoena, and it is often the case that the \nAttorney General is asked to do so.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. We have been in contact with the \nDepartment of Justice [DOJ] and have been advised informally the DOJ \nwould not object to enforcing a subpoena issued by the commission. In \nfact, they have been operating under the assumption that they would be \ncalled upon to enforce such a subpoena. There are many other Government \nbodies which use DOJ to enforce subpoenas and they are fully staffed to \nhandle such requests.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, a matter that I would like to clarify with \nthe bill's lead sponsor, Senator Simon, involves two interrelated \nissues regarding the Commission's study of the role of advertising in \npromoting gaming. First, unlike the Commission's other areas of study, \nadvertising is a constitutionally protected right of communication \nbetween buyers and sellers of legal products. Second, the Federal \nGovernment, through the Federal Trade Commission, already exercises \nbroad enforcement and regulatory authority over false and deceptive \nadvertisements in general, including those for gaming.\n  My question to my colleague is whether the Commission will be mindful \nof the unique first amendment liberties for advertising, and of the \nFTC's already existing regulatory authority over false and deceptive \nadvertising when the Commission assesses and evaluates the impact of \ngaming advertisements.\n  Mr. SIMON. My answer to my friend from Nevada, Senator Bryan, is an \nunequivocal yes on both counts. As my colleague points out, the first \namendment freedom of commercial speech provides important liberties for \nadvertising. It is my hope and intention that the Commission will grant \nspecial attention to the first amendment implications of its \nrecommendations and avoid trespassing upon any constitutionally \nprotected freedoms of commercial speech when it formulates its policy \nrecommendations.\n  Moreover, as my friend from Nevada points out, section 5 of the \nFederal Trade Commission Act empowers the FTC to prevent ``unfair or \ndeceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.'' It is my hope and \nintention that the Commission will take this fact into account and, to \nthe extent practicable and appropriate, will incorporate the FTC's \nexisting authority and expertise over false and deceptive advertising.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Stevens in \na colloquy regarding the privacy rights of individual citizens who \nengage in legal gambling activities.\n  The Gambling Impact Study Commission Act (S. 704), which I \ncosponsored and support, is intended to conduct a thorough study of \nissues related to legalized gambling. Private citizens who engage in \nlegal gambling activities, dine in a casino restaurant or stay in a \ncasino hotel, should also have their right to privacy protected.\n  The sponsors of this bill and other Members of the Senate have been \ncareful to state that the intent of this bill is to conduct a thorough \nstudy of the gaming industry while protecting the privacy rights of \nindividual gamblers. I understand that this legislation addresses the \nprivacy issue by prohibiting the release of individual information \nunless it is in aggregate or summary form and that there are sufficient \ncriminal and civil penalties to prevent public release of such \ninformation. In addition, this legislation is intended to be consistent \nwith any other law which offers privacy protection to American \ncitizens, including the Privacy Act of 1974.\n  Would you agree that the intent of this legislation is to provide the \nCommission with the necessary tools to gather the information it needs \nwhile protecting the privacy rights of Americans? It is my \nunderstanding that it is estimated that between 4 and 6 percent of \ngamblers are compulsive gamblers. Is it correct to assume that, \nalthough the Commission can subpoena the information, it would not have \na need for the personal records of private citizens, including the vast \nmajority of individual gamblers who are not considered compulsive \ngamblers?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct on all counts. This legislation \nfully protects the privacy rights of American citizens.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record should reflect that had this \nmatter been decided by a roll call vote, I would have voted in the \nnegative.\n  I believe this legislation to be unwarranted, invasive, and \npotentially capable of doing more harm than good. It is indeed ironic \nthat this Congress, which professes to be a States rights Congress has \nchosen to take action on a bill that affects an inherently State \nmatter.\n  While this bill enjoys overwhelming support--even from some in the \ngaming industry--I believe it establishes a poor precedent. We should \nnot be creating commissions to study lawful industries governed \npredominantly by State law. Nevada's regulation of gaming works well. \nAs the former chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, I know\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nfirst-hand the many benefits resulting from this successful \nrelationship.\n  Notwithstanding over 200 studies of gaming, the proponents of this \nlegislation argue that yet another study is warranted. I believe the \nmost recent impetus for greater examination is but the camel's nose \nunder the tent. Opponents of legalized gaming seek to use this \ncommission as a means to increase both Federal regulation and taxation \nof gaming. Ultimately, in my opinion, they will not be satiated until \nthis law abiding industry is either outlawed or regulated to death. I \nwish to disabuse them of any notion that they will succeed in their \nendeavors without a fight.\n  It is difficult to even grant this commission the benefit of the \ndoubt. While I have some hope that the commission will appreciate \nNevada's model of modern gaming operations I am concerned that it will \nfocus on those stories where gaming has failed. The well organized \nspecial interests lined up against lawful gaming operations have \nconsistently demonstrated their willingness to find only one side of \nthe debate. It is imperative that those who are appointed to this \ncommission include people of good will and impartiality who are capable \nof examining this industry from an unbiased perspective. It does not \nneed headline seekers intent on magnifying a few unique negative \nstories and painting a broad-brush gloom and doom picture that would \nunfairly taint Nevada's No. 1 employer.\n  Perhaps my greatest objection to this measure, however, is the \nunwarranted inclusion of subpoena power. In this Senator's view, we \nshould not be empowering congressionally appointed commissions with \nsuch broad subpoena authority for a study of gaming. Permitting the \nexercise of such a coercive tool only invites mischief and abuse by \nthose who are hostile to the gaming industry.\n  I realize it is the prerogative of the majority to set this Congress' \nagenda and prioritize those issues that should be addressed. I do not \nbelieve the formation of this unwarranted commission is, or should be, \na priority. Again, this is a matter of States rights.\n  Today, by voting against this bill, I realize I represent but the \nsmallest minority. However, I believe my concerns about the potential \nfor abuse and officious intrusion are entirely warranted. There is not \na doubt in my mind as to the ultimate agenda of the antigaming \nextremists. It is my sincere hope that my fears are proved wrong. I \nwish I could stand before this body and say I look forward to reading a \nresponsible and insightful report on gaming. Unfortunately, while this \ncommission may be created with the best of intentions, there is too \nmuch opportunity for it to do mischief and promote unwarranted \nproposals. That said, I will be steadfast in my own monitoring of its \nevolvement and agenda.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to register my strong \nopposition to S. 704, the Gaming Impact Study Commission Act. While \nthis bill is improved over the egregious version that passed the House, \nI still believe this is a waste of taxpayer's money and has the \npotential of becoming a witch-hunt instead of a legitimate study. If \nthis turns into a witch-hunt, it could have a chilling effect on \nleglaized gaming nationwide and have a devasting effect on the economy \nof my State of Nevada.\n  Advocates of legislation to create a Federal Gambling Study \nCommission have stated the purpose of the commission is to study the \nsocioeconomic effects of all forms of gambling and to make \nrecommendations to Congress. They consistently emphasize that no one, \nleast of all the legal gaming industry, should fear just a study.\n  While the gaming-entertainment industry has nothing to fear from a \nfair and unbiased study, anti-gaming groups have tried to skew this \nstudy into looking at only one side of the issue and to turn this into \na crusade.\n  The argument has been advanced that a Federal commission is needed to \nlook at the impacts of the spread of gaming because State and local \ngovernments lack the ability to acquire and act on objective \ninformation in the face of well-financed attempts to put casinos or \nother gaming-entertainment operations in their area.\n  The reason why this premise is false is that even without the \nassistance of a Federal commission, jurisdiction after jurisdiction has \nactually decided not to approve an expansion of gaming. No State has \napproved new casino gaming for several years. For example, 7 of 10 \ngaming initiatives were defeated in 1994 and no new casino gaming or \nvideo poker was approved by a new jurisdiction in 1995.\n  The proposed commission is a Federal solution in search of a \nnonexistent State problem: States are free to make their own decisions \non whether to permit gaming, one way or another.\n  Still others attack legalized gaming as some insidious form of \nentertainment that must be banned. The fact is today the legalized \ngaming industry is as legitimate a business as any of the Fortune 500. \nMore than 50 publicly-traded companies, all regulated by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, own gaming interests. The stocks of these \ncompanies are owned by millions of Americans around the country.\n  The gaming-entertainment industry directly and indirectly employs \nover one million people throughout the United States, paying $6 billion \nin salaries in 1994 alone. The casino gaming-entertainment industry \npaid more than $1.4 billion in taxes to State and local governments in \n1994 with an estimated $6 to $7 billion more paid by other forms of \ngaming-entertainment, such as State lotteries, horse and dog racing.\n  Nevada is proud to be the gaming-entertainment capital of the world. \nNevada's gaming industry provides 43 percent of the $1.2 billion \nannually going into the State's general fund. About $215 million from \ngaming revenues is dedicated to the State's university system and \nanother $400 million goes to kindergarten through grade 12 education \nprograms.\n  None of this is to suggest that the gaming-entertainment industry, \nlike any other major business, particularly one which hosts millions of \nvisitors each year, does not have its share of public issues and \nchallenges to address. The industry, to its credit, is making a serious \neffort to address concerns about problem gaming. For example, the \nindustry recently made a multi-million dollar commitment to a new \nnational center for responsible gaming which last week chose the \nHarvard Medical School's division of addiction for a $140,000 grant to \nstudy problem gaming.\n  This all leads me back to the question of why we need to spend \ntaxpayers dollars to study gaming.\n  Again, this bill is better than the House version which contains an \nopenended, unrestricted authority for the commission to issue \nsubpoenas. In the House version, there are almost no protections on \nwhat could be subpoenaed and what they could do with this information.\n  I do not believe gaming is appropriate for all locations. Each \ncommunity should weigh the merits and decide if they want gaming, and \nif they do, what types of gaming and under what conditions do they want \nit.\n  I am concerned that in certain jurisdictions gaming is not being \nadequately regulated. Nevada's gaming industry is closely monitored \nwith the State regulatory body employing 375 individuals. Unless the \nregulation is improved in certain jurisdictions, including Indian \ncasinos, we may see problems down the line. We should make it a \npriority to improve this regulation.\n  I regret some groups have seized this issue to make a full court \npress against all gaming. Gaming-entertainment is a legitimate, highly-\nregulated industry that is being unfairly maligned. It has made \nsignificant contributions to the Nation's economy and I am proud of the \nbenefits it has brought Nevada.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in recent months, the gaming industry \nhas come under considerable attack here in Washington. And as a senator \nwho represents thousands of ordinary people who are employed by the \nindustry, I want to come to their defense.\n  Mr. President, if you believed some of the rhetoric around here, you \nwould think that gaming is the root of all evil. Yet millions of \nAmericans gamble, whether in the form of State lotteries, office pools, \nrace track betting, church bingo, or casino gaming. For these citizens, \ngaming is fun, it is exciting, and, if pursued in moderation, it need \nnot do any harm.\n  Gaming is also an important part of our economy, and provides jobs \nand opportunities for thousands of our citizens. Nationwide, casinos \nprovide jobs\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nfor over 365,000 Americans. In Atlantic County, NJ, casinos directly \nsupply one out of three jobs. Last year, 33 million people visited \nAtlantic City, more than any other city in America.\n  Mr. President, in 1976, the voters of New Jersey decided that they \nwanted Atlantic City to have casinos. That was a democratic decision \nthat reflected the views of our electorate. Nobody forced New Jerseyans \nto vote that way. They evaluated the benefits of gaming, and they made \ntheir choice.\n  As a result of that decision, revenues generated by the gaming \nindustry in New Jersey have provided literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars for various projects throughout the State. They have financed \nthe New Jersey Vietnam Veterans Memorial. They have built hundreds of \nhomes. They have renovated day care centers, a bus terminal, and a \ntrauma center.\n  They also have helped improve the lives of countless numbers of \npeople living in the area. In Atlantic City, the number of families on \nAid to Families with Dependent Children has dropped by about 30 percent \nsince the first casino opened.\n  The more than $1 billion from casino property taxes paid since 1978 \nhave lowered the burden on other property owners and supported schools \nin Atlantic County. Taxes on casino revenues have supported \npharmaceutical assistance to the elderly, nursing and boarding home \ncare and assistance with utility bills for senior citizens and the \ndisabled.\n  Mr. President, in the past, some casinos have been tied to organized \ncrime and other problems. But it is unfair to assume, as some do, that \nthese problems are inevitable. Atlantic City's casinos are the most \nregulated in the country, perhaps the world. And the history of the \nlast two decades is that, by and large, this regulation works.\n  Mr. President, I met recently with the heads of the New Jersey \ncasinos. And I can tell you that the industry is not concerned about a \nstudy, if it is conducted in a fair and impartial manner.\n  But, Mr. President, I have real concerns about the likelihood that \nthe commission to be established by this legislation will not be \nimpartial. The whole impetus for this legislation seems to be coming \nfrom the Christian Coalition and others who are on a moral crusade \nagainst the industry. Maybe some of my colleagues believe that Ralph \nReed and others only want an objective evaluation of this industry. But \nI doubt it. Instead, Mr. President, this study seems designed to lay \nthe groundwork for a massive attack on the gaming industry. An attack \nthat serves the political goals of a radical fringe.\n  I want to acknowledge that, as with many other products and services, \nsome people who gamble do so to excess. And that can be a very serious \nproblem. Compulsive gamblers can destroy themselves and their families \nwith just a few rolls of the dice, and they need help. We should not \nignore their plight. In the case of other addictions, we've encouraged \npublic education efforts which have proven to be the most effective \ndeterrent to excesses. I would encourage States and localities to \nconsider such efforts, if appropriate. However, for the overwhelming \nmajority of people, gaming is a complement to a vacation or the \nequivalent of going to a movie on Saturday night. It is recreation. \nAnd, in the case of Atlantic City, the tourism industry is making great \nefforts to diversify and provide attractive convention facilities and \nopportunities for family vacations. I would hate to see these efforts, \nand the contribution they make to our State's economy and communities, \nhurt by a political witch hunt.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the commission's study will prove to \nbe objective, balanced, and fair. And I hope its conclusions are \nreasonable and rational. However, if this study simply leads to \npunitive legislation, which will hurt the hundreds of thousands of men \nand women who work in our casinos and related jobs, I will fight it \nevery step of the way.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 704, \nlegislation to establish a national gambling impact study commission.\n  In the past few years, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation of \nthe gaming industry across the Nation--initially under Indian tribal \nownership and more recently by State governments. In my home State of \nKansas, the casino and slot machine issue has been hotly debated. Race \ntracks and river boat gambling have been established in the Kansas City \narea, and both the Kickapoo and Potawatomie Nations have plans to \nexpand certain gaming facilities on tribal lands.\n  I realize that gaming can provide tremendous revenues for State and \nlocal economies, particularly for Indian tribes wishing to improve \nreservation conditions and provide employment opportunities. In this \nregard, gaming has produced positive results. However, growing evidence \nindicates gambling has some harmful side effects. A particular concern \nfocuses on reports that gaming causes the breakup of families, \nsuicides, increased teenage gambling, corruption, and the closing of \nmain street stores.\n  Mr. President, I think an impact study would help Americans better \nunderstand the unintended social and economic effects the gaming \nindustry is having on our families and communities. I also believe we \nhave a responsibility to bring together all the relevant data so that \nGovernors, State legislators, and citizens can make more informed \ndecisions about gambling in their home States.\n  Concerns have been raised in the Senate regarding the commission's \noriginal subpoena authority. As my colleagues have already stated, \nhowever, those concerns were addressed by the Senate Committee on \nGovernment Affairs when it adopted the Stevens substitute amendment on \nMay 14. In my view, the final measure represents a balanced approach--\none that addresses individual privacy rights and business trade \nconcerns but also provides the commission the authority and resources \nnecessary to thoroughly examine this issue.\n  This legislation has drawn broad, bipartisan support in Congress. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 704.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there is a shadow creeping across the \nAmerican landscape. It thrives in some of the poorest of our urban and \nrural communities. It threatens our towns and cities with economic \ncannibalism. It undermines our political process with a flood of cash \ninto the campaign coffers of our politicians. It preys upon the \nweakness of the poor, the elderly, and the young with the promise of \neasy money. It undermines the family with pathological addition and \nspousal and child abuse, and neglect.\n  Mr. President, what is this menace? We know it all too well. It is \ngambling. An industry that, just a few years ago, was frequently \npursued by law enforcement agencies from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation down to rural county sheriffs is today touted as the \neconomic savior of communities across America. And it is increasingly \nembraced and promoted by State and local government across the country \nas the answer to chronic government funding problems.\n  Mr. President, the gambling industry is booming. In 1988, only two \nStates--Nevada and New Jersey--permitted casino gambling. By 1994, 23 \nStates had legalized gambling. During this time, casino gambling \nrevenue nearly doubled. In 1993, $400 billion was spent on all forms of \nlegal gambling in American. Between 1992 and 1994, the gambling \nindustry enjoyed an incredible 15 percent annual growth in revenues.\n  Many of my colleagues would look at this performance and say ``good \nfor them.'' Many would cite the gambling industry as an American \nsuccess story. I am not so enthusiastic. There are many unanswered \nquestions regarding the hidden costs of rolling out the welcome mat for \nthe gambling industry. Many of the promises made by the gambling \nindustry--of jobs, economic growth and increased tax revenues--are \ndubious at best. The statistics on the devastating impact on our \nfamilies are beginning to roll in. Concern about teenage gambling \naddition is growing as more and more teens are lured by the promise of \neasy money. Crime and suicide numbers are sky-rocking in communities \nwhere gambling has taken root.\n  Mr. President, it is time to take a good, hard, objective look at the \ngambling industry and the gambling commission proposed in this bill is \nan important step toward getting the facts.\n  Critics of a gambling study commission claim that this is purely a \nState\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nissue, that there is no Federal role. This claim will not bear \nscrutiny. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution clearly provides \nCongress authority over issues of interstate commerce. Mr. President, \nsurely a one half trillion dollar-a-year industry, in which parent \ncorporations own and operate facilities in multiple States, can be \nconsidered interstate commerce. Further, gambling interests are \ninvolved in political campaigns in virtually every State, and crime \nassociated with gambling does often cross State lines. Finally, given \nthe potentially devastating impact of pathological gambling on the \nAmerican family, it is critical that this Federal commission be \nestablished to gather the facts on the explosion of legalized gambling.\n  Opponents of this commission have raised many charges against it. \nThey have claimed that the commission is a tool of the religious right. \nthey have claimed that the commission will become a witch hunt against \nthe gambling industry.\n  Mr. President, these claims are unfounded. The appointment of \ncommissioners will be equally divided between the executive branch and \nthe two Houses of Congress, ensuring that no faction may dominate the \nwork of the commission. Further, Mr. President, the scope of the \ncommission is clearly established within this legislation, which will \nprevent commission members from embarking on unrestricted \ninvestigations of the industry. Finally, this legislation enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, across both ideological and political lines, in \nboth the House and Senate. President Clinton has indicated his support \nfor this commission. The national media and newspapers across the \ncountry have been unanimous in advocating this gambling study \ncommission.\n  Mr. President, in recent years the gambling industry has preyed \nincreasingly on struggling rural communities. These communities have \nbeen targeted with millions of dollars in promotional money and \nlobbying. They are lured by the promise of booming economic \ndevelopment, new jobs and expanded tax revenues.\n  There can be little doubt that this promise has held true in the \nshort-run for some communities. What many communities are beginning to \ndiscover, however, is that in the medium and long term, gambling takes \na lot more from our communities than it gives. These costs are measured \nin broken families and broken lives.\n\n  Our communities are being sold on the vision of becoming another Las \nVegas. They are being promised tourist dollars and booming economic \ngrowth. The reality is different. The preponderant majority of gamblers \non riverboats and in this new breed of casino are from the local \ncommunity. Essentially, the gambling industry is cannibalizing the \nlocal economy.\n  A 1994 study of riverboat gambling in Joliet, IL found that 74 \npercent of all players came from within 50 miles of Joliet. A similar \nstudy of gambling in Aurora found that 70 percent of all players came \nfrom the immediate Aurora area, with only 3 percent coming from outside \nthe state of Illinois. Henry Gluck, the CEO of Caesar's World casino \nfirm told a 1994 New York State Senate hearing on gambling that the \npotential for casinos to attract outside dollars, and I quote, ``truly \napplies to a few major cities in the United States.'' I doubt that this \nis the message that the people of Harrison County, IN are getting from \nthe gambling industry.\n  It is becoming increasingly clear that these casinos provide little \nadditional value to local economies and tend to shift money out of \nlocal businesses. Casinos are one-stop entertainment. They provide \nmeals, drinks and everything else. Players simply take entertainment \ndollars that would normally be spent at local restaurants, bowling \nalleys, baseball parks, and movie theaters and spend them at the \ncasinos. This is not economic growth. It is economic churning.\n  Crime is another critical issue that this Commission will examine. \nTraditionally, organized crime has been synonymous with the gambling \nindustry. There is every indication that its influence is still \npresent. However, just as important are the more local concerns of \ndramatic increases in theft and violence that has followed the growth \nof gambling in America. A study conducted by ``U.S. News and World \nReport'' found that crime rates in communities with gambling are nearly \ndouble that of the national average. Examining assault, burglary, and \nlarceny, the report found 1,092 incidents per 10,000 population in 1994 \nin communities where gambling is present. The national average for \nthese crimes is of 593 per 10,000 people. U.S. News concluded that ``* \n* * towns with casinos have experienced an upsurge of crime at the same \ntime it was dropping for the Nation as a whole. They recorded a 5.8 \npercent jump in crime rates in 1994, while crime around the country \nfell 2 percent.'' This same study found that in 31 locations that got \nnew casinos crime surged 7.7 percent in the first year following the \nintroduction of the casino.\n  Deadwood, SD legalized casino gambling in 1989. Five years later \nserious crimes had increased by 93 percent, forcing the community to \ndouble the size of its police force. In Central City, CO assaults and \nthefts increased by 400 percent in the first 2 years after gambling's \nintroduction.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is all too aware of the toll that crime \ntakes on our cities and towns. It is critical that we come to \nunderstand how gambling acts as a catalyst for criminal activities and \nprovide these facts to communities that face decisions about inviting \nthis industry into their local economies.\n  Another area of concern is that of pathological gambling. For decades \nnow our Nation has struggled with the demon of addiction. In the past, \nthis problem has taken the form of drugs and alcohol. However, the \nrapid expansion of gambling injected a new narcotic into the Nation's \nbloodstream. Problem and pathological gambling is on the rise. The \nNational Council on Problem Gambling places the number of Americans \nwith serious gambling problems at around 5 percent. Most studies \nconfirm this estimate. However, as gambling becomes more pervasive, \nthis number is increasing. What does this mean?\n\n  As with other addictive behaviors, gambling impacts the individual, \ntheir families, their job, virtually every aspect of their lives. \nMarital problems--separation and divorce, spousal and child abuse and \nneglect, substance abuse, and suicide are all side-effects of problem \ngambling. Durand Jacobs, an individual who has done outstanding \nresearch on the impact of gambling, conducted a study of 850 Southern \nCalifornia high school students. He discovered that ``children with \ngambler parents experienced almost twice the incidence of broken homes \ncaused by separation, divorce, or death of a parent by the time they \nwere 15 years old.'' Another study, published in the Journal of \nCommunity Psychology, found that about 10 percent of the children of \ncompulsive gamblers had been the victim of physical abuse of the \ngambler parent. Fully one-quarter of the children in the study suffered \n``significant behavorial or adjustment problems.''\n  Ronald Reno, in his study on the ``Dangerous Repercussions of \nAmerica's Gambling Addiction,'' cites a gamblers anonymous study that \nfound that 78 percent of spouses of gamblers threatened separation or \ndivorce with nearly half carrying through on their threat.\n  Harrison County, MS, an area of intense gambling activity, \nexperienced a 149-percent increase in the divorce rate the year \nfollowing the introduction of riverboat gambling. A study in Deadwood, \nSD, found that reports of domestic abuse have risen more than 50 \npercent since the advent of legalized gambling. Central City, CO, \nexperienced a six-fold rise in child protection cases in the first year \nfollowing casino gambling's introduction.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most disturbing fact about the spread of \ngambling is the danger it poses to children. As with other addictive \nbehaviors, our children are most vulnerable to gambling addiction.\n  The March 1996 edition of ``Policy Review'' tells the story of Joe \nKosloski. Joe, then 16, won a little money at a bowling tournament. \nTaking the money, he and some friends headed for the Atlantic City \ncasinos. Despite being only 16 at the time, these kids got in. Joe got \non a roll, and parlayed his winnings into a couple of thousand dollars. \nLike most gamblers though, Joe's luck did not last. His fever for \ngambling, unfortunately, did.\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\n  Once the cash ran out, Joe opened credit accounts in the names of \nfamily members and used cash advances and credit cards to gamble. When \nJoe's scam finally came crashing down on him, he had amassed a $20,000 \ndebt. At 20 years of age, with no previous criminal record, he is in \nPennsylvania Federal Prison for credit card fraud.\n  Mr. President, it had been my intention to offer an amendment to S. \n704. As currently written, the bill would provide the Commission the \npower to subpoena documents only. In my view, this substantially limits \nthe Commission's ability to do its work. The gambling industry is a \none-half trillion dollar a-year cash business. Many of the insidious \ntactics used by the gambling industry to bilk people out of their money \nmust be considered by the commission in order to understand fully the \nmodern business of gambling. These techniques range from themeing--the \ndevelopment of themes within the casino to attract and hold people \nthere for longer periods of time--to various techniques to entice \npeople to place more frequent or higher wagers. Here I quote from a \n``U.S. News and World Report'' article of March, 1994:\n\n       A decade ago, most casinos bothered to gather data only on \n     high rollers. Now they use slot-club cards to snare the meat-\n     and potatoes guy, too. After filling out a survey and \n     receiving an ATM-like card, slot junkies insert them into a \n     ``reader'' built into almost all slot machines. In a distant \n     computer room, casinos track the action 24 hours a day, down \n     to the last quarter.\n       Players who use the cards the longest get the most comps, \n     somewhat like a frequent-flier giveback. At the Trump Castle \n     in Atlantic City, an internal document shows that 64 percent \n     of all slot players now use the Castle card. The cardholders \n     lost $109 million to the slots last fiscal year, or about \n     $101 per player per trip. Slot players who never bothered \n     with the card, by contrast, lost $31 per trip on average.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my strong belief that this Commission should \nhave full subpoena power to encourage the cooperation of gambling \nindustry figures to appear before the Commission. In order to ensure \nthat this bill was brought to the floor and passed, in order to ensure \nthat there is no delay in getting to the facts, I agreed not to offer \nthis amendment. However, I am here to serve notice that, at the first \nindication that the gambling industry is dodging the Commission, I will \nbe back here to offer legislation to broaden the Commission subpoena \npower.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about State \nsponsored gambling. In most States this takes the form of lotteries. \nHowever, in many States, including Indiana, the lottery has opened the \ndoor to scratch tickets, horse racing, casinos, the works. At last \ncount, 48 States have become involved in some form of gambling. Mr. \nPresident, given the concerns I have laid out, there is something very \ndisturbing about States promoting gambling as a solution to economic \ndevelopment and shrinking tax bases. To quote the late Dr. Richard C. \nHalverson, our former chaplain, this State sponsored gambling is \nnothing short of a tax on the character of our people. It is \ndereliction of our public duty to use gambling to solve Government \nrevenue problems.\n  Annual lottery sales now approach $32 billion. Yet the virtue of \ngambling as a revenue source is dubious at best. Money Magazine \nestimates that States keep only about one-third of total revenues \ngenerated from lotteries. Further, many States rely on lottery revenue \nto fill revenue gaps rather than lower taxes. Many States claim to use \nthe lottery to fund education. However, the proportion of State \nspending on education has remained relatively unchanged.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, Mr. President, is that as States are being \nflooded with gambling cash, the tide of political scandal is rising. \nAcross the country, State legislators are grappling with how to stem \nthe tide of gambling interest dollars and the corruption that follows \nit. And Congress is no exception. Gambling dollars are also finding \ntheir way into our campaigns. Mr. President, I feel strongly that the \nCommission should examine this problem in detail.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I congratulate Senators Lugar and Simon \nfor getting this bill passed. It was no easy task. In addition, I \nreiterate my concern and my warning regarding the subpoena issue. If \nthe gambling industry throws its lawyers at the Commission the way they \nhave thrown their lobbyist at Congress, I have little doubt that we \nwill revisit this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a managers' \namendment at the desk be deemed considered and agreed to, the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, the Senate proceed to the House companion \nmeasure, Calendar No. 344, H.R. 497, and all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken and the text of S. 704 be inserted in lieu thereof, the \nbill be deemed read the third time, and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements or colloquies \nrelating to the measure appear at this point in the Record. Finally, I \nask that S. 704 be returned to the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I want the \nRecord to reflect when the voice vote is done, or whatever the \nprocedure is to get this matter passed, that I be recorded as voting \n``no'' and that I be allowed to insert in the Record a statement \nregarding this legislation dealing with the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like that to be a part of the \nrequest.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I make the same request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I add that to the unanimous-consent request. \nI ask to include the statement and position of both of the Senators \nfrom Nevada. Mr. President, without their cooperation, this would not \nbe possible. Like them, I have some reservations, but they have helped \nwork out the problems, and I think they should get the opportunity to \nbe recorded against this Commission, even though they have agreed to \nlet it go on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 497), as amended, was deemed read the third time, and \npassed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to recognize the diligent efforts of \nthe Senators who have been working on this Commission. Senator Lugar, \nfrom Indiana, has been very helpful. He is one of the two original \nsponsors. He has been ably assisted in our effort to clear out problems \nby Senator Coats from Indiana. Several Senators had some amendments \nthey were interested in on both sides of the aisle, and they have \nagreed to withhold those. There was also, of course, the very fine work \nof Senator Simon to help work through problems on the Democratic side \nof the aisle. Without their cooperation, efforts, and commitment to \nthis, it would not have happened. In fact, I would not have been \npushing for it personally.\n  So I commend them. I would be glad at this point to yield the floor \nso they can make statements.\n  One final person, if I might, Mr. President. I would like to also \ncommend the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee who had this \nhot potato in his lap and managed to work it out in a way so that we \ncan get it approved by unanimous consent. I thank him for that work.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has been \nvery patient with us this afternoon. He repeatedly sought the floor. We \nhave urged him to delay. I now ask that, in morning business, he be \nrecognized so that he may make his statement for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I shall \nnot--I would like to speak for 2 minutes on the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me ask this. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFaircloth be recognized for 12 minutes, Senator Simon for 2 minutes, \nand Senator Kennedy for 3 minutes as though in morning business so that \nwe can get that out of the way. Then we will go back to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized as if in morning business for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: I reserved the right \nto\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\nobject subject to my being acknowledged for 2 minutes to speak on this \nbill. I do not think that the request was granted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The request was granted, Mr. President. We had committed \nto Senator Faircloth first, if the Senator does not mind.\n  Mr. SIMON. I would like to speak for 2 minutes on the bill which was \njust passed, if I may. I think my colleague from North Carolina would \nyield to me.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield to the Senator from Illinois for the 2 \nminutes, if I may then go.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator kindly yield to me 1 \nminute following the Senator from Illinois? I am on the same bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I also yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, respectively we have already yielded to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts following the Senator from North \nCarolina. If our request is going to be honored, I hope we will adjust \nthis accordingly.\n  Does the Senator from Virginia seek to speak on the same bill as the \nSenator from Illinois?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct; the same bill on which I \nam a cosponsor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I suggest that the Senator from Illinois be \nrecognized for 2 minutes, the Senator from Virginia for 1 minute, the \nSenator from Massachusetts 3 minutes, and the Senator from North \nCarolina will have his 12 minutes.\n  I rephrase my unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank a number of my colleagues for their \nhelp on creating the commission that has just passed, assuming the \nHouse acts favorably.\n\n  Particularly, I would like to thank my colleague from Indiana, \nSenator Lugar. Senator Warner from Virginia has been very helpful. \nSenator John Glenn was helpful. Senator Stevens was helpful. And a \nnumber of others that I should acknowledge, as well as Michael \nStevenson of my staff. What we have just done is to say, let us look at \nthis problem. I think we owe that to the Nation, and I appreciate our \ncolleagues doing that.\n  The fastest growing industry in our Nation today is legalized \ngambling. Is this good for the Nation? Is it not? Should it be slowed \nsomewhat? No one suggests that we are going to close down Las Vegas or \nAtlantic City. But I think we ought to look at this problem and see \nwhat the dimensions of that problem are and what we ought to do. That \nis what the commission bill does.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to join in thanking the principal \nsponsors of the bill--the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from Alaska and also my distinguished \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Representative Frank Wolf. I \nhave been working as a team with Frank Wolf. It is essential for \nAmerica simply to listen and learn about the growth of gambling. Then \nwe can decide for ourselves. States and individuals can decide for \nthemselves. But this bill will start a vital educational process.\n  I am privileged to have been a part of the effort which has succeeded \ntoday. We did not get everything we wanted. But we have certainly made \na start, and, if necessary, there may be a sequel to this piece of \nlegislation in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I applaud passage of the Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission Act. It has been apparent for some time that a \nreasonable consensus had been reached on providing the Commission with \nreasonable powers and duties, and I congratulate the leadership for \nbringing this important bill to the floor.\n  I also congratulate Senator Stevens for maneuvering this legislation \nthrough a tricky legislative process. Senators Lugar and Simon have \ndone a remarkable job of keeping public attention on this issue. And \nRepresentative Wolf from my home State of Virginia has certainly been a \nleader in steering this legislation through the House of \nRepresentatives. I have enjoyed working with all of them to make sure \nthat the facts about gambling are laid before the people so that they \nand their representatives can make fully-informed decisions about \ngambling in their States and communities.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the benefits of gambling are often \neasy to see--tax revenues for the States, jobs created in casinos, \nattention paid to cities or States with exciting games and lotteries. \nThese benefits are very evident in a number of our communities around \nour country.\n  The problem is that the downsides of gambling are harder to see. If a \nteenager gets addicted to gambling, or a father loses his family \nsavings, the effects on their families, their employers, and their \nfriends, are difficult to quantify. And just as there is no doubt that \nthe benefits of gambling are real, these hidden costs are very real \nindeed.\n  This Commission will be an unbiased factfinding body to analyze the \neffects of gambling. The Commission will have a number of important \ntopics to consider, including: gambling addictions, reliance by States \non gambling revenues, advertising, the effect of increased gambling \noperations on Native American communities and reservations, \nrelationships between gambling and crime and alcoholism, and effects of \ngambling on other types of businesses and entertainment. The Commission \nwill have a full plate of issues to consider and I am confident this \nbill will provide it the resources and time for thorough investigations \nand recommendations.\n  The gambling industry has spoken out against the investigatory tools \nthis bill gives the Commission and I can understand their concern that \nthe Commission be even-handed. I believe the compromise reached \nconcerning the scope of the Commission's use of subpoenas and hearings \nresponds to those concerns. For the Commission's conclusions to be \nreliable, it must have good information from the industry--without this \ncooperation, the Commission would be no more useful than the incomplete \nand biased studies States and localities have had to rely upon in the \npast.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia has considered a number of types of \ngambling over the past several years. It has adopted some, such as a \nState lottery, while rejecting others like riverboat casinos. The new \nCommission will be able to provide the Virginia legislature, executive \nbranch, and citizens with more accurate facts as they continue to \ndebate the future of gambling in the Commonwealth.\n  I do not favor federalizing regulation of the gambling industry--this \nbill does not require or foresee any Federal response to the findings \nmade by the Commission. It is a fact-finding act. Seeing the growing \nimportance of gambling in our society, however, I have concluded that \ndiscovery of these facts for consideration by the States may be more \nimportant than any new Federal legislation.\n  Again, I congratulate the leadership and sponsors, and I hope that \nthis legislation can be enacted in the very near future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \naccording to the agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank Senator \nFaircloth.\n  Mr. President, speaking today at a private high school in \nMinneapolis, candidate Bob Dole--formerly Senator Bob Dole, who should \nknow better--offered the American people what he called an ``Education \nConsumer's Warranty.'' But candidate Dole was not being candid about \nthe facts.\n  He did not hesitate to bash teachers and students. But many of his \ncriticisms were based on blatant misinformation, and he offered no \nsolutions to the problems he mis-identified.\n  Candidate Dole said that test scores and literacy are dropping. In \nreality, math and science scores on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress are up since 1982--for 9- 13- and 17-year olds. In \naddition, American students finished second among 31 nations in a 1992 \nstudy of reading skills.\n  Candidate Dole said that students are taking fewer courses in basic \nsubjects. The opposite is true. In the early 1980s, only 13 percent of \nhigh school graduates had 4 years of English and at\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nleast 3 years of math, science, and social studies. By 1990, according \nto the National Center for Education Statistics, 40 percent of high \nschool graduates had taken at least those basic courses.\n  Candidate Dole said that SAT scores are dropping. He was right 10 \nyears ago, but he is very wrong now. In 1983, SAT scores had been \ndropping for a decade. In the 1990s, they are rising. The national \naverage score for the class of 1995 was 910, the highest since 1974.\n  Candidate Dole also said that dropout rates are rising. In fact, more \nstudents are finishing high school and going on to college than ever \nbefore. The high school dropout rate has been cut by a third--from 17 \npercent in 1967 to 11 percent in 1993. Almost 90 percent of students \nare graduating from high school. Between 1980 and 1993, the proportion \nof high school graduates going to college increased--from 49 percent to \n62 percent.\n  Despite these improvements, much more needs to be done, and I commend \ncandidate Dole's new-found support for education. As Senate majority \nleader, he helped lead the Republican attempt to slash funds for \neducation. He even wanted to slash support for safe and drug free \nschools by more than half. But now he agrees that every student has the \nright to be safe in school.\n  Candidate Dole voted to cut support for reading and math by $1 \nbillion last year. Now he rightly agrees that all students need a solid \ngrounding in basic subjects.\n  Candidate Dole voted against the Improving America's Schools Act in \n1994, which encourages greater parent involvement in the full range of \neducational decisions for their children. Now he rightly says parental \nparticipation is a key component of successful education.\n  Obviously, when it comes to education, candidate Dole has a difficult \ntime escaping his anti-education record.\n  By contrast, President Clinton is the ``Education President.'' He has \nworked tirelessly and effectively to improve education since he was \nelected in 1992. He led the opposition to the Republicans' attack on \neducation last year, and he has proposed a budget that invests \nsignificantly more in education in the years ahead, and while still \nachieving a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n  If Americans want an Education President, they already have one. Any \n``Education Consumer'' would be well-advised to go with the proven \nproduct, not a candidate who is suddenly discovering the error of his \npast ways.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the clerk lay before the Senate \namendment No. 4493, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4493, as modified.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 22, before the period, insert: ``: Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading, \n     $1,000,000 is available, by grant or other transfer, to the \n     Harnett County School Board, Lillington, North Carolina, for \n     use by the school board for the education of dependents of \n     members of the Armed Forces and employees of the Department \n     of defense located at Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base, \n     North Carolina''.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment will help restore equitable \ntreatment for Fort Bragg-based military personnel and dependents who \nlive in and attend school in nearby Harnett County, NC. To achieve \nthis, my amendment authorizes $1,000,000 from fiscal year 1997 Army O \nfunds to be applied to the costs of Harnett County schools' providing \nquality education to dependent children of Fort Bragg personnel.\n  This amendment will remedy the gross disparity that now exists in the \ndistribution of impact aid dollars intended to help defray the costs of \nthe schooling of military-connected dependents. Over the years, and \ndespite a substantial increase in Fort Bragg-connected student \npopulations, the Federal Government has provided a declining amount of \nimpact aid dollars to Harnett County. Under current law, Harnett County \nno longer qualifies for any impact aid funding.\n  Mr. President, much of the growth in Harnett County's public school \nsystem is directly attributable to the influx of military personnel. \nAccording to one housing developer in Harnett County, 98 percent of the \nfamilies buying in one of his communities are military families.\n  During the past few years, thousands of students have been added to \nthe rolls of Harnett County's school system. Many of them are children \nof Army personnel and DOD civilians employed at Fort Bragg. This growth \nhas caused severe school overcrowding in Harnett County. Many children \nattend classes in temporary facilities, such as cafeterias, gymnasiums, \nauditorium stages, libraries and trailers. In some schools, students \nmust wait in line up to an hour to use the bathroom.\n  Mr. President, projections indicate that Harnett taxpayers will have \nto spend $87,000,000 for new schools within the next decade merely to \nkeep up with this growth. The county simply does not have the resources \nto build another school without substantial assistance.\n  The Federal Government has an obvious obligation to provide for the \neducation of military dependents. Because of the nature of military \nservice which requires frequent moves and reassignments, military \nfamilies seldom have an opportunity to establish strong roots in a \ncommunity and to become active in local schools. The Federal Government \nhas a duty to ensure that these parents need not worry about the \nquality of education afforded their children.\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\n  To further exacerbate the education funding crisis, Fort Bragg is now \nseeking to purchase an 11,000-acre property--known as the ``Overhills \nproperty''--which will nearly double the amount of land the Federal \nGovernment presently owns in Harnett County--7,000 acres of the \nOverhills property are in Harnett County. This purchase by Fort Bragg \nwill cause Harnett County to permanently lose an additional $24,000 \nin annual tax revenues.\n\n  Some may ask why Harnett County should be singled out to benefit from \nthis amendment. It is because it's the right thing to do. Harnett is \nthe only county in the Fort Bragg Impact Area that suffers an economic \nloss due to its location near Fort Bragg. According to 1990 figures, \nHarnett County has been losing $122,000 per year because of Fort Bragg.\n  Since then, impact aid funding has been eliminated, the number of \nmilitary dependents has soared, and the Army has proposed to erode \nfurther the tax base. Without help, the situation will worsen further.\n  Let there be no doubt, I fully support the acquisition of the \nOverhills property by the Army--provided that Harnett County's school \nsystem is given the assistance it needs and deserves.\n  Mr. President, North Carolinians are proud of the several great \nmilitary installations within our borders. For more than 50 years, \nNorth Carolinians have been especially proud of Fort Bragg, home of the \nUnited States Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne \nDivision. These units and other units stationed at Fort Bragg are on \nthe front line of our Nation's defense; standing ready to deploy \nanywhere, any time, to preserve freedom in the world.\n  Mr. President, I spent four non-heroic years in the Navy during World \nWar II. I have great affection and respect for the soldiers and defense \nsupport personnel who are devoting their lives to the defense of our \ncountry. I will do anything in my power to ensure that they are \nprovided everything they need to do their jobs.\n  This includes not merely providing an adequate training area, \nequipment and hardware; they also deserve the quality of life and peace \nof mind to enable each soldier to focus on his mission, accomplish it, \nand return home safely.\n  Unmistakably essential to that quality of life is the proper \neducation of their children.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to support this amendment which takes \na small step towards addressing the educational needs of the children \nof our Nation's finest soldiers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that ``Education Equity Fact Sheet'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Education Equity Fact Sheet\n\n       The Helms amendment would authorize $1 million over two \n     years to ensure that Fort Bragg-connected dependents who \n     attend school in Harnett County, N.C. are treated the same as \n     Fort Bragg-connected dependents who attend school in \n     Cumberland County, N.C.\n\n\n                           critical situation\n\n       Currently, Harnett is the only county in the Fort Bragg \n     Impact Area that suffers an economic loss due to its location \n     near Fort Bragg. (Fort Bragg-Pope AFB Impact Assessment, \n     Sept. 1990).\n       Military dependents are attending classes in makeshift \n     classrooms including cafeterias, gymnasiums, auditorium \n     stages, libraries, and trailers. It is projected that \n     $87,000,000 is needed to provide for new school facilities \n     over the next 10 years. (Harnett County News, Apr. 10, 1996).\n       According to 1990 figures, Harnett loses $122,000/year and \n     that deficit has substantially worsened as the number of \n     post-related personnel and dependents moving into the county \n     has increased dramatically. (Id.)\n       It costs the same amount to educate a child in Harnett \n     County as it does to educate a child in Cumberland County.\n       No child of a military service member should be treated as \n     a second-class citizen.\n       The federal government's responsibility to provide for the \n     education of military dependents should not depend upon where \n     their parents live.\n\n\n                   unjustifiable impact aid disparity\n\n       FY96 Cumberland--$2,586,932.00/14,143 Students=$183 per \n     student.\n       FY96 Harnett--$47,176.00/1,025 Students=$46 per student.\n       However, under current law, Harnett County no longer \n     qualifies for any impact aid funding, even though their base-\n     connected student population is soaring.\n       Fort Bragg wants to buy a Rockefeller Estate known as the \n     ``Overhills Property'', lying primarily in Harnett County--\n     the purchase will almost double the amount of land the \n     federal government owns in Harnett County, causing an \n     additional annual tax loss of $24,000.\n       Each new resident pays an average of only $231 per person \n     in taxes to Harnett County while it costs the county $500 to \n     educate each child.\n       Military families flock to Harnett.--Fayetteville Observer-\n     Times--Sun., Dec. 3, 1995.\n       ``Ninety-eight percent of the families buying [in Heritage \n     Village] are in the military.''--Bill Arnold, Partner in the \n     Kilnarnold Corp.\n       Out of room.--Harnett County News--Wed., April 10, 1996.\n       ``We've reached the critical stage for Harnett County.

We \ndo not know how many other Members wish to speak on the Senator's \namendment, so we will defer that. Has the Senator submitted his \namendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It is called up.\n  If you will remember, my amendment, just read, would not fund the 12 \nadditional Marine Corps generals that the Marine Corps wants, and the \nmoney is in this bill to do that. My argument, obviously, was as the \nnumber of marines has gone down from 199,000 to about 172,000 to \n173,000, it seems to me that as we are downsizing, we should not be \ntopsizing the administrative overhead from the standpoint of adding 12 \nmore generals.\n  We have seen a reduction in the number of generals and admirals--\nmaybe not enough--but we have seen a reduction in the other three \nforces. They still are not as efficient from the standpoint of the \nnumber of generals and admirals as the Marine Corps is.\n  Regardless of that, it seems to me inconsistent with balancing the \nbudget, when the Secretary of Defense is pointing out to us the need \nfor every dollar that we can get going into modernization, that we do \nnot spend more money on administrative overhead. If 70 generals were in \ncharge at the time there were 199,000, it seems to me we do not need 80 \ngenerals when we have 172,000 marines.\n  One argument that has been made by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the authorization committee, is that this issue should be \ndecided in conference between the House and the Senate on the \nauthorization bill and should not be a point to discuss when we have \nthe Senate defense appropriations bill up.\n  I disagree with that, and I disagree with that because this is a \nlegitimate appropriations matter. The Marine Corps requested 12 \nadditional generals, and these generals do cost extra money. In fact, \nit involves a lot more money. That extra money is in the bill that is \nbefore the Senate right now. Regardless of what the Senate Armed \nServices Committee said, if the money is not in this bill, then the new \ngenerals do not get paid. Period. You cannot pay people if there is no \nmoney appropriated for it. You cannot pay these new generals based on \nthe authorization bill. DOD cannot write one check based on an \nauthorization.\n  The money is in the military personnel account. You can turn \nyourself, if you want to see it, to pages 6 and 7 of the committee \nreport, and there you find a listing of the branches of the military, \nthe number of people who are being funded by this legislation. You are \nnot going to receive a paycheck if there is not money appropriated, \nbecause you cannot spend money in our Government without the \nconsequence of an appropriations bill.\n  So these generals are expecting to be paid. They will only be paid if \nthe money is in this bill, and my amendment would take that money out. \nIt would leave the money to the Defense Department, hopefully to do \nwhat the Secretary of Defense said should be done, and that would be to \nmodernize our military capability.\n  The last point--at least I think it will be the last point I will \nhave to make because we have not had the debate on this amendment that \nI hoped we were going to have, particularly from people on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. Most of their arguments have been procedure, \nthat this is in their bailiwick, it should not be decided now. They \nhave not been willing to state their case. Maybe somebody will come \nover here and do it, and I hope they will.\n  But the last point I want to make is that if there is a real need for \nadditional personnel to be funded in the Marines, it is for more \nsergeants and more lieutenants, because those are the people who lead \nMarine platoons in battle. That is the place where there is a \ntremendous shortfall in the number of qualified people who are needed, \nand I will refer to a study in just a minute.\n\n  Earlier in this debate, I talked about the driving force behind the \nrequest for 12 more Marine Corps generals. I said even though the \nMarine Corps said that war fighting was the reason they needed more \ngenerals and even though the Senate Armed Services Committee said war \nfighting was not the reason for needing more generals, in either case, \nthis cannot be justified because these positions are not going to war \nfighting, and it is not because of Goldwater-Nichols.\n  With all due respect, I think people who make these arguments are \nusing smokescreens. If war fighting were the top priority, the Marine \nCorps would be adding more platoon sergeants, not more generals to fill \nthe highest levels\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nin headquarters positions. I said the Marine Corps has a critical \nshortage of sergeants and lieutenants. I said that in one of my earlier \nstatements today. These are the people, lower in the ranks, who train \nthe force and keep it ready to go. If war breaks out, they would lead \nour platoons into battle.\n  Everyone knows that the heart and soul of the Marine Corps fighting \nforce is its 27 infantry battalions. That is what the Marine Corps is \nall about. Everything the Marine Corps does is focused on moving, \nprotecting and supporting those units. If those 27 battalions are not \nhealthy, then the Marine Corps is not strong.\n  Well, a doctor has been examining the battalion's vital signs, and \nthey are not up to snuff. I repeat what I said a moment ago, there is a \ncritical shortage of platoon sergeants. That statement is based on an \nimportant piece of information. It is based on the Marine Corps \nbriefing paper that I have in my hand, ``Making the Corps Fit to \nFight.'' It is called a unit cohesion task force interim report.\n  This review was conducted by the unit cohesion task force in April of \nthis year, just 3 months ago. It was under the leadership of Marine \nCol. G. S. Newbold.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a portion of this briefings in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Making the Corps Fit To Fight--Unit Cohesion Task Force Interim Report\n\n\n              unit cohesion task force--col. g.s. newbold\n\n     MM\n       Sgt.

I want to quote selectively from this paper.\n  The first slide has this title, ``The Legend,'' with bullets, ``First \nto Fight,'' ``Most Ready When the Nation Is Least Ready,'' ``The \nNation's 9-1-1 Force.''\n  Who is going to argue with that about the Marines? They have that \nreputation. They live up to that reputation, and we ought to support \nthat reputation.\n  Colonel Newbold is talking about the Marine Corps' mission. Then, of \ncourse, he gets down to the guts of his briefing, what he calls ``The \nReality.'' Of course, this is what we ought to be concerned about. In \nfact, we ought to be disturbed about this.\n  The very first bullet is a blockbuster. I want to quote: ``Infantry \nBattalions Are Staffed at 57 Percent of ASR for O311 Sergeants.'' Of \ncourse, a O311 sergeant is an infantry noncom. He is a platoon \nsergeant. Every platoon must have a sergeant, and a platoon is in deep \ntrouble without a good one.\n  So what does the Marine Corps do with 43 percent of its platoon \nsergeants missing, at the very same time when the command of the Marine \nCorps is asking for 12 additional generals?\n  Another slide is entitled ``Reality From Commanders.'' This provides \nan answer. The commander's answer:\n\n       I have lance corporals as platoon sergeants and [I have] \n     sergeants as platoon commanders.\n\n  At a time when the Marines are asking for 12 additional generals, and \nthey are using lance corporals as platoon sergeants and sergeants as \nplatoon commanders. The commander, of course, has to make good with \nwhat he has, but that is not good enough.\n  Corporals are normally squad leaders, and lieutenants are platoon \ncommanders. If corporals have to do the job of a sergeant, and \nsergeants are called upon to do the lieutenant's job, then why cannot \ncolonels do a general's job?\n  I referred to that in the sense that every one of these so-called \nvacancies that is called for, the need for these new generals, all but \none is filled with colonels who are getting the job done. If the \ncolonels would take up some of the slack--and it is being done already, \nand the job is being done well--what is the need for 12 additional \ngenerals, when we need sergeants and lieutenants, when we had 70 \ngenerals here when it was 199,000, and we are down to 172,000 now, and \nwe have 68 generals? Why do we need 80?\n  The briefing paper does indicate that the quality of the noncoms and \nthe sergeants on hand is excellent. Unfortunately, the good ones are \nbeing shipped off to nonoperational, noncombat assignments.\n  This is what the briefing paper says: ``We do have quality NCO' and \nSNCO', but the best go off to other key billets,'' like drill \ninstructors and recruiting duty.\n  This is Colonel Newbold in his task force report,``Making the Corps \nFit to Fight.''\n  Mr. President, recruiting duty, that is where some of the new \ngenerals would go. We have been told that by this report. If recruiting \nduty is not a good place to send your best NCO's, then why is it a good \nplace to put generals?\n  The briefing paper concludes with this piece of philosophy. I quote \nfrom the briefing paper.\n\n       In order to fulfill its role as the Nation's crisis \n     response force, the Marine Corps will re-establish the \n     primacy of the operating forces by creating manpower and \n     training policies and programs that support cohesion and \n     stability.\n\n  Those are very profound words by people in charge who are going to \nget the job done even though they do not seem to get the support of \npeople higher up. Because I do not think they are getting the support \nwhen they need sergeants and lieutenants and we are putting the money \ninto generals.\n  We are downsizing the Marine Corps and topsizing the administrative \npart of it. If the operating forces are the top priority, why are only \n25 percent of the Marine Corps general officers command combat \nofficers? Well, the paper draws a conclusion to that.\n  I want to quote from the paper again.\n\n       Our system is geared to the success of individual careers \n     versus the success of individual units.\n\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, this is what my amendment is all about, promotions at \nthe top versus the needs of the infantry battalions, sergeants versus \ngenerals. What does the Marine Corps need more, sergeants or generals? \nIf we want the Marine Corps to be the 911 force, always ready to go, \nthen we should make sure that the 27 infantry battalions are rock \nsolid. We better make sure they have the essentials to be effective. We \nbetter make sure that they have a full complement of sergeants and \nlieutenants.\n  It would be irresponsible to give the Marine Corps more generals when \nits heart and soul is short of the stuff that it needs to do battle. \nThe Marine Corps should not be topsizing while it downsizes. As the \nMarine Corps gets smaller, it seems to me it is legitimate to cut the \nbrass at the top, as the other services have already done. I had a \nchart here to demonstrate that.\n  Of course, most importantly, the point was made by our Secretary of \nDefense of how important modernization is. Those at the top of the heap \nshould have what they need to get the job done. By voting for my \namendment, you will send the right message to the Marine Corps.

Mr. President, earlier this afternoon the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, spoke on the floor indicating his \nconcern and expressing his criticism of remarks that Senator Dole made \ntoday in Minneapolis. I want to take just a few moments to respond to \nthose remarks. I thank the Senator for yielding the time for me to do \nthat.\n  What Senator Dole said today in Minneapolis was that this country \nneeds education reform, not education reform as defined by this \nadministration and by some in this Congress, but real education reform. \nEducation reform that ensures that parents have authority to be \ninvolved in their children's education, and in their curriculum, and in \nthe formation of educational programs for their children. Education \nreform that would break up the monopoly that dominates public \neducation. Education reform that gets money into the classroom instead \nof the bureaucracy. Education reform that rewards teachers, and rewards \nthe Governors who run effective programs, and rewards mayors and school \nboards. Education reforms that try new approaches, and education reform \nthat loosens Washington's grip on this country's schools.\n  For a decade or more now, the Congress and the public have been \ndebating how we can improve our public education system, and a number \nof proposals have been made. But there is an entrenched bureaucracy \nthat insists on making no real changes, on perpetuating the status quo. \nWhat Senator Dole was talking about was shaking up that status quo and \nbringing about reform that brings real results.\n  One of the issues that was discussed and was criticized earlier is \nthe question of choice for low-income students. This is an issue that I \nhave been involved with for some time. I have offered amendments, on a \nbipartisan basis with Senator Lieberman, allow test programs, or pilot \nprograms, for vouchers for low-income parents which would allow us to \ntest the concept of school choice.\n  It seems hypocritical for those of us who have the means to afford \nschool choice, whether by moving to another school district because we \nare unhappy with the public school where we currently are situated, or \nby enrolling our children in private schools or parochial schools, to \ndeny that freedom of choice to those families who do not have the \nresources to send their children to a private school.\n  The voucher demonstration program is an attempt to understand the \nimpact of enabling families choice over their children's educational \nopportunities. Many of these families have children who are consigned \nto some of the most violence-prone, educationally challenged schools in \nAmerica. Mothers and fathers know that the only way to successfully \ngive their children a chance to escape a lifetime of these difficult \nenvironments is to get a better education. Yet the Congress and this \nadministration have repeatedly blocked attempts at even the most minor \nof reforms to allow low-income children to escape their poor-\nperforming, violent schools.\n  The reform Senator Lieberman and I proposed was a 3-year \ndemonstration grant. We proposed trying it in 10-20 school districts \naround the country--costing a very modest amount of money--to see if it \nworks. Even that small of a reform effort is rejected, time after time. \nMy Project for American Renewal includes an expansion of that concept \nto provide experiments in up to 100 school districts. By trying a \ndemonstration program, we'll be able to see if what the opponents of \nschool choice say is right, but the only way to test their arguments is \nto get some objective evidence to evaluate school choice. I fear, Mr. \nPresident, that the opponents know that school choice would work: they \nknow it would pose a challenge to the existing system.\n  I suggest that that is exactly what the existing system needs--a \nchallenge, a challenge to improve its educational efforts. That \nchallenge will come through competition. Public schools and private \nschools and parochial schools can exist side by side. The competition \namong the three of them provides better education for all students \ninvolved. This has been demonstrated in my hometown of Fort Wayne, IN, \non a number of occasions. We ought to move in that direction.\n  To criticize Senator Dole for calling for education reform because he \nhas failed to support the status quo initiatives provided by this \nadministration that make no major change, efforts of the Clinton \nadministration and the status quo that is perpetuated by Members of \nthis body and call that educational reform--I think the American people \nknow better. Call this what it is, and that is an attempt by a \nPresidential candidate to bring about some change in our educational \nsystem that will benefit the children--not the bureaucracy, not the \nunions, not the administration--the children that are actually \nreceiving the education, or would like to receive the education. I \ncommend Senator Dole for his remarks, for his initiative in this area. \nI hope he has the opportunity to carry it out.\n  I regret we cannot seem to get beyond the status quo of what in many \ncases is a failed education system, particularly in areas where \nchildren live in poverty, the District of Columbia being the prime \nexample. We have struggled and struggled and struggled to try to give \nthe young people opportunities that others of us have and they do not \nhave. It is regrettable that we cannot discuss this on a rational basis \nand cannot support the efforts of someone trying to bring about this \nchange.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his patience and his time on \nthis. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S7987-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7987-S8007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4443, as Modified\n\n (Purpose: To strike $2,000,000 available for environmental activities \n   with respect to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, \n                               Louisiana)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send to the desk an amendment numbered 4443, as \nmodified, pertaining to the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort \nPolk, LA, and ask to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. McCAIN, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4443, as modified.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4443), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 3, before the period, add the following: \n     ``Provided, That the amount made\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\n     available by this paragraph for Army operation and \n     maintenance is reduced by $2,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would reduce Army operation \nand maintenance funding by $2 million to eliminate an add-on for \nReadiness Training Center at Fort Polk, LA.\n  During Senate consideration of the fiscal year 1997 Defense \nauthorization bill, an amendment was adopted which would authorize the \ntransfer of additional acreage from the Forest Service to the Army at \nFort Polk. This transfer would increase the training area at Fort Polk \nto ensure adequate acreage to conduct realistic land forces training. I \nhad no objection to this amendment and believe it will serve the needs \nof the Army and the other Services.\n  However, at the same time, it is unclear that an additional $2 \nmillion will be required in fiscal year 1997 to adequately protect the \nland and facilities in this additional area.\n  The report accompanying this bill describes the purposes for which \nthis funding would be used, including hiring more foresters, \nenvironmental engineers, and natural resources support personnel, as \nwell as maintaining the forest, roads, and public recreational areas, \nand protecting the red-cockaded woodpecker, long leaf pine, pitcher \nplant bogs, and archaeological resources. These are activities which \ncertainly should be undertaken for this new property, but they are also \nactivities which are underway on the current property utilized by the \nJRTC.\n  Mr. President, therefore, I suggest that, instead of setting aside $2 \nmillion for these purposes now, we instead encourage the Army to \nconduct the necessary land management and environmental maintenance \nactivities for these additional acres in the most cost-effective way \npossible. However, if the funds currently available to Fort Polk are \ninsufficient to ensure that the high standards of land and \nenvironmental management are maintained at the newly expanded Fort \nPolk, I believe the Congress would look favorably on a reprogramming \nrequest from the Army to make funding available. In addition, I expect \nthe Army to make funding available. In addition, I expect the Army to \ninclude in the fiscal year 1998 budget any additional costs associated \nwith expanding Fort Polk's Joint Readiness Training Center.\n  Mr. President, I understand that my colleagues from Louisiana may \noffer an amendment to retain $500,000 of these earmarked funds. While I \nwould prefer that the Army proceed with this effort and request \nreprogramming authority if additional funds are required, I would have \nno objection if the managers preferred to retain $500,000 of these \nfunds.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4448, as Modified, to Amendment No. 4443\n\n(Purpose: To restore $500,000 for environmental activities with respect \n    to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have two amendments. One is in the \nfirst degree and one is the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Johnston, \n     for himself and Mr. Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4448, as modified, to amendment No. 4443.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4448), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 7 strike out ``$2,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$1,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have identified $500,000 in one-time \ncosts that need to be funded immediately to ensure that the natural \nresources and archeological sites at Fort Polk are protected. The \nArmy's environmental record has clearly demonstrated how seriously they \ntake their stewardship of the land with which they are entrusted. I \nbelieve the money requested will be used in a cost effective manner and \nwill ensure that the resources are protected to the same high standards \ncurrently maintained by Fort Polk.\n  The red-cockaded woodpecker is an endangered species and is protected \nby Federal law. Woodpecker nesting trees are marked with a 1-meter \nthick white band. The nesting trees are protected by a 62-meter buffer \nzone that are marked by orange bands. Military training is restricted \nwithin this the buffer zone. Funding will allow for the red-cockaded \nwoodpecker sites to be identified, cleared, marked, and 62-meter buffer \nzone established.\n  There are Indian, archeological sites, cemeteries, and other \nhistorical sites located on this land and we must ensure that these \nsites are adequately protected. The balance of the funding will provide \nsufficient resources to survey the land, identify cultural and \narcheological sites, and mark them accordingly.\n  I also encourage the Department of the Army to identify any \nincremental costs associated with managing this land and I would \nsupport any reprogramming requests they find necessary to submit. I \nfurther expect that their fiscal year 1998 budget submission will \ninclude any of these recurring costs.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment is acceptable to Senator \nMcCain and the managers of this bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the second \ndegree amendment I am offering with Senator Johnston that would give \n$500,000 to the Department of the Army for environmental protection \nactivities at Fort Polk, LA. Earlier this month my distinguished \ncolleague and I were able to include a provision in the Department of \nDefense authorization bill that would transfer acreage in the Kisatchie \nNational Forest to the Army at Fort Polk. That amendment will allow \nFort Polk to expand its training exercises while continuing its unique \nmission of providing our troops the best training possible at the Joint \nReadiness Training Center [JRTC]. I am pleased we were able to work \nwith the managers of the authorization bill to have the transfer \nprovision included in the bill.\n  On this pending amendment, I would like to thank Senators McCain, \nStevens, and Inouye who have been very cooperative in working with \nSenator Johnston and me to appropriate $500,000 for environmental \nprotection at Fort Polk. This funding will ensure that the high \nstandards of land and environmental management are maintained at the \nnewly expanded JRTC. The Army can use this funding to continue \nsurveying and marking trees that are inhabited by the red-cockaded \nwoodpecker. In its current operations, the Army establishes a 62-meter \nbuffer zone around these trees to alert military personnel and the \npublic to stay clear of the area. The Army also posts signs to clearly \nmark archeological sites, such as cemeteries and Indian burial grounds, \nand other sensitive areas. This $500,000 will enable the Army to \ncontinue providing this and other important environmental programs at \nthe JRTC.\n  I appreciate the help Senator McCain and the managers of this bill \nhave given Senator Johnston and me on this amendment and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS. These are two amendments worked out with the Senators \nfrom Louisiana. They have combined their amendments. This is an \namendment that has been on the list all day. It has been modified.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Breaux amendment to the McCain amendment \nbe adopted and the McCain amendment be adopted. I yield to my friend \nfrom Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4448), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the first-degree \namendment, as modified, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4443), as modified, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote scheduled to occur today with respect to the pending bill S. 1894 \nbe vitiated and during the Senate's consideration of S. 1894, the \nfollowing amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order, and \nlimited to relevant\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nsecond-degree amendments, and following the disposition of the \namendments, S. 1894 be read for a third time, the Senate proceed \nimmediately to House companion bill H.R. 3610, all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, the text of S. 1894 be inserted, H.R. 3610 be read \nfor a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of H.R. \n3610, all without further action or debate.\n  The list is a Grassley amendment we are about to vote upon; a Bumpers \nF/A-18C/D amendment, on which there is a 30-minute time agreement; two \nrelevant Daschle amendments; a Dorgan amendment pertaining to funding \nreduction, on which there is a time agreement of 30 minutes equally \ndivided; Senator Ford's amendment on chemical demilitarization; Senator \nHarkin's amendment on defense merger, on which there is a 45-minute \nagreement, 30 minutes for Senator Harkin and 15 minutes to the managers \nof the bill; a Heflin amendment on pump turbines; a relevant amendment \nfor Senator Inouye; a Levin amendment on counterterrorism; a relevant \namendment for Senator Nunn; Senator Simon, a labor related amendment; \nand one relevant amendment for myself as Senator managing. I add \nSenator Feingold's amendment, on which there is a time limit of 30 \nminutes, if we do not work it out. He has two amendments.\n  I further ask that following the passage of H.R. 3610, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and \nS. 1894 be returned to the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4463\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regretfully disagree with the Senator \nfrom Iowa and state again that our act does not allocate funds to the \nentities of the Department of Defense by the roster, or in any way \nrelated to the force structure. If the Senator wishes to limit the \nfunds so it cannot be used to support more than 68 general officers, \nthat is an issue for the authorization committee.\n  At the request of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I \nmove to table the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4891\n\n (Purpose: To reduce procurement of F/A-18C/D fighters to six aircraft)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 4891.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, strike lines 3 through 4, and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``$7,005,704,000, to remain available \n     for obligation until September 30, 1999: Provided that of the \n     funds made available under this heading, no more than \n     $255,000,000 shall be expended or obligated for F/A-18C/D \n     aircraft.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President will the Senator yield to me just a \nmoment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is the plan of the managers of the \nbill to have the debate on the Bumpers amendment. We feel that \namendment will go to a vote sometime between 20 after and 25 after 6. \nAfter that, we will have the Harkin amendment, and it will be voted on \nsometime around 7 o'clock. After that time it will be my intent to ask \nthat all further votes be stacked until tomorrow morning commencing at \n9:30, and we will have final passage following that. There will be some \nfew statements just before final passage. We do have a series of \namendments to debate yet tonight, but we will have no more votes after \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nto the Senator from Iowa for a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin \nAyelsworth, a congressional fellow on my staff, be permitted floor \nprivileges during debate on the DOD appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if we could enter into a time \nagreement on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we entered into a time agreement, if I \nmay respond to the Senator from Arkansas, based upon our conversation. \nThere is at this time I believe 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry. Is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent that no \nsecond-degree amendments----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  There is a request from the Senator from Arkansas that no second-\ndegree amendments be in order. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple.\n  While we have 30 minutes to debate it, I hope that we can yield back \nsome of the time.\n  Let me start by explaining that Senator Feingold has an amendment \nthat deals with the Navy's plans to purchase the E and F models of the \nNavy's F-18 fighter, which is called the Super Hornet. Now, the \nexisting C and D models of the F-18 Hornet are the Navy's premier \ncarrier fighter interceptors. The General Accounting Office has just \nissued a report on the Navy's plans to purchase 640 of the advanced \nmodels which are now in development, namely the F-18E and F-18F. That \nreport, which is the most powerful GAO report I have ever read, says \nthat it is the height of foolishness to go forward with the purchase of \nthat many F-18E/Fs.\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\n  The Navy originally wanted to buy 1,000 of them, 360 of which would \ngo to the Marine Corps. And do you know what the Marine Corps said? \n``We don't want them.''\n  ``We don't want them.'' So that means the Navy is going to buy 640 at \na cost of roughly $53 million each. And the GAO says the present C/D \nmodels that we are using and could continue to use through the year \n2015 will do virtually everything the E/F will do. By buying C/D \nmodels, at a cost of $28 million, almost 50 percent less, the Navy \nwould save $17 billion.\n  Now, I tell you those were prefacing remarks because my amendment \ndoes not try to eliminate the E/F purchases of the Hornet. I am not \ntrying to eliminate the E/F because Senator Feingold has an amendment \nhe is working on trying to get accepted that would give the Pentagon \nthe opportunity to reconsider its plans to spend $60 billion on the E/F \nmodels. It would fence the funds for the E/F until the Pentagon \nprovides Congress with a better justification for its decision. I am a \nstrong proponent of the Feingold amendment; I am a cosponsor. I would \nhave liked to do something stronger, but I know that would not have a \nchance of winning a vote.\n  The Pentagon took the GAO study, which says you can save $17 billion \nby buying F-18C/Ds instead of E/Fs, and they tried to refute every \nsingle point the GAO said, and the GAO came back and refuted \nconclusively--conclusively--Mr. President, every single point the \nPentagon made in favor of squandering $17 billion on the F-18E/F.\n  Here is my amendment. It is very simple. It cuts $234 million for six \nF-18C/D aircraft that were not requested by the Pentagon and that were \nnot included in the Defense Authorization Bill.\n  There is, in this bill, one of the strangest things I have ever seen. \nThere is an appropriation for 12 of the C/D models, which the Pentagon \nsays they want to get rid of. What is even stranger is, of the 12, only \n6 are authorized; the other 6 are not authorized. The Navy says they \nwant this new, premier, advanced E/F model, not the C/D. So, No. 1, the \nPentagon did not ask for them. No. 2, the Senate authorizing committee, \nchaired by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, with the \nranking member from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, did not authorize them. We just \npassed the authorizing bill, and there is no authorization for these \nsix airplanes.\n  With the utmost respect to the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee on Defense, my dear friends, they just put six \nmore airplanes in the bill. They cost only $234 million. If you say it \nreal fast, it is just nothing.\n  So I say, if we are going to buy the E/F, why in the world are we \ngoing to keep buying C/Ds? And I know that we are going to buy the E/F \ndespite the fact that between now and 2025 we will spend at least $500 \nmillion for fighter aircraft. I have been around here 22 years, and I \ncan promise you I can get up on this floor and squeal like a pig under \na gate every day and it will not change two votes.\n  You think about it. By the year 2030 we are going to spend $500 \nbillion for the advanced model Hornet and for the Joint Strike Fighter, \nand for the F-22.\n  So, I wish I could stop the E/F. But I am certain in the knowledge, \nthe certain knowledge, that I would not prevail if I sought to stop the \nPentagon from going forward with the E/F. You know, the Senate has only \nkilled one weapon system that I can remember, and I cannot think what \nthat was. We only killed one weapons system since I have been in the \nSenate. The Pentagon occasionally kills one, and they say, ``We do not \nwant it anymore.'' But a lot of times when they say ``we do not want \nit,'' we impose it on them anyway.\n  And here is the GAO, which we give hundreds of millions of dollars a \nyear to tell us things, saying you are about to squander $17 billion \nfor nothing, and here I am on the floor of the Senate saying, I know \nthe Senate is going to ignore the advice of the GAO. So I am saying, if \nwe are going to go ahead and buy 640 of these high-priced, $53-million-\na-copy fighter planes, for God sakes let us not buy 6 more of the C/D \nmodels which are neither requested by the Pentagon nor authorized by \nthe authorizing committee.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senator Nunn would come to the floor and say \nthat he is going to support this amendment because it was not \nauthorized. I have heard him talk a thousand times about how sick he \ngets of the Senate appropriating money for things that are not \nauthorized. So here is a chance for the Senate to save a paltry $234 \nmillion.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does Senator Feingold seek time on this amendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 6 minutes \nremaining; the Senator from Alaska, 14 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not seek the floor if the Senator wishes to speak \nnow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like not to use up all of my time \nat this point. I would like for the opponents of my amendment to use \nsome time.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to do that, but the Senator was on his \nfeet. I will be glad to let him speak now if he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to defer to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is true that the budget did not \nrequest any funds to buy more F-18C's for the Navy. The Armed Services \nbill included six F-18C's for the Navy. This is authorized. The \ncommittee, our subcommittee, added and the Appropriations Committee \napproved $234 million to buy six single-seat F-18C's for the Navy.\n  Before his untimely death, we asked Admiral Boorda to list the 10 \nhighest priorities for the Navy this year, and Admiral Boorda listed as \nthe sixth priority, as the CNO, buying six more F-18C's. These replace \nthe less capable F-18A's that are still in the active inventory. The C \nmodel has substantial upgrades over the A model. It has better radar \nand carries more sophisticated weapons. It can fly at night and in \nadverse weather.\n  The Navy really needs at least 30 more F-18C's to upgrade its force \nand accomplish its war-fighting mission. The F-18C procurement was \nended because of financial considerations in the past. We still have \nfinancial considerations, but these F-18C's we buy now in fiscal year \n1997 will be in the inventory of the Navy through at least the year \n2018.\n  I say to my friend from Arkansas, as a pilot, these C models give \nNavy pilots the ability to fly at night, in adverse weather, with more \nsophisticated weapons and the best radar in the world. I think it is a \nneeded addition to our Navy.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes and 31 \nseconds; the Senator from Arkansas, 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Wisconsin 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly in support \nof the efforts of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, who is \ntrying to focus attention on the cost implications of decisions that \nare being made regarding the purchase of tactical aircraft for our \nvarious services. As we all know, there is no Member of the Senate who \nhas been a more consistent leader in this area than Senator Bumpers, \nconstantly pressing for the Senate to subject our military procurement \ndecisionmaking to greater scrutiny.\n  I appreciate his support for my amendment. A modified version of it \nappears to have been accepted. Of course, the motivation for that was \nthe GAO report that Senator Bumpers mentioned. It is entitled ``F/A-\n18E/F Will Provide Marginal Operational Improvement at High Cost,'' and \nas the Senator indicated, that marginal improvement is a $17-billion \ndifference, potentially.\n  We are pleased that process will go forward. The Department of \nDefense\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nwill respond to the GAO report, and then the GAO will respond to that. \nI am very pleased and appreciative to the Senator from Alaska for being \ncooperative on this.\n  But on the issue of the amendment of Senator Bumpers, in these times \nof fiscal constraint, every item in the Federal budget has to be \nsubjected to intense review. The Senator from Arkansas and I and many \nothers are deeply concerned that the Department of Defense is embarking \non a range of military aircraft purchases that cannot be sustained in \nthe outyears. The downpayments on these aircraft in the short term \nreally represent only the tip of the iceberg, from the point of view of \nthe cost.\n  A GAO report in 1996 notes the military services plan to spend more \nthan $200 billion on aircraft and other interdiction weapons over the \nnext 15 to 20 years to add to already extensive capabilities. GAO noted \nthat the various services have overlapping programs, with each service \nproposing upgrades or new weapons that may offer little additional \ncapability.\n  So, Mr. President, what the Bumpers amendment is all about and our \neffort here is all about is the fact somewhere, somehow, there needs to \nbe some overview of the range of these programs. In fact, the House \ndefense authorization bill contains a requirement for a force structure \nanalysis by the Institutes of Defense Analysis which examines the \naffordability, effectiveness, commonality, roles and missions and \nalternatives related to the wide range of aircraft. There are good \narguments to be made that we should defer decisions on all these \nprocurement plans pending such a review.\n  In the short term, the issues relating to the F/A-18 clearly need to \nbe examined. On the one hand, the Navy is seeking to remove the C/D \nwith the E/F. Yet this bill adds funding for 12 C/D's, planes which the \nDepartment of Defense has not requested. In fact, the DOD authorization \nbill just passed by the Senate only authorized six additional C/D's, \nand now the Appropriations Committee doubles that number.\n  Before we start adding these additional purchases, I think we ought \nto know where we are going. Is the Navy going to move toward the more \nexpensive E/F or retain the C/D? My view is that we should rely upon \nthe less expensive, but highly capable, C/D. But, Mr. President, one \nthing is clear, when it comes to the C/D versus the E/F, it is an \neither/or choice. We either buy the C/D's or the E/F's, one or the \nother. It is like going to buy a new washing machine. You find two \nslightly different and you decide, what the heck, we will buy both of \nthem. We cannot afford to do that. We cannot afford dual purchases.\n  I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas which \nstrikes the funding for the six additional C/D's. Whatever the ultimate \ndecision is with regard to the future of the F-18, there is no \njustification for this increase in the C/D purchases in this \nappropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Hawaii such time as he may \nuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is always difficult to speak against \nthe GAO. After all, that organization is a child of the Congress. But \nin this case, I give great weight to the concerns and the \nprofessionalism of the United States Navy. I also note that in recent \nyears, the United States Navy has suffered major aviation setbacks in \nthe acquisition programs. For example, the Congress canceled the A-6F \nprogram, the Department of Defense canceled the A-12 program, the Navy \ncanceled the Navy ATF and F-14D program and, as a result, what we have \navailable for us is the F/A-18E and at the present time the C's.\n  If we are to maintain a production line for the F/A-18E at a \nreasonable rate, then it would make sense to continue the production \neven of six models of the C. It will come down to cost. The production \nline will continue.\n  Second, there are many who will argue that the millennium has arrived \nand, therefore, there is really no need for these fancy weapons \nsystems. But I believe that we are being constantly reminded that this \nworld is still very unstable, that there is a need for aircraft \ncarriers, and if we are to have aircraft carriers, obviously there is a \nneed to have planes flying off these carriers. These are carrier \nplanes.\n  So, Mr. President, on this issue, I prefer to set my vote of \nconfidence with the Navy. I think the Navy is correct in suggesting to \nus that if they are to carry out their mission, they need this \naircraft.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the requirement for the additional \nprocurement of F/A-18C/D aircraft does not come from the industrial \ncommunity and is not a result of trying to string out a program which \nhas come to the end of its viable life.\n  The requirement comes from the Department of the Navy and its own \ninventory requirements. According to the Director of Air Warfare for \nthe Navy, a minimum of 436 F/A-18C/D aircraft are required to fill the \n10 active carrier airwings. The Navy expects that without continued \nprocurement, it will be 30 aircraft short of the CNO mandated and \ncongressionally approved requirements. If we include the normal \nattrition factor into the equation, the gap grows even wider for even \nthough the F/A-18 is the safest aircraft in tactical Naval aviation \nhistory, approximately eight aircraft per year are lost.\n  The night-strike capabilities of the C/D are critical to the fighting \neffectiveness of our carriers and allow for the use of the full range \nof the Navy's current weapons inventory. These aircraft improve pilot \nsituational awareness and survivability over their A/B model \ncounterparts. They are also fully compatible with shipboard maintenance \nand diagnostic equipment.\n  The F/A-18E/F aircraft is on schedule and cost and its performance \nexceeds expectations so far. So why do we need more C/D's? Because the \nprocurement schedule of the E/F will not produce significant numbers of \naircraft until 2009. As my colleagues know, I am a staunch supporter of \nthe F/A-18 E/F, for it does bring so much more warfighting capabilities \nto the men and women defending us, but that does not relieve us of the \nresponsibility to provide our fliers with these additional C/D's which \nwill bridge the technological void until the E/F's hit the fleet.\n  Let me put it to my colleagues this way. Advances in aviation, \nmilitary aviation in particular, are a little like those experienced in \nthe computer world. The strategic mix of aircraft currently in our \ninventory and those projected to be in our inventory are representative \nsteps in technological advances which will face threats from weapon \nsystems that are advancing as well. Much like computer systems, we can \nproject capabilities beyond our production abilities.\n  The F-18C/D represents the current cutting edge in tactical Naval \naviation, the E/F the next, JAST hopefully the next. But, we cannot in \ngood conscience ask our young men and women to put their lives on the \nline for us and not give them the best we know we have to offer in the \nhope of dramatic future improvements which are not yet developed. I \nurge my colleagues to support, and support fully, the strategic growth \nof Naval aviation, starting with the continued buy of the C/D's \nappropriated for in this bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bumpers amendment \nto the Defense appropriations bill. This amendment would save American \ntaxpayers 234 million dollars by eliminating funding for six F/A-18C \nthat the Pentagon has not requested.\n  Mr. President, the Defense appropriations bill allocates money for 12 \nmore F-18's than the President requested. It appropriates funds for six \nmore F-18C's than the Senate authorized. It commits us to spend 234 \nmillion dollars on six aircraft that the Navy does not want.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we need to cut Government spending, how \ncan we justify throwing away 234 million dollars of the taxpayers' \nmoney on these soon-to-be outdated aircraft?\n  Within this bill is 1.8 billion dollars to purchase the first 12 new \nF-18E/F fighters for the Navy. The Navy has said that the F-18E/F will \nbe the backbone of its carrier-based forces in the future. This \naircraft is to replace the F-14 and older F-18's, so that by 2009, the \nF-18E/F will comprise a majority of the F-18's in the Navy's inventory. \nIf we are worried about a future military threat, we should direct our \nprocurement to systems of the future, not to\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\naircraft like the F-18C/D that will be obsolete soon after they are \nmanufactured.\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue to squander our Nation's resources \non aircraft that are not needed to defend this country. We must look \nfor areas where we can cut spending while not jeopardizing our national \nsecurity. The Bumpers amendment represents such an opportunity. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 9 minutes 53 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will object to \nadding 3 minutes to my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I add 3 minutes to the time of the Senator from Arkansas \nand yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.\n  I made this point a while ago, but charts are always much more \ngraphic. Here is where we are headed. For the people around here who \nare fiscally responsible and really care about the deficit, this is \nwhat is going to happen between now and about the year 2025 or 2030. We \nare going to spend $70 billion on the F-22 fighter for the Air Force; \n$66.9 billion for the fighter plane that we have been talking about \nhere, the model E/F of the F-18 Hornet, a very, very fine airplane, \nindeed. But so are the C/D models that we now use. The Joint Strike \nFighter will cost about $219 billion. And then sometime around the year \n2010 we are going to start buying the replacement interdiction aircraft \nwhose cost we do not know. The cost in today's 1996 dollars for those \nthree fighter planes is $355.7 billion, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. With inflation at 2.2 percent, that will come to about \n$500 billion between now and the year 2030, $500 billion.\n  Look at this chart. Here are the military budgets of the United \nStates and our potential enemies. The United States, $269 billion; add \nNATO to it, $510 billion; Russia, $98 billion; China, $29 billion; and \nthe rogue nations, such as Libya, North Korea, a total of $17 billion. \nWe spend twice as much as all of the rogue nations, Russia and China \ncombined. When you add NATO to it, almost four times as much.\n  This chart shows that today, we have 3,800 fighter aircraft, and they \nare all so-called fourth generation, the best there is. Look at poor \nRussia, China, North Korea--not even in the game. Not even in the game. \nThe rogues have only 104 modern fighters divided among them. And we are \ngetting ready to spend $17 billion we should not spend, so says GAO.\n  Here is another chart. In the year 2005, we will have 3,200 fighter \nplanes. Look, 3,200 fighter planes that all of them will either be \nfourth or fifth generation aircraft. And the rogues will be no better \noff than they are today.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alaska on this point. He says the C/D \nfighter plane, the Hornet C/D models are very fine night fighters, they \nare excellent aircraft. I could not agree with him more. If it were \nleft up to me, that is what we would be buying. But, no, we are going \nto go spend twice as much, $53 million a copy, on the E/F models which \nthe GAO says is an outrageous waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  Back to my amendment. I am saying you cannot have it both ways. You \ncannot buy the E/F because it is going to be the hottest thing going \nand spend $67 billion on it but say we want a few more C/D's at the \nsame time. As a matter of fact, the committee wants 12.\n  Mr. President, the Pentagon did not ask for 12, even the Navy did not \nask for 12, and the committee, chaired by the Senator from South \nCarolina who is sitting on the floor, the Armed Services Committee of \nthe Senate chaired by Senator Thurmond, authorized six, not 12. And the \nSubcommittee on Defense appropriations, on which I sit, said, ``No, \nwe'll put another six in,'' even though they were not requested nor \nauthorized. It is a paltry $234 million. It will be the only chance you \nwill have of this entire bill to save one single dollar and do it \nsensibly.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the \nyeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before the vote starts, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time on the Ford amendment be limited to 30 minutes \nequally divided. I have this agreement with the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Bumpers amendment No. 4891.

Mr. President, we are awaiting an agreement on the \ndisposition of the final amendments of the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. While we are waiting for the final agreement on the \namendments, I will offer an amendment on behalf of Senators Feingold, \nKohl, Bumpers, and myself.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4892\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4892.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a) Not more than 90 percent of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act for the \n     procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft may be obligated or \n     expended for the procurement of such aircraft until 30 days \n     after the Secretary of Defense has submitted to the \n     Congressional defense committees a report on the F/A-18E/F \n     aircraft program which contains the following:\n       (1) A review of the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.\n       (2) An analysis and estimate of the production costs of the \n     program for the total number of aircraft realistically \n     expected to be procured at each of four annual production \n     rates as follows:\n       (a) 18 aircraft.\n       (b) 24 aircraft\n       (c) 36 aircraft.\n       (d) 48 aircraft.\n       (3) A comparison of the costs and benefits of the F/A-18E/F \n     program with the costs and benefits of the F/A-18C/D aircraft \n     program taking into account the operational combat \n     effectiveness of the aircraft.\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\n       (b) Not later than 30 days after the Secretary of Defense \n     has submitted the report required by subsection (a), the \n     Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the \n     Congressional defense committees an analysis of the report \n     submitted by the Secretary.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment restricts the obligation \nof 10 percent of the funds appropriated for the procurement of the Navy \nF/A-18E/F fighters until the Secretary of Defense submits a report on \nthe F/A-18E/F program.\n  The amendment is similar to an amendment adopted in the defense \nauthorization bill, and I believe that this is acting in concert with \nour colleagues on that Armed Services Committee.\n  This amendment is now acceptable to us. I believe I speak for my \nfriend from Hawaii, also. Does the Senator want to be listed as a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Wisconsin if he \nhas any comment to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment relates to funds \nappropriated under this bill for production of the F/A-18 E/F, or the \nSuper Hornet as it is commonly called, which I understand will be \naccepted by the managers. I appreciate their willingness to work with \nus on this matter.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to an amendment that I \noffered which was adopted on the Defense authorization bill, S. 1745, \nwhen it was considered by the Senate on June 28.\n  Basically, this amendment seeks to limit obligation of funds for the \nproduction of this new aircraft until Congress has an opportunity to \nreview carefully the recommendations made by the General Accounting \nOffice in a report issued last month. The GAO report, entitled ``Navy \nAviation: F/A-18E/F will Provide Marginal Operational Improvement at \nHigh Cost,'' outlines some very important questions that should be \nconsidered before we proceed further with procurement of this aircraft. \nThe amendment directs the Department of Defense to submit a report \nresponding to the GAO concerns, and provides an opportunity for GAO to \ncomment on the DOD response. It fences 10 percent of the funds \nappropriated for procurement of the new aircraft until 30 days after \nthis report is submitted.\n  At the time I offered a similar amendment to the DOD authorization \nbill, I discussed extensively the issues raised by GAO. Although I do \nnot want to take the Senate's time today to repeat each of these \narguments, I want to highlight some of GAO's concerns.\n  First, GAO noted that a projected total program cost of more than $89 \nbillion, the Super Hornet Program is one of the most costly aviation \nprograms in the Department of Defense.\n  Second, the Navy based the need for the development and procurement \nof the Super Hornet on the basis of existing or projected operational \ndeficiencies of the current model of the F/A-18 in the following key \nareas: strike range, carrier recovery payload and survivability. In \naddition, the Navy noted limitations of the current C/D model of the F/\nA-18 with respect to avionics growth space and payload capacity.\n  In its report, however, GAO concluded that the operational \ndeficiencies in the C/D that the Navy had cited in justifying the E/F \neither have not materialized as projected or such deficiencies can be \ncorrected with nonstructural changes to the current C/D and additional \nupgrades which would further improve its capabilities.\n  Mr. President, let me stress here that the GAO did not conclude that \nthe F/A-18 E/F is a bad plane. During the debate on this issue on the \nDOD authorization, several of the proponents of this aircraft spoke \nabout this plane being a highly capable carrier-based tactical \naircraft, as it was intended to be. I want to stress, again, that the \nissue here is whether the additional capabilities of this \naircraft justify its additional cost, or whether the current C/D \nversion of the F/A-18 can perform the mission at substantial cost-\nsavings to the Federal taxpayer.\n\n  GAO found that the C/D's are performing at higher levels than \noriginally contemplated. For example, the F/A-18C's operating in \nsupport of the current Bosnia operations are now routinely returning to \ncarriers with operational loads of 7,166 pounds, which is substantially \ngreater than the Navy projected for this aircraft. In fact, when \ninitially procured in 1988, this aircraft had a total carrier recovery \npayload of 6,300 pounds. Today, it is significantly higher. In \naddition, GAO noted that while it is not necessary, upgrading F/A-18Cs \nwith stronger landing gear could allow them to recover carrier payloads \nof more than 10,000 pounds--greater than that sought for the F/A-18E/F \nwhich would be 9,000 pounds.\n  GAO made similar findings with respect to the C/D's long-range \nmission capacity. GAO concluded that the Navy's F/A-18 strike range \nrequirements can be met by either the Super Hornet or the C/D, using \nthe 480-gallon external fuel tanks that are planned to be used on the \nE/F.\n  Mr. President, I will not detail any further today the areas where \nGAO noted that the differences in the capabilities of the two aircraft \nwere either not as significant as anticipated or could be minimized by \nmodifications of the C/Ds.\n  I do, however, want to stress the difference in the cost of these two \nplanes. As I mentioned at the outset, the total program cost of the \nSuper Hornet is projected to be over $89 billion assuming a procurement \nof 1,000 aircraft--660 by the Navy and 340 by the Marine Corps--at an \nannual production rate of 72 aircraft per year. However, as GAO noted, \nthese figures are not accurate. The Marine Corps has made it clear that \nthey do not intend to purchase any Super Hornets. Furthermore, an \nannual production rate of 72 aircraft is not feasible. The Navy has \nalready been directed to calculate costs based upon a more realistic \nproduction rate, at 18, 36 and 54 aircraft per year.\n  Using the overstated assumptions, the Navy calculated the unit \nrecurring flyaway cost of the Super Hornet at $44 million. However, \nusing GAO's more realistic assumptions of the procurement of 660 \naircraft, at a production rate of 36 aircraft per year, the cost of the \nE/F balloons to $53 million.\n  In comparison, the C/D's cost $28 million each at a production rate \nof 36 planes per year.\n  GAO concluded that the cost difference in unit recurring flyaway \nwould result in a savings of almost $17 billion if the Navy were to \nprocure 660 F/A-18 C/Ds rather than 660 F/A-18 E/Fs.\n  At a time of fiscal constraints on all aspects of the Federal budget, \nwe need to look carefully at whether it is necessary to spend this \nadditional $17 billion on an aircraft that may produce only marginal \nimprovements over the current model.\n  Mr. President, this question is also important because there is also \na far less costly program already being developed which may yield more \nsignificant returns in operational capability. This program is the \njoint advanced strike technology or JAST program which is currently \ndeveloping technology for a family of affordable next generation joint \nstrike fighter [JSF] aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and the \nNavy.\n\n  The JSF is expected to be a stealthy strike aircraft built on a \nsingle production line with a high degree of parts and cost \ncommonality. The Navy plans to procure 300 JSF's with a projected \ninitial operational capability around 2007. The JSF will be designed to \nhave superior or comparable capabilities in all Navy tactical aircraft \nmission areas, especially range and survivability, at far less cost \nthan the Super Hornet.\n  The estimated unit recurring flyaway cost of the Navy's JSF is \nestimated in the range from $32 to 40 million, as compared to GAO's $53 \nmillion estimate for the Super Hornet.\n  Mr. President, given the high cost and marginal improvement in \noperational capabilities the Super Hornet would provide, it seems that \nits justification is no longer clear. Operational deficiencies in the \nC/D aircraft either have not materialized or can be corrected with \nnonstructural changes to the plane. As a result, proceeding with the E/\nF program may not be the most cost-effective approach to modernizing \nthe Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. A strong argument can be made that \nthe Navy can continue to procure the C/D aircraft while upgrading it to \nimprove further its operational capabilities. For the long term, the \nNavy\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\ncan look toward the next generation strike fighter, the JSF, which will \nprovide more operational capability at far less cost than the E/F.\n  As I have indicated previously, the Navy does need to procure \naircraft that will bridge between the current force and the JSF which \nwill be operational around 2007. The question is whether the F/A-18C/D \ncan serve that function, or whether we should proceed with an expensive \nnew plane for what appears to be a marginal level of improvement. The \n$17 billion difference in projected costs does not appear to provide a \nsignificant return on our investment.\n  For these reasons, I think it would be prudent to adopt a go-slow \napproach to the F/A-18 E/F program and allow Congress sufficient time \nto review GAO's findings, the Defense Department's response, and GAO's \nevaluation of that response.\n  Mr. President, there is one issue I want to specifically address \nregarding the obligation of funds under this appropriations bill for \nthe F/A-18 E/F program. At the time the GAO report was submitted to \nCongress, the Navy responded that the GAO concerns were premature \nbecause the final procurement decision had not been made by DOD. DOD \nindicated that the final decision could not be made until the Defense \nAcquisition Board had made its low rate initial production [LRIP] \nmilestone decision in the first quarter of calendar year 1997. At that \ntime, DOD contended the Board would convene for a thorough program \nreview. It is my understanding that although there may be some \nprocurement funds obligated prior to the DAB decision, the bulk of the \nfunds would not be committed until this milestone decision is made next \nyear. DOD would, under this amendment, also be preparing its report in \nresponse to this amendment during the same period of time, and \nhopefully, answers to some of the questions raised by GAO would be \nthoroughly examined during this process prior to the final decisions \nfor fiscal year 1997 funding. Congress will also have an opportunity to \nreview this information and halt or slow down procurement if deemed \nappropriate.\n  Over the long term, it is important that we carefully consider all of \nthe issues surrounding the planned procurement of some 1000 F/A-18 E/\nF's. I believe that this amendment will assist in getting the relevant \ninformation, and I appreciate the cooperation of the managers in moving \nus in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    aluminum metal matrix composites\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am concerned with a project under the \nDefense Production Act which is currently caught up in the Department \nof Defense. On October 5, 1995, the President notified Congress that \nDOD intended to utilize title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) \nto address industrial resource shortfalls for the production of \nAluminum Metal Matrix Composites (AL MMC). Funding in the amount of \n$15,000,000 was to be made available for this effort. It is my \nunderstanding that staff in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition \n& Technology) office are attempting to divert these funds to other \ntitle III programs.\n  According to Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, Development \nand Acquisition) Gilbert F. Decker, ``the Army has valid requirements \nfor components manufactured with Al MMC to support its armored combat \nvehicle fleet.'' In fact, Mr. Decker wrote to Under Secretary Kaminski \nasking that he continue to reserve the funding for its original \npurpose, adding that ``use of Al MMC material will result in both a \nsignificant weight reduction and increase in the durability of \nmanufactured parts. It also promises a significant weight reduction and \nincrease in the durability of manufactured parts. It also promises a \nsignificant cost savings over current materials.''\n  Under Secretary of Defense Kaminski approved the project as well \nstating that ``Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites (Al MMC) is an enabling \ntechnology that will increase combat performance and reduce life cycle \ncosts for a variety of defense systems, e.g., missiles, where reduced \nweight will reduce time to kill and/or increase range.''\n  The funds necessary for this project are already appropriated monies \nand need no further authorization or appropriation to be spent. Based \nupon my understanding, it is the desire of the Army to proceed \nexpeditiously on the procurement of Aluminum Metal Matrix Composites \nwith title III funds. Unfortunately, DOD personnel on the staff level \nhave decided to step in the way of this project, Mr. Chairman, that is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for \nbringing this problem to the attention of the Committee. I can assure \nthe Senator that we will look into this matter and further discuss it \nwith our colleagues in the House when we go to Conference.\n\n\n                    DoD NATURAL RESOURCES ASSESSMENT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as you and Senator Stevens know, the \nDefense authorization bill is currently in conference and I am a \nconferee on that legislation. Section 248 of that bill as passed by the \nHouse contains a provision which authorizes a natural resources \nassessment and training delivery system improvement program to enhance \nthe Department of Defense's capabilities for complying with its own \nrequirements to protect and conserve the natural ecosystems on military \ninstallations. This provision was sponsored by Representative Hansen of \nUtah. I am hopeful that the Senate conferees will accept the Hansen \namendment in conference.\n  The purpose of this colloquy is to urge the prospective Senate \nconferees on the Defense Appropriations bill to give consideration to \nproviding a means of funding the Hansen amendment. Specifically, it is \nmy understanding that $3,400,000 would be required to allow a \nconsortium of environmental experts, including institutions of higher \neducation in my State of Virginia and others, to assist the Department \nof Defense to monitor natural resources in training and weapons testing \nareas, to address the highest priority DOD environmental conservation \nrequirements as identified by the Pentagon last year. It is my \nunderstanding that this program will help save funds in carrying out \nthese important military requirements.\n  I ask that Senator Stevens and the Senate conferees on the Defense \nappropriations bill do whatever is possible to identify funding to \ncarry out this important military environmental initiative in fiscal \nyear 1997. Can the distinguished Chairman address this matter?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia \nfor bringing this important matter to my personal attention. I am \nsomewhat familiar with the proposal contained in the House-passed \nDefense authorization bill and it sounds reasonable. I will assure the \nSenator from Virginia that I will work between now and the conclusion \nof conference on this appropriations bill to find a way to provide \nfunding for the natural resources assessment and training delivery \nsystem improvement program that has been identified by my colleague. \nOne possible avenue that will be explored is the Defense Legacy \nProgram.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend and colleague for his consideration of \nthis project.\n\n\n                          DoD TRANSIT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention \nthe fact that none of the Department of Defense organizations currently \nparticipates in a transit benefit program available to all Federal \ncivilian and military personnel. This is particularly significant given \nthe Metro facilities at the Pentagon. The program, offered by the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), and authorized \nunder the Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act, Public Law 103-\n172, enacted in 1993, allows Federal agencies to provide a tax free \nbenefit of up to $65 per month in employer-provided transit passes to \nhelp defray the costs of daily commutes by public transportation. The \nFederal Government is also permitted to provide up to $165 per month \nfor parking costs, similarly excluded from an employee's taxable \nincome. These benefits are identical to\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nthose enjoyed by private sector employees under the Energy Policy Act \nof 1992.\n  This incentive program for Federal employees has been an unqualified \nsuccess. The 100 Federal agencies in this area, including the United \nStates Senate, that participate in the WMATA Program, called Metrochek, \nhave reduced parking costs, decreased employee absenteeism rates and \nimproved employee morale and productivity. The program also results in \nsignificant energy conservation and environmental benefits and serves \nto reduce traffic congestion, by encouraging Federal employees to take \npublic transit, rather than driving alone in their automobiles.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This certainly appears to be a worthwhile program. I \nwould like to join the distinguished gentleman in encouraging \nDepartment of Defense organizations to participate. In your opinion, \nwhat would be the most efficient method for gaining their \nparticipation?\n  Mr. WARNER. First, Mr. President, the Department of Defense should \ninstruct its organizations to survey the area's Department of Defense \nemployees to accurately estimate how many employees might benefit from \nthis program. Additionally, I request the Chairman's support in \ndirecting some of DOD's largest organizations to conduct a \ndemonstration program to test the effectiveness of this program. For \nexample, there are over 40,000 civilian and military Army employees in \nthe Washington area. WMATA estimates that approximately 6,400 employees \ncould utilize the Metrochek Program. Similarly, the Navy and Marines \nhave 58,000 employees in this area, of which 8,700 may be able to \nutilize the program; and the Air Force has over 21,000 employees, of \nwhich 3,300 could benefit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be pleased to join the distinguished Senator in \nstrongly encouraging these DOD organizations to establish demonstration \nprograms in order to more closely examine the potential of this \nprogram.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to thank the Chairman. It seems to me that given \nthe substantial Federal investment made in Metrorail, we have an \nobligation to utilize this extraordinary asset. More than half of the \nMetro stations serve Federal installations. The Metrorail System was \nbuilt with the full partnership of the Federal Government, dating back \nto the Eisenhower Administration. I appreciate the Chairman's \nwillingness to promote this important program which benefits Federal \nemployees, while reducing congestion and improving air quality in this \nregion.\n\n\n            advanced materials intelligent processing center\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nappreciation to my colleagues, the senior Senator from Alaska, Ted \nStevens, and the Senior Senator from Hawaii, Dan Inouye, for the \nfunding provided for the Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing \nCenter in the fiscal year 1997 Defense Appropriations legislation. I \nbelieve the Center will provide returns to the American taxpayers by \nenhancing the affordability of military hardware and defense readiness.\n  At present, the affordability of military hardware is determined in \npart by the cost of fabricating components and the stockpiling of \nweapons for future use. Advanced materials, which are increasingly used \nin military hardware because they provide important performance \nbenefits, can be difficult and expensive to process. Weapons are \npresently manufactured and stockpiled at great cost in part because \ntechnologies are not yet in place that would allow a mothballed plant \nto be reactivated quickly, or a commercial manufacturing plant to be \nconverted rapidly to military production.\n  The Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing Center can address both \nof these cost factors by providing an integrated approach for the \nfabrication of military hardware containing advanced materials. The \nCenter will develop processing techniques that can help to lower the \ncost of fabricating military components from advanced materials, and \nhelp to lower the cost and the need for stockpiling.\n  Numerous studies have shown that inadequate processing technology can \ncontribute to the high cost of advanced materials. In addition, the \nFederal Government spends far more on product development (95 percent \nof Federal research and development) than on process development, in \ncontrast to Japan where the breakdown of research and development \nfunding is exactly opposite, and where affordable advanced materials \nare being developed far more rapidly than in the United States.\n  The Center is the culmination of more than two years of discussion \nand planning with organizations such as the Army Materials Laboratory \npolymer composites group, the Air Force Material Laboratory controls \ngroup and ceramic-matrix composites group, Argonne National Laboratory, \nthe NIST polymer composites group and the Office of Intelligent \nProcessing of Materials, the IHPTET Fiber Development Consortium, and \nthe Navy's Center of Excellence in Composites Manufacturing Technology.\n  Northwestern University is uniquely qualified to establish and \noperate the Center because of its international reputation in materials \nscience, its nationally recognized effectiveness in interdisciplinary \nR, industrial collaboration, technology transfer, and its experience \nin operating R consortia related to the production of advanced \nmilitary hardware. Northwestern's Department of Materials Science and \nEngineering is consistently ranked among the top five such departments \nin the Nation, and Northwestern's Material Science Center was among the \nfirst of such laboratories funded by the Federal Government.\n\n  In addition, Northwestern's Institute of Learning Sciences is \nnationally recognized in using artificial intelligence for adaptive \nlearning systems. Finally, Northwestern's industrial research \nlaboratory, BIRL, has successfully worked with many commercial and \nmilitary suppliers to develop and transfer new advanced materials and \nprocessing technologies.\n  With the end of the cold war, the Nation's industrial capacity to \nprovide defense hardware has declined dramatically through the closure \nor conversion to commercial use of defense manufacturing facilities. \nMany U.S. defense firms may be unable to convert their operations \nrapidly to large-scale military production. The funding recommended in \nthis year's legislation would allow for development of a center that \ncan help address the defense readiness of our industrial base.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to again commend my \ncolleagues on the subcommittee for their efforts on behalf of this \ncenter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the kind words of the distinguished Senator \nFrom Illinois. I am aware that Northwestern University in Evanston, IL \nwould be well qualified to operate the Advanced Materials Intelligent \nProcessing Center and will give this program every consideration for \nfunding during conference of this bill.\n\n\n                   computer emergency response system\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof engaging my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, in a colloquy regarding support for the \nComputer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center [CERT/CC], located \nat Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute in \nPittsburgh, PA. CERT/CC has operated since 1988 under the sponsorship \nof the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [DARPA]. Its mission \nis to respond to computer security emergencies and intrusions on the \nInternet, to serve as a central point for identifying vulnerabilities, \nand to conduct research to improve the security of existing systems.\n  The number of computer emergencies handled by CERT/CC has grown from \n132 in 1989 to nearly 2,500 in 1995. The severity of these incidents \nhas also increased dramatically. Finance and banking, medicine and \ntransportation rely heavily on computer networks. But as terrorists, \nordinary criminals, and rogue states grow more technologically \nsophisticated, our vulnerability to attacks on our computer networks \nhas grown. In light of these vulnerabilities, it is critical for the \nUnited States to develop networks capable of surviving attacks while \nprotecting sensitive data. In my view, CERT/CC can play a critical role \nin ensuring the security of our computer systems.\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\n  The Defense Department had planned to reduce funding for this \ncritically important activity. However, an amendment offered by \nSenators Nunn, Santorum and Kyl, and included in the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense Authorization bill, authorizes $2 million to the Software \nEngineering Institute to continue this effort. This important provision \nwill enable CERT's incident-handling activity to continue through \nfiscal year 1997. It is my hope that an appropriate long-term source of \nfunding for CERT will be identified during the coming fiscal year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his comments. I agree that the CERT provides a critical function \nfor the Defense Department at a time when our computer systems and \nnetworks are being attacked by computer hackers. I will work to provide \nan appropriate level of funding for CERT activities.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President. I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished Chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee \nan important matter that I and a number of our colleagues have been \nworking on. As I am sure they are aware, the Senate adopted an \namendment I offered to the fiscal year 1997 Senate Defense \nAuthorization bill that would require the Defense Department and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to jointly submit to the \nCongress no later than September 6, 1996 a detailed military retiree \nMedicare subvention demonstration program implementation plan. That \namendment also authorized funds to pay for the demonstration program. \nCurrently, however, the fiscal year 1997 Defense Appropriations bill \ndoes not include funding for this important effort. I would like to \nbring this matter to the attention of my colleagues, and to propose \nexpediting a reprogramming request in fiscal year 1997 to fund the \ndemonstration program should the Congress authorize it for fiscal year \n1997.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am aware of the efforts of my \ncolleague, and understand that if the Congress authorizes the \ndemonstration program in fiscal year 1997 some funds may need to be \nappropriated. Since we do not yet know how much funding could be \nrequired, it is impossible for the subcommittee to act at this time. I \nassure my colleague that the subcommittee supports Medicare subvention \nand we would be willing to work with my colleague from Texas and the \nadministration to expedite the reprogramming of 1997 funds if the \nCongress authorizes a Medicare subvention demonstration program in \nfiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I too am well aware of this issue. I am \npleased to have been a cosponsor of the amendment to the fiscal year \n1997 Defense authorization bill to which my colleague from Texas \nreferred, as well as being an original cosponsor of his demonstration \nlegislation, S. 1487. I strongly support the Senate's efforts to \nattempt to authorize a Medicare subvention demonstration program in \nfiscal year 1997 and look forward to reviewing the joint report when it \nis submitted on September 6. I assure my colleague from Texas that I \nwill be pleased to work with him and the administration to try to \nexpedite the reprogramming of fiscal year 1997 funds if the Congress is \nable to authorize the demonstration in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of \nthe committee, my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and my friend \nthe ranking minority member, Senator Inouye, for doing the good work \nagain this year on the Defense Department's problem disbursements.\n  The bill includes a provision--section 8089--that makes the \nDepartment match disbursements with obligations before payments are \nmade.\n  This measure helps to sustain the momentum we started back in 1994, \ncontinued in 1995, and re-energized this year.\n  Section 8089 ratchets down payment thresholds even more as \nrecommended in audit reports just issued by the inspector general and \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  This piece of legislation and the accompanying report language send \nthe right message to the Department.\n  We intend to keep the pressure on until this problem is fixed.\n  That's the message the bill sends.\n  I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their willingness to \nfollow through on this important issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this Defense Appropriations bill, S. \n1894, provides $244.8 billion in new discretionary budget authority and \n$243.2 in total discretionary outlays for the Department of Defense. \nThere are some major elements to this bill that are important for \nSenators to know.\n  The bill, as reported, is within the Defense Subcommittee's Section \n602(b) allocation and, thus, complies with the requirements of the \nBudget Act.\n  The bill fully funds certain important initiatives that were \nrequested by the President, including a three percent pay raise for all \nmilitary personnel and the end strengths for all of the active and \nreserve military services.\n  More importantly, the bill also funds needed increases in each of the \nmajor accounts of the defense budget. Each of these accounts was left \nwith major underfunding problems by the administration's budget \nrequest. The administration would have us believe that these increases \nare uncalled for an excessive; following that advice would have the \nfollowing consequences:\n  Programmed medical care for military beneficiaries would be \nunderfunded by $475 million, and that care would be reduced.\n  The average age of military barracks that is now over 30 years would \nincrease.\n  The average age of tactical aircraft would increase to over 20 years, \nand some Air Force fighters would be as old as 40 years.\n  Flight training for Air Force fighter pilots would decrease from 20 \nhours per month to an unacceptable 16 hours.\n  The size of Air National Guard squadrons would shrink to 12 aircraft \neach from a level that was 18 to 24 just a few years ago.\n  In short, while the administration would have people believe that the \nincreases we are funding in this bill are excessive and unnecessary, \nthe facts are that these increases will only help to slow--not prevent, \nlet alone reverse--some serious deterioration in our Armed Forces.\n  In fact, in terms of constant--inflation adjusted--dollars, this bill \nis a real-dollar decrease from last year's appropriations, and, despite \nits apparent increases, it constitutes the twelfth straight year of \ndecline in real-dollar defense spending.\n  The chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the \nSubcommittee staff deserve the thanks of the Senate for their extremely \nskillful crafting of this bill. It makes the best possible use of the \nlimited funds available; in many respects, it does more--with less--\nthan other defense bills before Congress, and, most importantly, it \nhelps to stem the aging and shrinking in our weapons inventory and the \nreduced training and readiness that the administration's anemic defense \nbudget would impose on our Armed Forces.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing \nthe relationship of the reported bill to the Defense Subcommittee's \n602(b) allocation be printed in the Record.\n  I urge the adoption of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       DEFENSE SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL       \n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense Discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........     80,733\n    S. 1894, as reported to the Senate............    244,561    162,247\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary..............    244,561    242,980\n                                                   =====================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........         12\n    S. 1894, as reported to the Senate............  .........  .........\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........  .........  .........\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........  .........\n    S. 1894, as reported to the Senate............        184        184\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     budget resolution assumptions................         12         12\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory..........................        196        196\n                                                   =====================\n      Adjusted bill total.........................    244,757    243,188\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.........................    244,565    242,985\n    Nondefense discretionary......................  .........         12\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................        196        196\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total allocation............................    244,761    243,193\n                                                   =====================\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\n                                                                        \nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.........................         -4         -5\n    Nondefense discretionary......................  .........  .........\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............

Mr. President, again, I want to thank the managers of the \nbill for the good work they have done. They have done an incredible job \nin working through a long list of amendments and making sure that all \nthe Senators' interests are protected.\n  It looks to me like they have reached a point here where we can bring \nthe DOD appropriations bill to a conclusion, with votes in the morning. \nWe are waiting for one final clearance. We hope to get that, and there \nare calls being made now.\n  I thank the Democratic leader publicly for his help in working \nthrough these amendments and on a number of other issues we are working \non.\n  I will not ask unanimous consent right now, but I thought I might \noutline what the two managers have come up with, and that would be \nthis: All remaining amendments to the Department of Defense bill be \noffered and all debate occur tonight, and that any rollcall votes \nordered with respect to these amendments begin at 9:30 in the morning, \nwith the first vote limited to the standard time, and all remaining \nstacked votes be reduced to 10 minutes in length, with 2 minutes \nequally divided on each before the votes so that there will be an \nexplanation; following the disposition of all of those amendments and \nall other provisions of the bill, we would go to third reading, and \nSenator Dorgan would be recognized for 5 minutes for closing debate, \nand there would be 5 minutes equally divided between the two managers, \nand following that, final passage.\n  If sounds to me like all of this could probably be done within an \nhour or so, and then we would go right after that into the \nconsideration of S. 1956, which is the reconciliation bill. If we can \nget a final clearance on that, then we would be able to officially \nannounce that there would be no further votes tonight. We have not \ngotten that finally agreed to at this point. But I think it would be \nvery good if we could get that completed and go to reconciliation. Of \ncourse, we would have to have it. The bill would have to be available, \nand we believe it will be available by 10:30 in the morning.\n  Let me do this while we are waiting. I thought maybe we could go the \nagreement at any moment now. Would the Senator from Iowa like to go \nahead and proceed? Then would he be willing to yield to me to put this \nunanimous consent as soon as we get final clearance?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Any time.\n  Will the majority leader yield on the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, maybe my ears did not pick it up. Any time we have \ndebate in the evening and we stack votes in the morning, this Senator \nfeels that it is appropriate to give at least a couple of minutes in \nthe morning before the votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be included in the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A minute on each side.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, and hopefully we can get the final word \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4492\n\n    (Purpose: Relating to payments by the Department of Defense of \n       restructuring costs associated with business combinations)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Simon, proposes an amendment numbered 4492.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 88, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8099. (a)(1) Not later than February 1, 1997, the \n     Comptroller General shall, in consultation with the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Defense and the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, submit to Congress a report \n     which shall set forth recommendations regarding the revisions \n     of statute or regulation necessary--\n       (A) to assure that the amount paid by the Department of \n     Defense for restructuring costs associated with a business \n     combination does not exceed the expected net financial \n     benefit to the Federal Government of the business \n     combination;\n       (B) to assure that such expected net financial benefit \n     accrues to the Federal Government; and\n       (C) in the event that the amount paid exceeds the actual \n     net financial benefit, to permit the Federal Government to \n     recoup the difference between the amount paid and the actual \n     net financial benefit.\n       (2) For purposes of determining the net financial benefit \n     to the Federal Government of a business combination under \n     this subsection, the Comptroller General shall utilize a 5-\n     year time period and take into account all costs anticipated \n     to be incurred by the Federal Government as a result of the \n     business combination, including costs associated with the \n     payment of unemployment compensation and costs associated \n     with the retraining of workers.\n       (b) No funds appropriated or otherwise made available for \n     the Department of Defense by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended to process or pay any claim for restructuring costs \n     associated with a business combination under the following:\n       (1) Any contract, advance agreement, or novation agreement \n     entered into on or after July 12, 1996.\n       (2) Any contract, advance agreement, or novation agreement \n     entered into before that date unless the contract or \n     agreement specifies that payment for costs associated with a \n     business combination shall be made under the contract using \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department by this Act.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSimon's name be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I believe we have \nthis agreement.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments \nto the Department of Defense appropriations bill be offered, that all \ndebate occur today, and that the rollcall votes ordered with respect to \nthese amendments begin at 9:30 a.m., on Thursday, July 18, with the \nfirst vote limited to the standard time, and all remaining stacked \nvotes reduced to 10 minutes in length with 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to each vote for explanation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that, following disposition of the \namendments, all other provisions of this consent agreement apply; and, \nfollowing third reading of H.R. 3610, that Senator Dorgan be recognized \nto be followed by 5 minutes equally divided between the two managers; \nand, following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on final passage of H.R. 3610, as amended, without \nfurther action or debate; and following disposition and passage of H.R. \n3610, the Senate turn to consideration of S. 1956, the reconciliation \nbill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further votes this evening. However, Members who have \namendments will have to remain to offer and debate their amendments. \nThose votes, including passage, will occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. Also, \nfollowing passage of the DOD appropriations bill, the Senate will begin \nreconciliation.\n  Therefore, a number of votes will occur during Thursday's session of \nthe Senate.\n  Again, I thank Senator Daschle, Senator Stevens, and Senator Inouye\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\nfor the great work they have done here, and all Senators because it \ntakes a lot of cooperation to get a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  We will continue to try to move bills that we get agreement on, and \njudges that we have agreement on, so that we can continue to work \ntogether and do the business of the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for yielding this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4492\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous agreement, the proponents of the \nHarkin amendment have 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nIowa, and the opponents have 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Let me \ntry to explain it by beginning this way. If you remember the $600 \ntoilet seats, and the $500 hammers in the Department of Defense, well, \nwhat is going on right now is going to make those look like a real \nbargain. What has happened since 1993, due to a policy change that was \nnever debated on the Senate floor, never published in the Federal \nRegister, is that taxpayers are now paying for mergers and acquisition \ncosts of defense contractors.\n\n  Yes. You heard me right. Any defense contractor that merges--acquires \nother companies--the taxpayers get to pick up the bill. I know it is \nhard to believe. But it is actually happening.\n  The cost estimated so far of doing this just since 1993 is over $300 \nmillion. There is somewhere in the neighborhood of about $2 billion in \ncosts pending that the taxpayers will have to pick up unless we do \nsomething about it and stop this nonsense--this egregious attack on the \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  In 1993 the DOD, at the request of defense contractors, changed its \npolicy on reimbursing companies for corporate mergers without \nadequately notifying Congress. This change in the interpretation of the \nFederal acquisition rules is far reaching. Every department and agency \nof the Government is affected. Yet, the Senate has not had one hearing \nnor significant floor debate on this issue.\n  Mr. President, this amendment simply seeks to assure that what \nproponents of this form of corporate welfare claim--that it will lead \nto rational downsizing of the defense industry and result in net \nsavings to the taxpayer--is actually realized. As of now both of those \nclaims do not seem to be supported by the facts.\n  Let me read a couple of passages from a recent DOD inspector general \nreport dated June 28, 1996, on page 9. ``Contractors''--meaning defense \ncontractors--``are submitting cost proposals for activities called \nconcentration, transition, economic planning, and other terms that do \nnot immediately suggest restructuring and make the cost issues \ndifficult for the Government to review, administer, and resolve.''\n  On page 10 of the same IG report,\n\n       One contractor's restructuring proposal projected savings \n     over 10 years. The contractor's projections are highly \n     speculative since the volume of Government business is not \n     guaranteed. The same contractor also proposed savings based \n     on ``synergies in the work force'' [how about that one?] a \n     term that is not defined in the existing procurement \n     regulations, and is difficult at best to monetize and \n     evaluate.''\n  Another contractor proposed keeping subcontract profits [listen to \nthis one] in its prime contract price, although it now owned the \nsubcontractor and would be receiving a profit on top of a profit.\n\n  Another example:\n\n       A contractor voluntarily deleted costs to win a competitive \n     program and subsequently identified those costs as \n     restructuring.\n\n  And billed the taxpayers for it.\n  On page 16, the same IG report, which just came out about 3 weeks \nago:\n       Amortization based on the projection of extended savings \n     can almost make a marginal acquisition appear attractive by \n     spreading costs over a long period, and comparing them to the \n     projected savings to determine savings. In all cases, \n     amortization periods were selected for arbitrary reasons, \n     such as the length of time needed to achieve restructuring \n     savings, or to meet available funding otherwise not supported \n     by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n  There is more, but I will leave that for right now.\n  As I said earlier, Mr. President, proponents also say the policy is \ngoing to save taxpayers' money. How many times have we heard that old \nsong? The record is spotty at best.\n  According to a GAO study of one business combination, ``The net cost \nreduction certified by DOD represents less than 15 percent of the \nsavings projected to the DOD 2 years earlier when they sought support \nfor the proposed partnership.''\n  Less than 15 percent of the projected savings were actually being \nachieved. That alone proves the need for my amendment.\n  Clearly, projected savings are not being realized. Yet, there is \nabsolutely no mechanism for DOD to recoup actual losses to the \nGovernment. As a result, the American taxpayer is being asked to pick \nup the tab.\n  In addition, the current practice is to measure only cost to the \nDepartment of Defense when contractors merge and lay off thousands of \nhard-working Americans. The costs associated with Government-subsidized \nsocial services like worker retraining are not tallied. Neither are the \ncosts associated with lost payroll tax revenue. My amendment would fix \nthat by requiring the Comptroller to include all costs to the \nGovernment in his recommendations.\n  Although I believe this practice must stop, maybe this is too much to \ndo right now, but that is why I am offering this very modest amendment. \nWhat this amendment does is it merely puts a 1-year moratorium on these \npayments so the Comptroller General can give us the tools we need to \ntake a close look at the policy and to ensure that taxpayers recoup any \npayments in excess of realized benefits. It will also allow us to have \nhearings on this far-reaching policy change.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to one adopted in the \nHouse on June 13. On June 13--get this--the House of Representatives, \nby voice vote, adopted an amendment even more stringent than mine. It \nwould be retroactive. It would go back even on the contracts that are \nheld right now.\n  When I first proposed my amendment on the defense authorization bill, \nsome of the Members came to me and said, ``Oh, my gosh. This is going \nto open up the Government to all kind of lawsuits--breach of \ncontract.'' Well, all right, I took that into account. This amendment \nthat I offer is not like that amendment. This amendment is only \nprospective. It allows the Government to pay the costs for which it is \ncurrently obligated, but it prevents any further obligation.\n  Let me be very clear about this, especially to the managers of the \nbill. This amendment allows the Government to pay costs for which it is \ncurrently obligated but prevents any further obligation.\n  Let me just discuss this policy in more detail. Lawrence Korb, the \nUnder Secretary of Defense under President Reagan, supports this \namendment. According to an article by him in the summer 1996 issue of \nthe Brookings Review, this wasteful practice was initiated by the \nPentagon in July 1993. The Pentagon claims that this was not a change \nof policy but merely a clarification of existing policy. However, no \none can come up with examples of such corporate welfare before the 1993 \ndecision. And there are several examples of such requests being denied. \nSo it was a policy change, a serious and costly one.\n  If this was not a policy change and merely a clarification of \nexisting policy, then you better look out, because we have got mergers \nand acquisitions going back to the late 1970's, and they are all going \nto be marching up here and saying, well, it was existing policy.\n  I hope the managers of the bill and their staffs will think about \nthis and respond to this. You cannot have it both ways. If this is a \nchange in policy, then it was not published in the Federal Register. It \ndid not follow the rules, Federal rules. There were no hearings held in \nthe Senate. We never debated it. If, however, as the Pentagon claims, \nthis was not a change in policy but only a clarification of existing \npolicy, then the taxpayers of this country ought to have to pay for \nevery merger and acquisition going all the way back, and so the ones \nthat were denied in the past will now come back to haunt us because \nthey will come back and say, by your own words, this was existing \npolicy.\n\n  That is why even the $2 billion we are looking at that is pending now \nis going to mushroom to $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion. Who knows \nwhen it will all end?\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\n  Let me read a little bit from Mr. Korb's article. First of all, from \nhis letter to me dated July 11.\n\n       As I testified in July 1994 before the House Armed Services \n     Committee, and as I have written in Foreign Affairs, the \n     Brookings Review and the Baltimore Sun, I do not believe that \n     such payments are necessary to promote the rational \n     downsizing of defense industry. Moreover, by its policy of \n     subsidizing defense mergers and acquisitions, the Clinton \n     administration has already created mega-companies that will \n     stifle competition and wield tremendous political power.\n       The conditions that the amendment places on paying the \n     subsidy will ensure that Federal money will not go towards \n     mergers that would have occurred without the subsidy or \n     before the policy change. In addition, your amendment--\n\n  Talking about my amendment--\n\n       Will guarantee that there will be real savings to the \n     taxpayer and that these savings are documented.\n\n  In the article that he had in the Brookings Review in the summer \nissue, Mr. Korb pointed out how this happened. He said:\n\n       To date, the Pentagon has received 30 requests for \n     reimbursement for restructuring. Lockheed Martin alone \n     expects to receive at least $1 billion to complete its \n     merger.\n       How did it happen? In July 1993, John Deutch, then the \n     undersecretary of defense for acquisition, responded to \n     pressure on his boss, William Perry, from the chief executive \n     officers of Martin Marietta, Lockheed, Loral and Hughes by \n     deciding to allow defense companies to bill the Pentagon for \n     the costs of mergers and acquisitions.\n       According to Deutch . . . the move was not a policy change \n     but a clarification of existing policy.\n       Deutch is wrong . . . This is a major policy change. It is \n     not necessary. And it will not save money.\n\n  Mr. Korb goes on in his article. He says:\n\n       Indeed, during the Bush administration, the Defense \n     Contract Management Agency rejected a request by the Hughes \n     Aircraft Corporation to be reimbursed for $112 million in \n     costs resulting from its acquisition of General Dynamics' \n     missile division.\n       But on July 21, 1993, Deutch wrote a memorandum stating \n     that restructuring costs are indeed allowable and thus \n     reimbursable under Federal procurement law.\n       Deutch's position that he was merely clarifying rather than \n     making policy is not supported by anyone, even those who \n     favor the change. The procurement experts in his own \n     department disagreed vehemently. On June 17, 1993, the career \n     professionals at DCMA told him that the history of the FAR \n     argues against making the nonrecurring organization costs \n     associated with restructuring costs allowable and noted that \n     they had disallowed these costs in the past.\n       The DCMA position was also supported by Don Yockey, the \n     undersecretary of defense for acquisition in the Bush \n     administration, the Aerospace Industries Association, the \n     American Bar Association's Section on Public Contract Law, \n     and the American Law Division of the Congressional Research \n     Service. * * *\n\n  In Luckey's opinion, Deutch's position is based on semantics, not \nlegality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the cover letter to this \nSenator and the article that appeared in the Brookings Review, summer \n1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter and article were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Brookings Institution,\n\n\n                           Center for Public Policy Education,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: As you requested, I am writing to give \n     you my opinion on your amendment to S. 1894, that would \n     prohibit the secretary of defense from paying the \n     restructuring costs resulting from a merger or acquisition in \n     the defense industry after July 11, 1996, and permits the \n     Federal government to recoup funds from those companies that \n     merged prior to this date if the net federal benefit does not \n     exceed the amount paid to the companies.\n       As I testified in July 1994 before the House Armed Services \n     Committee, and as I have written in Foreign Affairs, the \n     Brookings Review, and the Baltimore Sun, I do not believe \n     that such payments are necessary to promote the rational \n     downsizing of defense industry. Moreover, by its policy of \n     subsidizing defense mergers and acquisitions, the Clinton \n     administration has already created mega-companies that will \n     stifle competition and wield tremendous political power.\n       The conditions that the amendment places on paying the \n     subsidy will ensure that federal money will not go toward \n     mergers that would have occurred without the subsidy or \n     before the policy change. In addition, your amendment will \n     guarantee that there will be real savings to the taxpayer and \n     that these savings are documented.\n       I appreciate your asking for my opinion on this matter and \n     would be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lawrence J. Korb,\n                                                         Director.\n\n                [From the Brookings Review, Summer 1996]\n\n                              Merger Mania\n\n                         (By Lawrence J. Korb)\n\n       McDonnell Douglas, Martin Marietta, Ling-Temco-Vaught \n     (LTV). As the telltale compound names signal, mergers and \n     acquisitions have long been a staple of the U.S. defense \n     industry. But since the Clinton administration took office in \n     1992, the number of mergers has increased dramatically.\n       In 1991, military mergers were valued at some $300 million. \n     by 1993, the value had climbed to $14.2 billion. It will top \n     $20 billion in 1996. In 1993 Martin Marietta purchased \n     General Electric's defense division and General Dynamics' \n     space division. At about the same time Lockheed purchased \n     General Dynamics' aircraft division, while Loral purchased \n     LTV, Ford Aerospace, and Unisys. Then in 1994 Lockheed merged \n     with Martin to become Lockheed Martin, and a year later \n     Lockheed Martin purchased Loral to produce a $30 billion \n     giant known as Lockheed Martin Loral, which now controls 40 \n     percent of the Pentagon's procurement budget.\n       During this same period. Northrop outbid Martin for the \n     Grumman aircraft company, and the new company in turn bought \n     the defense division of Westinghouse. On a somewhat smaller \n     scale, Hughes bought General Dynamics' missile division and \n     Raytheon purchased E-Systems. Among the true defense giants, \n     only McDonnel Douglas has not yet made a major purchase.\n       Spokesmen for the defense industry cite two reasons for \n     this sudden rush of mergers. First, merger mania is sweeping \n     U.S. industry generally. Second, with the end of the Cold \n     War, defense spending has fallen so dramatically that excess \n     capacity in the defense industry can be eliminated only \n     through consolidation. As Norman Augustine of Lockheed Martin \n     has observed, for the defense industry this is 1929.\n       Superficially these reasons seem quite plausible. Merger \n     mania has certainly hit many areas of American industry, such \n     as banking and communications. In 1992 Chemical Bank merged \n     with Manufacturers Hanover, and in 1995 they combined with \n     Chase Manhattan to form a single company. In the past year, \n     Time, which had merged with Warner Communications in 1990, \n     purchased Turner Broadcasting; Capital Cities/ABC merged with \n     Pacific Telesis; and Bell Atlantic merged with NYNEX.\n       And defense spending has indeed fallen since the end of the \n     Cold War. In current dollars, projected defense spending for \n     fiscal year 1997 is about 40 percent below that of a decade \n     ago, and procurement spending is about one-third what it was \n     at its peak in the 1980s.\n       But what industry spokesmen fail to note is that the \n     decline in defense expenditures has been greatly exaggerated \n     and that, unlike the private-sector restructuring, the \n     government is subsidizing defense mergers.\n       Remember the $600 toilet seats and the $500 hammers that \n     had taxpayers up in arms during the mid-1980s? Today's \n     subsidized mergers are going to make them look like bargains. \n     The outrageously priced toilet seats and hammers were the \n     result of defense companies taking advantage of a loophole in \n     acquisition regulations. This time, the taxpayers are being \n     fleeced at the hands of the Pentagon's civilian leadership, \n     whose secret reinterpretation of the regulations has rained \n     hundreds of millions of dollars upon the defense industry. To \n     date the Pentagon has received 30 requests for reimbursements \n     for restructuring. Lockheed Martin along expects to receive \n     at least $1 billion to complete its merger.\n\n\n                           how did it happen?\n\n       In July 1993, John M. Deutch, then the undersecretary of \n     defense for acquisition, responded to pressure on his boss, \n     William Perry, from the chief executive officers of Martin \n     Marietta, Lockheed, Loral, and Hughes by deciding to allow \n     defense companies to bill the Pentagon for the costs of \n     mergers and acquisitions. According to Deutch, who has since \n     been promoted to deputy secretary of defense and then to \n     director of Central Intelligence, the move was not a policy \n     change but a clarification of existing policy. In Deutch's \n     view, not only was the clarification necessary to promote the \n     rational downsizing of the defense industry, it would also \n     save taxpayers billions in the long run.\n       Deutch is wrong on all three counts. This is a major policy \n     change. It is not necessary. And it will not save money.\n       A commonsense reading of the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulations (FAR) would lead a reasonable person to conclude \n     that organization costs are not allowable. The regulations \n     state that since the government is not concerned with the \n     form of the contractor's organization, such expenditures are \n     not necessary for or allowable to government contracts. \n     Indeed, during the Bush administration, the Defense Contract \n     Management Agency (DCMA) rejected a request by the Hughes \n     Aircraft Corporation to be reimbursed for $112 million in \n     costs resulting from its acquisition of General Dynamics' \n     missile division. As far back as the Nixon administration, \n     during the post-Vietnam drawdown of defense spending, which \n     was as severe as the current drawdown, the Defense Department \n     rejected a similar request from General Dynamics.\n       But on July 21, 1993, Deutch wrote a memorandum stating \n     that restructuring costs are\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\n     indeed allowable and thus reimbursable under federal \n     procurement law. Because Deutch regarded the memo as merely a \n     clarification of existing policy, he saw no need for a public \n     announcement. Indeed, he did not discuss his \n     ``clarification'' with the military services or Congress or \n     even inform them of it. Congress found out about it \n     accidentally nine months after the memo was written when \n     Martin Marietta tried to recoup from the Pentagon about $60 \n     million of the $208 million it paid for General Dynamics' \n     space division. A somewhat astonished Senator Sam Nunn (D-\n     GA), then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \n     remarked, ``Why pay Martin Marietta [60] million?''\n       Deutch's position that he was merely clarifying rather than \n     making policy is not supported by anyone, even those who \n     favor the change. The procurement experts in his own \n     department disagreed vehemently. On June 17, 1993, the career \n     professionals at DCMA told him that the history of the FAR \n     argues against making the nonrecurring organization costs \n     associated with restructuring costs allowable and noted that \n     they had disallowed these costs in the past.\n       The DCMA position was also supported by Don Yockey, the \n     undersecretary of defense for acquisition in the Bush \n     administration; the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), \n     the trade association for aerospace companies; the American \n     Bar Association's Section on Public Contract Law; and the \n     American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service.\n       Yockey, who was Deutch's immediate predecessor as \n     procurement czar and who is both a retired military officer \n     and former defense industry executive, argued in a July 13, \n     1994, letter to the professional staff of the House Armed \n     Services Committee that by definition, structure means \n     organization, and that the FAR does not allow the \n     reimbursement of organization costs. Indeed, it was Yockey \n     himself who told DCMA to reject Hughes' request for \n     reimbursement for its purchase of General Dynamics' \n     missile division.\n       In a September 28, 1993, letter to Eleanor Spector, the \n     director of defense procurement, Leroy Haugh, vice president \n     of procurement and finance of AIA, stated that the Deutch \n     memo constituted a significant policy decision and an \n     important policy change. Therefore, Haugh asked Spector to \n     promptly publish notice of this policy change in the Federal \n     Register and to consider amending the regulations. In a May \n     3, 1994, letter to Deutch, Donald J. Kinlin, the chair of the \n     ABA Section on Public Contract Law, urged Deutch to modify \n     the FAR since at that time it did not reflect the changes \n     made in Deutch's July 1993 memorandum. What is significant \n     about the AIA and ABA positions is that both groups support \n     Deutch's change.\n       Finally in a June 8, 1994, memorandum John R. Luckey, \n     legislative attorney for the Congressional Research Service, \n     stated that while formal amendment of the FAR could make \n     restructuring costs allowable, the argument that they are \n     allowable under the current regulations appears to contradict \n     their plain meaning. In Luckey's opinion, Deutch's position \n     is based on semantics, not legality.\n       In short, the political leadership of the Clinton defense \n     department made a significant policy change that as a minimum \n     should have been published in the Federal Register and, as \n     Secretary Perry later admitted, cleared in advance with \n     Congress.\n\n\n                       The Substance of the Issue\n\n       This end run around the administrative and legislative \n     processes by the Pentagon is unprecedented, but even more \n     important is whether the Defense Department and the Taxpayers \n     should be giving the defense industry a windfall by allowing \n     a write-off of substantial parts of restructuring costs. For \n     four reasons, the answer to that question should be an \n     emphatic ``No.''\n       First, like Mark Twain's death, the decline of the defense \n     industry in this country has been greatly exaggerated. As \n     Pentagon and industry officials endlessly point out, defense \n     spending in general, and procurement spending in particular, \n     have declined over the past decade. They note that between \n     fiscal year 1985 and fiscal year 1995, the defense budget \n     declined 30 percent in real terms and procurement spending \n     fell 60 percent. But that comparison ignores the fact that \n     between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1985, the defense \n     budget grew 55 percent and the procurement budget grew a \n     whopping 116 percent. Defense spending in real terms is still \n     at about its Cold War average, and the defense budget for \n     fiscal year 1996 was higher than it was for fiscal year 1980. \n     In inflation-adjusted dollars, Bill Clinton spent about $30 \n     billion more on defense in 1995 than Richard Nixon did in \n     1975 to confront Soviet Communist expansionism. Using fiscal \n     year 1985, the height of the Reagan buildup, as a base year \n     distorts the picture. It would be like comparing spending in \n     the Korean and Vietnam wars to the level of World War II and \n     concluding we did not spend enough in Korea and Vietnam. \n     Moreover, procurement spending will rise 40 percent over the \n     next five years, and the pentagon is now soliciting bids for \n     the $750 billion joint strike fighter program.\n       Similarly, while defense employment has fallen 25 percent \n     over the past eight years, it grew 30 percent in the five \n     years before that. More people work in the defense sector now \n     than at any time in the decade of the 1970s. Moreover, much \n     of the decline in the defense industry is attributable to the \n     reengineering or slimming down that is sweeping all American \n     industries, even those with an increasing customer base.\n       Finally, if one adds the $266 billion worth of U.S. arms \n     sold around the world since 1990 (a scandal in itself) to the \n     $300 billion in purchases by the Defense Department, American \n     defense industry sales are still at historic highs. Defense \n     is still a profitable business--which explains why defense \n     stocks are still quite high despite the jeremiads of industry \n     spokesmen. Over the past year Lockheed Martin stock has \n     increased 48 percent in value. Northrop Grumman is up 50 \n     percent and McDonnell Douglas a whopping 80 percent.\n       Second, taxpayer subsidization is no more necessary today \n     to promote acquisitions and mergers than it has ever been. \n     Just about every major defense company today is the product \n     of a merger, some of them decades old. For example, General \n     Dynamics acquired Chrysler's tank division in the early \n     1980s, and McDonnell acquired the Douglas Aircraft Company in \n     the late 1960s. Even today in the supposed ``bull market,'' \n     plenty of bidders vie for the available companies. Three \n     years ago, several companies engaged in a fierce bidding war \n     for LTV. And Northrop outbid Martin Marietta for Grumman. It \n     is hard to believe that if taxpayer subsidies were not \n     available, companies would not buy available assets if it \n     made good business sense. If they paid a little less for \n     their acquisitions, the taxpayers rather than the \n     stockholders would benefit. In the bidding war for Grumman, \n     both Martin and Northrop offered significantly more than \n     market value, thus giving Grumman's shareholders a financial \n     bonanza of $22 a share (a bonus of nearly 40 percent). \n     Raytheon paid a similar premium to acquire E-Systems in April \n     1995. Should the government allow Northrop's and Raytheon's \n     stockholders to reap a similar bonanza by subsidizing those \n     sales?\n       Over the past five years, William Anders, the former CEO of \n     General Dynamics, made himself and his stockholders a fortune \n     by selling parts of his company to Hughes, Martin, and \n     Lockheed. Since 1991 General Dynamics' stock increased 550 \n     percent and the company has stashed away $1 billion. Should \n     we also help the stockholders and executives of the buying \n     companies? Did defense companies offer the taxpayers a rebate \n     during the boom years of the 1980s when their profits reached \n     unprecedented levels?\n       Third, the Defense Department has no business encouraging \n     or shaping the restructuring of defense industry, or as \n     Deutch puts it, ``promoting the rational downsizing of the \n     defense industry.'' Who is to determine what is rational? A \n     government bureaucrat or the market? While government \n     shouldn't discourage restructuring, it should stay at arm's \n     length. If the deal does not make good business sense, the \n     company will not proceed, As Martin did not when the price \n     for Grumman became too high. Moreover, might not these \n     mergers create megacompanies that will reduce competition and \n     may be very difficult for the political system to control? \n     The Lockheed Martin Loral giants, for example, is larger than \n     the Marine Corps. With facilities in nearly every state and \n     200,000 people on its payroll, its political clout is \n     enormous. And it presents problems over and above its sheer \n     size. For example, Loral sells high-tech components to \n     McDonnell Douglas for its plane, which is competing with \n     Lockheed Martin for the $750 billion joint strike fighter \n     program. How can Loral be a partner in promoting the McDonnel \n     Douglas plane against the Lockheed Martin entry?\n       Fourth, past history indicates that these mergers end up \n     costing rather than saving the government money. Both the \n     General Accounting Office and the Department of Defense \n     Inspector General have found no evidence to support \n     contentions by Deutch and defense industry officials that \n     previous mergers had saved the government money. Indeed, on \n     May 24, 1994, the Inspector General found that the claim of \n     Hughes Aircraft that its 1992 purchase of General Dynamics' \n     missile division saved the Pentagon $600 million was \n     unverifiable. Moreover, under the Deutch clarification, \n     contractors can be reimbursed now for savings that are only \n     projected to occur in the distant future. And if these \n     savings do not occur as projected, how will the Pentagon get \n     its (our) money back?\n\n\n                    bring back the merger watchdogs\n\n       Mergers always have been and always will be a feature of \n     the U.S. defense industry. And the government has a role in \n     those mergers. But that role--as exemplified by the \n     successful 1992 Bush administration challenge of Alliant \n     Techsystem's proposed acquisition of Olin Corporation's \n     ammunition division--is to ensure that they preserve \n     sufficient competition to enable the Pentagon to get the best \n     price for the taxpayer. It is definitely not to increase \n     company profits and limit competition by subsidizing the \n     merger. Not only should the Defense Department abolish the \n     new merger subsidy, it should follow the lead of its \n     predecessors and scrutinize the anticompetitive aspects of \n     all future mergers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So this practice is clearly an abuse of taxpayers' money. \nIf these companies are compelled to merge for business reasons, why do \nthey need a handout from the taxpayer? If the business deals are good, \nthe mergers will happen anyway and the taxpayers will receive any \nsavings without paying anything out. If the deals are bad, then we \nshould not gamble taxpayer funds on them.\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\n  You would think we would have learned from the savings and loan \ndebacle. You would think we would have learned from the $600 toilet \nseats and $500 hammers, too. I just do not think it is right to make \ntaxpayers absorb the business costs of an industry capable of paying \nits own merger expenses.\n  Mr. Korb points out defense is still a profitable business. Over the \npast year, Lockheed Martin stock increased 48 percent in value, \nNorthrop Grumman is up 50 percent, McDonnell Douglas, a whopping 80 \npercent.\n  Anyway, right now we have a situation where we give an up-front \npayment, hopefully for some savings that come down the line. But we do \nnot know whether those savings are going to accrue. One analysis we \nhave shows that only about 15 percent of the savings actually accrued. \nHere is what other groups have to say on the subject.\n  The Cato Institute: ``The costs associated with mergers should not be \nabsorbed by federal taxpayers. This is an egregious example of \nunwarranted corporate welfare in our budget.''\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense: ``It is time for the Pentagon to drop \nthis ridiculous `Money for nothing' policy.''\n  The Project on Government Oversight: ``The new policy is unneeded, \nestablishes inappropriate government intervention in the economy, \npromotes layoffs of high-wage jobs, pays for excessive CEO salaries, \nand is likely to cost the government billions of dollars.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent these letters from Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense and the Project on Government Oversight be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common $ense,\n\n                                                    July 15, 1996.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Taxpayers for Common $ense supports \n     your amendments to the Defense Appropriations Bill that would \n     place a moratorium on payments by the Department of Defense \n     to defense contractors for restructuring costs associated \n     with corporate mergers. Your amendment would also require \n     proof for the taxpayers, in the form of a report to Congress, \n     that there is a net savings when defense contractors merge. \n     As you know, a similar amendment recently passed the House \n     during consideration of the Defense Appropriations.\n       Under existing policy, the Pentagon can spend appropriated \n     funds to reimburse defense contractors for expenses related \n     to corporate mergers. Proponents will argue that in the end \n     these mergers could save U.S. taxpayers money. However, the \n     recent merger of the Lockheed company and Martin Marietta for \n     form Lockheed-Martin provides disturbing evidence of the cost \n     to the taxpayer. Lockheed-Martin may be eligible for up to \n     $1.6 billion in reimbursements. Until there is proof that \n     mergers by defense contractors save taxpayer money, we should \n     no longer be blindly handing out ``several billions of \n     dollars'' as estimated by GAO (GAO/T-NSIAD-94-247).\n       Taxpayers for Common $ense believes no tax dollars should \n     be spent subsidizing a business cost of a mature industry. We \n     support your amendment as a step in the right direction \n     toward common sense spending by the Pentagon and urge all \n     members of the Senate to support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jill Lancelot,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Project on Government Oversight,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1996.\n     Attn: Kevin Aylesworth.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Project on Government Oversight \n     strongly endorses the Harkin Amendment to the Fiscal Year \n     1997 Defense Appropriations bill, S. 1894, to ban payments to \n     defense corporations for post-merger ``restructuring'' costs, \n     and to improve assurances that past agreements on mergers do \n     in fact lead to actual savings for the public treasury.\n       The government should not be in the business of promoting \n     and subsidizing defense mergers, which are already happening \n     at a record pace. The defense industry is already dangerously \n     concentrated--the newly-formed Lockheed Martin Loral accounts \n     for an astounding 40% of the defense procurement budget. The \n     subsidy payments thrust the government inappropriately into \n     free market decision making, and will serve to further reduce \n     the economic competition that is the ultimate basis for low-\n     cost production.\n       The payments are also exacerbating two highly disturbing \n     trends in U.S. industry--widespread layoffs in high-wage \n     jobs, and the parallel explosion of outrageously high CEO \n     salaries. By subsidizing the costs of restructuring, which \n     usually means laying off tens of thousands of workers, and \n     reimbursing corporations for lavish executive salaries, this \n     unfortunate policy accelerates rather than restrains these \n     trends.\n       The defense industry continues to be awash in profits, \n     ``pork'' contracts, and federal subsidies. At a time when \n     government resources are severely constrained, this wasteful \n     corporate welfare program subsidizing mergers should be \n     halted immediately.\n       We applaud your efforts to reverse the damage caused by the \n     Defense Department's misguided policy on merger payments, and \n     appreciate the leadership you have shown in exposing and \n     correcting this waste, which will otherwise end up costing \n     the government billions of dollars.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Danielle Brian,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 12 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to address some issues that may be bothering \nsome of my colleagues. I know some representatives of defense \ncontractors have visited with my colleagues. They have told them my \namendment will hurt workers because the companies are relying on the \ntaxpayer money to help them. This is completely and totally untrue.\n  According to the rules of this subsidy, DOD cannot reimburse \ncompanies for helping fired workers unless the companies were already \nobligated to do that. Understand, under the subsidy rules, Government \nmoney cannot go to a company to help fired workers unless the companies \nwere already obligated to do that under existing contracts with the \nworkers. In other words, the taxpayers' subsidies will never reach the \nlaid-off workers.\n  Mr. President, if you do not believe me, let me read a letter from \nJames Carroll, directing business representative of the International \nAssociation of Machinists, Lodge 709, Marietta, GA. He says:\n\n       I am the Directing Business Representative and President of \n     . . . Local Lodge 709, based in Marietta, Georgia. Our Local \n     represents workers at Lockheed Martin's assembly plant. Over \n     the past five years, many thousands of our members have been \n     laid off because of these cutbacks in defense and cost \n     cutting measures by Lockheed Martin. Contrary to the facts of \n     an increasing stock value and skyrocketing executive \n     compensation, our members did not receive any compensation or \n     retraining assistance from the Lockheed Martin Corporation.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that, under the present \nsubsidy arrangement, these workers will not get any Government money \nregardless of what representatives of the defense industry may have \ntold my colleagues. ``Our Members did not receive any compensation from \nLockheed Martin Corporation.''\n  If they did not under the company's agreement, they will not get any \nfrom the Government. They will only get the money from the Government \nif the company already helped them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from James Carroll \nof the International Association of Machinists be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Aeronautical Machinists\n\n\n                                Lodge No. 709, IAMAW--AFL-CIO,\n\n                                      Marietta, GA, June 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Bernie Sanders,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Sanders: Following up on the letter sent by our \n     International President George Kourpias on May 15, I would \n     like to bring to your attention the urgent need of defense \n     industry workers who have been and continue to be displaced \n     during this time of reduced defense spending and cost cutting \n     by America's private defense companies.\n       I am the Directing Business Representative and President of \n     the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers Local Lodge 709 based in Marietta, Georgia. Our Local \n     represents workers at Lockheed Martin's assembly plant. Over \n     the past five years, many thousands of our members have been \n     laid off because of these cutbacks in defense and cost \n     cutting measures by Lockheed Martin. Contrary to the facts of \n     an increasing stock value and skyrocketing executive \n     compensation, our members did not receive any compensation or \n     retraining assistance from the Lockheed Martin Corporation. \n     In fact, during this last round of negotiations which \n     concluded only two months ago, we proposed several innovative \n     ideas to Lockheed Martin which would provide for retraining \n     assistance to displaced aerospace workers. However, we were \n     unable to reach agreement on any of these innovative ideas.\n       We certainly hope that you are successful in your attempts \n     to bring some fairness and\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\n     equity to these workers and workers in the future who have \n     dedicated years of service to building America's defense \n     products.\n           With best regards,\n\n                                             James M.

Some colleagues have said the contractors are going to \nsue the Government for breach of contract. I do not know what they are \ntalking about. If a company has a contract with the DOD that specifies \nthat payment must be made from fiscal year 1997 funds, it will be paid \nunder my amendment. If there is no such clause in the contracts, then \nthey will not be paid from 1997 funds. There is no breach of contract \nhere. What my amendment is, is simply a 1-year moratorium on payments \nwe are not obligated to pay in 1997.\n  I know there was an amendment adopted earlier today of Mr. Bradley. \nIt called for a study. That amendment makes the best case for my \namendment. It is a clear recognition we do not know how to assure that \nany payments for merger claims are purely waste. What my amendment does \nis it says we are going to have a moratorium for 1 year. If you had in \nyour contract you would be paid out of fiscal year 1997 funds, you will \nbe paid. If there is no such existing agreement, then there is a 1-year \nmoratorium until we can get the study done that I call for.\n  I might add, that is a study done by GAO in concert with OMB and the \ninspector general, not some internal study done by the Department of \nDefense. So we can get the study back early next year, we can take a \nlook at it and we can address this a year from now.\n  But mind you, if we do not put in a 1-year moratorium, you mark my \nwords, they are going to rush in and they are going to sign these \nthings in the next few months and they are going to lock it in. Then \nthe arguments will be true that if we attempt to stop it, they will sue \nfor breach of contract. Now is the time to put the 1-year moratorium \non. Now is the time to stop this nonsense.\n  I know, I remember when the $600 toilet seats and $500 hammers came \nup, people scoffed. The people of this country understood it. The \ntaxpayers of this country understand this, too. They understand it is \nnot right for them to pay compensation for executives, board members \ngetting $200,000-and-some a year bonuses when they merge, and the \nworkers being fired and not getting any retraining or compensation \nwhatsoever. This money will not help the workers one bit.\n  It is egregious. I cannot think of anything in my 22 years here in \nthe Congress that I have seen to be this egregious. All I can say is \nthose in the defense industry--and not all of them --but those who have \npropounded this, those who came to Secretary Perry and Under Secretary \nDeutch and got this changed, all I can say is: Don't you have any shame \nat all? None whatsoever? It is time to end this practice.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Alaska \nis recognized. The Senator has 15 minutes. The Senator from Iowa has 6 \nminutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have faced a dilemma. As we have \nreduced defense procurement by more than 60 percent in the last 10 \nyears, that has led to significant overcapacity in the defense \nindustry. But at the same time, we have had the difficulty of trying to \nensure the preservation of an industrial base capable of maintaining \nthe strongest military power in the world. Now, without restructuring \nthis industry, that overcapacity would have led to higher overhead \ncosts that would have increased the price of defense goods and services \nand continued the downward spiral, really, of the amount actually \navailable for acquisition of systems that we need to assure our men and \nwomen of the armed services that they have the best in the world to be \nprepared to defend us with.\n  Restructuring of this defense industry, in my judgment, has reduced \nthe unit prices. We have lower unit prices, and we now have long-term \nsavings for the Department of Defense and the taxpayers as a result of \nthe restructuring. Our committee has urged and fostered that \nrestructuring.\n  A contractor must negotiate restructuring costs with the Department. \nNot all costs of restructuring are paid by the Department. The \nDepartment of Defense policy that has been laid down by the Congress \nand the Department is such that if the restructuring plan, and its \nallowable costs, do not save the taxpayers money, the Department of \nDefense will not agree to pay any of the restructuring costs.\n  In the past 3 years, the Department of Defense has reimbursed \ncontractors $300 million in these restructuring costs, and we estimate \nthat will save $1.4 billion in defense costs. That is a 450 percent \nreturn on the contribution of the Department of Defense to the \nrestructuring plans.\n  I might add that if there are plans that are approved, restructuring \ncosts that benefit employees would not be allowed if the amendment of \nthe Senator from Iowa is adopted. It would not allow severance pay for \nemployees. It would not allow early retirement incentive payments for \nemployees. It would not allow employee retraining costs. It would not \nallow relocation expenses for retained employees, and many times they \nare moved to different locations. I know several significant examples \nof very long movements for those who have retained. Those clearly ought \nto be a cost to be repaid by the Department when it results in a lower \ncost to the Government.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa would not allow the repayment \nof outplacement services for employees helping them find new jobs. \nAbove all, it would not allow continued medical, dental, life insurance \ncoverage for terminated employees for the period of time involved.\n  We believe the amendment of the Senator from Iowa goes in the wrong \ndirection. We have adopted now by consent the Bradley amendment, which \nthe Senator from Iowa mentioned. It does require the comptroller \ngeneral to give us a study by early next year--I believe it is by April \n1--on the analysis of these restructuring costs.\n  Under current procedure, the costs that are not allowed are \nincorporation fees of the new entity, the merged entity; attorney, \naccountant, broker, promoter, organizer, management consultant, \ninvestment banker, or investment counselor fees cannot be paid, and \nthose are the substantial costs of restructuring; interests or other \ncosts of borrowing to finance an acquisition or merger are not \nrecoverable from the Department of Defense; any payment to employees of \nspecial compensation in excess of the contractor's normal severance pay \npractice are not recoverable; any payment to employees of special \ncompensation which is contingent upon the employee remaining with the \ncontractor for a specified period of time following a change in \nmanagement control are not payable by the Department of Defense; and \nany cost deemed unreasonable or excessive by the Department are not \nrepayable.\n  Mr. President, as I said, in my judgment, we face a very difficult \ntask. We look forward to the report that we will get from the Bradley \namendment. But in other areas, we are actually paying money to maintain \nindustrial base. We had the President, contrary to my judgment, decided \nto buy the Seawolf. Why? Because we had to maintain the industrial base \nto build submarines. We have had other instances where we actually paid \nindustries to keep going in order to maintain the industrial base for \nthe future.\n\n  The restructuring process brings together and merges industrial parts \nso that the successor entity is capable of producing for the Government \nat a lower cost under the circumstances that we are buying smaller \namounts and we are buying different types of equipment.\n  I really do believe restructuring is in the best interest of the \ntaxpayers of this country. I look forward to the study, but I oppose \nthe Senator's amendment. This is not a question of a hammer or toilet \nseat or coffee pot. This is a question of maintaining the industrial \nbase of the United States so that we can continue to be the leader of \nthe world.\n  We are exporting, as we said this morning, some 14 billion dollars' \nworth of industrial products that are made by these industries. They \nare sold overseas. The fact that they are constructed by these \nindustries and produced by these industries and sold overseas yields us \na lower unit price for the taxpayers of this country to allow\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\nus to continue to replace, I do not care what it is, tanks or ships or \naircraft. We need to maintain those to maintain the defense of this \nisland Nation.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, with all good will to him and what he \nis trying to do, it is wrong to put this concept of restructuring costs \nin the same category as those fees which we all condemned which were \nwasteful. These are not wasteful costs, Mr. President. They are the \ncosts of downsizing the production units that we built up during the \ncold war in order to maintain our freedom. Now we are downsizing those \nunits so that we can continue to be able to defend our freedom in the \nfuture.\n  I spent a lot of my personal time going over some of these plans to \ntry to assure that they are, in fact, in the public interest. We have \nhad conversations with the Department of Justice on them and with other \nentities, industry and Government, to make sure it is on the right \ncourse, because of the fact that we know there are going to be \nincreased costs down the line in the future because we are, in fact, \ngoing to acquire fewer units for our own use. Our policy should be to \nassure the survival of an industrial base that is capable of meeting \ndemands throughout the world in order that we, too, may continue to \nhave the advantage of prices based upon substantial production and not \nthe limited production to meet our own needs.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii have any comments? I yield the remainder \nof my time to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is always very difficult to speak in \nopposition to my friend, Senator Harkin, but I am certain all of us \nwill agree that corporate restructuring and corporate mergers are part \nof the daily business world. It is not the exception, it is the rule.\n  These mergers are carried out for a very simple reason, and that is \nto reduce the cost of operations. In recognition of this, the \nDepartment of Defense has adopted a policy that not only allows but \nencourages defense contractors to enter into restructuring or corporate \nmergers in order to save money for our Department and, in turn, save \nmoney for our taxpayers.\n  These costs, Mr. President, have to be certified by auditors of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  And these auditors will have to determine that the cost to be offset \nmust be lower than the savings accrued to the Government through \nefficiencies.\n  As a result, having encouraged industry to consolidate and to have \nlower costs, obviously industry responded. Based upon that \nanticipation, many companies have entered into restructuring. This \namendment, though it may appear to be meritorious, would not allow \ndefense contractors to charge the restructuring costs as legitimate \noverhead costs on DOD contracts.\n  I believe logic will lead us to conclude that if industry cannot \nconsolidate, if industry cannot merge, if it cannot restructure, it \nwill not become more efficient and thereby lower overall costs. This \nwill simply mean that the taxpayers of the United States will have to \npay additional sums to support an inefficient industrial base.\n  So, Mr. President, I concur with the current policy of the Department \nof Defense that encourages contractors to restructure and merge, and \nthat this amendment would be contrary to that policy. So I join my \nchairman in opposing the Harkin amendment. I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized. The \nSenator has 6 minutes, 43 seconds. The Senator from Alaska has 2 \nminutes, 22 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened to my two good friends--and \nthey are just that--responding to my remarks. I am wondering if they \nare talking about my amendment. My friend from Hawaii says that this \namendment would not allow them to restructure and reorganize. There is \nnothing in my amendment that says that, not one thing in my amendment, \nI say to my friend from Hawaii.\n  My amendment simply says, No. 1, we get a report by next spring, the \ninspector general and OMB and GAO to submit a report to set out just \nwhat is happening here and what kind of savings.\n  It says then that no funds appropriated in this bill can be used this \nyear. This is this year's bill, fiscal year 1997. No funds in this bill \ncan be used to pay for a merger acquisition unless it has already been \ncontracted to do so. So if there is an existing contract right now, \nthat specifies that we are to pay merger and acquisition costs out of \nthis bill. That is OK.\n  What we say in this amendment is that we are going to put a 1-year \nmoratorium on signing any new ones, just signing any new ones. As I \nsaid, Mr. President, mark my word, if we do not adopt this amendment, \nin the next few months you will have a rush by these companies to sign \nthem, lock themselves in, and then they will raise the specter of, uh-\noh, it is a breach of a Government contract if you do not ante up and \npay it. That is why we need the 1-year moratorium. That is all it is.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, my amendment does not say that we \ncannot pay all of these attendant costs that he mentioned. He mentioned \nhousing costs. He mentioned all these kinds of things, severance pay, \nretraining, relocation.\n  He said my amendment would not allow for that. My amendment does not \nmention that. My amendment says a 1-year moratorium. That is all, a 1-\nyear moratorium. But if they have gotten contracts that say they should \nbe paid this year, they will be paid.\n  Further, I again reply to my friend from Alaska with the letter from \nthe head of the Machinists Union at Martin Marietta, who said that over \nthe last 5 years members have been laid off because of cutbacks. ``* * \n* our members did not receive any compensation or retraining assistance \nfrom the Lockheed Martin Corporation.''\n\n  The way the subsidy is now structured, I say to my friends, under the \nDepartment of Defense, they still will not get anything. They will only \nget it if, in fact, there was an agreement by those companies to \nprovide it in the first place. So, again, I hope that they would look \nat my amendment and read it for what it is.\n  Let me just say one other thing. We talked about two other things. \nThe industrial base--we have heard about, well, we are going to erode \nthe industrial base. I say to my friend from Alaska, profits are at an \nall-time high in the defense industry. I do not think we have to worry \nabout eroding the industrial base of this country.\n  Again, I refer to the article by Lawrence Korb that appeared in the \nBrookings review where he pointed out that they are making record \nprofits, that Grumman shareholders got a bonanza of $22 a share, a \nbonus of 40 percent when they merged. Since 1991, General Dynamics' \nstock increased 550 percent, and the company has stashed away $1 \nbillion. We are not eroding the industrial base of this country. If it \nis good business practice, they are going to merge.\n  That brings me to my final point, I say to my two good friends. We \nasked representatives of the defense industry, I say to my friend from \nHawaii, we asked them--you know, these industries do not just deal with \nthe Government. They have private industries that they deal with and \nthat they contract with. We asked them, in any of your contracts with \nthe private sector, do you have a clause like this in your contract \nthat they will help pay? Not a one. Not a one. Just for the Government. \nSo I say to my friends, this is not an overburdensome amendment.\n  I know the first amendment I offered--maybe the managers of the bill \nthink this is the first amendment I offered back under the \nauthorization bill. It is not. I recognized that there might be a \nproblem with breach of contract. That is why we put a clause in there \nthat said if they have an existing contract, that they are to be paid \nthose out of this bill--we are only talking about fiscal year 1997--\nthey must be paid. I am only talking about those who did not have that \nkind of an agreement. Then there is a 1-year moratorium. We get the \nreport back. We find out what we are talking about. That gives us some \ntime.\n  I say to my friends from Alaska and Hawaii, please do not put us in a \nposition where, over the next several months, companies will come in, \nlock in their contracts, and there is not a darn thing we will be able \nto do about\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\nit because then it will be a breach of a Government contract. Let us \nstop it right now, put a moratorium for 1 year, get the report, and \nthen figure out what we want to do. Let us figure out--maybe the \ndefense authorizing committee or the Appropriations Committee might \nwant to spell out in more detail what it is that will be reimbursable, \nwhat is the period of time that we will take into account, and should \nwe have a recoupment clause.\n  Mr. President, what if they project all these savings, the taxpayers \nrush in, give them hundreds of millions of dollars for mergers and \nacquisitions, and then the savings are not realized? What do we do? \nNothing. Perhaps we need a policy of recoupment that if, in fact, those \nsavings are not realized over, say, 5 years, that we should have a \npolicy of recoupment so that we can recoup back to the taxpayers the \nmoney that was spent out if, indeed, the savings do not accrue.\n\n  So I think it is a logical and a reasonable amendment with just a 1-\nyear moratorium. I think the facts are on our side. I think the people \nare on our side on this issue, too. This does not go as far as the \nHouse bill. The House bill was retroactive, and there may be some--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection for an additional 2 \nminutes? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think there may be some problems with that House bill \nin terms of breach of contract, so that is why we took it out of here.\n  I hope the managers will take another look at this amendment and how \nit is written and hopefully be able to support and include it in this \nbill, because I think it will go a long way towards, again, letting \ncompanies restructure, if in the marketplace--if in the marketplace--\nthat is the best thing for them to do. Let it happen. But the \nGovernment should not be an active player in it one way or the other. \nThat is all this amendment seeks to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document by the \nCongressional Research Service, the Library of Congress, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1994.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: The allowability of restructuring costs in Federal \n         procurement.\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request of \n     June 2, 1994, for a legal analysis of the position of the \n     Department of Defense (DOD) stated in the memorandum of July \n     21, 1993 \\1\\* and supported in subsequent DOD documents that \n     restructuring costs are allowable costs and thus reimbursable \n     under Federal procurement law. Specifically you have \n     requested an opinion as to whether this represents a change \n     in policy from that set out in the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulations (FAR) so as to call for amendment of the FAR and \n     the accompanying administrative procedures or is merely a \n     clarification of existing practice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * Footnotes are at the end of the letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The FAR does not use the term restructuring costs. \n     Therefore, while it is quite correct to say, as DOD does, \n     that there are no cases or regulations which make \n     restructuring costs unallowable,\\2\\ it is equally true that \n     there are no cases or regulations which do allow their \n     reimbursement. ``Restructuring cost'' is not a term which has \n     been used in this area, and therefore, it is misleading to \n     draw a conclusion from this lack of mention.\n       DOD would define restructuring costs as: ``Restructuring \n     costs result from changes to a contractor's organization in \n     an effort to address a declining base or to enhance business \n     efficiencies. Restructuring represents events driven by \n     internal change such as downsizing or external changes such \n     as acquisitions, mergers divestitures, etc. This implementing \n     guidance addresses restructuring costs which result from \n     nonroutine nonrecurring, or extraordinary events. \n     Restructuring efforts are expected to result in a current or \n     future economic benefit for the Government.'' \\3\\ These costs \n     would include such costs as ``facilities consolidation, \n     facilities shut down, severance pay, relocation, equipment \n     write-off, and information system conversion.'' \\4\\\n       To find restructuring cost to be allowable, DOD has \n     attempted to distinguish or exempt these costs from two types \n     of costs which the FAR states are unallowable. First, the FAR \n     does not allow reimbursement of organization costs. Part 31 \n     of the FAR states:\n       ``(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this \n     section,\\5\\ expenditures in connection with (1) planning or \n     executing the organization or reorganization of the corporate \n     structure of a business, including mergers and acquisitions, \n     (2) resisting or planning to resist the reorganization of the \n     corporate structure of a business or a change in controlling \n     interest in the ownership of a business, and (3) raising \n     capital (net worth plus long-term liabilities), are \n     unallowable. Such expenditures include but are not limited to \n     incorporation fees and costs of attorneys, accountants, \n     brokers, promoters and organizers, management consultants and \n     investment counselors, whether or not employees of the \n     contractor. Unallowable reorganization costs include the cost \n     of any change in the contractor's financial structure, \n     excluding administrative costs of short term borrowings for \n     working capital, resulting in alterations in the rights and \n     interests of security holders, whether or not additional \n     capital is raised.'' \\6\\\n       The guiding principle behind this regulation appears to be \n     that the Government is not concerned with the form of the \n     contractor's organization and so therefore such expenditures \n     are not necessary for (or allocable to) Government \n     contracts.\\7\\\n       The history of this regulation as set out in the DCAA memo \n     of June 17, 1993 seems to argue against, not for, the use of \n     the non-recurring nature of these costs or the potential \n     savings to the Government as reasons for allowing \n     reimbursement. The memo states that ``the intent of the \n     subject cost principle was to make non-recurring organization \n     costs unallowable'' and quotes the subcommittee responsible \n     for the section as stating: ``The subcommittee does not \n     believe that the allowability of organization and \n     reorganization costs, including merger and acquisition costs, \n     should depend on benefits. . . . the benefits to the \n     government are normally too remote to form a valid basis for \n     the allowability of costs.'' \\8\\\n       DOD has attempted to avoid the unallowability described in \n     Sec. 31.205-27 in two ways. First, it has stated that \n     restructuring costs are not organization costs even though by \n     their own definition restructuring costs are costs resulting \n     from changes in the contractor's organization such as \n     acquisitions mergers and divestitures.\\9\\ This appears to be \n     less a legal argument than a semantic one, i.e. an \n     unallowable cost is allowable because it is given a new name.\n       Second, DOD argues that these costs are not costs of the \n     organization or reorganization event, but rather costs which \n     arise subsequent to the organization or reorganization event, \n     and while they would not have arisen ``but for'' the event, \n     the costs, are not part of that event.\\10\\ This argument \n     might be persuasive especially for some of the restructuring \n     costs more removed from the actual reorganization, merger, or \n     acquisition, but it does appear to severely limit any purpose \n     for the words ``in connection with'' or ``executing the \n     organization or reorganization'' of Sec. 31.205-27.\\11\\\n       The second type of unallowable cost which DOD has tried to \n     distinguish in order to find restructuring costs allowable \n     are those which are unallowable under a novation agreement. A \n     novation agreement is often required in the situation which \n     would give rise to what DOD calls restructuring costs. The \n     Government may, when it is in the best interests of the \n     Government, agree to recognize a successor in interest to a \n     contract (a novation agreement) but the agreement must \n     include the following clause:\n       ``The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the \n     Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of \n     them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or \n     other expenses, or any related increases, directly or \n     indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer of \n     this agreement, other than those that the Government in \n     absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been \n     obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the \n     contracts.\\12\\''\n       DOD appears to have accepted that reimbursement of \n     restructuring costs would be prohibited by this provision of \n     the novation agreement. The solution is provided by the \n     memorandum in the form of an exception to the provision which \n     states:\n       ``The Government recognizes that restructuring by the \n     Transferee incidental to the acquisition/merger may be in the \n     best interests of the Government. Restructuring costs that \n     are allowable under part 31 of the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation \\13\\ may be reimbursed under flexibly-priced \n     novated contracts, provided that the Transferee demonstrates \n     that the restructuring will (1) reduce overall costs to DOD \n     and/or NASA, or (2) preserve a critical capability that might \n     otherwise be lost to DOD.\\14\\''\n       It can be argued that DOD has attempted to alter the policy \n     embodied in these two FAR provisions without going through \n     the administrative formalities and requirements, such as \n     notice and comment periods and notification of Congress, \n     necessary to amend these regulations. While formal amendment \n     of the FAR could make these restructuring costs allowable, \n     the argument that they are allowable under the current \n     regulations appears to contradict their plain meaning.\n                                                   John R. Luckey,\n                                             Legislative Attorney.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ This memorandum was issued by John M.

Mr. President, I yield my time, and I thank the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time. The Senator \nfrom Alaska has 2 minutes, 22 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret the disagreement with the \nSenator from Iowa. It appears to me the process we are following is one \nthat has been worked out by the authorization committees, by the \nAppropriations Committees, and by the administration. It is really a \nnonpartisan area we are dealing with of trying to assure the survival \nof the defense industrial base and maintain that at the lowest possible \ncost to the taxpayers.\n  I do believe they have had some profits and there are profits that \nare coming back, primarily because they are writing off a lot of \nlosses. They are abandoning a lot of buildings, selling buildings at a \nlot less than they paid for them. I expect we will see a period of time \nwhere there is some recouping of losses through tax advantages. That is \nanother subject. I do think that is one of the incentives toward the \nrestructuring, to try and take the losses and take advantage of them \nwhile there is still income from existing contracts.\n  I can reassure the Senate when we are paying 60 percent less than we \nwere 10 years ago for procurement, we are not expanding the industrial \nbase. This restructuring is reducing it. It is downsizing it. I hope we \nwill end up by maintaining what we need.\n  I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote will take place at 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning.\n  Under the previous agreement, further amendments to the bill were to \nbe offered this evening. Are there additional amendments?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe there are still some \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will mention under the previous \nagreement, if Members do not appear to offer their amendments their \nright to offer additional amendments will be extinguished.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment which is a fairly \nstraightforward amendment to transfer funds for two F-16's which the \nAir Force did not request either in its original budget request or in \nthe so-called wish list, and to transfer that to antiterrorism \ninitiatives of the Defense Department and specifically to a fund which \nwas added this morning by an amendment authored by Senator McCain and \nmyself.\n  We have a pressing need in the antiterrorism area. The number of F-\n16's which were funded by the appropriations bill exceeds the request \nof the Air Force, again, both in its original budget request and in its \nsupplemental request, the so-called wish list.\n  Here is the way this is actually working, Mr. President. The \nappropriations bill would add four F-16's to the Air Force's budget \nrequest of four. That is a total, then, of eight aircraft. Now, what \nhappened during the Armed Services Committee consideration of the \ndefense authorization bill was that each of the armed services was \nasked to provide a list of items that they would like to have funded by \nCongress if more money became available. These have been described in \nmany ways and titled in many ways, but the service wish list is one of \nthe ways they have been entitled it, and perhaps they are known best by \nthat.\n  The Air Force, in its wish list, the list of items that it would like \nto have if it was given more money than was in the original budget \nrequest, asked for two extra F-16's. That is in the wish list above the \nbudget request, but the bill before us provided four extra F-16's. So \nthere is no urgent requirement for these two extra F-16's. The Air \nForce fighter force structure is fully protected. Even if we do not add \nany of the four extra F-16's, the Air Force needs roughly 1,250 F-16's \nto protect its fighter force structure.\n  We currently own more than 1,800 F-l6 aircraft, including over 260 F-\n16's that are parked in long-term storage in the desert. Now, while \nthese stored aircraft are not as modern as the brand new aircraft that \nwe would buy in this year's budget, they would prevent the Air Force \nfrom needing to retire any squadrons in the near term because not \nenough aircraft would be available.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4893\n\n(Purpose: To strike out funding for new production of F-16 aircraft in \nexcess of six aircraft, and to transfer the funding to increase funding \n                       for antiterrorism support)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4893.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 10, strike out ``$6,630,370,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$6,582,370,000''.\n       Sec. 8100. None of the funds appropriated under title III \n     of this Act may be obligated or expended for more than six \n     new production F-16 aircraft.\n       Sec.   . The $48,000,000 reduction of funds for F-16 \n     aircraft in excess of six new production aircraft shall be \n     made available for funding for the emergency anti-terrorism \n     program element established in Sec. 8099 of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Air Force budget continues to buy F-\n16's because the service feels that they need to buy more F-16's to \nprevent a force structure reduction sometime around the turn of the \ncentury. But I do not see that anyone could really argue that having a \ncouple more modern F-16's in a force structure of more than 1,200 \naircraft is nearly as important as taking an immediate step to reduce \nour vulnerability to terrorist activities.\n  What this amendment would do would be to shift $48 million from \naircraft that we do not need now, that was in neither the Air Force \nbudget request nor in its wish list, and instead of spending that $48 \nmillion on the additional two F-16's not requested, would fund higher \npriority antiterrorist activities. We are familiar with a recent report \nof the Joint Chiefs that show that antiterrorism funding in this budget \nreflects a reduction over the past several fiscal years. We have heard \nthat referred to today in an amendment that was offered by Senator \nMcCain and myself.\n  These antiterrorist efforts have fallen short by some $56 million \nover this period. There were mitigating circumstances that may have led \nthe Defense Department to make these reductions, such as changes in the \nnumber of bases, completion of construction projects, or other changes. \nBut, surely, this recent attack in Saudi Arabia makes it abundantly \nclear that there is much more that we should be doing in our effort to \naddress the terrorism problem. And those of us that were able to be at \nbreakfast with Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili this morning, \nI think, were given a very detailed list of the kind of efforts that we \nhave to make if we are going to truly carry the war against terrorism \nto the terrorists. Spending $48 million more for antiterrorism instead \nof spending it on aircraft that we do not need right now surely makes \ngood sense to me, and I hope it does to my colleagues, as well.\n  The amendment that I am offering tonight is an amendment that I said \nI would be offering during the authorization bill debate. At that time, \nI indicated an interest in trying to remove from the authorization bill \nthese additional two F-16's above the original\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\nbudget request in the supplemental wish list of the Air Force. I did \nnot do it at that time. We were in a great hurry to address the issues \nin that bill at that time, and I did not do it.\n  But given the fact that this is now really the last chance that we \nwill have to address this issue, and given the current need to put some \nresources into our antiterrorist activity, I thought that this would be \nan opportune moment to offer an amendment to transfer the money from \nthe two F-16's not requested by the Air Force into the antiterrorism \nefforts that the Defense Department must engage in.\n  So I offer this amendment in that spirit and hope that it commands \nbroad support in the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I must express some surprise at the \nSenator, in view of his position on the Armed Services Committee, and \nin view of the fact that today we have already, at the request of \nSenator McCain and Senator Levin, transferred, subject to \nauthorization, $14 million to the Department of Defense for the purpose \nof antiterrorism activities. Now, that is subject to authorization.\n  The effect of Senator Levin's amendment now would be to transfer \nmoney that is authorized for F-16's to more money for the antiterrorism \nactivities, and it is not authorized either. They have not received \nauthorization for the first $14 million we put up for this \nantiterrorism program. That is not even defined yet. It is not defined \nby the authorization committee or by the Department.\n\n  Now, we did that in the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation with \nthe Armed Services Committee members. I find it very difficult to \nunderstand this amendment now, when the Chief of Staff of the Air Force \ncame to see me, General Fogleman. He listed to me personally, as one of \nhis highest priorities, getting these F-16's. The F-16's--all four of \nthem, not just two--really are our weapons system for cooperation \nbetween the Air Force and the Army now, which is the close air support \nfighter that works in conjunction with ground troops in combat.\n  I say to my friend from Michigan that nowhere in the world can you \nsee that so vividly as in the joint training exercises in my State of \nAlaska. We use the F-16's along with our Army forces there, and army \nforces from throughout the world come to participate in the training in \nmy State in order to develop the ability to really use these new close \nair support fighter and ground troop accommodations. This is really one \nof the great things about our Defense Department now. This is a team. \nThe Air Force and Army are now a team because of the F-l6. I think this \nis the message General Fogleman brought to us.\n  These F-16's are needed. As a matter of fact, we have gone from the \nconcept of trying to meet the Soviets anywhere in the world--a \nworldwide concept of defense to a concept of two major regional \ncontingencies being what we will plan for. We plan for our ability to \nmeet two major regional contingencies. If we carried out the plans that \nwere previously approved by the authorization committee to do so, to \nmeet two major regional contingencies, the Air Force would need 114 \nmore F-16's. The Air Force is not fully supplied with aircraft to meet \nthe plans to carry out their missions in the event of two major \nregional contingencies. Now, we are trying to move along in this way as \nbest we can.\n  The Senate passed an authorization bill that included eight F-16's. \nOur committee has funded that request from the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have not added funds for unauthorized F-16's. As a matter \nof fact, if you want to talk to the budget, we have $10 billion more \nmoney in this bill than was requested in the budget, and that is a \nbattle we are going to have to face later with the administration to \nsee whether they really want to maintain that figure.\n  Our bill, I point out once again, is $1.2 billion over last year's \nbill, but in terms of actual items covered, last year we did not fund \nthe contingencies. This year we did fund the contingencies.\n  So, if you look at our bill fairly, we are below the level of 1996. \nThis bill, despite the fact we have increased more than $10 billion \nover the budget, is less than we are spending now for defense. I think \nthe recent events in Saudi Arabia, the fact that we have troops in \nBosnia, and we have the crises that we are facing in the Pacific, God \nknows. I hope we are right. We believe we can get by with what we have \nin this bill. But I fear for the future of this country if we are \nwrong.\n  The Department budgets approximately $1 billion for military security \nforces. Antiterrorism is their primary mission. We have added $14 \nmillion to the $1 billion already budgeted, and the Senator wants to \nadd more before there is even a plan to spend what we have budgeted \nnow.\n  I say, with all good grace, to my friend that I am just surprised at \nthis, after we have already agreed to the amendment that he and Senator \nMcCain already delivered to us on the subject of antiterrorism. I can \njust state categorically that I oppose the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Chairman Stevens has most adequately \narticulated the position of the subcommittee, and I join my chairman in \nopposing the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will make two brief points.\n  First, to buy more F-16's now, we are going to be parking F-16's in \ndesert storage. We already have more F-16's than the force structure \nneeds. They need 1,250 F-16's to support the current fighter force \nstructure. There are 1,370 currently available.\n  But the main point that I want to make here this evening is that the \nAir Force in its budget request asks for four more--for four F-16's \nthis year.\n  Then the Armed Services Committee submitted to the Air Force, as well \nas to the other services, a request. ``If you had more money, how would \nyou spend it?'' The Air Force came up with almost a $3 billion wish \nlist. How many F-16's are on that wish list? Two. How many are on the \nappropriations bill extra? Four. At the same time that there has been \ncriticism of a shortage of antiterrorism funds, and at the same time \nthat we know we are going to have to invest more in antiterrorism, we \nare providing the Air Force in this appropriations bill with eight F-\n16's when the budget request of the Air Force is for four and the wish \nlist would add two to that.\n  I think we have a greater priority than to be doing that. I hope that \nthe Senate will support the transfer of this money from F-16's that \nhave not been requested in either request of the Air Force, and to put \nit into an area where we know there is going to be a growing and \ncritical need.\n  I, at this point, ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary \nPerry to Senator Daschle describing the money which is going into the \nantiterrorist effort be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: As you know, last week the Department \n     was sharply criticized for cutting its budget for anti-\n     terrorism. Citing a report by the Joint Staff, critics \n     claimed that we cut anti-terrorism funding by as much as 82% \n     and implied that this contributed to the tragic bombing in \n     Saudi Arabia. I think it is critical to correct this \n     misperception, put this study in context, and explain the \n     Department's funding for anti-terrorism.\n       The JCS report was commissioned by myself and CJCS \n     Shalikashvili following the Riyadh bombing. Its purpose was \n     to identify and assess all of the anti-terrorism programs, \n     actions and preparedness of the DoD and possible areas for \n     additional action. A portion of the report did describe some \n     program funding reductions, specifically the cut in an Air \n     Force program from $10.6 million in FY 1994 down to $1.9 \n     million in FY 1996--the 82% cut seized upon by some as \n     evidence on lack of attention to anti-terrorism. The report \n     notes, however, that these cuts resulted from personnel \n     reductions, domestic base closings, completed construction \n     projects or program completions, and the programs themselves \n     were just a minor portion of the overall DoD expenditures on \n     anti-terrorism.\n       The reality is that the Department of Defense spends \n     billions annually on anti-terrorism efforts. There are two \n     categories normally associated with Defense activities to\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n     combat terrorism: anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism.\n       Anti-terrorism activities deal with traditional defensive \n     measures such as barriers, fences, detection devices and \n     Defense personnel who have as part of their mission \n     protecting DoD personnel and facilities against the threat of \n     terrorism. The Defense Department spends nearly $2 billion \n     annually on such anti-terrorism activity overall. \n     Traditionally we have not budgeted anti-terrorism activities \n     in a single program because force protection is part of each \n     individual commander's responsibility and is therefore \n     budgeted by every installation in, for example, their \n     operation and maintenance accounts.\n       In the area of counter-terrorism, DoD has many programs and \n     activities which are more often associated with proactive \n     activities undertaken to neutralize the terrorist threat or \n     respond to terrorist acts. All combatant forces in Defense \n     potentially have as part of their mission a counter-terrorism \n     function; however, these activities are more commonly \n     associated with special operations forces, which have annual \n     budgets in excess of $3 billion. Further, that amount is in \n     addition to the considerable sums spent from our intelligence \n     portion of the budget to counter terrorism.\n       The JCS report did fault DoD procedures for funding \n     unanticipated contingencies, and urged the establishment of a \n     special annual contingency fund for anti-terrorism \n     emergencies. Currently, when a crisis emerges, we have to put \n     together a special team and borrow funds from other accounts. \n     The JCS report argued that we needed a separate contingency \n     account, controlled centrally by OSD. I accepted that \n     recommendation and directed the Comptroller to proceed \n     accordingly.\n       It is unfortunate that a minuscule portion of the JCS \n     review is now being used to draw wider, and inappropriate, \n     conclusions in light of the Dhahran bombing. I have \n     concluded, however, that the Department does need more \n     systematic insight and control over its widely-dispersed \n     anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism efforts. That could very \n     well mean a reassignment of priorities and additional funding \n     to reflect that reassignment. To this end, the Defense \n     appropriations floor amendment proposed by Senators McCain \n     and Levin providing targeted anti-terrorism spending can help \n     facilitate this effort. Further, I have specifically directed \n     that Deputy Secretary John White head up a comprehensive \n     effort for systematic programming and budgeting in this area. \n     I will keep you and all members of Congress informed of our \n     plans as they unfold.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William J. Perry.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a time limit on this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to say that if the \nSenator's amendment were to be adopted, our bill would be subject to a \npoint of order. I hope that will not happen. So I move to table the \nSenator's amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SMOLEN, U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we debate the fiscal year 1997 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations bill, I hope my colleagues will \ntake a moment to reflect on the enormous assistance we receive from the \nlegislative liaison offices for the various branches of the Armed \nForces.\n  The men and women who serve in the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine \nCorps legislative liaison offices are a valuable link between Members \nof Congress and the Pentagon. These offices give us with the Pentagon's \nviews on defense bills and specific amendments being considered on the \nSenate and House floors. They also provide timely answers to our \nquestions and help educate us on a variety of defense issues. Moreover, \nthey are instrumental in notifying us about actions affecting military \ninstallations or activities in our States or districts.\n  South Dakota is the proud home to Ellsworth Air Force Base and the B-\n1B bomber. As I have worked to promote Ellsworth and the B-1 over the \nyears, I have had the opportunity to get to know many of the fine men \nand women who serve in the Air Force's Legislative Liaison offices. I \nmust say that Maj. Gen. Normand E. Lezy, the Director of the Air \nForce's Legislative Liaison Office and Brig. Gen. Lansford E. Trapp, \nJr., the Deputy Director, and their staff at the Pentagon, have been \nunderstanding, responsive and fair.\n  The Air Force Legislative Liaison staff located in the Russell \nBuilding has also been very helpful to me on a number of matters that \nmy staff and I have brought to their attention. They, too, perform a \ntremendous service for the Air Force and the U.S. Senate. Although we \nmay at times take their assistance for granted, I know all my \ncolleagues truly appreciate their hard work and dedication.\n  I have been particularly impressed by Col. Robert L. Smolen, the \nChief of the Air Force's Senate Liaison Office. Colonel Smolen is an \nextraordinarily gifted and dedicated officer whose military experiences \nin the United States and the Republic of Korea have made him an \nenormous asset to the Air Force's Legislative Liaison Office. During \nthe past year, I have had the opportunity to work with and get to know \nColonel Smolen. He has been very helpful to me and to many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  Earlier this year, for instance, he devoted a great deal of time to \narranging a congressional delegation trip for me, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Reid. General Trapp and Colonel Smolen graciously accompanied \nus on our trip to the former Yugoslavia. Despite difficult \ncircumstances, it was a very successful and informative trip due in \nlarge part to their excellent preparation and assistance.\n  Unfortunately for all of us in the Senate, Colonel Smolen is \ndeparting Washington for Oklahoma where he will be the new Air Base \nWing Commander at Tinker Air Force Base. I have a great deal of respect \nand admiration for Colonel Smolen. I know he is scheduled to leave this \nweek, and before he does, I would like to review some of the highlights \nof his distinguished career in the U.S. Air Force.\n  Bob Smolen began his career in the Air Force in 1974 as a graduate of \nthe Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Program at Allegheny College \nin Meadville, PA. In what I would argue may have been his best \nassignment, he served at Ellsworth Air Force Base as an Airborne \nMissile Operations Officer in the 4th Airborne Command Control \nSquadron's 28th Bomber Wing from January 1977 to March 1979.\n  Since then, Bob Smolen has served in a number of capacities for the \nAir Force in the United States and around the world. He served as an \naide to the Commander in Chief of the North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand in Colorado Springs, CO. He also served in Washington before as \na Congressional Liaison Officer and Special Assistant to the Director \nof the Legislative Liaison Division in the Office of the Secretary in \nthe early 1980's.\n  Bob Smolen has also been a squadron and deputy air base commander. He \nserved as the Deputy Commander for the 12th Air Base Group in Randolph \nAir Force Base in Texas from October 1989 to August 1991. He also \nserved as the Commander of the 750th Support Squadron at Onizuka Air \nForce Base in California. In addition, he was the commander of the 51st \nSupport Group at Osan Air Base in the Republic of Korea from May 1993 \nto June 1995.\n  After returning to the United States, Colonel Smolen served as the \nChief of the Inquiry Division of the Air Force Office of Legislative \nLiaison from July 1995 to September 1995. Since then, he has been the \nChief of the Air Force's Senate Liaison Office.\n  Knowing of Colonel Smolen's previous assignments here and abroad, I \nam confident the Air Force made the right decision in selecting him to \nbe the new 72nd Air Base Wing Commander at Tinker Air Force Base. I \ncongratulate him on his new assignment and wish him, his wife Adriane, \nand their three children the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8007-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8007-S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 S. 1936--THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss an \nissue of great importance to the State of Arizona and the Nation. As \nyou may know, Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating \nStation, the Nation's largest nuclear power plant. Palo Verde's three \n1,270 megawatt pressurized water reactors serve more than\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\n4 million customers in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas. This \nfacility is not only effective and efficient for customers in those \nStates; it serves as an example for other plants across the country. In \n1987, Palo Verde was selected to receive the Outstanding Engineering \nAchievement Award, the Nation's highest engineering honor from the \nNational Society of Professional Engineers and in 1995, received an \nINPO 1 rating--the highest rating for excellence by the Institute of \nNuclear Power Operations. I am also pleased to announce that just last \nweek, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued its ``Systematic \nAssessment of Licensee Performance,'' or SALP report, for Palo Verde. \nIn three categories--operations, maintenance and engineering--Palo \nVerde received a Category 1 rating, reflecting superior safety \nperformance. Let me quote the NRC in a July 5 letter to Arizona Public \nService, Palo Verde's operator: ``It is clear that Arizona Public \nService has established the programs and processes necessary to achieve \nand sustain superior performance. Management attention is evident at \nall levels.'' I commend Palo Verde for its outstanding performance. \nThese are achievements to be proud of.\n  Palo Verde also deserves awards for its low impact on the \nenvironment. Because it uses uranium as fuel, Palo Verde has saved the \nearth 51 million tons of coal; 12 million barrels of oil; and 272 \nbillion cubic feet of natural gas. By avoiding fossil fuels, Palo Verde \navoided disseminating 2 million tons of sulfur oxide, also known as \nacid rain, 40 million tons of carbon dioxide, and 700 thousand tons of \nnitrogen oxides. In addition, Palo Verde contributes to the local \nenvironment in Phoenix by recycling 40,000 gallons of municipal \neffluent per minute.\n\n  All of these benefits do not come without some cost, of course. Palo \nVerde, like nuclear plants all over the world, produces high-level \nradioactive waste, in the form of spent fuel rods, that must be \ndisposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Currently, these rods \nare stored on-site, in cooling ponds. This storage, as is the case at \nso many other plants, was designed to be temporary. Palo Verde cannot \naccommodate all the spent fuel that it will produce in its lifetime. \nPalo Verde, and other nuclear plants across the country, relied on the \ncommitment by the United States Government to begin taking spent fuel \nby 1998. By that year, 26 U.S. reactors will exhaust existing spent \nfuel storage capacity. Fuel managers at Palo Verde estimate that the \nthree reactors will lose the ability to discharge the entirety of their \ncores in 2004.\n  For years, we have debated what to do with the spent fuel rods from \ncommercial reactors as well as high-level defense waste. In 1982, \nCongress made a commitment to the American people to take the waste. \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act laid the groundwork to develop storage and \ndisposal facilities for commercial and defense waste. Under this \nlegislation, the Department of Energy has an obligation to provide \nsafe, centralized storage for the Nation's spent fuel. In return, \nelectricity consumers would finance this program by paying a few \nadditional cents on their monthly electric bills, the so-called 1 mill \nper kilowatt charge. Since 1982, electricity consumers have paid \nbillions of dollars into the nuclear waste fund. Including interest, \ntheir contributions come to over $11 billion. Consumers in the \nsouthwestern states served by Palo Verde have paid in over $175 \nmillion.\n  Unfortunately, significant progress toward long-term storage has not \nbeen made. Although characterization and viability assessments are \nunderway at Yucca Mountain, NV, the proposed site of the permanent \nrepository, the Federal Government is not now ready to accept high \nlevel waste. And absent extraordinary actions by DOE, it will not be \nready any time soon--certainly not by the 1998 deadline. DOE has \nalready conceded that the permanent repository could not possibly be \nready before 2010. Compounding the problem, DOE has not even begun the \nbasic planning required for an interim facility.\n  Failing to meet the deadline in 1998 is deplorable but it seems it is \nunavoidable. The consequences for some utilities could be devastating. \nSome could be forced to shut down. If those 23 plants that run out of \nstorage space in 3 years were to shut down, America would lose enough \npower for nearly 11 million people--power that doesn't result in air \npollution.\n  Another option for plants would be for these utilities to build \nadditional on-site storage. This would cost tens of millions of \ndollars--money that would come from the pocketbooks of electricity \ncustomers. Those same consumers who have already paid so many billions \nof dollars to the Government for spent fuel storage would be forced to \npay twice for the same service. Officials at Palo Verde estimate that \ntheir initial capital costs and licensing for new on-site storage would \nbe in the neighborhood of $20 million with annual monitoring \nexpenditures of about $10 million.\n  To remedy this inequity, along with several other Senators, including \nSenators Craig and Murkowski, I introduced S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1995. This bill proposes an interim storage facility at \nthe Nevada Test Site near Yucca Mountain and would enable the \nGovernment to meet its obligation to begin accepting spent fuel and \ndefense waste in 1998. This bill passed out of the Energy Committee in \nMarch of this year. Just last week, Senators Craig and Murkowski \nintroduced S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, in an attempt \nto address a number of concerns that had been expressed with respect to \nS. 1271. The new bill was also drafted to broaden the bipartisan \nsupport for this important legislation. I am pleased to co-sponsor this \nnew legislation.\n\n  The bill has been successful in gaining bipartisan support, as \nevidenced by the cloture vote of 65 to 34 on July 16. I believe that \nthe changes made are reasonable and will go a long way toward reaching \nagreement with the House bill. Just as important, Senator Bennett \nJohnston, the ranking member on the Energy Committee, has agreed to \ncosponsor S. 1936 and has sent a letter to the White House, urging the \nPresident to reconsider his previous veto statement. As Senator \nJohnston points out in his July 11 letter to President Clinton:\n\n       Nuclear waste has never been a partisan issue. While the \n     current law was signed by a Republican president, it has its \n     roots in the Carter administration. It was passed by a \n     Democratic House and a Republican Senate and amended by a \n     Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, with broad \n     bipartisan support. It would be a terrible, terrible mistake \n     to make it a partisan issue now.\n\n  Continuing in this bipartisan tradition is S. 1936, which amends the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Introduced July 9 by Senators Larry \nCraig and Frank Murkowski, it retains the fundamental principles of S. \n1271, which passed Energy Committee in March. S. 1936 would develop an \nintegrated management system for used nuclear fuel from commercial \nnuclear power plants and for high-level radioactive materials from \ndefense activities, all of which is now stored in 41 States.\n\n\n                        Central Interim Storage\n\n  Under S. 1936, construction of an interim facility could begin \nDecember 31, 1998. If the President determines by that date that Yucca \nMountain is not a suitable site for a permanent repository, an \nalternate interim storage site may be chosen. An alternate storage site \nmust be selected by the President by June 30, 2000, and Congress must \napprove construction at that alternate site by December 31, 2000. If \nthose milestones are not met, an interim storage facility will be built \nat the Nevada Test Site. This provision is significant because it \nensures that the construction of an interim storage facility at the \nYucca Mountain site will not occur before the President and Congress \nhave had an ample opportunity to review the technical assessment of the \nsuitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a permanent repository and \nto designate an alternative site for interim storage based upon that \ntechnical information. This provision of S. 1936, in effect, de-links \npermanent and interim storage. This linkage was a criticism of S. 1271 \nwhich would have allowed construction of an interim storage facility on \nOctober 1, 1998. S. 1936 provides time to determine if Yucca Mountain \nis a viable site for a permanent repository before building an interim \nsite in Nevada. If it is not, S. 1936, again, provides the option for \nfinding an alternate interim storage site.\n\n\n            Ratepayer Funding of the Waste Disposal Program\n\n  S. 1936 ensures that funds are available for the program when needed. \nThe\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\nbill continues electricity customers' payments into the Waste Fund at \nthe rate of 1 mill per kilowatt-hour, or about $600 million per year, \nuntil September 30, 2020. After that date, the program will be funded \nby a user fee, which will be capped at 1 mill. The bill also requires \nthat all one-time fees owed by utilities for spent fuel generated \nbefore 1983 be paid by September 30, 2020 and imposes a penalty on \nutilities that fail to pay the one-time fee. In S. 1271, the 1 mill fee \nwould have continued indefinitely. One-time fees would have been paid \nwhen DOE fulfilled its contractual obligation to begin taking waste in \n1998.\n\n  S. 1936 ensures that electricity customers' deposits of about $12 \nbillion to the Federal Nuclear Waste Fund are made available as needed \nfor the nuclear waste management program, and that the monies are spent \nfor their intended purpose.\n  Both bills assure continued funding for the nuclear waste management \nprogram. S. 1936 resolves budget issues relating to ``PAY-GO'' and \nassures that funds are made available to the program, and not used to \noffset the budget deficit.\n\n\n                        Interim Storage Capacity\n\n  Both bills establish a two phase approach for acceptance of waste at \nthe central facility to encourage timely completion of the permanent \nrepository, without burdening nuclear power plants, many of which are \nrapidly running out of on-site storage capacity. Under S. 1936, spent \nfuel acceptance in Phase I would begin November 30, 1999, and the \nfacility capacity would be capped at 15,000 metric tons. Phase I under \nS. 1271 would have begun on the same date, with a 20,000 MTU capacity. \nUnder S. 1936, Phase II begins by December 2, 2002. The storage \ncapacity would increase to 40,000 MTU. However, a provision in S. 1936 \nwould increase the capacity cap to 60,000 MTU if DOE fails to complete \nthe Yucca Mountain viability assessment by June 30, 1998, or if it \nfails to submit a repository license application by February 1, 2002, \nor it fails to begin repository operation by January 17, 2010. Phase II \nin S. 1271 would have also begun by December 31, 2002, but with a \n100,000 MTU capacity. S. 1936 provides storage capacity through 2019 \nand maintains pressure to complete construction of a repository by \n2010.\n\n\n                             Transportation\n\n  Like S. 1271, S. 1936 designated Caliente, NV, as an intermodal \ntransfer point and provides for heavy haul truck transfer to the Nevada \nTest Site. S. 1936 clarifies that transporting spent nuclear fuel will \nbe governed by all Federal, State, and local requirements to the same \nextent as anyone engaging in interstate transportation. S. 1936 also \ncontains more stringent requirements for promulgating employee safety \nrules, provides greater detail in transportation requirements, and \nprovides training for workers in all phases of the integrated waste \nmanagement system and emergency response personnel.\n\n\n            National Environmental Policy Act and Preemption\n\n  S. 1936 requires that DOE conduct an environmental impact statement \nfor licensing both the interim spent fuel storage facility and the \npermanent repository. Environmental reviews are also required for the \nintermodal transfer facility. S. 1936, far from overriding all State \nand local laws, actually expands jurisdiction of all applicable \nFederal, State, and local and tribal laws. The only time Federal law \nwould override, or preempt, State or local law is when these are \npatently unreasonable as would be the case if a State passed a law \ndeclaring illegal the passage of nuclear waste through it. Such laws as \nthis, which would be an insuperable obstacle to carrying our S. 1936, \nwould be preempted. This is in contrast to S. 1271, which said the \nstorage facility would be governed solely by the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, Atomic Energy Act, and the Hazardous Material Transportation Act, \nto the exclusion of all laws below the Federal level. S. 1936 takes \ninto account an expanded universe of Federal, State, and local and \ntribal laws, while ensuring that the program is not obstructed.\n\n\n                            Local Relations\n\n  S. 1936 restores financial assistance to Nevada's local governments \nand to tribes, and it provides land transfers to Nye and Lincoln \nCounties, and the city of Caliente. The bill's affected areas see the \nland transfer provision as attractive, since the vast majority of \nNevada land is government owned. S. 1936 provides equitable treatment \nfor Nevada's local governments and tribes.\n\n\n                             Transportation\n\n  The Federal Government must plan today to ensure its ability to \ntransport spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants to a \ncentral storage facility beginning in 1999. The Energy Department is \nresponsible for transporting spent nuclear fuel to a central storage \nfacility and repository. S. 1936 instructs DOE to use private \ncontractors to the fullest extent possible in each aspect of the \ntransportation network. Spent fuel must be transported from nuclear \npower plants to an interim storage facility in containers certified by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission. DOE selects transportation routes \nfor spent fuel shipments to Nevada, and the agency must notify States \nalong the transportation routes in advance of spent fuel shipments. As \nmentioned, the containers would be transferred at an intermodal \nfacility at Caliente, NV and shipped by heavy haul truck over the final \n120 miles to the central storage facility.\n  The bill also provides technical assistance to States, local \ngovernments and Indian tribes for training in procedures required for \nroutine transportation and in emergency response. The transportation \nprovisions in S. 1936 are consistent with preemption authority found in \nthe Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n\n\n                         Amounts to be Shipped\n\n  Radioactive materials currently account for about 3 percent of the \n100 million packages of hazardous materials shipped each year in the \nUnited States. Of those 3 million radioactive packages, fewer than 100 \ncontain high-level radioactive waste. The number of spent fuel \nshipments will increase to about 300 to 500 per year by the turn of the \ncentury, when the DOE is expected to begin accepting high-level \nradioactive waste at a central storage facility. Even then, high-level \nradioactive waste will comprise a small percentage of all hazardous \nmaterial shipments.\n  During the past 30 years, the commercial nuclear industry has built a \nsolid safety record during more than 2,400 shipments of spent fuel over \nU.S. highways and railroads. During this time, no fatalities, injuries \nor environmental damage have been caused by the radioactive nature of \nthe cargo. Spent nuclear fuel is placed in dry, rugged containers for \nshipment. These specially designed containers--certified by the NRC--\nuse heavy steel-walled technology to safely confine radioactive \nmaterials.\n  Because of the strict controls by DOE, NRC and other State and \nFederal agencies, utilities and other U.S. companies have a long \nhistory of safe spent fuel transportation. Spent fuel has been shipped \nfrom temporary storage facilities at West Valley, NY and Morris, IL, \nback to utilities; from the Three Mile Island plant to the Idaho \nNational Engineering Laboratory; and from the Hope Creek nuclear power \nplant in New Jersey to a General Electric facility in California.\n\n\n                  Designation of Transportation Routes\n\n  Spent fuel can be shipped only along specified rail and highway \nroutes. The routes will be selected by the DOE, but States participate \nin the designation process. Eleven States have registered preferred \nroutes for transportation of high-level radioactive materials. S. 1936 \nrequires DOE to adhere to NRC regulations requiring advance \nnotification of State and local governments prior to transportation of \nspent fuel.\n\n  For those shipments that will be transported by truck, most of the \ndesignated routes travel along interstate highways and bypasses--not \nthrough major cities and towns. However, States may propose \nalternatives to the interstate highway system. Potentially affected \nStates must be consulted in the designation of alternative routes. \nShippers must file a written route plan with the NRC, including the \norigin-destination of the shipment, routes, planned stops, estimated \narrival times at each stop, and emergency telephone numbers in each \nState the shipment will enter.\n\n\n        Protection of Public Health and Safety During Shipments\n\n  Federal regulations for transporting radioactive material ensure that \nthe\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\npublic and the environment are protected from dangerous releases of \nradioactivity. Three Federal agencies each play a key role in the safe \ntransfer of radioactive materials from nuclear power plants to a \ncentral storage facility. The DOE is responsible for accepting, \ntransporting, storing and disposing of spent fuel from nuclear power \nplants. The DOT regulates highway routing, packaging, labeling, \nshipping papers, personnel training, loading and unloading, handling \nand storage, as well as transportation vehicle requirements. The NRC \nregulates container design and manufacturing to ensure that containers \nmaintain their integrity under routine transportation conditions and \nduring severe accidents. S. 1936 requires that containers for nuclear \nfuel transport be licensed by the NRC. The agency also examines \nshipping routes to ensure the security of spent fuel shipments.\n  According to NRC regulations, the radiation level of containers \nduring shipment cannot exceed 10 millirem per hour at a distance of 6 \nfeet from the truck. At this level, a person who spends 30 minutes \nstanding 6 feet away from the vehicle carrying radioactive materials \nwould receive 5 millirem of radiation. By comparison, the average \nperson receives about 300 millirem each year from natural background \nradiation.\n\n\n                               Accidents\n\n  Between 1971 and 1989, seven accidents occurred involving \ntransportation of spent nuclear fuel. None caused any release of \nradioactivity. The most severe of these accidents occurred in 1971 in \nTennessee. A tractor-trailer carrying a 25-ton spent fuel shipping \ncontainer swerved to avoid a head-on collision, went out of control and \noverturned. The trailer, with the container still attached, broke free \nof the tractor and skidded into a rain-filled ditch. The container \nsuffered minor damage, but did not release any radioactive material.\n\n\n                        Local Response-Training\n\n  The Federal Government provides training and other assistance to the \nStates so they may adequately respond in the event of an accident. \nUnder existing law and S. 1936, DOE provides funding from the Federal \nNuclear Waste Fund to train State and local officials and tribal \nemergency rescue workers and to develop emergency response and \npreparedness plans. S. 1936 also required the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish training standards applicable to workers \ndirectly involved in the removal, transportation, interim storage, and \ndisposal of high-level radioactive waste.\n  The DOE operates a Radiological Assistance Program, with eight \nregional offices staffed with experts available for immediate \nassistance. If necessary, police will summon those experts to handle \nthe transportation package and remove any radioactive material that may \nhave been released.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Terrorism has been given considerable attention in the planning, \nprocedures and regulation of spent fuel transportation. It is highly \nunlikely that a terrorist would have the opportunity, the equipment, or \nthe required expertise to sufficiently damage a spent nuclear fuel \ncontainer to cause a radiation release.\n  Points of origin, schedule, route, and mode of transportation are \nknown only by a core group of Federal and State government officials. \nSpecial devices on vehicles, sophisticated satellite tracking, and \narmed security through populated areas will be employed to deter \nterrorist threats.\n  Tests by Sandia National Laboratories evaluated the possibility of a \nterrorist attack. For security reasons, much of this information is \nclassified; however, we do know that, for testing purposes, a container \nwas subjected to a device 30 times more powerful than a typical anti-\ntank weapon. This test was conducted in a carefully controlled \nenvironment and resulted in a one-fourth of an inch in diameter hole \nthrough the primary containment wall. The NRC estimates that even a \ndevice this powerful would have caused a release of less than 10 grams \nof spent fuel.\n\n\n                       The 100 Millirem Standard\n\n  S. 1936 establishes a 100 millirem standard for release of \nradioactivity from the repository as a maximum annual dose to an \naverage member of the general population in the vicinity of Yucca \nMountain. This standard is consistent with current national and \ninternational standards designed to protect the public health and \nsafety and the environment. S. 1936 also would allow the NRC to \nestablish another standard if it finds that the 100 millirem level \nwould pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of Nevadans.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  In sum, I believe that S. 1936 is an effective short-term solution to \nour nuclear waste disposal, for both commercial and defense waste. A \ncentral interim storage facility is both environmentally and \neconomically sound. To me, the choice seems clear. Why leave nuclear \nwaste scattered throughout the country in various sites when it can be \nsafely transferred and stored in one central site? A single storage \nsite is clearly the pro-environmental option. Interim storage at a \ncentral Federal site enhances safety and efficiency in the management \nof spent fuel. In addition to the environmental benefits, central \nstorage is significantly more cost-effective for electricity customers. \nStoring used fuel at a central interim storage facility would save \nconsumers $4.3 billion if the facility is operating by 2000 and a \nrepository begins accepting spent fuel in 2010.\n  America's 110 nuclear power plants are this Nation's second largest \nsource of electricity, constituting about 20 percent of our electric \npower. Nuclear energy supplies over 40 percent of all the new \nelectricity required by the American people since 1973. Our nuclear \npower plants will also make the largest contribution of any technology \ntoward meeting the Administration's year 2000 goals for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Whether we build new nuclear power plants in the future or not, we \nmust deal responsibly with the nuclear fuel produced by our currently \noperating plants. We must also deal with the defense waste that this \nNation has produced. S. 1936 is good policy and represents a safe, \nresponsible solution that enjoys strong bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8007-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8010-S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LTG ROBERT L. ORD III\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate and pay \ntribute to a great American leader, statesman and soldier. Lt. Gen. \nRobert L. Ord, III, Commanding General of the U.S. Army, Pacific \n(USARPAC) will retire on July 31, 1996 after more than 34 years of \ndedicated service to our nation and our Army.\n  A native of Medford Lakes, NJ, Lieutenant General Ord graduated from \nthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1962 and was commissioned as \na second lieutenant of Infantry. Over the course of the next three \ndecades, he served our country honorably and faithfully in a variety of \nexceptionally challenging troop and staff assignments in the United \nStates, Vietnam, and Korea.\n  A leader in both peace and war, he has commanded at every level from \nplatoon to division and Army major command. Lieutenant General Ord \ncommanded a rifle company in Vietnam and the 2d Battalion, 1st Infantry \nTraining Brigade at Fort Benning, Ga. Following graduation from the \nArmy War College in 1980, he served as the Operations Officer, Chief of \nStaff, and Commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry \nDivision (Light) at Ford Ord, CA. He then served in the Pentagon as the \nExecutive Officer to the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel \nfollowed by promotion to brigadier general and assignment in Korea as \nChief of Staff of the United States-Korea Combined Field Army. \nSubsequently, he returned to Fort Ord as Assistant Division Commander \nof the 7th Infantry Division (Light), where he participated in \nOperation Just Cause in Panama, followed by Command of the U.S. Total \nArmy Personnel Command in Washington, DC.\n  From February 1992 until September 1993, Lieutenant General Ord \nserved as the commanding general of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) \nand the United States Army, Hawaii where his relentless pursuit of \nexcellence and focus on mission training placed the 25th Infantry \nDivision (Light) on the cutting edge of combat readiness. Through his \ninnovative, aggressive and creative\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\nleadership, the 25th Infantry Division (Light) and United States Army, \nHawaii became fully integrated, modernized, manned and equipped forces \ncapable of exceptional tactical mobility, lethality and versatility.\n  As Commanding General, United States Army, Pacific, Fort Shafter, HA, \nfrom November 1993 to June 1996, Lieutenant General Ord has been the \nconsummate statesman and ambassador for the United States throughout \nthe Pacific. He has utilized his vast diplomatic skills with senior \nleaders from over 37 countries of the Asia-Pacific region to win \nfriends and influence foreign governments; thereby, broadening the \nprestige of the U.S. Army and deterring hostile action from potential \nadversaries. Through his insightful guidance and visionary leadership, \nhe has redefined the future of the Army in the Pacific and made \ndramatic progress toward its ``end-state'' with alignment and \nrestructuring of apportioned Army forces.\n  Throughout his career, Lieutenant General Ord has demonstrated a deep \nand personal concern for soldiers, Army civilians, retirees, and their \nfamilies that has earned him a reputation as a commander who would \nspare no effort to ensure that their needs were met. His extraordinary \nleadership and brilliant statesmanship have significantly enhanced the \nvital national security interests of the United States and were the \ndriving force behind preparing America's Army in the Pacific for the \n21st Century. With resolute commitment and dedication, he has \naccomplished the Army's most challenging tasks of downsizing, \nreorganizing and streamlining while maintaining exceptional combat \nreadiness and quality of life in his forces.\n  Lieutenant General Ord's career has been the epitome of selfless \nservice to our nation and the quintessential example of all we could \nhope our military leaders to be. And through the decades of service and \nsacrifice, he has been supported by a loving family. The Nation shares \nLieutenant General Ord with his wife Gail, their daughters Traci and \nGinger, and grandchildren Mariah and Zachary. They too have served our \ncountry, supporting in countless ways the career of this dedicated \nsoldier and statesman.\n  Lieutenant General Ord, a consummate professional, a loyal servant of \nthe Constitution, a leader of demonstrated moral and physical vigor and \ncourage--on behalf of the Congress of the United States and the people \nwe represent, I offer our heartfelt appreciation and sincere thanks to \nyou and your family for your selfless and dedicated service. Mahalo, \naloha and best wishes for a bright and happy future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8010-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago in 1972 when the television networks reported that I had been \nelected as a U.S. Senator from North Carolina. I remember well the \nexact time that the announcement was made and how stunned I was.\n  It had never really occurred to me that I would be the first \nRepublican in history to be elected by the people of North Carolina to \nthe U.S. Senate. When I got over my astonishment, I thought about a lot \nof things. And I made some commitments to myself one of which was that \nI would never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, \nwho wanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which back in February exceeded $5 trillion for the first \ntime in history. Congress created this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always are \ninclined to discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no \nPresident can spend a dime of Federal money that has not first been \nauthorized and appropriated by both the House and Senate of the United \nStates.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Tuesday, July 16, 1996, stood at \n$5,158,429,724,926.15. On a per capita basis, the existing Federal debt \namounts to $19,442.95 for every man, woman, and child in America on a \nper capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday--which identified the total Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness on Monday, July 15, 1996--shows an increase of more than $2 \nbillion--$2,116,065,511.60, to be exact. That 1-day increase alone is \nenough to match the total amount needed to pay the college tuitions for \neach of the 313,770 students for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8011-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 12, the United States imported 7,300,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 800,000 barrels less than the 8,100,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 53 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in \nthe 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,300,000 barrels a \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8011-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8011-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY BOARD ON ARMS PROLIFERATION POLICY--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 160\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 1601(d) of Public Law 103-160 (the ``Act''), I \ntransmit herewith the report of the President's Advisory Board on Arms \nProliferation Policy.

A bill to establish a demonstration project to study and \nprovide coverage of routine patient care costs for medicare \nbeneficiaries with cancer who are enrolled in an approved clinical \ntrial program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        THE MEDICARE CANCER CLINICAL TRIAL COVERAGE ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto continue the effort to expand treatment options for older Americans \nwho happen to have cancer. I am especially pleased my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Mack, is joining me as an original cosponsor. Senator \nMack is a vigorous and persistent advocate for cancer research and \nimprovements in patient care for those with cancer. He has been \nfighting this battle for a long time.\n  Our bipartisan sponsorship, which is just a nice thing to happen \naround here anyway, is intended to say to the American people, \nespecially to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, that \nwe in the Congress are, in fact, very, very serious about trying to be \nhelpful.\n  Over 1.3 million people will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Over \n11,000 of those people, newly diagnosed with cancer, will be people I \nrepresent, that is West Virginians. Cancer is, in fact, the second \nleading cause of death in West Virginia, second only to heart disease. \nThis legislation is aimed at improving Medicare coverage, since \nMedicare beneficiaries account for more than half of all cancer \ndiagnoses, and 60 percent of all cancer deaths.\n  Our bill deals with the very specific problem faced by Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are currently prevented from receiving care that may \nextend or save their lives. To put it very simply and very bluntly, \nAmericans over the age of 65 who are struck with cancer believe they \nshould get the best shot in fighting their disease. The Medicare Cancer \nClinical Trial Coverage Act of 1996, which is the bill I am \nintroducing, is a bill to do something very targeted to give older \nAmericans their best shot at fighting cancer. With this bill we want to \ntackle the frustrating, often anguishing problem faced by older \nAmericans who are unable to participate in cancer clinical trials. Let \nme explain.\n  Consider the story of a West Virginian who was treated with an \nexperimental drug for lung cancer, under a research trial approved by \nthe National Cancer Institute. Because Medicare would not cover the \ncost of hospitalization required to administer the anticancer \ntreatment, he decided he could only pay for one more treatment out of \nthe money from his own pocket. This West Virginian could not bring \nhimself to bankrupt his family, yet getting the additional treatments\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nmight bring the gift of a longer life for him and, obviously, much more \nstability and happiness for his family. This is a terrible choice that \nshould not have to be made by anybody in this country.\n  While we still have a long way to go in discovering a cure for \ncancer, there are constantly popping up reports of exciting new \nadvances in the treatment of cancer. The bad news is that millions of \npeople with cancer cannot take advantage of these path-breaking \ntreatments because they are provided in a setup which is called \nclinical trials. To insurers, including the Medicare Program, that \nlabels them experimental. In other words, clinical trials are labeled \nexperimental and, therefore, the basis for turning down coverage with \nno ifs, ands, or buts.\n  Critics of coverage for clinical trials argue that care provided in \ntrials is purely investigational and too costly. In fact, these trials \ncan provide essential information about which treatments are effective \nand which ones are not. This is one of the best ways for the health \ncare system to learn about the various advantages and disadvantages of \ntreatment options, including what costs are involved before a certain \ncourse is expanded widely or prematurely.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Connie Mack is very \ncareful in pursuing a solution. We lay out a framework for a major \ndemonstration project to come up with the information and the \nexperience needed to then modify Medicare's policy toward clinical \ntrials. With this demonstration we want the Medicare Program to find \nout more about the costs of covering high-quality clinical trials for \nits beneficiaries with cancer, and then compare them to the benefits \nand other results learned through the demonstration. There is truly an \nurgent need to get on with this study, and then where the findings \nshould take us in changing Medicare's policy toward clinical trials. \nWith new cancer therapies rapidly unfolding, dealing with a disease \nthat its victims are desperately trying to battle, peer-reviewed \nclinical trials may be the best and only available care.\n\n  Cancer researchers themselves--and there is a long list of \nassociations and organizations who support this legislation--are eager \nto have more older Americans involved in these trials. More needs to be \nlearned about the biological responses to various treatments within \ndifferent age groups, and this bill can help fill that particular gap.\n  In our bill we confine the demonstration to covering a select group \nof high-quality clinical trials. Our criteria say the trials covered \nunder this demonstration have to be the result of top-notch peer review \nprocedures.\n  This legislation does not write any new policies for Medicare into \nstone, but it does lay the foundation for a Medicare policy toward \ncancer treatments that factors in what clinical trials now have to \noffer. We give the program 5 years to conduct the demonstration, and \nthen we call on the Secretary of HHS to tell Congress how Medicare \nshould or perhaps should not be changed in its policy toward cancer and \nother kinds of clinical trials.\n  Many researchers, physicians, patients, and many of us in Congress \nhave already been pushing for more coverage for clinical trials by \nMedicare and other insurers. In its 1994 report to Congress, a very \nlong-named advisory group--something called the National Cancer \nAdvisory Board's Subcommittee to Evaluate the National Cancer Program--\nemphasized the need for private insurance and Medicare coverage for \napproved clinical trials. And we use that report in our bill to create \nthe criteria for what kinds of trials should be covered in the Medicare \ndemonstration that Senator Mack and I are proposing.\n  I continue to believe that all Americans should be guaranteed access \nto quality health care. I would love to see Congress acting immediately \nto ensure that any American struck by cancer, whether age 21 or age 71, \ncould get coverage for treatment in a clinical trial if that is judged \nthe best option for them. Those are highly ambitious goals, and today \nSenator Mack and I offer this bill as one more incremental step in \ntheir direction.\n  I actually started some years ago with legislation to improve cancer \ncare for Medicare patients. That legislation ended up being enacted in \n1993. It was really sort of embarrassingly simple. My legislation \nrequired Medicare coverage of oral anticancer drugs if those drugs \nwould otherwise have been covered by Medicare if administered \nintravenously in a doctor's office. Obviously, the result being cost \nsavings and almost simple beyond belief. But, nevertheless, it was not \nallowed prior to my legislation.\n  We changed the law, and now it is allowed. A lot of money is being \nsaved, and people are being helped because they can take an oral drug \nat home rather than having an injection in a doctor's office. As a \nresult, many Medicare beneficiaries with cancer can take advantage of \ndrugs that they were, in a sense, walled off from before.\n  The other part of my bill set an uniform standard for Medicare \ncoverage of anticancer drugs. Prior to the enactment of my legislation, \nthere was significant variation in Medicare coverage of anticancer \ndrugs because individual Medicare carriers made their own decisions on \ncoverage. A GAO report found that Medicare's unreliable and \ninconsistent coverage of accepted off-label uses of cancer drugs forced \noncologists to alter their preferred treatment. Now there is clear and \nconsistent Medicare policy regarding coverage of anticancer drugs.\n  In conclusion, I think it is time again for Congress to take another \nsmall, yet crucial, step in improving coverage for elderly cancer \npatients who deserve every chance they have to battle this horrible \ndisease.\n  I hope to get the help of colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and \nI am sure Senator Mack shares this wish with me--to get more supporters \nto recognize that this urgent need has to be attended to as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of our bill and a \nsummary of the legislation, along with a list of its supporters, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under part B of the Medicare Program of medical \nnutrition therapy services of registered dietitians and nutrition \nprofessionals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1996\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Medical Nutrition \nTherapy Act of 1996 on behalf of myself and my friend and colleague \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings.\n  This legislation is similar to a bill, H.R. 2247, that was introduced \nlast year in the House by Representative Jose Serrano. It provides for \ncoverage under part B of the Medicare Program of medical nutrition \ntherapy services which are furnished by or under the supervision of a \nregistered dietitian or nutrition professional.\n  Mr. President, at a time when the Medicare system is under increasing \nscrutiny and the Congress and administration are debating how to ensure \nthe long-term stability of the program, I believe that the legislation \nI am introducing should be an integral part of those debates.\n  Medical nutrition therapy is the assessment of patient nutritional \nstatus followed by therapy, ranging from diet modification to \nadministration of specialized nutrition therapies such as intravenous \nor tube feedings. It has proven to be a medically necessary and cost-\neffective way of treating and controlling many diseases and medical \nconditions, including AIDS, cancer, kidney disease, diabetes, and \nsevere burns. The treatment of all of these conditions and numerous \nothers saves health care costs by speeding recovery and reducing the \nincidence of complications. This in turn results in fewer \nhospitalizations, shorter hospital stays, and reduced drug, surgery, \nand treatment needs.\n  An analysis of nearly 2,400 case studies submitted by members of \nAmerican Dietetic Association members showed that on average more than \n$8,000 per patient can be saved with the intervention of medical \nnutrition therapy. The July 1995 issue of the American Journal of \nMedicine highlighted a study that found that the use of a diabetes \nteam, led by an endocrinologist working with a nurse diabetes educator \nand dietitian, resulted in a 56-percent reduction in length of hospital \nstays among patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of diabetes \ncompared with patients treated by an internist alone. Currently, \nhospital care of diabetic patients costs an estimated $65 billion a \nyear. The potential 5-day reduction in hospitalization found by this \nstudy translates into billions of dollars per year in potential health \ncare savings and that is only the savings related to diabetes \ntreatment. The true saving resulting from the increased use of medical \nnutrition therapy in other illnesses is substantial and that is why I \nam here today to offer this legislation.\n  Mr. President, no consistent policy or approach exists for covering \nthe costs for medical nutrition therapy. In inpatient settings, \ndietitians' services are often folded into hospital room and board \ncharges and are not reimbursed while equipment and prescribed medical \nnutritional products are often, but not always, treated in the same \nmanner. In outpatient settings, coverage is inconsistent for both \ndietitians' services and other nutrition therapies. Medicare and some \nMedicaid programs cover physician-prescribed medical nutrition \ntherapies as part of a home care therapy benefit. However, professional \ndietitian services are not covered as a reimbursable expense.\n  I believe that we need to change this and the legislation I am \noffering today will achieve that. I also believe that as the relevant \nstudies are developed it will be clearly shown that coverage of medical \nnutrition therapy of reducing health care expenditures and should be an \nintegral part of any long-term solution to the solvency of the Medicare \nProgram.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Specter, Mr. Wyden, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        D'Amato, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Reid and Mr. Ashcroft):\n\n  S. 1965. A bill to prevent the illegal manufacturing and use of \nmethamphetamine; ordered held at the desk.\n\n\n         THE COMPREHENSIVE METHAMPHETAMINE CONTROL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1965, a \nbipartisan bill to combat the methamphetamine epidemic, a serious and \ngrowing public health problem which poses a special threat to our \nNation's youth who are abusing the drug in record numbers.\n  According to the latest information from the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, 50 percent of the methamphetamine consumed in the \nUnited States is illegally imported. The other 50 percent is \nmanufactured illegally in the United States in clandestine labs. \nAccordingly, any national strategy to combat methamphetamine must \ntarget both the source of import and these clandestine labs.\n  Methamphetamine presents a unique problem in the fight against \nillegal drugs. It is not grown, but is manufactured from other \nchemicals, virtually all of which are legally used for other purposes.\n  Clandestine methamphetamine laboratories manufacture methamphetamine \nfrom chemicals with legitimate medical uses. Two of the most common \nprecursor drugs--ephedrine and pseudoephedrine--are common ingredients \nin cold and cough preparations. Other precursor chemicals include \niodine, often used in iodized salt; red phosphorous, often used in the \nproduction of matches; and hydrochloric acid, used for a variety of \nchemical purposes.\n  In addition, methamphetamine distribution has become a major target \nof opportunity for sophisticated drug trafficking rings, including \nvicious, poly-drug organizations in Mexico who have beaten well-trodden \npaths into the United States. Willing European suppliers provide them \nwith tons of ephedrine, the precursor drug used to manufacture the \nillegal meth.\n\n[[Page S8016]]\n\n  These Mexican methamphetamine traffickers are organized--and they do \nnot hesitate to use extreme violence. They showed their true colors \nwhen they murdered DEA special agent Richard Fass in Glendale, AZ, in \nJune 1994--just 1 day before he was to be transferred to a new \nassignment.\n  Any legislative solution to the meth crisis must, by necessity, \nbalance the need to stem this illegal tide of methamphetamine into the \nUnited States against the need to ensure access to precursor chemicals \nwhich have legitimate medical uses and upon which millions of Americans \nrely.\n  Mr. President, methamphetamine has wreaked havoc across America, \nespecially on communities in the Southwest. And, unfortunately, it is \nspreading east. It has entered the intermountain west, especially Utah, \nand is beginning to be seen throughout the rest of the country as well.\n  An indication of the magnitude of this problem is the fact that \nmethamphetamine emergency room cases are up 256 percent over the 1991 \nlevels, according to the latest information from the Drug Abuse Warning \nNetwork.\n  In 1994, the last year that data were available, there were 17,400 \nmethamphetamine-related emergency visits. In California, \nmethamphetamine seizures are up 518 percent over the 1991 level.\n  In Utah, we had 56 lab seizures in 1995, up from 13 in 1994. From \nJanuary through June of this year we have already had 37 lab seizures. \nUtah has ranked in the top three States in the number of \nmethamphetamine lab seizures for the past 2 years, an alarming trend.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Utah has \nexperienced the second greatest increase in methamphetamine-related \nadmissions in the entire country--a 133-percent increase in admissions \nbetween 1992 and 1993.\n  But statistics don't tell the whole story. This crisis is more than \nnumbers, it involves real people suffering real problems. Let me show \nyou examples of the people behind those numbers.\n  One of these people is Russell Ray Thompson. After a long day of \ndrinking alcohol and injecting methamphetamine, Thompson shot an \nunarmed female friend six times with a rifle, leaving her two orphaned \nchildren to live with their grandparents.\n  Another is Connie Richens, from Vernal, UT. As Ms. Richens was \npreparing to meet her husband at a bowling alley, two men forced \nthemselves into her apartment and slashed her throat four times. Uinta \nCounty sheriff's deputies found powdered methamphetamine a few feet \nfrom her dead body.\n  Methamphetamine is a killer. It kills those who abuse it, as well as \ninnocent bystanders. It is the latest outrage perpetrated on American \nsociety by those who deal in drugs. We must put a stop to this terrible \nproblem.\n  At this point, I would like to summarize the major provisions in S. \n1965.\n  The first title contains measures to stop the importation of \nmethamphetamine and precursor chemicals into the United States. We have \nincluded a long-arm provision, which imposes a maximum 10-year penalty \non the manufacture outside the United States of a list I chemical--\nwhich is a chemical that is used to manufacture a controlled \nsubstance--with intent to import it into this country.\n  The second title contains several provisions to control the \nmanufacture of methamphetamine in clandestine labs. It includes an \nimportant provision to permit the seizure and forfeiture of list I \nchemicals that are involved in illegal trafficking. Another provision \nincreases penalties for the manufacture and possession of equipment \nused to make controlled substances. These provisions will not only \nimpact the manufacture of methamphetamine, but other drugs illegally \nmanufactured as well.\n  After a great deal of work with the Department of Justice, Senator \nBiden, and the DEA, I have also included a provision that will allow \nthe Attorney General to commence a civil action for appropriate relief \nto shut down the production and sale of listed chemicals by individuals \nor companies that knowingly sell precursor agents for the purpose of \nthe illegal manufacture of a controlled substance.\n  I believe that these provisions are important, as they give law \nenforcement additional authority to stop the flow of these precursor \nsubstances that are diverted for the manufacture of illegal controlled \nsubstances and to shut down clandestine labs. This bill gives the law \nenforcement community the muscle it needs to fight trafficking in \nmethamphetamine and its precursor drugs.\n  In addition to the provisions I have already outlined, the third \ntitle increases penalties for trafficking in methamphetamine and list I \nprecursor chemicals, enhances penalties for the dangerous handling of \ncontrolled substances, allows the Government to seek restitution for \nthe clean up of the clandestine laboratory sites from those who created \nthe contamination, and allows for the seizure of the modes of \ntransportation of illegal methamphetamine and list I chemicals.\n  In developing these provisions, we were cognizant of the fact that \nthe DEA and the administration have stated that one important way to \nstop meth abuse is to increase the penalties for illegal importation of \nprecursor chemicals. This will reduce the number of domestic, \nclandestine methamphetamine labs which, in turn, will decrease the \navailability of this dangerous drug, improve the safety of our \nneighborhoods, and eliminate a source of environmental damage.\n\n  It is an unfortunate consequence of enhanced domestic penalties that \nsome of the domestic labs may relocate to Central and South America. It \nis my hope that the provisions in this bill requiring additional \ncoordination between the United States and these countries will allow \nfor the development of an international strategy that will combat this \nproblem too.\n  In particular, fighting this problem effectively is going to require \nimproved cooperation from Mexico. I believe that Congress stands ready \nto support the administration in international efforts to stem the flow \nof drugs into the United States.\n  The fourth title cracks down hard on the ability of rogue companies \nto sell large amounts of precursor chemicals that are diverted to \nclandestine labs. Provisions in this title limit the package size that \nprecursor drugs may be sold in at the retail level, and require the \nproduct to be packaged in blister packs when technically feasible.\n  Mr. President, this title contains carefully drafted provisions that \nbalance the need to crack down on precursor chemicals against the need \nto maintain the availability of drugs such as pseudoephedrine for \nlegitimate purposes. I recognize the need to take measures to decrease \nthe availability of the precursor list I chemicals for diversion to \nclandestine methamphetamine laboratories. However, in so doing, we must \nnot restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to use common remedies \nfor colds and allergies, or subject sales of such legal products to \nonerous recordkeeping at the retail level.\n  It is no secret that I have been critical of the DEA's proposed \nregulations in this area. The provisions included in S. 1965, I \nbelieve, will achieve our common goal without the negative side effects \nof the proposed regulations.\n  In fact, I believe that our provisions with regard to the sale of the \nprecursor chemicals pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine go much \nfarther in preventing the diversion of these products while maintaining \ntheir access for legitimate uses. In this bill we lower the single \ntransaction threshold for pseudoephedrine--containing products from \n1,000 grams to 24 grams. Our bill also allows the Attorney General to \nlower this single--transaction limit further, as necessary to prevent \nthe diversion of products to meth labs. That provision was inserted to \nmeet the concerns of Senator Feinstein and others who believe that \nretail sales are a significant source of precursor drugs for \nclandestine labs.\n  Some of my colleagues may have seen an article this morning in USA \nToday, which leaves one with the impression that retail cough and cold \npreparations are a significant source of precursor drugs. I have spent \na great deal of time studying this issue, consulting extensively with \nthe DEA and State and local law enforcement officials in Utah. I remain \nunconvinced that legitimate products purchased at the retail level are \na significant source of precursor drugs for the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine. Nevertheless, I\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nhave included several provisions in this title that will limit the \npotential diversion of legitimate products at the retail level to \nmethamphetamine labs.\n  When this legislation is enacted, I will continue to monitor this \nsituation very closely. If the data show that retail products \ncontaining pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine are contributing to \nthe methamphetamine problems, I pledge to revisit this issue next \nCongress.\n  In addition, we have strict reporting and recordkeeping provisions \nfor those companies that sell ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and \nphenylpropanolamine by mail. These provisions - which go far beyond \nwhat DEA has proposed to date--will shut down loopholes in current law \nthat allow these products to get to the meth labs.\n  This bill gets tough on those who divert legitimate products to \nclandestine methamphetamine labs. I would have it no other way.\n  In anticipation of questions regarding this provision, I want to \nunderscore that the bill does not apply to dietary supplement products \nin any way.\n  Finally, an important title of our legislation improves and expands \nexisting education and research activities related to methamphetamine \nand other drug abuse. This approach, I feel, is key to the success of a \ncomprehensive drug control policy. Increased emphasis on research, \nprevention, and treatment go hand in hand with efforts to reduce \nsupply.\n  Consequently, our bill creates a methamphetamine interagency working \ngroup to design, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive \nmethamphetamine education and prevention program. It requires public \nhealth monitoring programs to monitor methamphetamine abuse in the \nUnited States.\n  In addition, the legislation calls for a methamphetamine national \nadvisory panel to develop a program to educate distributors of \nprecursor chemicals and supplies to decrease the likelihood of \ndiversion of these products to clandestine laboratories, and creates a \nsuspicious orders task force to improve the reporting of suspicious \norders and sales of list I chemicals.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to make clear that the legislation \nwe introduce today represents a consensus position based on literally \nhundreds of hours of consultations with representatives of Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement, as well as substance abuse prevention \nand treatment experts and representatives of manufacturers of \nlegitimate products containing the precursor chemicals.\n  In particular, I want to recognize the input from the Drug \nEnforcement Agency and Department of Justice, who have been \ninstrumental in the development of a bill that we all can support.\n  I want to thank Senator Biden for his leadership role in developing \nthis bill and for his willingness to move forward in a bipartisan way \nso that we can take steps toward addressing this important public \nhealth problem this session.\n  In addition, I want to recognize the significant contributions of \nSenator Wyden, who early on indicated his interest in working with me \nto develop a bipartisan bill, and Senators Specter, DeWine, Ashcroft, \nand Harkin.\n  Finally, I must also recognize the efforts of Senators Feinstein, \nGrassley, and Kyl. They have contributed significant time and energy to \nbringing this issue before Congress and are strong advocates for \nlegislation to deal with this problem.\n  The bill that my colleagues and I rise to introduce today represents \na bipartisan, comprehensive response to control the methamphetamine \nabuse problem in our country. We still have a few issues to work out as \nthis bill moves forward, but I am confident that we can quickly address \nany remaining areas of concern, so that we can pass this bill this \nsession.\n  Methamphetamine abuse is a growing threat to the public health of \nthis country. I hope that the Senate can move quickly to pass this bill \nso we can enact a comprehensive program to stop this problem in its \ntracks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Methamphetamine is a very dangerous and harmful drug. \n     It is highly addictive and is associated with permanent brain \n     damage in long-term users.\n       (2) The abuse of methamphetamine has increased dramatically \n     since 1990. This increased use has led to devastating effects \n     on individuals and the community, including--\n       (A) a dramatic increase in deaths associated with \n     methamphetamine ingestion;\n       (B) an increase in the number of violent crimes associated \n     with methamphetamine ingestion; and\n       (C) an increase in criminal activity associated with the \n     illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor \n     compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in \n     the United States.\n       (3) Illegal methamphetamine manufacture and abuse presents \n     an imminent public health threat that warrants aggressive law \n     enforcement action, increased research on methamphetamine and \n     other substance abuse, increased coordinated efforts to \n     prevent methamphetamine abuse, and increased monitoring of \n     the public health threat methamphetamine presents to the \n     communities of the United States.\n    TITLE I--IMPORTATION OF METHAMPHETAMINE AND PRECURSOR CHEMICALS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, the story of our failure to foresee--and \nprevent--the crack cocaine epidemic is one of the most significant \npublic policy mistakes in modern history. Although warning signs of an \noutbreak flared over several years, few took action until it was too \nlate.\n  We now face similar warning signs with another drug--methamphetamine. \nWithout swift action now, history may repeat itself.\n  So today, Senator Hatch and I, along with Senators Feinstein, \nSpecter, Harkin, Wyden, D'Amato, and DeWine are introducing legislation \nto address this new emerging drug epidemic before it is too late.\n  Within the past few years the production and use of methamphetamine \nhave risen dramatically. Newspaper and media reports over the past few \nmonths have highlighted these increases. I have been tracking this \ndevelopment and pushing legislation to increase Federal penalties and \nstrengthen Federal laws against methamphetamine production, \ntrafficking, and use since 1990.\n  And what I and others have found is alarming: From 1991 to 1994 \nmethamphetamine-related emergency room episodes increased 256 percent--\nthe increase from 1993 to 1994 alone was 75 percent--with more than \n17,000 people overdosing and being brought to the emergency room \nbecause of methamphetamine. A survey of high school seniors, which only \nmeasures the use of ``ice''--a fraction of the methamphetamine market--\nfound that in 1995 86,000 12th graders had used ``ice'' in the past \nyear, 39,000 had used it in the past month, and 3,600 reported using \n``ice'' daily. This same survey found that only 54 percent of high \nschool seniors perceived great risk in trying ``ice''--down from 62 \npercent in 1990. And 27 percent of these children said it would be easy \nfor them to get ``ice'' if they wanted it.\n  The cause for concern over a methamphetamine epidemic is further \nfueled by drug-related violence--again something we saw during the \ncrack era--that we can expect to flourish with methamphetamine as well. \nPutting the problem in perspective, drug experts claim that ``ice \nsurpasses PCP in inducing violent behavior.''\n  In addition to the violence--both random and irrational--associated \nwith methamphetamine users, there is also the enormous problem of \nviolence among methamphetamine traffickers and the environmental and \nlife-threatening conditions endemic in the clandestine labs where \nmethamphetamine is produced.\n  The bill we are now introducing addresses all of the dangers of \nmethamphetamine and takes bold actions to stop this potential epidemic \nin its tracks. The Hatch-Biden methamphetamine enforcement bill will \ntake six major steps toward cracking down on methamphetamine \nproduction, trafficking, and use, particularly use by the most \nvulnerable population threatened by this drug--our young people.\n  First and foremost, we increase penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine.\n  Second, we crack down on methamphetamine producers and traffickers by \nincreasing the penalties for the illicit possession and trafficking of \nthe precursor chemicals and equipment used to manufacture \nmethamphetamine.\n  Third, we increase the reporting requirements and restrictions on the \nlegitimate sales of products containing these precursor chemicals in \norder to prevent their diversion, and we impose even greater \nrequirements on all firms which sell these products by mail. This \nincludes the use of civil penalties and injunctions to stop legitimate \nfirms from recklessly providing precursor chemicals to methamphetamine \nmanufacturers.\n  Fourth, we address the international nature of methamphetamine \nmanufacture and trafficking by coordinating international enforcement \nefforts and strengthening provisions against the illegal importation of \nmethamphetamine and precursor chemicals.\n  Fifth, we ensure that methamphetamine manufacturers who endanger the \nlife on any individual or endanger the environment while making \nmethamphetamine will receive enhanced prison sentences.\n  Finally, we require Federal, State and local law enforcement and \npublic health officials to stay ahead of any potential growth in the \nmethamphetamine epidemic by creating national working groups on the \nprotecting the public from the dangers of methamphetamine production, \ntrafficking, and abuse.\n  The Hatch-Biden bill addresses all of the needs with a fair balance \nbetween the needs of manufacturers and consumers of legitimate products \nwhich contain methamphetamine precursor chemicals and the need to \nprotect the public by instituting harsh penalties for any and all \nmethamphetamine-related activities.\n  This legislation is the crucial, comprehensive tool we need to stay \nahead of the methamphetamine epidemic and to avoid the mistakes made \nduring the early stages of the crack-cocaine explosion.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch and my other colleagues who share my \ndesire to move now on the problem of methamphetamine. I also want to \nthank the Clinton administration, which also was determined to act now \non this issue and worked with us in developing several of the \nprovisions in this bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting our children and \nour society from the devastations of methamphetamine by supporting this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nHatch, Senator Biden, and others to introduce the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Control Act of 1996.\n  Methamphetamine is one of the most insidious drugs to hit the streets \nin decades. In a few short years in Oregon, methamphetamine has become \nthe second most frequently detected drug in workplace drug testing and \nin motor vehicle driver drug checks. This drug has become not only a \nscourge on Oregon's streets, increasing crime and creating toxic \nenvironmental hazards in the labs where it is produced, but has \nrepercussions throughout the social services system as well. Foster \ncare caseloads have increased because of the meth epidemic, and drug \ntreatment centers are struggling with rising numbers of people needing \nhelp to escape the effects of this highly addictive and damaging drug.\n  According to Sheriff Robert Kennedy, who serves the State in Jackson \nCounty in southwestern Oregon, methamphetamine arrests in his county \nhave increased 1,100 percent in the past 5 years. This drug has become \nan urban and rural problem, and is being abused across the economic and \nsocial spectrum. Statewide, the Oregon Narcotics Enforcement \nAssociation and others have joined together to fight the public safety \nand health problems associated with methamphetamine.\n  From the problems associated with cleaning up labs, to stopping the \ninflux\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nof Mexican-manufactured methamphetamine from coming into Oregon, law \nenforcement officials across the State have told me that meth is \nquickly becoming a major problem demanding high priority.\n  That is why I am pleased today to join in the effort to help the \ncountry's law enforcement officers fight the methamphetamine epidemic. \nThe Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act takes on the battle \nagainst the drug on a number of fronts.\n  To combat the precursor drugs manufactured across the border in \nMexico, this legislation includes a long-arm provision that allows the \nUnited States to prosecute people who manufacture methamphetamine \nprecursor chemicals, with an intent to import them into our country.\n  Here at home, the bill significantly increases penalties for illegal \ntrafficking in methamphetamine. Penalties for methamphetamine \ntrafficking have been too low for too long. This bill will make drug \ndealers think twice by making penalties for dealing methamphetamine \ncomparable to those for crack cocaine.\n  The legislation also cracks down on trafficking in the precursor \nchemicals used to produce methamphetamine, increasing penalties and \nallowing law enforcement increased flexibility to obtain injunctions to \nstop the production and sale of precursor chemicals when an individual \nor company knowingly sells these chemicals to methamphetamine dealers.\n  Finally, the act addresses the problem that many methamphetamine \nproducers use legal, over-the-counter drugs, containing precursor \nchemicals, to manufacture methamphetamine. The bill will confront this \nin a direct way by limiting bulk quantities of these drugs that can be \nsold over the counter and, at the same time, creating a safe harbor for \nretailers so smaller quantities of the drugs can be sold to consumers \nwho need unimpeded access to these helpful and commonly used products.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, every 4 hours, an illicit \nlab can produce a quarter pound of methamphetamine that sells for \n$2,000. These labs can be set up anywhere--in cars, hotel rooms, and \nabandoned buildings. Their byproducts pollute the area of the lab with \ncarcinogenic toxins and, often times, these dangerous chemicals are \ndumped by the side of the road, in waterways or in other public areas.\n  It is time for Congress to join in the fight against this drug that \npollutes our communities, drives crime and violence, and floods our \nsocial services systems. I am pleased to join in this effort, and I \ncommend my colleagues for their bipartisan efforts and hard work in \ncrafting this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in February, Iowa was featured on the \nfront page of the New York Times--but it wasn't the kind of publicity I \nwant to see our State receive. The article highlighted a problem that \nis exploding around Iowa--the growing use of the drug methamphetamine, \ncommonly known as meth or crank.\n  There's no doubt that meth has invaded our State with a fury. The \nstatistics tell the tragic story. More than 35 percent of new \nincarcerations in Iowa involve meth. Federal methamphetamine \ninvestigations have doubled and meth arrests have more than tripled \nover the past 2 years. The Division of Iowa Narcotics Enforcement has \nreported a nearly 400-percent increase in meth seizures in a 1-year \nperiod. And in our largest city of Des Moines, meth seizures increased \nmore than 4,000 percent.\n  The number of labs producing meth has also increased dramatically. \nAnd many of the traffickers are illegal aliens from Mexico, presenting \nadditional problems and burdens on law enforcement. This is especially \nchallenging because Iowa currently has no Immigration and \nNaturalization Service office.\n  Meth is now termed Iowa's ``drug of choice.'' And unfortunately, its \nspread has left no part of our State untouched.\n  In a word, meth is poison. It destroys lives, families, and \ncommunities. The experts describe methamphetamine as a synthetic \ncentral nervous system stimulant--the strongest and most intense of the \namphetamine group. A leading Iowa doctor referred to meth as the most \nmalignant, addictive drug known to mankind.\n  Meth is a killer. It causes brain, heart, liver, and kidney damage. \nIt breaks down the immune system and often leads to paranoid psychosis, \nviolent behavior, and death.\n  The narcotic is primarily used by young male adults. But experts have \nfound that a growing number of women and teens are now turning to meth.\n  A majority of Iowa law enforcement officials responding to a recent \nGovernor's Alliance on Substance Abuse Survey ranked meth as the No. \n1 problematic drug in their area.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help States like Iowa \nfight back. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Enforcement Act of 1996 \ncracks down on the use and manufacture of methamphetamine by increasing \nthe sentencing scheme to be comparable to crack cocaine. It also goes \nafter the precursor chemicals and equipment used to manufacture \nmethamphetamine as well as companies who intentionally sell chemicals \nfor manufacture of meth. The bill also includes public health \nmonitoring and a task force and advisory panel for public education.\n  This legislation will complement another initiative I have been \nworking on. I have spent a lot of time with local, State, and Federal \nlaw enforcement officials in Iowa who tell me that they simply don't \nhave the resources necessary to adequately tackle this skyrocketing new \nchallenge. That's why I am working hard to increase the arsenal in \nIowa's fight against meth and to help our law enforcement on the \nfrontlines.\n  Several years ago, Congress created the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area initiative to provide added resources to highly \naffected areas. The program has proven useful, but it has been limited \nto urban areas such as Miami and Philadelphia.\n  I believe that it's time to apply this model to help Iowa and \nsurrounding Midwestern States to combat the large methamphetamine \ntrafficking networks, curtail sale and distribution of the narcotic and \nreduce related violence. This would open the door for the hiring of \nadditional field investigators, chemists, prosecutors and other law \nenforcement personnel specifically targeted to the methamphetamine \nproblem.\n  I recently wrote to National Drug Control Policy Director, Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey, outlining just such a plan. Because of the urgent need I \nproposed a $7 million increase in resources to begin such an \ninitiative. I will continue to work with Director McCaffrey and my \ncolleagues on the appropriations committee to make this a reality.\n  People in Iowa have worked hard to cultivate a good quality of life. \nThey have worked hard to make their communities a place to raise a \nfamily, a safe place, a decent place, but drug dealers are planting the \nseeds of destruction and are wreaking havoc on small towns and rural \ncommunities all over America.\n  We must win back our communities and we must fight back. It's a \nquestion of priorities and the determination to defend our homes from a \nthreat that is right down the street, not halfway around the world.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing a bill that will combat a plague on our citizens and \ncommunities: methamphetamine.\n  Methamphetamine is an addictive synthetic drug, used by an increasing \nnumber of students and young professionals. Methamphetamine abuse is \nnow the fourth cause of emergency room visits in this country. Clearly, \nan epidemic has arisen in the United States.\n  In the early 1990's, emergency room episodes caused by \nmethamphetamine use rose 350 percent, while deaths nearly tripled, \naccording to the DEA.\n  While methamphetamine use has increased dramatically in the Southwest \nand Midwest regions of this country, officials have recognized a trend \nshowing that the methamphetamine trade is moving eastward. The whole \ncountry is at risk.\n  The growing methamphetamine trade demands immediate and tough action, \nespecially against the traffickers that are selling this poison to our \nchildren. This bill is a sound response to the emerging epidemic.\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n  As methamphetamine abuse has experienced a massive growth, the purity \nof the drug has increased to the highest potency in 12 years. And not \nonly has the methamphetamine itself changed in the past few years, but \nso has the traffickers. Mexico-based criminal organizations have mostly \nreplaced the outlaw motorcycle gangs who had monopolized the \nmethamphetamine production and distribution.\n  These Mexican drug traffickers are self-sufficient in all aspects of \nthe methamphetamine production and trade. They are able to purchase the \nprecursor drugs internationally, produce the drug, and transport the \nmethamphetamine across the border into the U.S. It differs from the \ncocaine trade in that the Mexican criminal groups can operate this \ntrade without sharing profits with the Colombian cartels.\n  According to a Justice report, the seizure of methamphetamine from \nMexico to the U.S. rose dramatically from 6.5 kilograms in 1992 to 306 \nkilograms in 1993 to a whopping 653 kilograms in 1995. That is an \nincrease of 1,000 percent in just 3 years.\n  In response to the sudden and dramatic increase in the trafficking of \nmethamphetamine across the southern border, this bill will impose \npenalties of up to 10 years for the manufacturing of precursor drugs \nwith the intent of importing it into this country.\n  The salient points of this bill include: One, enhanced penalties for \nthe manufacture and possession of the equipment used to make the \ncontrolled substances; two, seizure and forfeiture of trafficking in \nprecursor chemicals; and three, provides the Attorney General with the \nauthority to shut down the production and sale of the precursor \nchemicals if the individual or company knowingly sell the precursor in \norder to produce methamphetamine.\n  Most importantly, the penalties associated with trafficking \nmethamphetamine will be raised to make it comparable with crack \ncocaine. A 5-year mandatory minimum will be imposed for every 5 grams \ntrafficked and 10 years to life for a conviction involving the \ntrafficking of 50 grams.\n  The statistics do not reveal the effects the drug has on the addicts \nwho use it. The effects are appalling. The methamphetamine user will \nexperience an irritable and paranoid effect and then begin the downward \nspiral of a crippling depression. As with any drug addict, the family \nsuffers tremendously through the entire occurrence.\n  But it is not only those close to the methamphetamine user who bears \nthe burden. An article in the magazine Police Chief last March \ndescribes the perspective of law enforcement that encounters the \naltered behavior of the addict. ``Simply put, when methamphetamine \nproduction and abuse become prevalent in any geographic area, the \nancillary criminal behavior in that area will grow as well.''\n  It is clear that this epidemic must be addressed here and now. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill and urge its immediate passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, methamphetamine is, if not the most dangerous \ndrug in America today, one of the fastest spreading. In Western States, \nmeth is already the crack epidemic of the 1990's.\n  Meth is cheap, easy to manufacture, and readily available. The drug \nis a synthetic compound that stimulates the central nervous system and \ncauses psychosis, paranoid delusions, and acts of violence.\n  The drug is most prevalent in four Western cities--Phoenix, Los \nAngeles, San Diego, and San Francisco. The damage the drug has caused \nin Arizona is startling. Phoenix police attribute meth use as a factor \nin the 40 percent jump in homicides in 1994. Meth-related deaths in \nPhoenix have soared from 11 in 1991 to 122 in 1994. According to the \nArizona Criminal Justice Commission, 1 in 17 Arizona high school \nstudents reported using meth in the last 30 days. The drug is also \nbehind the headlines of several horrific crimes that have occurred in \nthe State.\n  Arizona has taken action, and a methamphetamine bill offered by State \nRepresentative Paul Mortenson, passed the legislature in Phoenix and \nwas signed into law by Governor Symington this April. The bill \nincreases the penalties for those who produce and sell the drug, and \ncriminalizes the possession of equipment or chemicals used in the \nmanufacture of dangerous drugs.\n  Appropriately, the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, is \naddressing the methamphetamine explosion. I would particularly like to \npoint out the fine work of Senator Feinstein on this issue. Senator \nFeinstein introduced the predecessor to this bill, and last month \nsuccessfully amended a defense bill to stop the Federal Government from \ninadvertently selling to illicit manufacturers the chemicals used to \nmake meth.\n  The Methamphetamine Control Act accomplishes much. The bill:\n  Increases the penalties for the trafficking and manufacture of \nmethamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. The new penalties put the \npenalties for meth on the same level with crack;\n  Increases the penalties for the illegal manufacture and possession of \nequipment used to manufacture meth;\n  Requires those convicted of offenses relating to methamphetamine to \nprovide restitution to the United States for the costs incurred by the \nUnited States for the cleanup associated with the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine;\n  Regulates the sale of over-the-counter drugs that contain the \nprecursor chemicals for methamphetamine if the sale exceeds a \nsubstantial threshold quantity; and\n  Establishes a Methamphetamine Interagency Task Force to develop \nstrategies to fight the use of this drug.\n  The devastating effects of meth are seen every day in our jails, our \nemergency rooms, and our morgues. We must do everything we can to \nwithstand this tide of poison. America can't afford another epidemic \nlike crack, which destroyed countless individuals, families, and \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Campbell (for himself, Mr. Chafee and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1966. A bill to extend the legislative authority for the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Foundation to establish a commemorative \nwork; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS MEMORIAL ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Chafee and Senator Moseley-Braun, today I introduce \nlegislation that seeks to extend the legislative authority for the \nconstruction of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial and for \nthe Foundation raising funds to construct the memorial.\n  Mr. President, in 1986, the Congress enacted and President Reagan \nsigned into law legislation establishing a Black Revolutionary War \nPatriots Memorial, a memorial to honor the more than 5,000 African-\nAmericans who fought for this country during the Revolutionary War. In \norder to appropriately recognize the bravery and sacrifice of these \nhonorable and distinguished patriots, Public Law 99-558 sought to \nestablish a suitable memorial, a monument which will be located on the \nMall here in Washington, DC. When complete, the memorial will be the \nfirst monument on the Mall to be dedicated solely to the \naccomplishments of African-Americans.\n  The centerpiece of P.L. 99-558 was the establishment of the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Foundation, as a not-for-profit organization \nwhose sole charter is to raise the necessary funding for the costs \nassociated with constructing the memorial.\n  When enacted, the foundation was authorized to operate for a period \nof 10 years, no more. While the foundation has raised a substantial \namount of funding, it remains short of its $9.5 million goal. This \nlegislation would provide for a 2-year extension of the legislative \nauthority for the establishment of the memorial, providing the \nfoundation with valuable time to complete its fundraising.\n  I have a couple of reasons for wishing to see this extension approved \nby Congress. First, this memorial serves a noble purpose, honoring the \nservice and patriotism of individuals long deserving of this praise. \nSecond, the sculptor who has been commissioned to design this memorial \nis a Coloradan named Ed Dwight. Mr. Dwight, the first African-American \nastronaut, is an accomplished artist residing in Denver. His work is \nknown across the world, and I would like to see his design for the\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nBlack Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial become a reality and be \nsituated near several of this country's most distinguished monuments.\n  Mr. President, I believe Congress has demonstrated its commitment to \nthe establishment of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial by \nauthorizing its construction almost 10 years ago. In addition, my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator John Chafee and Representative Nancy \nJohnson, have also introduced legislation which will raise funds for \nconstruction costs through the minting and issuing of a commemorative \ncoin honoring these patriots. To date, 376 Members have signed on as \ncosponsors to these measures, myself included.\n  It is my hope this legislation will receive the full, expeditious \nsupport of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1968. A bill to reorder United States budget priorities with \nrespect to United States assistance to foreign countries and \ninternational organizations; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   THE FOREIGN AID REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Foreign Aid \nReform Act of 1996. I would like to offer just a few brief remarks \nabout this legislation and its three component parts.\n  First, it bars foreign aid to countries that vote against the United \nStates more often than not in recorded votes at the United Nations.\n  Second, this legislation creates a point of order to require the \nCongress to enact domestic appropriations bills before it considers \nforeign aid bills.\n  Third, this bill prohibits foreign aid to be distributed by agencies \nthat are essentially domestic, and it defines domestic agencies as \nthose not primarily responsible for foreign affairs or national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, 64 percent of American foreign aid recipients voted \nagainst the United States more often than not in the 1995 session of \nthe United Nations. India, for example, received $157 million of \nAmerican taxpayers' money last year--it is the fifth largest recipient \nof American aid--and, yet, it voted against the United States in 83 \npercent of their U.N. votes. India ties Cuba and exceeds Iran in its \nrecord of opposition to American diplomatic goals.\n  In fact, the nations that voted against us a majority of the time at \nthe United Nations received a total of $3.1 billion in foreign aid in \n1996. I find it incredible that we gave $3 billion to nations that \nrefused to offer some consistent support to our diplomatic initiatives.\n  The United States sent troops to Haiti to restore President Aristide \nand sent $123 million in financial aid. The aid continues, but, Mr. \nPresident, Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the \ntime.\n  President Clinton engineered a $40 billion bailout for Mexico, and, \nyet, Mexico voted against us 58 percent of the time in the United \nNations.\n  United Nations votes are based on a range of considerations. However, \nforeign aid is sold to the American people as a program to defend \nAmerican interests, to promote our interests, and to assist our \nfriends, but it is clear that support for our diplomatic efforts is not \na popular response to our generous distribution of aid.\n  The second provision of this bill, Mr. President, subjects the \nforeign operations appropriations bill to a point of order that \nrequires the Congress to complete domestic appropriations prior to \nconsideration of the foreign assistance budget.\n  The foreign operations bill for fiscal year 1996 became law on \nFebruary 12 of this year, but four domestic spending bills remained \nunfinished for another 10 weeks. In fact, foreign operations is \nprobably going to be among the first three appropriations bills that we \nconsider during the current budget process.\n  The American people will have every right to be upset if part of the \nGovernment shuts down, and benefit and payroll checks are not \ndelivered, but the foreign aid checks flow freely. The constitutional \ncharge of the Congress is to attend to the Federal business of the \nAmerican people. The American people worked to earn this money, and we \nshould attend to their business first, not to foreign aid.\n  This bill also takes domestic agencies out of the foreign aid \nbusiness. I will illustrate the need for this provision with some \nrather remarkable examples of waste in just one Agency, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, although I am confident that it exists \nat numerous others.\n  The EPA was one of the few domestic agencies to receive a real \nincrease in its 1996 budget. After receiving an increase in its budget, \nhowever, it awarded 106 grants worth a total of $28 million to foreign \ncountries between 1993 and 1995.\n  The foreign assistance budget sent $600,000 to Communist China, but, \nMr. President, the EPA sent $1,200,000 to Communist China. The EPA, in \neffect, tripled their infusion of American aid. This aid went to a \ncountry that voted against us 79 percent of the time in the United \nNations and with which we recorded a $34 billion trade deficit.\n  The EPA awarded a $20,000 grant to the Chinese Ministry of Public \nSecurity. Of course, the Ministry of Public Security is not an \nenvironmental agency, but a national police force that issued shoot to \nkill orders during the pro-democracy rallies of 1989. The grant was \ndesigned for ``halon management and maintenance training,'' which, Mr. \nPresident, turns out to be upkeep of fire extinguishers. The taxpayers \nare responsible for this program, Mr. President, because the Clean Air \nAct obligates the American people to assist developing nations. In my \nopinion, however, a nation that builds and maintains nuclear weapons \nshould be able to maintain their fire extinguisher without the hard-\nearned American taxpayers' money.\n\n  The EPA sent $175,000 to China to build a clearinghouse in Peking for \ninformation about Chinese coal mining issues. The American taxpayer \nwill be delighted to know that they bought the Chinese a $25,000 \ncomputer and spent $4,500 to air condition the clearinghouse office.\n  These are not isolated incidents. It goes on: $350,000 for a \nrefrigeration project, $160,000 for an energy efficiency center, and \n$125,000 to assist in the construction of an environmental industrial \npark. This is to a country that boasts a $34 billion trade surplus.\n  China is not the only foreign nation to receive EPA grants. Nigeria, \nwhich voted against us 69 percent of the time at the United Nations, \nearns billions of dollars each year in oil exports, but the EPA sent \nthem $410,000 to study gas emissions.\n  Oman, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, received a \n$100,000 grant. Oman, indeed, voted against us 65 percent of the time \nin the United Nations. I find it impossible to imagine that this \nPersian Gulf monarchy could not afford $100,000 for an environmental \nstudy of its own environmental issues.\n  The list continues. The Swedish National Board for Industrial and \nTechnical Development received $50,000 to study efficient lighting. It \nappalls me that our money--American taxpayers' money--is going to \nSweden, one of the most technically advanced countries in the world, to \nstudy efficient lights.\n  The EPA sent $50,000 to a university in Austria to help host a \nconference in an Israeli beach resort town on indoor air quality. The \nEPA also sent $50,000 to the Clean Air Society of Australia and New \nZealand, two of the nations with the cleanest air in the world, and \n$140,000 to a university in Denmark.\n  Mr. President, these are not Third World nations, and I certainly do \nnot believe the American people need to fund conferences and research \nin countries that can easily afford these efforts.\n  The grants that I describe were all funded with Environmental \nProtection Agency discretionary money. As you know, the EPA is very \nvocal about its budget. The EPA claims the environment will suffer if \nits budget is scrutinized, but, clearly, millions of dollars are \nsquandered.\n  I think that these grants reflect a profound lack of appreciation for \nthe hard work that the American people perform to pay their taxes. If \nthe Federal Government can find no better use of the taxpayers' money \nthan these wasteful grants, then Washington should return it to the \nAmerican people.\n  The American people do not carry their lunch buckets to work in order \nto send their dollars to the security forces that order soldiers to \nshoot students in China. The American people do not\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nlabor in order to send Austrian professors to beach resorts. The \nAmerican people do not labor to help the Sultan of Oman develop a list \nof emissions from his bountiful oil wells. Unfortunately, however, that \nis the case. It is an outrageous waste of American tax dollars. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Foreign Aid Reform Act \nof 1996.\n       By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mrs. Kassebaum, \n     Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Bingaham, Mr. Chafee and Mr. \n     Wyden):\n\n  S. 1969. A bill to establish a Commission on Retirement Income \nPolicy; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE COMMISSION ON RETIREMENT INCOME POLICY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the ``Commission on \nRetirement Income Policy Act of 1996'' with my colleagues Bill Bradley, \nBill Cohen, Bob Kerrey, Nancy Kassebaum, Jeff Bingaman, John Chafee, \nand Ron Wyden. As you can see, this is a bi-partisan effort by many of \nthe members of the Senate/House Ad Hoc Steering Committee on Retirement \nIncome Security. This bill is a companion to a bill introduced in the \nHouse on March 13, 1996, by Nancy Johnson and Earl Pomeroy HR 3077.\n  The objective of the Steering Committee, which is co-chaired by \nSenator Bradley, Representative Nancy Johnson and Earl Pomeroy, in its \nfirst year of operation has been to engage Members of Congress and \nexperts in the private sector in a national dialog concerning this \ncountry's retirement income policies. Over the past 9 months, the \nSteering Committee has hosted a series of luncheons for members and \nstaff to discuss retirement savings issues. During that time, we heard \nfrom a variety of experts who represent a cross-section of views and \ninterest in the retirement policy field.\n  Although, generally I am not a great fan of Commissions, I believe \nafter this past year of informal meetings with Members and private \nsector experts that it is imperative that we as a Nation go back to \nbasics regarding all of the components that make up retirement income. \nI am referring to the three-legged-stool approach which was so nicely \nillustrated at our first luncheon on November 9, 1995, by Deborah \nBriceland-Betts, Executive Director, Older Women's League. The three-\nlegged-stool which represents our national retirement savings is \ncollapsing. The problem is that not only is one leg shaky instead all \nthree legs, employer pension benefit plans, Social Security and \nindividual savings, are wobbly.\n  The private pension system simply does not cover a majority of \nworkers. Those employees fortunate enough to have coverage will find \ntheir pension plans will not provide them with sufficient retirement \nincome to meet their expected needs. The Social Security program which \nis now over 60 years old, is heading for a collapse under the weight of \nthe baby boom generation. Personal savings have been in a downward \nspiral for years, Americans have become used to personal deficit \nspending.\n  Financial planners, actuaries, pension consultants, and economists \nhave begun to warn the public and policy makers that, if current trends \ncontinue, the retirement income of future retirees will fall far short \nof their anticipated needs. Yet, more pressing issues, such as health \ncare costs and coverage, cuts in government spending, and other \ndomestic concerns, have made if difficult for the message to get \nthrough to the American public. By the time individuals start to plan \nfor retirement income needs they often become overwhelmed. Faced with \nfalling wages and competing savings demands for college for the kids or \nproviding for long-term health care needs for aging parents, many baby \nboomer sense they are in a deep financial hole from the start.\n  If we continue to ignore this looming retirement crisis and wait \nuntil the baby boomers begin to retire, it will be too late. Future \nretirees must save throughout their earnings lifetimes and we as a \nsociety must find the way to shore up the Social Security and private \npension systems by determining how the two systems can work as a team \nto meet this Nation's goal of adequate retirement income for all \nAmericans.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to outline the bill. First, the \nCommission will review trends in retirement savings in the United \nStates, and will evaluate existing federal incentives and programs \ndesigned to encourage and protect such savings. In developing \nrecommendations, the bill requires the Commission to consider the \namounts of retirement income that future retirees will need (including \namounts needed to pay for medical and long-term care), the various \nsources of retirement income which are available to individuals, the \nneeds of retirement plan sponsors for simplicity and reasonable cost, \nand the recent shift away from defined benefit plans toward defined \ncontribution plans. The Commission will gather information through a \nseries of public hearings and through receipt of testimony and evidence \nfrom a wide variety of witnesses.\n  This Commission must report to Congress and the President within 1 \nyear after being established. It will recommend concrete steps to \nensure that future retirees have adequate retirement income. While the \nCommission will consider savings generally, it will focus on private \nsavings vehicles and will not make recommendations regarding an \noverhaul of the Social Security Program, rather it will look to ways \nthe private and public programs can work together. The Commission's \nrecommendations will address the role that traditional pension plan \ncoverage should play in reaching retirement income goals, as well as \nthe role to be played by other retirement savings tools such as 401(k)s \nand Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The bill requires that any \nrecommendations for new federal incentives or programs to encourage \nretirement savings also identify the funds necessary to finance these \ninitiatives.\n  Finally, the only change that we have made from the House bill is the \ncompliment of the Commission. Our Senate version has put greater \nemphasis on having private sector representation. The Commission will \nhave 16 members, four appointed by the President, of which at least two \nmust be from private life. Three members each, appointed by both the \nMajority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, of which at least two must \nbe from private life. Three members each, appointed by both the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives and the Minority Leader the House of \nRepresentatives, of which at least two must be from private life.\n  Mr. President in closing, I along with Senator Bradley, would also \nlike to acknowledge with special gratitude, the American Society of \nPension Actuaries for their letter of endorsement, which we would like \ninserted in the Record, for this bill we are introducing today in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Society of Pension Actuaries, Actuaries, \n           Consultants, Administrators and Other Benefits \n           Professionals,\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Jim Jeffords,\n     513 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The purpose of the American Society \n     of Pension Actuaries is to educate pension actuaries, \n     consultants, and administrators and other benefits \n     professionals and to preserve and enhance the private pension \n     system as part of the development of a cohesive and coherent \n     national retirement income policy.\n       ASPA supports the establishment of a commission on \n     retirement income policy. We are very excited that you and \n     Senator Bradley plan to introduce legislation in the Senate \n     as a companion bill to HR 3077. When Representatives Nancy \n     Johnson and Earl Pomeroy introduced HR 3077, a bipartisan \n     call for the creation of a special commission to examine the \n     scope of our nation's growing retirement savings crisis and \n     recommend policies to help improve the economic security of \n     retired workers, ASPA applauded the initiative shown by this \n     session of Congress to safeguard our nation's economic \n     future.\n       Because of the looming retirement income crisis that will \n     occur with the convergence of the Social Security trust \n     fund's potential exhaustion and the World War II ``baby \n     boomers'' reaching retirement age, ASPA created a National \n     Retirement Income Policy Committee to study these alarming \n     issues and suggest potential solutions. Without a thriving \n     private pension system, ASPA's NRIP Committee believes there \n     will be insufficient resources to provide adequate retirement \n     income for future generations.\n       ASPA's NRIP Committee devoted two years to preparing six \n     in-depth research papers on this topic. The National \n     Retirement\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\n     Income Policy Research Papers, published in 1994, present an \n     integrated plan for avoiding a retirement income crisis and \n     develop constructive solutions to: (a) stimulate interest and \n     debate over retirement income policy issues; (2) make \n     specific policy recommendations on what ``retirement \n     savings'' for Americans should encompass; and (3) call for \n     the creation of a commission on retirement income policy as \n     described in HR 3077.\n       Enclosed are the ASPA NRIP papers Executive Summary and \n     Research Papers which are: Income Replacement in Retirement, \n     Social Security, Working Beyond Retirement Age, Personal \n     Savings, Targets for Personal Savings, and Private Plans.\n       We believe you will find these papers to be highly \n     creative, quite stimulating and helpful in understanding the \n     urgent need for legislation such as HR 3077 and the creation \n     of a retirement income commission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Chester J. Salkind,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today, Senator Jim Jeffords and I are \nintroducing a bill to create a special national commission to study \nretirement issues and recommend specific policies to improve the \neconomic security of retired Americans. Millions of Americans are not \nsaving nearly enough through pension plans or in their own personal \nsavings accounts to provide for their retirements, and they cannot rely \nupon the Social Security system to provide a comfortable life for them. \nA crisis is brewing--and we will only be able to prevent it if we focus \non solving our retirement savings problems now. That is what this \ncommission is for, to start that process comprehensively and in \nearnest.\n  The aging of our population is a principal contributor to the \nimpending retirement crisis. Baby boomers are turning 50 this year, 1 \nevery 7 seconds. The economic implications of this demographic shift \nare tremendous. By 2030, 20 percent of our population will be retired, \ncompared to 12 percent today. There will also be a lot fewer workers in \nour economy to support a lot more retirees. In the 1940's, there were \n42 workers for every retiree. Today, there are 4.8 workers supporting \neach retiree. In 2030, there will be only 2.8.\n  Not only can we expect a lot more retirees, we can expect that they \nwill be retired for a lot longer, with increasingly high expenses. \nPersons working today can expect to live about 25 percent of their \nadult lives in retirement, compared to 7 percent in 1940, because life \nspans are lengthening considerably. Enjoying a longer life is a miracle \nof science and good health management, but it is also very expensive. \nWe will need to support ourselves for more years of retirement, and we \nwill face dramatically rising health care costs, which \ndisproportionately consume the incomes of retired persons, particularly \nas individuals live longer.\n  Meanwhile, the Social Security system is expected to completely \nexhaust its resources by 2029. Yet 60 percent of all retirees (over the \nage of 65) rely on Social Security for at least 70 percent of their \ntotal retirement income.\n  Unless we are hoping to support ourselves on the backs of our \nchildren or are willing to accept impoverishment and destitution in our \nretirements, we as individuals and as a nation need to be sure we are \nsaving enough now to support ourselves in the future. But the fact is \nwe are not. Despite the initiation of savings incentives such as \nfavorable tax treatment for Individual Retirement Accounts and frequent \nwarnings about the need to save, the U.S. savings rate remains among \nthe lowest in the developed world. We should be saving more in our own \npersonal accounts than our parents did since we are anticipating longer \nand more expensive retirements--but we are putting aside less.\n\n  Moreover, far too many Americans will be unable to rely on an \nadequate pension income to supplement their meager savings. Nearly half \nof all full-time workers are not currently covered by an employer-based \nretirement plan. Although two-thirds of middle-aged employees are \nexpected to receive some type of employer pension benefit upon \nretirement, the amount of these benefits may not be adequate to offer \nthem security. The one-third who are not expected to receive pension \nbenefits will be even less secure, forced to continue to work into \ntheir last years or become a burden on their families or whatever \nsocial safety net remains.\n  Concerns about inadequate pension incomes are heightened by recent \ntrends such as the movement away from traditional pension plans toward \nplans which give employees more responsibility for starting, \nmaintaining, and investing their own retirement savings accounts. Our \nnational public policy needs to understand the implications of this \nevolution and develop effective methods to educate and encourage \nAmericans to make responsible investments for their retirements. We \nneed to figure out how to encourage more employers to offer good \npension plans. We need to know what prevents or deters Americans from \nparticipating in those plans. And we need to assess what government \npolicy can do to encourage people to save more.\n  The changing nature of our economic world and the workplace \ncomplicate these tasks. Old solutions may not be effective in today's \nenvironment of downsizing, outsourcing, and international competition. \nThe availability, size, and security of pensions tighten as various \nindustries are squeezed by global competition. Compounding the problem \nis the fact that workers anticipate changing jobs much more often in \nthe past, so that many will leave each workplace before they have had a \nchance to accumulate a decent pension. Women may feel the pain of this \nproblem even more acutely, because more women work part-time or in \nindustries with poorer pension benefits, and because women more often \nenter and leave the workforce in order to care for children or elderly \nparents. We need a new approach to retirement policy that surmounts the \ninsecurity implicit in our changing economic environment and delivers \nincreased availability, security, and portability of decent pensions.\n  We also need to recognize how other social changes play a role in \nreducing the opportunity for saving. For instance, the tendency of \nparents to have children later in life means a shorter period of time \nbetween when the parents become empty-nesters and when they retire. As \na result, baby boomers and other generations will have less time in \nwhich to save for their retirement. This problem is further exacerbated \nby dramatic increases in college education expenses.\n  While we are making some positive steps toward improving retirement \nsecurity through our efforts to save the social security and health \ncare systems, simplify pension laws, and provide increased savings \nincentives, our efforts are piecemeal. Unfortunately, the magnitude of \nthe retirement crisis that is descending upon us is too awesome to be \napproached piecemeal. We need to understand how the elements of \nretirement income--private savings, employer-provided pensions, and \nsocial security--fit together to provide security, as well as how they \ndo not. Then, in a comprehensive fashion, we need to consider what \npublic policies might strengthen these various elements and provide \ntrue retirement security for all Americans.\n  The Retirement Income Policy Commission which Senator Jeffords and I \npropose will be charged with this critical assignment. Sixteen experts \nfrom both the public and private sectors--chosen in a bi-partisan \nfashion by the House, Senate, and President--will sit on the panel \nvoluntarily, without pay. Together, they will begin to explore the \ndimensions of our savings problem, understand its causes, and recommend \nbetter government policies to promote retirement security. Within one \nyear of beginning their investigations, they will report their findings \nto the President and Congress, and the Commission will be dissolved.\n  It would be easy to look the other way as the retirement crisis \nquietly descends upon us, but our responsibilities to our parents, our \nchildren, and ourselves demand that we do not. Taken alone, the aging \nof the baby boom generation gives urgency to this matter; when these \ndemographics are coupled with our low savings rates, inadequate \npensions, potentially debilitated social security system, and current \neconomic and social trends, they harken a disaster. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this modest first step toward averting that \ndisaster.\n  I am pleased that distinguished Senators from both sides of the \naisle--Nancy Kassebaum, Bob Kerrey, John Chafee, Jeff Bingaman, Bill \nCohen, and Ron Wyden--are original co-sponsors of the legislation which \nSenator\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nJeffords and I are introducing today. I am also pleased that \nendorsements of this bill or the very similar House companion bill have \nbeen made by the American Society of Pension Actuaries, the American \nCouncil of Life Insurance, the American Association of Engineering \nSocieties, the National Defined Contribution Council, the Society for \nHuman Resource Management, the American Institute of Chemical \nEngineers, and AT I ask unanimous consent that their letters of \nendorsement be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           American Council of Life Insurance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Earl Pomeroy,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Earl: On behalf of the member companies of the \n     American Council of Life Insurance (ACLI), I want to applaud \n     you for introducing H.R. 3077, the ``Commission on Retirement \n     Income Policy Act of 1996''. Our members strongly support \n     this legislation, which will establish a commission to review \n     and study trends in retirement savings and Federal incentives \n     that encourage and protect such savings.\n       As you may know, the life insurance industry manages more \n     than one-third of the assets held in private pension plans \n     today which represents $750 billion in pension assets. With \n     such a large commitment to the retirement security of \n     millions of Americans, our industry is vitally concerned with \n     issues affecting the continued viability and expansion of our \n     retirement system.\n       Demographic, economic, social and political factors will \n     continue to play a significant role in the financial security \n     of future retirees. The ``coming of age'' of the baby boom \n     generation, the shift in business to smaller service \n     companies, the increasing prevalence of two income families \n     and the financial uncertainties underlying the current \n     structure of Social Security will necessitate a reassessment \n     of our current approaches to retirement income savings. A \n     rational national retirement income policy must be developed, \n     communicated and supported so that resources can be allocated \n     most efficiently, ensuring that each American can have a \n     financially secure retirement.\n       It is imperative to promote a framework in which Americans \n     can enjoy a dignified and financially secure retirement. We \n     believe your legislation can help develop that framework. \n     Accordingly, we applaud the leadership role you have \n     undertaken on this important issue and we would encourage \n     your colleagues to co-sponsor the bill. Please do not \n     hesitate to call on the ACLI for support to help enact the \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carroll A. Campbell, Jr.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                        Engineering Societies,\n\n                                    Washington DC, April 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Neil Abercrombie,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Abercrombie: I am writing on behalf of \n     the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES) to \n     request that your consider co-sponsoring H.R. 3077, which \n     provides for the establishment of the Commission on \n     Retirement Income Policy. The bill was introduced by \n     Representative Earl Pomeroy and Representative Nancy Johnson. \n     A summary of the bill's provisions is attached.\n       AAES is a multidisciplinary organization of 28 engineering \n     and scientific societies whose more than 800,000 members are \n     dedicated to advancing the knowledge, understanding, and \n     practice of engineering in the public interest. The AAES \n     December 1994 Statement on Retirement Income Policy called \n     for a commission on retirement income policy.\n       AAES is committed to improving opportunities for engineers \n     and other workers to earn retirement income that will enable \n     them to remain economically secure at the conclusion of their \n     working lives. As the 21st century approaches, demographic \n     and economic changes are imposing severe strains on the \n     nation's retirement income delivery system. For most workers, \n     including engineers, career-long employment with one company \n     is a thing of the past. Members of the U.S. work force now \n     experience periodic unemployment, frequent job changes, and \n     increasing reliance on part-time, temporary, or contract \n     employment, which affect their current livelihood, and their \n     future retirement income security.\n       AAES believes that the Commission on Retirement Income \n     Policy would give national focus to this crucial issue and \n     would contribute to a fiscally responsible effort to resolve \n     retirement security problems.\n       We hope you will co-sponsor and work for active \n     consideration of H.R. 3077. Thank you very much for your \n     attention and interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     E.L. Cussler,\n     1996 AAES Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Defined\n\n\n                                         Contribution Council,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, May 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Earl Pomeroy,\n     U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Pomeroy: On behalf of the National Defined \n     Contribution Council (``NDCC''), I am writing to applaud your \n     leadership on retirement savings issues and support your \n     efforts to establish a commission on retirement income \n     policy.\n       The NDCC fully supports H.R. 3077, ``The Commission on \n     Retirement Income Policy Act of 1996'' and looks forward to \n     working with you and other members of Congress on its \n     passage.\n       The NDCC is a national organization dedicated to the \n     promotion and protection of the defined contribution \n     industry. It has been organized specifically for plan service \n     providers and focuses on public policy analysis, legislative \n     advocacy and educating the public on the need for retirement \n     savings.\n       The NDCC commends you on your recent proposal to create a \n     commission charged with studying policies to help improve \n     Americans' economic security during retirement. Please feel \n     free to call on us in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Mary Rudie Barneby,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Society for Human\n\n\n                                         Resources Management,\n\n                                                     July 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Nancy Johnson,\n     Hon. Earl Pomeroy,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives Johnson and Pomeroy: On behalf of the \n     Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM, I am writing to \n     enthusiastically endorse H.R. 3077, The Commission on \n     Retirement Income Policy Act of 1996. SHRM is the leading \n     voice of the human resource profession, representing the \n     interests of more than 70,000 professional and student \n     members from around the world.\n       Today most individuals are able to retire comfortably. On \n     average, workers retire earlier and live longer than in the \n     past. However, a number of trends in the economy and \n     workplace suggest that it will become increasingly difficult \n     for American workers to meet their needs for adequate \n     retirement income. The U.S. population is aging rapidly and \n     the elderly live longer. The retirement of the baby boom \n     generation will impose severe pressure on Social Security, \n     Medicare and Medicaid. It is clear that a coordinated \n     strategy is needed.\n       That is why H.R. 3077 is so critical. The establishment of \n     the Commission on Retirement Income Policy would give \n     Congress access to the research and recommendations of \n     experts so that America can meet the challenges ahead. This \n     bipartisan legislation should be cosponsored and actively \n     supported by all members of Congress.\n       Thank you for introducing this key legislation. SHRM looks \n     forward to working with you to see H.R. 3077 considered and \n     passed in 1996.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Michael R. Losey, SPHR,\n     President & CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AT,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Earl Pomeroy,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Pomeroy: As you are aware, AT has a \n     strong interest in its employees and the manner in which they \n     are, or will be, provided for in retirement. Because of our \n     interest in these matters, we were extremely pleased to see \n     the legislation which you and Congresswoman Nancy Johnson \n     have introduced in the House (H.R. 3077). It is our \n     understanding that the legislation, if passed, would \n     establish a commission for the purpose of studying how to \n     best deal with the future retirement needs of this country. \n     The commission, in turn, would issue its findings and \n     recommendations to both the President and Congress by the end \n     of 1997.\n       AT believes that proper planning for the financial needs \n     of retirement and the safeguarding of the retirement savings \n     of U.S. workers is extremely important, and strongly supports \n     your and Rep. Johnson's efforts in introducing and moving \n     H.R. 3077 forward. We urge your House colleagues to co-\n     sponsor this important legislation and to work with us to \n     achieve its swift passage.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Thomas R. Berkelman,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Federal Government Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the private ownership of property is essential to a \n     free society and is an integral part of the American \n     tradition of liberty and limited government;\n       (2) the framers of the United States Constitution, in order \n     to protect private property and liberty, devised a framework \n     of Government designed to diffuse power and limit Government;\n       (3) to further ensure the protection of private property, \n     the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution was \n     ratified to prevent the taking of private property by the \n     Federal Government, except for public use and with just \n     compensation;\n       (4) the purpose of the takings clause of the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, as the Supreme \n     Court stated in Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 \n     (1960), is ``to bar Government from forcing some people alone \n     to bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, \n     should be borne by the public as a whole'';\n       (5) the Federal Government has singled out property holders \n     to shoulder the cost that should be borne by the public, in \n     violation of the just compensation requirement of the takings \n     clause of the fifth amendment of the United States \n     Constitution;\n       (6) there is a need both to restrain the Federal Government \n     in its overzealous regulation of the private sector and to \n     protect private property, which is a fundamental right of the \n     American people; and\n       (7) the incremental, fact-specific approach that courts now \n     are required to employ in the absence of adequate statutory \n     language to vindicate property rights under the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution has been \n     ineffective and costly and there is a need for Congress to \n     clarify the law and provide an effective remedy.\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n       (b) Definitions.--\n       (1) ``just compensation''--\n       (A) means compensation equal to the full extent of a \n     property owner's loss, including the fair market value of the \n     private property taken and business losses arising from a \n     taking, whether the taking is by physical occupation or \n     through regulation, exaction, other means;

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the persons owning and operating civilian nuclear power \n     reactors have the primary responsibility for providing \n     interim storage of spent nuclear fuel from such reactors, by \n     maximizing, to the extent practical, the effective use of \n     existing storage facilities at the site of each civilian \n     nuclear power reactor, and by adding new onsite storage \n     capacity in a timely manner where practical;\n       (2) the Federal Government has the responsibility to \n     encourage and expedite the effective use of existing storage \n     facilities and the addition of needed new storage capacity at \n     the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor; and\n       (3) the Federal Government has the responsibility to \n     provide, in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, \n     not more than 1,900 metric tons of capacity for interim \n     storage of spent nuclear fuel for civilian nuclear power \n     reactors that cannot reasonably provide adequate storage \n     capacity at the sites of such reactors when needed to assure \n     the continued, orderly operation of such reactors.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to provide for the utilization of available spent \n     nuclear fuel pools at the site of each civilian nuclear power \n     reactor to the extent practical and the addition of new spent \n     nuclear fuel storage capacity where practical at the site of \n     such reactor; and\n       (2) to provide, in accordance with the provisions of this \n     subtitle, for the establishment of a federally owned and \n     operated system for the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel \n     at one or more facilities owned by the Federal Government \n     with not more than 1,900 metric tons of capacity to prevent \n     disruptions in the orderly operation of any civilian nuclear \n     power reactor that cannot reasonably provide adequate spent \n     nuclear fuel storage capacity at the site of such reactor \n     when needed.\n       Sec. 132\n       Available Capacity for Interim Storage of Spent Nuclear \n     Fuel\n       Sec. 132. The Secretary, the Commission, and other \n     authorized Federal officials shall each take such actions as \n     such official considers necessary to encourage and expedite \n     the effective use of available storage, and necessary \n     additional storage, at the site of each civilian nuclear \n     power reactor consistent with--\n       (1) the protection of the public health and safety, and the \n     environment;\n       (2) economic considerations;\n       (3) continued operation of such reactor;\n       (4) any applicable provisions of law; and\n       (5) the views of the population surrounding such reactor.\n\n     SEC. 133\n\n\n                       interim at reactor storage\n\n       Sec. 133. The Commission shall, by rule, established \n     procedures for the licensing of any technology approved by \n     the Commission under section 219(a)1 for use at the site of \n     any civilian nuclear power reactor. The establishment of such \n     procedures shall not preclude the licensing, under any \n     applicable procedures or rules of the Commission in effect \n     prior to such establishment, of any technology for the \n     storage of civilian spent nuclear fuel at the site of any \n     civilian nuclear power reactor.\n\n\n          licensing of facility expansions and transshipments\n\n       Sec. 134. (a) Oral Argument.--In any Commission hearing \n     under section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 on an \n     application for a license, or for an amendment to an existing \n     license, filed after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at the site \n     of a Civilian nuclear power reactor, through the use of high-\n     density fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, the \n     transshipment of spent nuclear fuel to another civilian \n     nuclear power reactor within the same utility system, the \n     construction of additional spent nuclear fuel pool capacity \n     or dry storage capacity, or by other means, the Commission \n     shall, at the request of any party, provide an opportunity \n     for oral argument with respect to any matter which the \n     Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties. \n     The oral argument shall be preceded by such discovery \n     procedures as the rules of the Commission shall provide. The \n     Commission shall require each party, including the Commission \n     staff, to submit in written form, at the time of the oral \n     argument, a summary of the facts, data, and arguments upon \n     which such party proposes to rely that are known at such time \n     to such party. Only facts and data in the form of sworn \n     testimony or written submission may be relied upon by the \n     parties during oral argument. Of the materials that may be \n     submitted by the parties during oral argument, the Commission \n     shall only consider those facts and data that are submitted \n     in the form of sworn testimony or written submission.\n       (b) Adjudicatory Hearing.--(1) At the conclusion of any \n     oral argument under subsection (a), the Commission shall \n     designate any disputed question of fact, together with any \n     remaining questions of law, for resolution in an adjudicatory \n     hearing only if it determines that--\n       (A) there is a genuine and substantial dispute of fact \n     which can only be resolved with sufficient accuracy by the \n     introduction of evidence in an adjudicatory hearing; and\n       (B) the decision of the Commission is likely to depend in \n     whole or in part on the resolution of such dispute.\n       (2) In making a determination under this subsection, the \n     Commission--\n       (A) shall designate in writing the specific facts that are \n     in genuine and substantial dispute, the reason why the \n     decision of the agency is likely to depend on the resolution \n     of such facts, and the reason why an adjudicatory hearing is \n     likely to resolve the dispute; and\n       (B) shall not consider--\n       (i) any issue relating to the design, construction, or \n     operation of any civilian nuclear power reactor already \n     licensed to operate at such site, or any civilian nuclear \n     power reactor for which a construction permit has been \n     granted at such site, unless the Commission determines that \n     any such issue substantially affects the design, \n     construction, or operation of the facility or activity for \n     which such license application, authorization, or amendment \n     is being considered; or\n       (ii) any siting or design issue fully considered and \n     decided by the Commission in connection with the issuance of \n     a construction permit or operating license for a civilian \n     nuclear power reactor at such site, unless (I) such issue \n     results from any revision of siting or design criteria by the \n     Commission following such decision; and (II) the Commission \n     determines that such issue substantially affects the design, \n     construction, or operation of the facility or activity for \n     which such license application, authorization, or amendment \n     is being considered.\n       (3) The provisions of paragraph (2)(B) shall apply only \n     with respect to licenses, authorizations, or amendments to \n     licenses or authorizations, applied for under the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 before December 31, 2005.\n       (4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the \n     first application for a license or license amendment received \n     by the Commission to expand onsite spent fuel storage \n     capacity by the use of a new technology not previously \n     approved for use at any nuclear powerplant by the \n     Commission.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--No court shall hold unlawful or set \n     aside a decision of the Commission in any proceeding \n     described in subsection (a) because of a failure by the \n     Commission to use a particular procedure pursuant to this \n     section unless--\n       (1) an objection to the procedure used was presented to the \n     Commission in a timely fashion or there are extraordinary \n     circumstances that excuse the failure to present a timely \n     objection; and\n       (2) the court finds that such failure has precluded a fair \n     consideration and informed resolution of a significant issue \n     of the proceeding taken as a whole.\n\n\n                     storage of spent nuclear fuel\n\n       Sec. 135. (a) Storage Capacity.--(1) Subject to section 8, \n     the Secretary shall provide, in accordance with paragraph \n     (5), not more than 1,900 metric tons of capacity for the \n     storage of spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power \n     reactors.

The restriction \n     in the preceding sentence shall only apply until such time as \n     the Secretary decides that such candidate site is no longer a\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\n     candidate site under consideration for development as a \n     repository.\n       (3) In selecting methods of providing storage capacity \n     under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider the \n     timeliness of the availability of each such method and shall \n     seek to minimize the transportation of spent nuclear fuel, \n     the public health and safety impacts, and the costs of \n     providing such storage capacity.\n       (4) In providing storage capacity through any method \n     described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall comply with \n     any applicable requirements for licensing or authorization of \n     such method, except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(i).\n       (5) The Secretary shall ensure that storage capacity is \n     made available under paragraph (1) when needed, as determined \n     on the basis of the storage needs specified in contracts \n     entered into under section 136(a), and shall accept upon \n     request any spent nuclear fuel as covered under such \n     contracts.\n       (6) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term ``facility'' \n     means any building or structure.\n       (b) Contracts.--(1) Subject to the capacity limitation \n     established in subsections (a) (1)3 and (d)4 the Secretary \n     shall offer to enter into, and may enter into, contracts \n     under section 136(a) with any person generating or owning \n     spent nuclear fuel for purposes of providing storage capacity \n     for such spent fuel under this section only if the Commission \n     determines that--\n       (A) adequate storage capacity to ensure the continued \n     orderly operation of the civilian nuclear power reactor at \n     which such spent nuclear fuel is generated cannot reasonably \n     be provided by the person owning and operating such reactor \n     at such site, or at the site of any other civilian nuclear \n     power reactor operated by such person, and such capacity \n     cannot be made available in a timely manner through any \n     method described in subparagraph (B); and\n       (B) such person is diligently pursuing licensed \n     alternatives to the use of Federal storage capacity for the \n     storage of spent nuclear fuel expected to be generated by \n     such person in the future, including--\n       (i) expansion of storage facilities at the site of any \n     civilian nuclear power reactor operated by such person;\n       (ii) construction of new or additional storage facilities \n     at the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor operated by \n     such person;\n       (iii) acquisition of modular or mobile spent nuclear fuel \n     storage equipment, including spent nuclear fuel storage \n     casks, for use at the site of any civilian nuclear power \n     reactor operated by such person; and\n       (iv) transshipment to another civilian nuclear power \n     reactor owned by such person.\n       (2) In making the determination described in paragraph \n     (1)(A), the Commission shall ensure maintenance of a full \n     core reserve storage capacity at the site of the civilian \n     nuclear power reactor involved unless the Commission \n     determines that maintenance of such capability is not \n     necessary for the continued orderly operation of such \n     reactor.\n       (3) The Commission shall complete the determination \n     required in paragraph (1) with respect to any request for \n     storage capacity not later than 6 months after receipt of \n     such request by the Commission.\n       (c) Environmental Review--(1) The provision of 300 or more \n     metric tons of storage capacity at any one Federal site under \n     subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be considered to be a major \n     Federal action requiring preparation of an environmental \n     impact statement under section 102(2)(C) of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969.\n       (2)(A) The Secretary shall prepare, and make available to \n     the public, an environmental assessment of the probable \n     impacts of any provision of less than 300 metric tons of \n     storage capacity at any one Federal site under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A) that requires the modification or expansion of any \n     facility at the site, and a discussion of alternative \n     activities that may be undertaken to avoid such impacts. Such \n     environmental assessment shall include--\n       (i) an estimate of the amount of storage capacity to be \n     made available at such site;\n       (ii) an evaluation as to whether the facilities to be used \n     at such site are suitable for the provision of such storage \n     capacity;\n       (iii) a description of activities planned by the Secretary \n     with respect to the modification or expansion of the \n     facilities to be used at such site;\n       (iv) an evaluation of the effects of the provision of such \n     storage capacity at such site on the public health and \n     safety, and the environment;\n       (v) a reasonable comparative evaluation of current \n     information with respect to such site and facilities and \n     other sites and facilities available for the provision of \n     such storage capacity;\n       (vi) a description of any other sites and facilities that \n     have been considered by the Secretary for the provision of \n     such storage capacity; and\n       (vii) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of \n     providing such storage capacity at such site, including the \n     impacts on transportation.\n       (B) The issuance of any environmental assessment under this \n     paragraph shall be considered to be a final agency action \n     subject to judicial review in accordance with the provisions \n     of chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. Such judicial \n     review shall be limited to the sufficiency of such assessment \n     with respect to the items described in clauses (i) through \n     (vii) of subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Judicial review of any environmental impact statement \n     or environmental assessment prepared pursuant to this \n     subsection shall be conducted in accordance with the \n     provisions of section 119.\n       (d) Review of Sites and State Participation--(1) In \n     carrying out the provisions of this subtitle with regard to \n     any interim storage of spent fuel from civilian nuclear power \n     reactors which the Secretary is authorized by section 135 to \n     provide, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, notify, \n     in writing, the Governor and the State legislature of any \n     State and the Tribal Council of any affected Indian tribe in \n     such State in which is located a potentially acceptable site \n     or facility for such interim storage of spent fuel of his \n     intention to investigate that site or facility.\n       (2) During the course of investigation of such site or \n     facility, the Secretary shall keep the Governor, State \n     legislature, and affected Tribal Council currently \n     informed of the progress of the work, and results of the \n     investigations. At the time of selection by the Secretary \n     of any site or existing facility, but prior to undertaking \n     any site-specific work or alterations, the Secretary shall \n     promptly notify the Governor, the legislature, and any \n     affected Tribal Council in writing of such selection, and \n     subject to the provisions of paragraph (6) of this \n     subsection, shall promptly enter into negotiations with \n     such State and affected Tribal Council to establish a \n     cooperative agreement under which such State and Council \n     shall have the right to participate in a process of \n     consultation and cooperation, based on public health and \n     safety and environmental concerns, in all stages of the \n     planning, development, modification, expansion, operation, \n     and closure of storage capacity at a site or facility \n     within such State for the interim storage of spent fuel \n     from civilian nuclear power reactors. Public participation \n     in the negotiation of such an agreement shall be provided \n     for and encouraged by the Secretary, the State, and the \n     affected Tribal Council. The Secretary, in cooperation \n     with the States and Indian tribes, shall develop and \n     publish minimum guidelines for public participation in \n     such negotiations, but the adequacy of such guidelines or \n     any failure to comply with such guidelines shall not be a \n     basis for judicial review.\n       (3) The cooperative agreement shall include, but need not \n     be limited to, the sharing in accordance with applicable law \n     of all technical and licensing information, the utilization \n     of available expertise, the facilitating of permitting \n     procedures, joint project review, and the formulation of \n     joint surveillance and monitoring arrangements to carry out \n     applicable Federal and State laws. The cooperative agreement \n     also shall include a detailed plan or schedule of milestones, \n     decision points and opportunities for State or eligible \n     Tribal Council review and objection. Such cooperative \n     agreement shall provide procedures for negotiating and \n     resolving objections of the State and affected Tribal Council \n     in any stage of planning, development, modification, \n     expansion, operation, or closure of storage capacity at a \n     site or facility within such State. The terms of any \n     cooperative agreement shall not affect the authority of the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission under existing law.\n       (4) For the purpose of this subsection, ``process of \n     consultation and cooperation'' means a methodology by which \n     the Secretary (A) keeps the State and eligible Tribal Council \n     fully and currently informed about the aspects of the project \n     related to any potential impact on the public health and \n     safety and environment; (B) solicits, receives, and evaluates \n     concerns and objections of such State and Council with regard \n     to such aspects of the project on an ongoing basis; and (C) \n     works diligently and cooperatively to resolve, through \n     arbitration or other appropriate mechanisms, such concerns \n     and objections. The process of consultation and cooperation \n     shall not include the grant of a right, to any State or \n     Tribal Council to exercise an absolute veto of any aspect of \n     the planning, development, modification, expansion, or \n     operation of the project.\n       (5) The Secretary and the State and affected Tribal Council \n     shall seek to conclude the agreement required by paragraph \n     (2) as soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days \n     following the date of notification of the selection under \n     paragraph (2). The Secretary shall periodically report to the \n     Congress thereafter on the status of the agreements approved \n     under paragraph (3). Any report to the Congress on the status \n     of negotiations of such agreement by the Secretary shall be \n     accompanied by comments solicited by the Secretary from the \n     State and eligible Tribal Council.\n       (6)(A) Upon deciding to provide an aggregate of 300 or more \n     metric tons of storage capacity under subsection (a)(1) at \n     any one site, the Secretary shall notify the Governor and \n     legislature of the State where such site is located, or the \n     governing body of the Indian tribe in whose reservation such \n     site is located, as the case may be, of such decision. During \n     the 60-day period following receipt of notification by the \n     Secretary of this decision to provide an aggregate of 300 or \n     more metric tons of storage capacity at any one site, the \n     Governor or legislature of the State in which such site is \n     located, or the governing body of the affected Indian where \n     such site is located, as the case may be, may disapprove the \n     provision of 300 or more metric tons of storage capacity at \n     the site involved and submit to the Congress a notice of such \n     disapproval. A notice of disapproval shall be\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\n     considered to be submitted to the Congress on the date of the \n     transmittal of such notice of disapproval to the Speaker of \n     the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate. Such \n     notice of disapproval shall be accompanied by a statement of \n     reasons explaining why the provision of such storage capacity \n     at such site was disapproved by such Governor or legislature \n     or the governing body of such Indian tribe.\n       (B) Unless otherwise provided by State law, the Governor or \n     legislature of each State shall have authority to submit a \n     notice of disapproval to the Congress under subparagraph (A). \n     In any case in which State law provides for submissions of \n     any such notice of disapproval by any other person or entity, \n     any reference in this subtitle to the Governor or legislature \n     of such State shall be considered to refer instead of such \n     other person or entity.\n       (C) The authority of the Governor and legislature of each \n     State under this paragraph shall not be applicable with \n     respect to any site located on a reservation.\n       (D) If any notice of disapproval is submitted to the \n     Congress under subparagraph (A), the proposed provision of \n     300 or more metric tons of storage capacity at the site \n     involved shall be disapproved unless, during the first period \n     of 90 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress \n     following the date of the receipt by the Congress of such \n     notice of disapproval, the Congress passes a resolution \n     approving such proposed provision of storage capacity in \n     accordance with the procedures established in this paragraph \n     and subsections (d) through (f) of section 115 and such \n     resolution thereafter becomes law. For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term ``resolution'' means a joint \n     resolution of either House of the Congress, the matter \n     after the resolving clause of which is as follows: ``That \n     there hereby is approved the provision of 300 or more \n     metric tons of spent nuclear fuel storage capacity a the \n     site located at ______, with respect to which a notice of \n     disapproval was submitted by ______ on ______.''. The \n     first blank space in such resolution shall be filled with \n     the geographic location of the site involved; the second \n     blank space in such resolution shall be filled with the \n     designation of the State Governor and, legislature or \n     affected Indian tribe governing body submitting the notice \n     of disapproval involved; and the last blank space in such \n     resolution shall be filled with the date of submission of \n     such notice of disapproval.\n       (E) For purposes of such consideration of any resolution \n     described in subparagraph (D), each reference in subsections \n     (d) and (e) of section 115 to a resolution of repository \n     siting approval shall be considered to refer to the \n     resolution described in such subparagraph.\n       (7) As used in this section, the term ``affected Tribal \n     Council'' means the governing body of any Indian tribe within \n     whose reservation boundaries there is located a potentially \n     acceptable site for interim storage capacity of spent nuclear \n     fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors, or within whose \n     boundaries a site of such capacity is selected by the \n     Secretary, or whose federally defined possessory or usage \n     rights to other lands outside of the reservation's boundaries \n     arising out of congressionally ratified treaties, as \n     determined by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to a \n     petition filed with him by the appropriate governmental \n     officials of such tribe, may be substantially and adversely \n     affected by the establishment of any such storage capacity.\n       (e) Limitations.--Any spent nuclear fuel stored under this \n     section shall be removed from the storage site or facility \n     involved as soon as practicable, but in any event not later \n     than 3 years following the date on which a repository or \n     monitored retrievable storage facility developed under this \n     Act is available for disposal of such spent nuclear fuel.\n       (f) Report.--The Secretary shall annually prepare and \n     submit to the Congress a report on any plans of the Secretary \n     for providing storage capacity under this section. Such \n     report shall include a description of the specific manner of \n     providing such storage selected by the Secretary, if any. The \n     Secretary shall prepare and submit the first such report not \n     later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (g) Criteria for Determining Adequacy of Available Storage \n     Capacity.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission pursuant to section 553 \n     of the Administrative Procedures Act, shall propose, by rule, \n     procedures and criteria for making the determination required \n     by subsection (b) that a person owning and operating a \n     civilian nuclear power reactor cannot reasonably provide \n     adequate spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at the civilian \n     nuclear power reactor site when needed to ensure the \n     continued orderly operations of such reactor. Such criteria \n     shall ensure the maintenance of a full core reserve storage \n     capability at the site of such reactor unless the Commission \n     determines that maintenance of such capacity is not necessary \n     for the continued orderly operation of such reactor. Such \n     criteria shall identify the feasibility of reasonably \n     providing such adequate spent nuclear fuel storage capacity, \n     taking into account economic, technical, regulatory, and \n     public health and safety factors, through the use of high-\n     density fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, \n     transshipment of spent nuclear fuel to another civilian \n     nuclear power reactor within the same utility system, \n     construction of addition spent nuclear fuel poor capacity, or \n     such other technologies as may be approved by the Commission.\n       (h) Application.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, nothing in this Act shall be construed to encourage, \n     authorize, or require the private or Federal use, purchase, \n     lease, or other acquisition of any storage facility located \n     away from the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor and \n     not owned by the Federal Government on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (i) Coordination With Research and Development Program.--To \n     the extent available, and consistent with the provisions of \n     this section, the Secretary shall provide spent nuclear fuel \n     for the research and development program authorized in \n     section 2172 from spent nuclear fuel received by the \n     Secretary for storage under this section. Such spent nuclear \n     fuel shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection \n     (e).\n\n\n                          INTERIM STORAGE FUND\n\n       Sec. 136. Contracts.--(1) During the period following the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, but not later than January \n     1, 2010, the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts \n     with persons who generate or own spent nuclear fuel resulting \n     from civilian nuclear activities for the storage of such \n     spent nuclear fuel in any storage capacity provided under \n     this subtitle: Provided, however, That the Secretary shall \n     not enter into contracts for spent nuclear fuel in amounts in \n     excess of the available storage capacity specified in section \n     135(a). Those contracts shall provide that the Federal \n     Government will take (1) title at the civilian nuclear power \n     reactor site, to such amounts of spent nuclear fuel from the \n     civilian nuclear power reactor as the Commission determines \n     cannot be stored onsite, (2) transport the spent nuclear fuel \n     to a federally owned and operated interim away-from-reactor \n     storage facility, and (3) store such fuel in the facility \n     pending further processing, storage, or disposal. Each \n     such contract shall (A) provide for payment to the \n     Secretary of fees determined in accordance with the \n     provisions of this section; and (B) specify the amount of \n     storage capacity to be provided for the person involved.\n       (2) The Secretary shall undertake a study and, not later \n     then 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     submit to the Congress a report, establishing payment charges \n     that shall be calculated on an annual basis, commencing on or \n     before January 1, 1996. Such payment charges and the \n     calculation thereof shall be published in the Federal \n     Register, and shall become effective not less than 30 days \n     after publication. Each payment charge published in the \n     Federal Register under this paragraph shall remain effective \n     for a period of 12 months from the effective date as the \n     charge for the cost of the interim storage of any spent \n     nuclear fuel. The report of the Secretary shall specify the \n     method and manner of collection (including the rates and \n     manner of payment) and any legislative recommendations \n     determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.\n       (3) Fees for storage under this subtitle shall be \n     established on a nondiscriminatory basis. The fees to be paid \n     by each person entering into a contract with the Secretary \n     under this subsection shall be based upon an estimate of the \n     pro rata costs of storage and related activities under this \n     subtitle with respect to such person, including the \n     acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance of any \n     facilities under this subtitle.\n       (4) The Secretary shall establish in writing criteria \n     setting forth the terms and conditions under which such \n     storage services shall be made available.\n       (5) Except as provided in section 137, nothing in this or \n     any other Act requires the Secretary, in carrying out the \n     responsibilities of this section, to obtain a license or \n     permit to possess or own spent nuclear fuel.\n       (b) Limitation.--No spent nuclear fuel generated or owned \n     by any department of the United States referred to in section \n     101 or 102 of title 5, United States Code, may be stored by \n     the Secretary in any storage capacity provided under this \n     subtitle unless such department transfers to the Secretary, \n     for deposit in the Interim Storage Fund, amounts equivalent \n     to the fees that would be paid to the Secretary under the \n     contracts referred to in this section if such spent nuclear \n     fuel were generated by any other person.\n       (c) Establishment of Interim Storage Fund.--There hereby is \n     established in the Treasury of the United States a separate \n     fund, to be known as the Interim Storage Fund. The Storage \n     Fund shall consist of--\n       (1) All receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the \n     Secretary under subsections (a), (b), and (e), 1 which shall \n     be deposited in the Storage Fund immediately upon their \n     realization;\n       (2) any appropriations made by the Congress to the Storage \n     Fund; and\n       (3) any unexpended balances available on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act for functions or activities necessary \n     or incident to the interim storage of civilian spent nuclear \n     fuel, which shall automatically be transferred to the Storage \n     Fund on such date.\n       (d) Use of Storage Fund.--The Secretary may make \n     expenditures from the Storage Fund, subject to subsection \n     (e),2 for any purpose necessary or appropriate to the conduct \n     of the functions and activities of the Secretary, or the \n     provision or anticipated provision of services, under this \n     subtitle, including--\n       (1) the identification, development, licensing, \n     construction, operation, decommissioning, and post-\n     decommissioning maintenance\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n     and monitoring of any interim storage facility provided under \n     this subtitle;\n       (2) the administrative cost of the interim storage program;\n       (3) the costs associated with acquisition, design, \n     modification, replacement, operation, and construction of \n     facilities at an interim storage site, consistent with the \n     restrictions in section 135;\n       (4) the cost of transportation of spent nuclear fuel; and\n       (5) impact assistance as described in subsection (e).\n       (e) Impact Assistance.--(1) Beginning the first fiscal year \n     which commences after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary shall make annual impact assistance payments to \n     a State or appropriate unit of local government, or both, in \n     order to mitigate social or economic impacts occasioned by \n     the establishment and subsequent operation of any interim \n     storage capacity within the jurisdictional boundaries of such \n     government or governments and authorized under this \n     subtitle: Provided, however, That such impact assistance \n     payments shall not exceed (A) ten per centum of the costs \n     incurred in paragraphs (1) and (2), or (B) $15 per \n     kilogram of spent fuel, whichever is less;\n       (2) Payments made available to States and units of local \n     government pursuant to this section shall be--\n       (A) allocated in a fair and equitable manner with a \n     priority to those States or units of local government \n     suffering the most severe impacts; and\n       (B) utilized by States or units of local governments only \n     for (i) planning, (ii) construction and maintenance of public \n     services, (iii) provision of public services related to the \n     providing of such interim storage authorized under this \n     title, and (iv) compensation for loss of taxable property \n     equivalent to that if the storage had been provided under \n     private ownership.\n       (3) Such payments shall be subject to such terms and \n     conditions as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure \n     that the purposes of this subsection shall be achieved. The \n     Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to \n     carry out the provisions of this subsection.\n       (4) Payments under this subsection shall be made available \n     solely from the fees determined under subsection (a).\n       (5) The Secretary is authorized to consult with States and \n     appropriate units of local government in advance of \n     commencement of establishment of storage capacity authorized \n     under this subtitle in an effort to determine the level of \n     the payment such government would be eligible to receive \n     pursuant to this subsection.\n       (6) As used in this subsection, the term ``unit of local \n     government'' means a county, parish, township, municipality, \n     and shall include a borough existing in the State of Alaska \n     on the date of the enactment of this subsection, and any \n     other unit of government below the State level which is a \n     unit of general government as determined by the Secretary.\n       (f) Administration of Storage Fund.--(1) The Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall hold the Storage Fund and, after \n     consultation with the Secretary, annually report to the \n     Congress on the financial condition and operations of the \n     Storage Fund during the preceding fiscal year.\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit the budget of the Storage \n     Fund to the Office of Management and Budget triennially along \n     with the budget of the Department of Energy submitted at such \n     time in accordance with chapter 11 of title 31, United States \n     Code. The budget of the Storage Fund shall consist of \n     estimates made by the Secretary of expenditures from the \n     Storage Fund and other relevant financial matters for the \n     succeeding 3 fiscal years, and shall be included in the \n     Budget of the United States Government. The Secretary may \n     make expenditures from the Storage Fund, subject to \n     appropriations which shall remain available until expended. \n     Appropriations shall be subject to triennial authorization.\n       (3) If the Secretary determines that the Storage Fund \n     contains at any time amounts in excess of current needs, the \n     Secretary may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest \n     such amounts, or any portion of such amounts as the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate, in obligations of the United \n     States--\n       (A) having maturities determined by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to be appropriate to the needs of the Storage Fund; \n     and\n       (B) bearing interest at rates determined to be appropriate \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration \n     the current average market yield on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States with remaining periods to \n     maturity comparable to the maturities of such investments, \n     except that the interest rate on such investments shall not \n     exceed the average interest rate applicable to existing \n     borrowings.\n       (4) Receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the \n     Secretary under this section, and expenditures of amounts \n     from the Storage Fund, shall be exempt from annual \n     apportionment under the provisions of subchapter II of \n     chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code.\n       (5) If at any time the moneys available in the Storage Fund \n     are insufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge his \n     responsibilities under this subtitle, the Secretary shall \n     issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations in such \n     forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject \n     to such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the \n     Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. The total of \n     such obligations shall not exceed amounts provided in \n     appropriation Acts. Redemption of such obligations shall be \n     made by the Secretary from moneys available in the Storage \n     Fund. Such obligations shall bear interest at a rate \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall be \n     not less than a rate determined by taking into consideration \n     the average market yield on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States of comparable maturities \n     during the month preceding the issuance of the obligations \n     under this paragraph. The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     purchase any issued obligations, and for such purpose the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public \n     debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any \n     securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United \n     States Code, and the purposes for which securities may be \n     issued under such Act are extended to include any purchase \n     of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at \n     any time sell any of the obligations acquired by him under \n     this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury of obligations under this \n     paragraph shall be treated as public debt transactions of \n     the United States.\n       (6) Any appropriations made available to the Storage Fund \n     for any purpose described in subsection (d) shall be repaid \n     into the general fund of the Treasury, together with interest \n     from the date of availability of the appropriations until the \n     date of repayment. Such interest shall be paid on the \n     cumulative amount of appropriations available to the Storage \n     Fund, less the average undisbursed cash balance in the \n     Storage Fund account during the fiscal year involved. The \n     rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury taking into consideration the average market \n     yield during the month preceding each fiscal year on \n     outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of \n     comparable maturity. Interest payments may be deferred with \n     the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but any \n     interest payments so deferred shall themselves bear interest.\n\n\n                              section 137\n\n       Sec. 137.2 (a) Transportation.--(1) Transportation of spent \n     nuclear fuel under section 136(a) shall be subject to \n     licensing and regulation by the Commission and by the \n     Secretary of Transportation as provided for transportation of \n     commercial spent nuclear fuel under existing law.\n       (2) The Secretary, in providing for the transportation of \n     spent nuclear fuel under this Act, shall utilize by contract \n     private industry to the fullest extent possible in each \n     aspect of such transportation. The Secretary shall use direct \n     Federal services for such transportation only upon a \n     determination of the Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary, that private industry is \n     unable or unwilling to provide such transportation services \n     at reasonable cost.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4672\n\n       On page 96, line 7, strike all after ``Service.'' through \n     the end of line 12.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4673\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause, and insert:\n\n                     ``TITLE I. INDEPENDENT REVIEW\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Waste Independent \n     Review Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress find that--\n       (1) despite the enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), ratepayer contributions to \n     the Nuclear Waste Fund established by section 302 of the Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 10222) of over $6,000,000,000, and expenditures of \n     over $4,000,000,000, the high-level radioactive waste program \n     is behind schedule and is the subject of numerous fundamental \n     controversies, including the very concept of deep geologic \n     storage;\n       (2) the Federal Government's only proposed transuranic \n     waste disposal facility, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \n     (WIPP), is beset with unresolved engineering, geologic, and \n     certification problems and suffers from cost overruns;\n       (3) Federal and State efforts to site low-level radioactive \n     waste disposal sites have failed in many instances because of \n     technical problems and public opposition; and\n       (4) there has never been a comprehensive independent review \n     of Federal nuclear waste policies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to \n     conduct a full independent review of United States nuclear \n     waste policy.\n\n     SEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) By 1998, approximately 45,000 tons of spend nuclear \n     fuel will be stored at commercial nuclear reactors across the \n     nation;\n       (2) the deep geologic high level radioactive waste and \n     spent nuclear fuel repository envisioned by the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et. seq.) will not be \n     constructed in time to permit the Secretary to receive and \n     accept high level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel as \n     contemplated by sections 123 and 302 of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     10143, 10222), with the result that the Secretary will be \n     unable to perform contracts executed pursuant to section \n     302(a) of that Act with persons who generate or hold title to \n     high level radioactive waste or spend nuclear fuel;\n       (3) there have been no orders for the development or \n     construction of civilian nuclear power generating facilities \n     since the enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; \n     several such facilities that were anticipated when the Act \n     was enacted are not operating now;\n       (4) it does not now appear that a deep geologic high level \n     radioactive waste and spend nuclear fuel repository will be \n     available before the year 2010 or later;\n       (5) by the time a deep geologic repository is available \n     many currently operating commercial nuclear reactors will \n     need spend fuel storage capacity beyond the maximum now \n     available in at-reactor spent fuel storage pools; nuclear \n     utilities have spent and will spend major sums to construct \n     facilities, including dry cask spend fuel storage facilities, \n     for use in the interim before a deep geologic repository is \n     available;\n       (6) the sums spent for the purposes described in paragraph \n     (5) are the same funds that commercial nuclear utilities \n     intended to contribute to the Nuclear Waste Fund established \n     by section 302(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10222 (c));\n       (7) the technology for long term storage of spent nuclear \n     fuel, including the technology of dry cask storage, has \n     improved dramatically since the enactment of the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act of 1982;\n       (8) the existing statutory jurisdiction of the Commission, \n     under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2001 et. \n     seq.), the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5801 \n     et. seq.), Executive Order 11834 (42 U.S.C. 5801 note), the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reorganization Plan No. 1 of \n     1980, and the Commission's various authorization Acts \n     includes the jurisdiction to review and evaluate the spent \n     fuel storage capability of commercial nuclear utilities that \n     hold or seek licenses to receive and possess nuclear \n     materials from the Commission;\n       (9) commercial nuclear utilities that hold licenses to \n     receive and possess nuclear materials are generally well \n     suited to maintain the institutional capability necessary to \n     become stewards of spent nuclear fuel during a period of \n     interim storage;\n       (10) the increased radioactive decay that will occur in \n     spent nuclear fuel that has been stored for interim period \n     prior to the delivery to the Secretary pursuant to section \n     123 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10143) \n     will ease and facilitate its subsequent handling, \n     transportation, and final disposal.\n\n     SEC. 5. AMENDMENTS TO THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1982.\n\n       Section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10222(a)) is amended by inserting at the end thereof \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(f)(1) After January 31, 1998, if the Secretary does not \n     have a facility available to accept spent fuel from persons \n     holding contracts under this section, those persons may, \n     through credits on fee payments under subsection (a)(2), \n     offset the expense of providing storage of spent fuel \n     generated after that date (including expenses reasonably \n     incurred before that date in anticipation of the necessity of \n     providing such storage) and until the date of the Secretary's \n     first acceptance of that person's spent fuel at a storage or \n     disposal facility authorized by this Act.\n       ``(2) The credits described in paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) shall be deducted from each remittance of a person's \n     fee payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund from the time that the \n     person meets the conditions of paragraph (1) until the time \n     that the Secretary first accepts that person's spent fuel at \n     a storage or disposal facility authorized by this Act; and\n       ``(B) shall be in an amount determined by the Secretary to \n     reflect the cost of storage qualifying under subsection \n     (f)(1).''\n\n                           Amendment No. 4674\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause, and insert\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) By 1998, approximately 45,000 tons of spent nuclear \n     fuel will be stored at commercial nuclear reactors across the \n     nation;\n       (2) the deep geologic high level radioactive waste and \n     spent nuclear fuel repository envisioned by the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et. seq.) will not be \n     constructed in time to permit the Secretary to receive and \n     accept high level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel as \n     contemplated by sections 123 and 302 of that Act (42 U.S.C. \n     10143, 10222), with the result that the Secretary will be \n     unable to perform contracts executed pursuant to section \n     302(a) of that Act with persons who generate or hold title \n     to high level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel;\n       (3) there have been no orders for the development or \n     construction of civilian nuclear power generating facilities \n     since the enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; \n     several such facilities that were anticipated when the Act \n     was enacted are not operating now;\n       (4) it does not now appear that a deep geologic high level \n     radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel repository will be \n     available before the year 2010 or later;\n       (5) by the time a deep geologic repository is available \n     many currently operating commercial nuclear reactors will \n     need spent fuel storage capacity beyond the maximum now \n     available in at-reactor spent fuel storage pools; nuclear \n     utilities have spent and will spend major sums to construct \n     facilities, including dry cask spent fuel storage facilities, \n     for use in the interim before a deep geologic repository is \n     available;\n       (6) the sums spent for the purposes described in paragraph \n     (5) are the same funds that commercial nuclear utilities \n     intended to contribute to the Nuclear Waste Fund established \n     by section 302(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10222 (c));\n       (7) the technology for long term storage of spent nuclear \n     fuel, including the technology of dry cask storage, has \n     improved dramatically since the enactment of the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act of 1982;\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\n       (8) the existing statutory jurisdiction of the Commission, \n     under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2001 et. \n     seq.), the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5801 \n     et. seq.), Executive Order 11834 (42 U.S.C. 5801 note), the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reorganization Plan No. 1 of \n     1980, and the Commission's various authorization Acts \n     includes the jurisdiction to review and evaluate the spent \n     fuel storage capability of commercial nuclear utilities that \n     hold or seek licenses to receive and possess nuclear \n     materials from the Commission;\n       (9) commercial nuclear utilities that hold licenses to \n     receive and possess nuclear materials are generally well \n     suited to maintain the institutional capability necessary to \n     become stewards of spent nuclear fuel during a period of \n     interim storage;\n       (10) the increased radioactive decay that will occur in \n     spent nuclear fuel that has been stored for interim periods \n     prior to delivery to the Secretary pursuant to section 123 of \n     the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10143) will \n     ease and facilitate its subsequent handling, transportation, \n     and final disposal.\n\n     SEC. 5. AMENDMENTS TO THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1982.\n\n       Section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10222 (a)) is amended by inserting at the end thereof \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(f)(1) After January 31, 1998, if the Secretary does not \n     have a facility available to accept spent fuel from persons \n     holding contracts under this section, those persons may, \n     through credits on fee payments under subsection (a)(2), \n     offset the expense of providing storage of spent fuel \n     generated after that that (including expenses reasonably \n     incurred before that date in anticipation of the necessary of \n     providing such storage) and until the date of the Secretary's \n     first acceptance of that person's spent fuel at a storage or \n     disposal facility authorized by this Act.\n       ``(2) The credits described in paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) shall be deducted from each remittance of a person's \n     fee payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund from the time that the \n     person meets the conditions of paragraph (1) until the time \n     that the Secretary first accepts that person's spent fuel at \n     a storage or disposal facility authorized by this Act; and\n       ``(B) shall be in an amount determined by the Secretary to \n     reflect the cost of storage qualifying under subsection \n     (f)(1).''\n\n                           Amendment No. 4675\n\n       On page 73, strike line 1 though line 13.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4676\n\n       On page 40, strike line 9 through line 13.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4677\n\n       On page 72, strike line 18 through line 25.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4678\n\n       On page 41, line 6, strike ``unreasonable''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4679\n\n       On page 51, strike line 5 through page 54 line 15, and \n     insert\n       ``(a) Establishment of Commission.\n       (1) In general.--The President, in consultation with the \n     science advisor to the President and the council on \n     environmental quality, shall establish a commission to be \n     known as the ``Nuclear Waste Policy Review Commission'' \n     (referred to in this act as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Representation of interest groups.--The membership and \n     structure of the Commission shall be determined by the \n     President with a view toward providing representation from--\n       (A) Environmental groups;\n       (B) Consumer groups;\n       (C) Taxpayer groups;\n       (D) The scientific community, including nuclear-oriented \n     and other fields such as biology and medicine;\n       (E) State and local governments;\n       (F) Indian tribes;\n       (G) Transportation experts;\n       (H) Management experts;\n       (I) Federal, State, and local regulatory agencies;\n       (J) Utilities;

TENTH AMENDMENT PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in most areas of governmental concern, State \n     governments possess both the Constitutional authority and the \n     competence to discern the needs and the desires of the People \n     and to govern accordingly;\n       (2) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have \n     interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, \n     should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal \n     Government by the Constitution;\n       (3) the framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon \n     the Federal Government only limited authority over the States \n     and the People;\n       (4) under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the \n     powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people; and\n       (5) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth \n     Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to \n     act in areas of State jurisdiction, should be directed to \n     strictly construe Federal laws and regulations which \n     interfere with State powers with a presumption in favor of \n     State authority and against Federal preemption.\n       (b) Limitation.--No preemption of State law under this Act \n     shall be effective until the Secretary has published in the \n     Federal Register a determination demonstrating the \n     Constitutional basis for the preemption.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) despite the enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), ratepayer contributions to \n     the Nuclear Waste Fund established by section 302 of the Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 10222) of over $6,000,000,000, and expenditures of \n     over $4,000,000,000, the high-level radioactive waste program \n     is behind scheduled and is the subject of numerous \n     fundamental controversies, including the very concept of deep \n     geologic storage;\n       (2) the Federal Government's only proposed transuranic \n     waste disposal facility, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \n     (WIPP), is beset with unresolved engineering, geologic, and \n     certification problems and suffers from cost overruns;\n       (3) Federal and State efforts to site low-level radioactive \n     waste disposal sites have failed in many instances because of \n     technical problems and public opposition; and\n       (4) there has never been a comprehensive independent review \n     of Federal nuclear waste policies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to \n     conduct a full independent review of United States nuclear \n     waste policy.\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President, in consultation with the \n     science advisor to the President and the Council on \n     Environmental Quality, shall establish a commission to be \n     known as the ``Nuclear Waste Policy Review Commission'' \n     (referred to in this act as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Representation of Interest Groups.--The membership and \n     structure of the Commission shall be determined by the \n     President with a view towards providing representation from--\n       (1) environmental groups;\n       (2) consumer groups;\n       (3) taxpayer groups;\n       (4) the scientific community, including nuclear-oriented \n     and other fields such as biology and medicine;\n       (5) State and local governments;\n       (6) Indian tribes;\n       (7) transportation experts;\n       (8) management experts;\n       (9) Federal, State, and local regulatory agencies;\n       (10) utilities; and\n  (11) other affected industries.\n       (c) Independent Status.--The Commission shall be \n     independent of the Department of Energy and other Federal \n     agencies.\n       (d) Participation by the Public.--The Commission shall hold \n     public meetings and provide full opportunities for \n     participation by all interested parties.\n\n     SEC. 5. ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED.\n\n       The Commission shall consider all issues related to United \n     States policy concerning high-level, transuranic, low-level \n     waste, and other radioactive wastes including--\n       (1) various options for high-level radioactive waste \n     storage and disposal, including deep geologic disposal, on-\n     site dry storage, monitored retrievable storage, centralized \n     interim storage, or any other options;\n       (2) evaluation of the experiences of other countries in \n     storing and disposing of radioactive waste;\n       (3) an analysis of funding through the Nuclear Waste Fund \n     established by section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n     1982 (42 U.S.C. 10222), including fee sufficiency and \n     strategies for providing equity for ratepayer contributions \n     to the Nuclear Waste Fund;\n       (4) the siting and characterization process for nuclear \n     waste programs currently in effect and alternatives to those \n     programs;\n       (5) technical, managerial, economic, and policy analyses of \n     the nuclear waste inventory of the United States; and\n       (6) an examination of the classification system for nuclear \n     waste currently in effect, and options for reclassification.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report on its \n     review under this Act, including recommendations for \n     legislative or other action.\n\n     SEC. 7 MORATORIUM ON ISSUANCE OF LICENSES.\n\n       No Federal agency may issue a license for a facility for \n     the storage or disposal of radioactive waste (except a \n     license for temporary on-site storage) until the date on \n     which the Commission submits its report under section 6.\n\n     SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF COMMISSION.\n\n       The commission shall terminate 30 days after the date on \n     which the Commission submits its report under section 6.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4702\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY LIMITATION.\n\n       Nothwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds \n     authorized under this Act shall be expended in any fiscal \n     year during which the Secretary does not publish in the \n     Federal Register a fee sufficiency report which demonstrates \n     that contract holders will pay the full cost of the storage \n     and disposal of all spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste produced in relation to civilian nuclear \n     power reactors. Such report shall include the estimated total \n     life cycle cost of all expenditures authorized by this Act, \n     the estimated total payments of contract holders to the \n     Nuclear Waste Fund, the estimated proportionate share of the \n     total life cycle cost attributable to disposal, storage, and \n     transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste produced by contract holders, and the \n     surplus or shortfall of contract holders' payments versus \n     proportionate share of the costs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4703\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, no \n     facility for the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel or \n     high-level radioactive waste shall be sited in a State under \n     consideration as a site for a permanent repository.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4704\n\n

Mr. President, as the Senate knows, John \nChancellor died last Friday at age 68. He was so much a part of our \nlives for over 40 years as an NBC news commentator and anchor. We are \ndiminished by his death, and yet, as Tom Brokaw suggested, enhanced by \nthe realization of just how great a legacy he leaves. A legacy, Mr. \nBrokaw stated, that ``will always be secure.''\n  He was in some measure Irish; at least he once told me of a \ngrandmother who had taught him to hate Oliver Cromwell. Which he must \nhave done, and in so doing, evidently used up all the hate he had in \nhim. For there was nothing else but love: for the life he lived, and \nthe people he lived it with. Most especially, of course, his wife \nBarbara and their three children. Yeats once wrote of a man who was \nblessed and had the power to bless. Such a man was John Chancellor.\n  He was a friend of 30 years and more. From first to last, one sensed \nin him a deep confidence that American democracy would prove itself in \nwhatever crisis it faced; just as he would do. He faced many; always \nwith grace and afterward, grand ``rollicking'' recollections, as Tom \nBrokaw put it. David Broder captures that quality in his column this \nmorning.\n\n       Many of us in print journalism lost a great friend last \n     week in John Chancellor. He hung out with the political \n     reporters who had nowhere near his celebrity because he \n     always thought of himself as a reporter and he wanted to be \n     with people who were more interested in the stories they were \n     covering than in stroking their own reputations. He was \n     modest and funny and generous in his praise. No journalist of \n     his era enjoyed greater trust and affection from his \n     colleagues--or the people he covered. And none deserved it \n     more.\n\n  The Senate honors his memory and salutes his legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8059-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8059-S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KOREA VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. I am pleased to join as co-sponsor of the Korea \nVisa Waiver Pilot Program, S. 1616. This bill authorizes the United \nStates to allow tourists from South Korea to enter the United States \nwithout a visa. This Korea visa waiver will create a new and easier \nsystem for Korean citizens that want to visit the United States. The \nusual delays that presently accompany a request for a U.S. visa from \nthe U.S. Embassy in Seoul will now be avoided.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program was first established in 1986 in order \nto encourage growth in the tourism industry. Since its inception, \ncitizens from certain countries are able to enjoy travel to the United \nStates for short visits without the hassles of waiting for a visa. This \nlegislation will extend this treatment to the Republic of Korea, in \naddition to the three countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  The bill would allow certain travel agencies in Korea to issue \ntemporary travel permits to tour groups, of stays no longer than 15 \ndays. The visitor must possess a round-trip ticket and certain other \nrequirements are imposed to insure that these visitors return home. \nThese requirements should satisfy the critics who are fearful of the \noverstayers.\n  Overseas tourism must be encouraged, for our culture and for our \neconomy. The boost by travelers to the United States will benefit \neveryone. South Korean travelers will have this positive impact on the \ntravel industry in this country.\n  When Canada and New Zealand relaxed their visas for South Korean \ncitizens, those nations saw a massive increase in tourism. According to \n1994 estimates cited by the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, \nKoreans ranked 10th out of all nations in terms of the number of \nvisitors to the United States. This visa-free travel from South Korea \nwill only serve this country's interest.\n  Korea is important to the United States: Korea has been the 6th \nlargest\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\nUnited States trading partner and has the 11th largest economy in the \nworld. The Chamber of Commerce in Korea expects that demand for travel \nto the United States by Koreans may increase. This should be \nencouraged, rather than discouraged, especially when other countries \nare offering Korean travelers visa-free travel.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look into the merits of this legislation \nand support its ultimate passage.\n\n\n                        Commander John J. Jaskot\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Breaux to say thank you to a dedicated public servant whose \ncareer serves to remind us that it is honest hard work and devotion to \nduty that makes this Government work.\n  Comdr. John J. Jaskot, United States Coast Guard, has served on \nCapitol Hill since 1992, first as a Coast Guard Congressional Fellow to \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and most \nrecently as the Coast Guard's Liaison Officer to the U.S. Senate. \nDuring his tenure on Capitol Hill, Commander Jaskot has proven his \nunquestionable integrity and steadfast loyalty while demonstrating the \ntireless commitment to putting forth the effort required to make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, Senator Breaux and I, and our staffs, have worked \nextensively with Commander Jaskot in achieving our shared objectives. \nIn cases where those objectives were not mutually shared, it has been \nCommander Jaskot who has helped bridge the gap between the Senate and \nthe Coast Guard. His untiring work ethic and creativity have helped \nfind solutions to some challenging problems which would otherwise have \ntarnished the already embattled reputation of the Federal Government.\n  On issues specific to Louisiana, Commander Jaskot has ensured that a \nproper dialog has been maintained on tough issues such as the \nenforcement of the use of the contentious Turtle Excluder Devices \n[TEDs] by the Gulf Coast shrimping fleet, the placement of aides to \nnavigation on the newly opened Red River Waterway, and the replacement \nof the dangerous Florida Avenue Bridge. He has made similar efforts on \nissues of national and international scope such as the implementation \nof the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Haitian and Cuban refuge crises, \nand maintaining funding to help keep our waterways operating safely.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, through his hard work, ingenuity, \nintegrity, and genuine good nature, Commander Jaskot has proven that it \nis people who really make the difference between a government that \nworks for its people and one that fails. We can all learn from his \nexample, that on local, as well as national issues, an individual can \nmake a difference. Commander Jaskot certainly has.\n  Commander Jaskot is retiring after 20 years of highly decorated \npublic service in the United States Coast Guard. Senator Breaux and I \nthank him for his dedication to our country and wish he and his family \n``fair winds and following seas'' in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8059-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SYCAMORES HAVE BEEN FELLED; WE WILL GROW CEDARS INSTEAD\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Members of the Senate are \nfamiliar with Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz's historic contribution both to the \nfield of Jewish scholarship and to the resurgence of Jewish life in the \nformer Soviet Union. In 1989, Rabbi Steinsaltz founded the Judaic \nStudies Center and synagogue in the Kunseva section of Moscow, the \nfirst such new school in the Soviet Union since the 1917 Bolshevik \nRevolution. I am privileged to serve on the center's board of advisors \nand to have hosted Rabbi Steinsaltz on his all-too-infrequent trips to \nWashington, DC.\n  It is my unpleasant duty to share with the Senate the disturbing news \nthat a fire of undetermined nature broke out last Friday night, July \n12, in Rabbi Steinsaltz's Judaic Studies Center. All 50 students and \nworshipers in the building at the time were safely evacuated. Except \nfor the Torah scrolls which were saved from the raging flames, the \nentire building was destroyed, including thousands of books and other \nequipment.\n  The center had been a focal point of Russian Jewish life since its \nestablishment. It was the key spiritual center for thousands and the \nfirst Jewish institution of learning officially permitted to function \nduring the Glasnost period. During its years of operation, more than \n1,000 Russian Jews were enrolled in intensive Judaic studies courses \nand many thousands more attended seminars and workshops. On Jewish \nholidays hundreds of Jews flocked there for communal celebrations.\n  When the fire broke out, the center was hosting a seminar for Jewish \ncommunal workers from cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States (CIS). Cities such as Chellabinsk, Siberia, \nBerditchev, Ukraine, and Vitebsk, Belarus, had sent one representative \neach for an intensive 3-month course in Jewish and communal service \nstudies. Graduates of this program are expected to return to their \nnative cities--far from the major Jewish centers--and apply what they \nhave learned.\n  Rabbi Steinsaltz, who is best known for his monumental modern \ncommentary on the Talmud, was recently given the title of Duchovny \nRavin--an historic title connoting the spiritual leader of Russian \nJewry.\n  In Jerusalem, Rabbi Steinsaltz responded to the news by quoting \nIsaiah 9:9. ``Bricks have fallen--we will rebuild with dressed stone. \nSycamores have been felled--we will grow cedars instead.''\n  I know I speak for the entire Senate and for all Americans who \ncherish religious freedom and scholarship when I add my words of \nconsolation and encouragement to Rabbi Steinsaltz on this \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8060-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEASURE HELD AT THE DESK--S. 1965\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Clevert, Jr., To Be U.S. District Judge for \n                   the Eastern District of Wisconsin\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my strong support \nto the nomination of Charles N. Clevert to be United States District \nCourt Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.\n  I am pleased that the full Senate has joined with me, Senator Kohl \nand my colleagues on Judiciary Committee in recognizing Charles \nClevert's qualifications for the Federal bench. I attended Judge \nClevert's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee and the \nfact that he will be a worthy jurist was clearly evident at that time. \nHis is a career of dedicated and unwavering service, not only to the \nlegal community, but to the people of Wisconsin as well.\n  Throughout his legal career, Charles Clevert has worked on behalf of \nthe people of Wisconsin in a number of important ways. He has served as \na prosecutor both in the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office as \nwell as in the United States Attorney's Office. His career has taken \nhim to courtrooms in both Federal and State courts throughout Wisconsin \nand he has practiced in both the criminal and civil arenas. For the \npast nineteen years he has been a United States Bankruptcy Judge. In \n1986, Judge Clevert became the Chief Bankruptcy Judge for Wisconsin's \nEastern District. Clearly Mr. President, these experiences will serve \nhim well on the Federal bench.\n  However Mr. President, these accomplishments do not fully recognize \nthe contribution of Charles Clevert to his profession and his \ncommunity. In addition to being active in various Wisconsin Bar \nAssociations and lecturing at the University of Wisconsin Law School, \nJudge Clevert has been active in working with young people in my state \nof Wisconsin for over 20 years.\n  Judge Clevert takes the time to meet and talk with school children in \nand around Milwaukee about the importance of education and the role of \nthe courts in our society. He stresses the need to emphasize education, \nnot drugs and alcohol. His simple message of hard work and respect for \nthe law is a positive and important one for the young people of \nWisconsin. I was pleased to hear Judge Clevert indicate that it is his \nintention to continue his activities throughout Milwaukee and the State \nof Wisconsin following his confirmation to the federal bench.\n  Mr. President, Charles Clevert's nomination was recommended to \nPresident Clinton by a nominating committee that my colleague, Senator \nKohl and I have established to help ensure that the citizens of our \nState receive quality judicial representation. I am pleased that the \nfull Senate has joined with that advisory committee, the President and \nthe Judiciary Committee in recognizing Charles Clevert's qualifications \nand confirming his nomination to be a United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Wisconsin. I want to wish Judge Clevert, and \nhis family, well in this new and important phase of his career. \nAlthough the responsibility that awaits him is great, it is a \nresponsibility that Charles Clevert will no doubt handle with the \ncompetence and professionalism that has to date marked his \ndistinguished career.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Charles Clevert has accomplished a number of \n``firsts'' in his life. He was the first member of his family to go to \ncollege. He was the first African-American assistant U.S. Attorney in \nWisconsin. When he was appointed in 1977, he was the youngest \nbankruptcy judge in the country.\n  Today, as he is confirmed by the Senate, he becomes the first \nAfrican-American Federal district court judge in Wisconsin history. In \nmy opinion, it is critical that our Federal judiciary try to reflect \nthe diversity that is America. But while we are gratified that Judge \nClevert will add diversity to our Federal bench, he was nominated for \none simple reason: he was the most qualified.\n  Let me tell you why President Clinton could not have made a better \nchoice to fill the vacancy created when Terry Evans--himself an \noutstanding judge--was elevated to the Seventh Circuit.\n  First, Charles Clevert is a jurist of extraordinary intelligence and \nunquestioned skill. Practicing lawyers consistently rank him among the \nfinest judges in Wisconsin. Attorneys who appear before Judge Clevert \nrepeatedly praise him for his integrity, fairness and demeanor. He \nreceived similar high marks from members of the nonpartisan nominating \ncommission--which Senator Feingold and I established with the State \nbar--who made Judge Clevert one of the finalists for the Eastern \nDistrict vacancy. The ABA gave him a ``well-qualified'' rating, the \nhighest grade possible for any nominee.\n  And don't take my word for it, ask the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel: it \ncalled Judge Clevert's selection a ``wise choice'' and a ``milestone.''\n  Second, Judge Clevert is a person of extraordinary achievement and \ngenerosity. He grew up working class in Richmond, where he attended a \nsegregated high school. He went to a small college in West Virginia, \nand then graduated from Georgetown Law School. He has spent more than \n20 years in Wisconsin as a prosecutor and a bankruptcy judge--he is now \nthe Chief Bankruptcy Judge of the Eastern District. Judge Clevert's \nreputation is exceptional even among his colleagues: several years ago \nthey honored him by appointing him President of the National Conference \nof Bankruptcy Judges.\n  Let me also mention that Judge Clevert and his wife Leslie have two \nlovely children, Chip and Melanie, both of whom are in high school. \nWhat little free time Judge Clevert has away from his job and his \nfamily he spends working with his church and with charities. For \nexample, he sits on the board of the Anvil Housing Corporation, which \nprovides subsidized housing for senior and handicapped citizens. And he \nis involved with a group called Men of Tomorrow, an organization that \nmentors young men between the ages of 11 and 18.\n  Mr. President, no one can read the story of Judge Clevert's life and \nnot be impressed. It is eloquent testimony to our country's ability to \ncreate opportunity for all from a social compact some claim was written \nfor a few.\n  From any perspective--prosecutor or defense lawyer, corporate \nlitigator or consumer advocate, debtor or creditor--Charles N. Clevert \nis already a\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\nterrific bankruptcy court judge. He is someone who will faithfully \napply Supreme Court precedent. He is a pragmatist, not an ideologue. \nAnd his career demonstrates a proven record of fairness and toughness.\n  I congratulate the Senate on a wise decision today, and I am sure \nthat Judge Clevert will be as distinguished on the district court as he \nhas been on the bankruptcy bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/17/senate-section/article/S8061-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
