This morning, leader time has been reserved and there will \nbe a period for morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. At 11 a.m., \nthe Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. \n440, the National Highway System bill.\n  I have announced there will be no rollcall votes during today's \nsession of the Senate. Cloture was filed last night on the motion to \nproceed, and there will be a vote on that cloture motion at 3 o'clock \non Monday.\n  I am hopeful that maybe during today's session there can be some \nagreement reached on S. 440, the National Highway System Designation \nAct of 1995. It is a very important piece of legislation. It affects \nevery State. There are one or two controversial areas. One is the \nDavis-Bacon Act, and one is the maximum speed limit compliance program. \nThose two issues, I assume, will be debated for some time. But it is my \nhope to complete action on this bill no later than Tuesday of next \nweek, and then at that point to either go to regulatory reform, if that \nis ready--there are negotiations ongoing as we speak, and there are \nstill about 10 areas of difference, but if we can reach a bipartisan \ncompromise on regulatory reform, we would hope to take it up on \nWednesday--or the other possible proposal would be welfare reform. And \nagain, there is some difficulty on both sides, I might say. Republicans \nare having some difficulties. I understand the Democrats may be, too. \nBut that is again a very important piece of legislation we hope to be \nable to resolve if not next week, take it up the following week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8525-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me also indicate, as I said yesterday, \nwe passed a very important piece of legislation, telecommunications \nlegislation. And obviously there were many, many people who deserved to \nbe thanked for their effort. Certainly, the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Larry Pressler of South Dakota, and members of his staff, and \nSenator Hollings and members of his staff, and many members of the \ncommittee. I wanted to make certain I did not forget to thank David \nWilson on my staff, who has been following this issue almost on a day-\nto-day basis for the past several months. I certainly appreciated his \nefforts and his insight into the very delicate issues which were \ninvolved in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I understand there will be speakers coming to the \nfloor. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know leaders' time was reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8525-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8525-S8526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, remarks I made in California a few weeks ago \nhave played a role in starting a new national debate on how the \nentertainment industry has contributed to the coarsening of our \nculture. \n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n  I was certainly not the first in this Chamber to take some to task \nfor placing profits ahead of the innocence of our children. Senators \nSimon and Bradley have fought the good fight on this matter for many \nyears.\n  One thing that those Senators and I know, however, is that what we do \nhere on the floor of the Senate, matters far less than what occurs out \nin the real world.\n  Until Americans hold accountable those who debase our culture, then \nthere is little hope for progress.\n  But there are definite signs of progress all across the country. And \ntoday, I wanted to congratulate radio station KGRM, which is the campus \nradio station at Grambling State University in Shreveport, LA.\n  Earlier this week, the station announced that, as a protest against \nprofanity and obscenity, it will not play rap music for 19 days.\n  The station's assistant director said--and I quote--``If we can give \nstudents a format that's free of obscenity as far as words and lyrics, \nI think they'll be receptive to it.''\n  Mr. President, Robert Kennedy once said ``Each time a man stands for \nan ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against \ninjustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.''\n  This morning, radio station KRGM is transmitting much more than just \nwords and music. It is also transmitting a ripple of hope. I \ncongratulate them for their courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8525-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ADARAND DECISION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, last Monday's Supreme Court ruling in the \nAdarand case is good news for those who believe that the Federal \nGovernment works best when it works to unite all Americans of all \nbackgrounds.\n  In her majority opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor correctly \nrejected the Clinton administration's position by insisting that \nGovernment-sponsored racial classifications, no matter how well \nintentioned, are inherently suspect and must meet the very highest \nstandard of constitutional review--the standard of review known as \nstrict scrutiny.\n  Whatever our race or ethnic background, the simple truth is that we \nare all Americans. We all pledge allegiance to the same flag. We all \npay taxes to the same Government. We all share the same hope of a \nbetter future for our children and grandchildren. And on the \nbattlefield, we all bleed the same blood. As Justice Scalia said in his \nconcurring opinion, and I quote:\n\n       In the eyes of government, we are just one race. It is \n     American.\n\n  No doubt about it, the evil of discrimination continues to exist in \nthe America of 1995. And, unfortunately, we have not yet achieved the \ncolor-blind ideal for which so many have valiantly struggled. But \nfighting discrimination cannot become an excuse to divide Americans by \nrace, by ethnic background, by gender.\n  You do not cure discrimination with more discrimination.\n  So, Mr. President, I welcome the Supreme Court's Adarand decision. It \nclarifies the standard of review that must be applied to Federal laws \nand regulations that grant preferences on the basis of race. And \nperhaps as important, it is a wake-up call to Congress to put the \nFederal Government's own troubled house in order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8526-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the facts are out: The New York Times \nreported last weekend that the Milosevic regime is actively aiding its \nBosnian Serb allies--sending military assistance and fuel, SAM-6's, and \neven paying the salaries of many Bosnian Serb officers. This comes as \nlittle surprise to me, since I have been extremely skeptical of \nSlobodan Milosevic's reincarnation as peacemaker--an image the Clinton \nadministration has actively promoted in a desperate bid to devise a \nBosnia policy.\n  Indeed, the recent hostage taking by the Bosnian Serbs, followed by \ntheir release as a result of Milosevic's efforts, has called into \nquestion the theory of a split between Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic.\n  In my view the issue is not whether or not Milosevic and Karadzic are \nfriends or political rivals, but whether or not their objectives are \nthe same. The real question is, do Milosevic and Karadzic both want a \ngreater Serbia?\n  It seems to me that the answer is yes--and that this charade of good \ncop, bad cop, has been useful in furthering that objective.\n  Apparently administration sources were aware of this support from \nBelgrade but continued with the approach of easing sanctions on Serbia. \nThose of us in the Congress who believed this policy was unwise for a \nnumber of reasons--including the fact that it removed leverage on the \ndeteriorating situation in Kosova--were told that lifting sanctions \nwould help bring peace to Bosnia because Milosevic would recognize \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, this report should prompt an immediate review of the \nadministration's approach. Now is not the time to lift or further \nsuspend sanctions on Serbia. The Milosevic regime is clearly supporting \nBosnian Serb and Krajina Serb forces--and maybe even orchestrating \ntheir actions. In addition, it is continuing to oppress the Albanian \nmajority in Kosova--which is in its 6th year under martial law.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment to the foreign aid bill \nwhich would amend current Serbian sanctions legislation--originally \nsponsored by Senator Levin--to include strict criteria for the lifting \nof United States sanctions on Belgrade. This criteria will include a \ncomplete cutoff of military, political, or other material support from \nBelgrade to the Bosnian Serb and Krajina Serb militants; a restoration \nof civil rights to all minorities in Serbia; and a restoration of civil \nand human rights and political autonomy to the 2 million Albanians in \nKosova.\n  It is time to stop this farce. Milosevic is no peacemaker. He is the \nauthor of the tragedies in Croatia, in Bosnia, in Kosova. His regime \nmust be held responsible for its actions, not rewarded for its \npretensions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8526-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Reform Act of 1995. This is historic legislation \nthat will substantially change the communications industry in this \ncountry.\n  Although the legislation alters the status quo, I was not able to \nsupport it due to the fact that the bill fundamentally reregulated, not \nderegulated the telecommunications industry.\n  I strongly support passing telecommunications reform. For too long \nthis issue has been dictated by the courts. This is an abrogation of \ncongressional authority, and the Congress is now compelled to play \ncatch-up. It is imperative that the Congress implement a comprehensive, \ncomplete policy that will encourage free market competition and breed \nindustry innovation that will ultimately benefit the consumer. \nLegislation that will accomplish this must contain provisions that \nderegulate and fosters true competition.\n  Unfortunately, the bill passed by the Senate, S. 652, does exactly \nthe opposite. Regulation is increased and congressional, and Federal \nCommunications Commission micromanagement is advanced. This bill \nestablishes a regulatory regime that reallocates existing markets, \ncontrols and limits future growth, and effects changes to the \ncommunications industry through a series of complex, excessive \nregulation.\n  The best way to truly help the consumer is to allow industry the \nmaximum flexibility to grow and prosper. \n\n[[Page S8527]]\nThat can be accomplished through deregulation. History shows us that \nderegulation of industry benefits the consumer. We should be working to \npass legislation that deregulates.\n  S. 652 contains a prescription for a larger and more intrusive \nGovernment in Washington.\n  The bill mandates over 80 new regulatory proceedings that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates will cost over $81 million to \nimplement. Moreover, it is squarely at odds with nearly a quarter \ncentury of well-considered, soundly crafted, and broadly successful \nregulatory reform initiatives which commanded strong bipartisan support \nand, in the final analysis, yielded substantial consumer dividends for \nthe American public. Back in 1970, the Senate Commerce Committee began \nwork to deregulate a number of key, infrastructure industries. Airline, \ntruck and rail, broadcast, maritime, cable, and freight regulatory \nreforms were initiated and successfully carried forward. These reforms \nparalleled changes which were occurring in the world at large, as the \nnotion of pervasive, central economic planning by Government--embodied \nin the now-bankrupt Communist teaching and doctrine--faltered and \ncompetitive free enterprise concepts were adopted and embraced.\n  Senator Packwood and I offered a series of amendments to S. 652 to \nmake the bill more deregulatory. One amendment would have eliminated \nfrom the bill provisions which give the FCC excessive and unnecessary \npolicymaking power. Another would have struck the community users \nprovisions in the bill. A third amendment would have replaced the \nbill's universal service scheme with a voucher system that would have \ntruly empowered consumers.\n  Unfortunately, all of those amendments were defeated.\n  I do want to thank the Commerce Committee chairman and ranking member \nfor accepting some other amendments. I had sought to change the \ndefinition of the universal service contained in the bill. The \nuniversal service definition was far too broad and would have \npotentially cost consumers and companies hundreds of millions of \ndollars. The committee adopted the definition of universal service that \nI proposed as part of the manager's package of amendments.\n  Also included in the manager's package was an amendment I intended to \noffer to strike the DBS tax provisions in the bill. The legislation \ncontained language that would have authorized the States to order DBS \ntelevision providers to act as State tax collectors. This was an ill-\nconceived concept and I am very pleased that it was struck from the \nbill.\n  I was also very pleased that the committee accepted my amendment \nmandating that the FCC report any increases in the fees charged to \ncommunications companies as part of their universal service obligation \nand another amendment to means test the community users section of the \nbill. Both improved the bill.\n  Last, although I could not support this legislation, I want to thank \nChairman Pressler. He did a masterful job of shepherding this bill \nthrough the Senate. He deserves specific praise for his efforts.\n  I also want to thank ranking Member Hollings, Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Snowe, and Senator Packwood.\n  Their staff also deserve considerable praise for their efforts and \nhard work. I also want to thank Adam Thier of the Heritage Foundation, \nBob Corn-Revere of Hogan & Hartson, and Jeffrey Blumenfeld and Christy \nKunin of Blumenfeld & Cohen for their input and advocacy regarding the \ntelecommunications voucher program.\n  I appreciate their help, and I thank them for their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8526-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HOUSTON ROCKETS WIN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on Wednesday a team from my home \nState, the Houston Rockets, won their second consecutive NBA \nChampionship, defeating the Orlando Magic four games to none. The \nRockets overcame everything from injuries to midseason trade to, \nfinally, one of the toughest playoff schedules over.\n  To understand the full significance of Wednesday night's victory, Mr. \nPresident, you must understand the history of Houston's two star \nplayers, Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. Both attended the \nUniversity of Houston in the first part of the 1980's. In 1983 and \n1984, Olajuwon and Drexler took their University of Houston team to the \nNCAA National Championship game. Soon after, they both went their \nseparate ways. But this past Valentine's Day, in a trade many sports \ncritics called unnecessary, the Rockets put Drexler back with his old \ncollege teammate Olajuwon. Wednesday night, the critics were proven \nwrong.\n  The Houston Rockets set an NBA playoff record by winning seven road \ngames in a row. On their way to the NBA title, they won 11 out of their \nlast 13 games. In the Western Conference Finals, they defeated the team \nwith the best record in the regular season, another treasured Texas gem \nthe San Antonio Spurs. As a team that never got the respect that it \ndeserved when it won the title last year, Houston can now celebrate a \ntitle that will long be remembered. For most of the team, the second \none is so much sweeter; but to Clyde Drexler, after 12 years in the \nNBA, this is the sweetest.\n  Mr. President, to repeat as champions with a four-game sweep is \nunprecedented. Five times the Rockets faced elimination and five \ntimes--with poise, determination, and character--they prevailed. The \nchampionship was a total team effort and everyone contributed.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that my colleagues will be glad to join me \nin congratulating the 1995 NBA World Champion Houston Rockets. For a \nteam that started the playoffs with the sixth seed in the tournament, \nthey are the lowest seed ever to win a World Championship. The Rockets \nshowed their most adamant critics that they were not about to give up. \nIn the words of head coach Rudy Tomjonavich, ``Never underestimate the \nheart of a champion.''\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to make sure that we recognized this \ngreat team effort, and the heart of these champions. And I am very \nproud of the Houston Rockets today, as last year, for their repeat \nworld championship in basketball Wednesday.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8527-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. SIMON.

HENRY FOSTER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate on the \nsituation facing the President's nomination submitted to the Senate for \nthe office of Surgeon General.\n  Mr. President, it is now nearly 4 months since President Clinton sent \nto the Senate the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to be Surgeon General \nof the United States. On May 2 and 3, the Labor Committee held hearings \non the nomination and on May 26 the committee voted to approve the \nnomination and sent it to the full Senate for final action.\n  Already 3 weeks have passed and nothing further has happened. It is \ntime for a vote.\n  Dr. Foster has demonstrated his impressive qualifications, his \ncharacter, and his vision for the future of health care in this \ncountry. During the committee hearings, he successfully put to rest the \ncharges attacking his character and his ability. He earned the \nadmiration and respect of the committee and the American public. Even \nsome who opposed the nomination have expressed the belief that the \nSenate \n\n[[Page S8528]]\nshould vote. Other opponents have threatened to filibuster to prevent a \nfinal vote.\n  It is time for the Senate to act. By now it is obvious that Dr. \nFoster is a highly principled physician and educator who has devoted \nhis life and his career to the service of others. His record is \noutstanding. He has been widely praised for his contributions to the \nquality of health care for his patients, for his service to his \ncommunity, and for his research and teaching and medicine. We do a \ndisservice to Dr. Foster, the Senate and the Nation as a whole by \nprolonging this process.\n  The Nation has now been without a Surgeon General for 6 months, and \nthere is no justification for further delay. Only one issue is holding \nup this nomination. Many other issues have been raised as a \nsmokescreen, but they are easily dispelled. The real issue delaying \nthis nomination is the issue of abortion. The diehard opponents of a \nwoman's right to choose are doing all they can to block this nomination \nbecause Dr. Foster participated in a small number of abortions during \nhis 38-year career. But Dr. Foster is a baby doctor, not an abortion \ndoctor. He has delivered thousands of healthy babies, often in the most \ndifficult circumstances of poverty and neglect. As one commentator has \nobserved, ``Dr. Foster has saved more babies than Operation Rescue.''\n  In any event, abortion is a legal medical procedure and a \nconstitutionally protected right. It is not a disqualification for the \noffice of Surgeon General of the United States. And there is no \njustification for some of our Republican colleagues to try to make it \none.\n  Dr. Foster is an obstetrician and a gynecologist, and it is no \nsurprise to anyone that he has participated in abortions. Those who \nhave heard Dr. Foster describe his vision for health care and have \nexamined his record know about the lives he has saved, the hundreds of \nyoung doctors he has trained, his outstanding research on sickle-cell \nanemia and infant mortality, his model program on maternal and infant \ncare, and his groundbreaking work to combat teenage pregnancy. \nPresident George Bush thought so highly of Dr. Foster's ``I Have a \nFuture Program'' in Nashville that he honored it with the designation \nas one of his thousand points of light.\n  With this nomination, the Nation has an unprecedented opportunity to \ndeal more effectively with some of the more difficult challenges facing \nus in health care today and to do it under the leadership of an \noutstanding physician and an outstanding human being who has devoted \nhis life to providing health care and for opportunity to those who need \nthe help most.\n  As Dr. Foster has stated, his first priority will be to deal with the \nNation's overwhelming problem of teenage pregnancy, and he is just what \nthe doctor ordered to lead this important battle.\n  Teenage pregnancy is a crisis of devastating proportions. The United \nStates has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the industrial \nworld. More than a million U.S. teenagers become pregnant every year, \nand every day the problem gets worse. Dr. Foster can be the national \nspokesman we need on this issue to educate teenagers about the risks of \npregnancy.\n  Every day, every week, every month, every year, the number of \nteenagers lost to this epidemic grows further out of control. With Dr. \nFoster's leadership, we have an unparalleled opportunity to deal more \neffectively with this cruel cycle of teenage pregnancy, dependency and \nhopelessness.\n  Dr. Foster's ``I Have a Future Program'' has been a beacon of hope to \ninner-city teenagers. His program provides the guidance they need to \nmake responsible, sensible decisions about their health and their \nfuture and to put themselves on the road to self-sufficiency and \nproductivity and away from dependency, violence and poverty. He has \ntaught them to say no to early sex and yes to their futures and to \ntheir education and to their dreams.\n  Dr. Foster has devoted his life to giving people a chance, giving \nwomen the chance for healthy babies, giving babies a healthy childhood, \ngiving teenagers a chance for successful futures.\n  Now Dr. Foster deserves a chance of his own, a chance to be voted on \nby the entire Senate. I urge the majority leader to do the right thing \nand bring this nomination up before the Senate and a vote by the entire \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I heard earlier during the debate and discussion that \nwe have legislation before us that is going to be necessary to pass by \nOctober. I daresay that every day that we delay in terms of approving \nDr. Foster is a day when this Nation is lacking in the leadership of \nthis extraordinary human being who can do something about today's \nproblems, not problems and challenges that the States are going to face \nin the fall, but today's problems, tomorrow's problems, on the problems \nof teenage pregnancy and the problems of child and maternal care, and \nall the range of public health problems that are across this country.\n  That individual ought to be approved. We ought to have a debate. If \nthe majority leader was looking for something to do on a Friday, we \nought to be debating that today and voting on it today, instead of \ndebating the issue that is going to deny working families income to put \nbread on the table.\n  We can ask what our priorities are. The majority has selected to \ndebate Davis-Bacon, not to debate the qualifications of Dr. Foster. As \nmuch as I am sympathetic to where we might be in the fall, I am \nconcerned about the public health conditions of the American public \ntoday. There is no excuse--no excuse whatsoever--not to bring him up, \nother than the power of those who have expressed their views about the \nissues on abortion. That is what is behind this delay, and it is wrong.\n  Dr. Foster has appeared before the committee, answered the questions, \nhas been reported out, and he is entitled to a vote. Even two members \nof our committee who voted in opposition indicated that they believe \nthe Senate ought to vote on this.\n  We have to ask ourselves, how much longer do we have to wait? This is \na timely, important, sensitive position, and this country is being \ndenied the leadership of Dr. Foster, and we have no adequate \nexplanation about why that is the case. The nominees are entitled to be \ndebated and to be reported out and, once reported out, they are \nentitled to be voted on in the U.S. Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will have an opportunity the next \ntime the majority is looking around for something because we are not \nready to deal with the welfare reform issues, and we are not prepared \nto deal with some other issue, that we can move ahead on the Dr. Foster \nnomination. We are ready to debate it. The committee is ready to debate \nit. We are entitled, he is entitled, and the country is entitled to \nhave a vote on that nomination, and I hope that it will be very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8527-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETI- TION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n\n                          section 252(a)(2)(A)\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD.

In addition to his \nprofessional work at Habersham Bank and his community service with the \nchamber of commerce and the Georgia Mountains Private Industry and \nLocal Coordinating Committee, Mr. Stovall serves in the Habersham \nCounty Rotary Club and as governor of Rotary District 6910.\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\n  It is in his capacity as a Rotary District Governor that Mr. Stovall \nbrought to my attention a recent ``Rotary Peace Program'' put on by the \nRotary Foundation of Rotary International. Entitled ``Population and \nDevelopment: A Global Perspective for Rotary Service,'' the event \nbrought together Rotarians from District 9100, which includes Rotary \nclubs in 15 West African nations, and Rotarians from District 6910, \nwhich includes 57 Rotary clubs from throughout North Georgia.\n  At the Dakar Peace Program, the Rotarians were examining an issue of \nconcern to many Americans--that is, the population growth in a number \nof countries in the world which are incapable of meeting the \nagricultural, the environmental, the medical, and the economic \nchallenges that accompany such high races of growth.\n  Mr. President, these Rotarians, meeting in Dakar, Senegal, serve as \nan example of how nonprofit service organizations can take actions \nwhich contribute to the public debate and help to further policy \nobjectives. To this end, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks the resolution adopted at the \nDakar Peace Forum.\n  I also want to recognize other Georgia Rotarians who participated in \nthe Dakar Peace Forum.

Mr. President, America rejoiced last week when the \nnews broke of Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady's rescue from Serb-\ncontrolled territory of Bosnia after being missing for 6 days. We were \nrelieved know that he was safe and sound and we were eager to receive a \nsliver of good news from a region where day after day for 3 years we \nhave been besieged by reports of the murder of innocents, genocide, and \ninternational hooliganism on a scale unseen since the dark days of \nWorld War II.\n  Our elation could not help but grow when this young F-16 pilot \nstepped before the microphones for the first time after his rescue. His \nwords filled us with pride and reminded us of what makes the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces so special and what is special about America. \nAfter 6 days of eating grass, drinking rain water, and hiding from \narmed Serbs who were trying to kill him, this young man's first words \nwere of his thanks to God, his parents, his comrades-in-arms, and his \ncountry. As remarkable as his own actions were in the face of \nconsiderable hardship and danger, Scott O'Grady told the world that he \nwas not the hero in this situation--in his view it was the brave men \nand women who risked their lives for him by conducting a continuous \nsearch effort and, when at last he was located, flying into enemy \nterritory to snatch him away and bring him home.\n  Though he spoke for less than 2 minutes in that first appearance \nbefore a cheering crowd at Aviano Air Base and, thanks to instant \ncommunications, the entire world, his words should give us all pause \nand cause us to consider the values he reflects: trust in God, love of \nfamily, unwavering confidence in his country, and faith in the \nabilities of his colleagues in each of the military services. \nThroughout the past week of interviews and ceremonies at the White \nHouse and Pentagon, Captain O'Grady has continued to talk about his \nfaith in God, country, family, and coworker.\n  Are these values unique to Scott O'Grady or to members of the Armed \nForces? Clearly, living, working, and, when called upon, fighting and \ndying together are unique aspects of life in the Armed Forces which \nbuild the camaraderie and faith in your fellow workers that are so \nevident in the military. These values are critically important when \none's work requires you to put your life in the hands of others.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am involved in \ndecisions on defense budgets and policies which remind me every day of \nthe important responsibilities we have for the men and women of our \nArmed Forces. We must work to ensure that they are properly trained, \nequipped, and motivated--as Captain O'Grady and the members of the \nrescue forces clearly were--if they are going to be able to continue \ntheir vital work of ensuring our national security. Too often in recent \ntimes, the dedicated men and women of our military have been tarred \nwith a brush of scandal because of the proper acts of just a few. These \nacts are cause for concern and should be taken seriously as the Senate \nalways has. But at the end of the day, I believe that what we see in \nCaptain O'Grady and those brave servicemen and women who rescued him is \nthe best representation of what our Armed Forces are and what they \nstand for.\n  But the values we have seen reflected in the words and deeds of Scott \nO'Grady are, in fact, the values which Americans have prized throughout \nour history. They are what has made America great. They are the values \nwhich most of us learned from our parents in homes across America. \nScott's mother and father should be proud of the way they taught these \nvalues to their son.\n  The daily barrage of headlines of violence in the homes and streets \nof America, stories of broken homes, and indications of racial and \nreligious bigotry could lead one to conclude that there is a cancer \ngrowing on America's spirit. I do not believe it and I doubt that most \nAmericans believe it.\n  Americans are as they have always been--people of faith, courage, \npatriotism, and hard work. Perhaps it is time to remind ourselves of \nwhat is good about us and to allow our values to come to the surface \nagain where they can help pull us above our fears and insecurities.\n  America owes young Scott O'Grady a debt of gratitude--for the \nprofessional manner in which he performed his duties as an officer in \nthe U.S. Air Force and for the reminder that he has given us of what it \ntakes to survive in these troubled times. America should rejoice with \nhis return--and reflect upon what it says about us as a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8529-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\n\n                           AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to address the Supreme \nCourt's historic decision in the Adarand case handed down earlier this \nweek. A majority of the Court, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nfound that preference and set-aside programs ordered by the Federal \nGovernment must be examined under the strictest judicial scrutiny. \nJustice O'Connor's opinion states that equal protection of the laws, as \nguaranteed by the Constitution, extends to every person, not to \nparticular groups.\n  These preference programs are based on notions of group entitlement. \nAs a practical matter, this decision will make it very difficult for \nthe Federal Government to justify the more than 150 preference programs \nthat currently exist. This decision is an important step in making this \nNation truly color blind.\n  The case involved a Federal subcontract on a highway project. Under \nthe Surface Transportation Act of 1987, Department of Transportation \ngives a bonus to a general contractor who hires subcontractors who \nqualify as socially and economically disadvantaged. Under the Small \nBusiness Administration definitions, disadvantaged is presumed to \ninclude African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women, native Americans, \nand other minority group members.\n  Despite Adarand Construction's lowest bid on a Colorado highway \nproject to build a guardrail, the general contractor gave the \nsubcontract to a minority firm. Adarand sued, claiming a violation of \nits right to equal protection.\n  Justice O'Connor, citing earlier affirmative action cases which had \nclouded the issue of the validity of these programs, wrote that \nclassification based upon race which appear to be benign are not really \nbenign, but ``are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial \ninferiority or simple racial politics.''--from her own plurality \nopinion in Croson.\n  This decision comes in the midst of lots of attention to these \npreference programs. There is a movement in California to abolish \npreference and set aside programs. Gov. Pete Wilson recently did away \nwith preferences in State employment by executive order and there is \nlikely to be a ballot initiative next year. President Clinton has \nordered a review of Federal preference policies, and congressional \nleaders, including the majority leader, have called for close \nexamination of these programs.\n  Americans have no tolerance for racial discrimination, but they also \nhave no patience for discrimination which is committed under the guise \nof making up lost opportunity for those who belong to certain groups. \nYou can't discriminate against one group to benefit another. Justice \nScalia said it best in his concurrence in the Adarand case,\n\n       . . . [U]nder our Constitution there can be no such thing \n     as either a debtor or creditor race. . . . In the eyes of the \n     government, we are just one race here.\n\n  Mr. President, in the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, which I chair, we will have an opportunity to \nreview at least one of these set-aside programs. It requires a \npercentage of certain categories of foreign aid to be managed by \nminority contractors. Under the Court's decision in the Adarand case, \nwe will now examine the set-aside program under the strict scrutiny \ntest. The administration will have to establish a compelling interest \nto justify the continuation of preference and set-aside programs. In \nthis time of very scarce dollars, and especially scarce in the context \nof foreign aid, it's hard to imagine the administration's justification \nfor anything other than the most efficient and economical use of our \nforeign aid dollars.\n  I look forward to the ramifications and implications of the Adarand \ncase and the revision and even end to many of the Federal Government's \npreference programs and policies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8530-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, introduced a bill to reform the FAA. There is \nprobably no institution in this town that needs reform more than it \ndoes. In my home State of Montana we take aviation, particularly \ngeneral aviation, very seriously because we are a very large State but \nwe are the 44th in population. We are the fourth largest State, 148,000 \nsquare miles. The Chair understands about that, coming from Wyoming, \nour good friend to the south. So you could say both of us have quite a \nlot in common. There is quite a lot of dirt between light bulbs in our \npart of the world and not many folks in between. So, for us having \ngeneral aviation in a healthy mode and our ability to fly point to \npoint is not a luxury, it is often a necessity in the West.\n  So we have a very strong, hard-working and well organized pilot \ncommunity in Montana. I am proud of my strong relationship with the \nthousands of pilots in my State. Many of them are flying ranchers and \nthat is the way they get their parts, that is the way they do a lot of \nbusiness, a lot of their travel.\n  I have been watching the debate about reform of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the Air Traffic Control system with some concern, \nand I share those concerns with my friend from Oklahoma. The pilots who \ntalk to me tell of outdated equipment that their air traffic \ncontrollers are forced to use. I have heard the same concerns from air \ntraffic controllers all over the country, as a matter of fact. They \ntell me about the concerns that the FAA does not get the necessary \nfunds and it is absolutely hamstrung in some areas by layers and layers \nof red tape. They say the FAA is ripe for reform. After serving in this \nbody now in my second term, after 6 years, I would have to agree with \nthat.\n  But many of the proposals I have seen are only superficially \nattractive. The numbers just do not add up. The administration's ATC \nCorporation idea--there is no industry support for an entirely \nprivatized ATC.\n  So today I am joining with Senator Inhofe in his introduction of \nlegislation to provide some realistic, meaningful reform for the FAA. \nIt will reestablish the FAA as an independent agency with an \nadministrator who has a fixed term in office of 7 years and a \nmanagement advisory committee made up of members of the private sector \nto advise the administrator on management policy, spending, and \nregulatory matters.\n  This measure will provide the FAA with major personnel, procurement \nand finance reforms that I think it needs. It will mandate that the FAA \ntake action on safety-critical regulations in a more timely manner. \nThis bill will give the FAA more flexibility in making corrections \nwithout risking its record of safety.\n  It is my hope this bill will be a starting point from which we can \ngain some consensus among this body, and in this Congress, and we hope \nthat consensus will evolve rather quickly. I understand Senator McCain \nis also working on a proposal to reform FAA. He is the chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee. His knowledge of not \nonly flight but also this agency is unexcelled, and I hope he will \nwelcome this bill and that it will be a valuable contribution to what \nhe is trying to do. Maybe we can really get together and put reform on \nthe fast track. We can work together. I think it can be supported by \neveryone in the aviation community. It is needed.\n  Also, we have to be very mindful that not just airlines use FAA. It \nis very important we maintain it at a healthy level for general \naviation because of the points I spoke about earlier on today.\n  With that, I support this reform as it starts down the track. We hope \nwe can get a consensus and reform it before the snow flies this fall.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Senators on the floor, I yield the \nfloor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8530-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 440.\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I might say to my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, I had some remarks prepared, and intend to \nspeak for awhile, but I wondered, if he wanted to start off, he can.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota. I am here to listen to the persuasiveness of his argument. I \nwill say that this bill is important. As we all know, unless we pass \nthis legislation by the end of September of this year, our States will \nbe deprived of some $6.5 billion of highway funds, which we need. So I \nthink it is unfortunate we are involved in this filibuster, but that is \nobviously the choice of those on the other side. I am perfectly \nprepared to hear the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Given the few remarks of my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, it probably would be important for me to clarify the situation.\n  Mr. President, I agree that the underlying bill, this highway bill, \nis extremely important to the country. The debate is really not about \nthe underlying bill. The debate is about Federal prevailing wage \nstandards under the Davis-Bacon law, and an effort to repeal Davis-\nBacon, at least in relation to the highway construction work that is \ndone.\n  What is attached to this bill is an amendment to repeal the Davis-\nBacon law in relation to highway construction work. That is what is \nunfortunate. So those of us who are taking on this issue in this debate \nare not doing it, if you will, Mr. President, of our own choosing. That \nis to say, we are more than willing to have a full-scale debate about \nthe importance of the Davis-Bacon legislation first passed in 1931. We \ndo not believe that this debate should be taking place right now. We do \nnot think this amendment to repeal Davis-Bacon should be a part of this \npiece of legislation. That is really the debate. The debate is not \nabout the underlying bill at all. My colleague from Rhode Island will \ncertainly find me to be very supportive of much of his work on the \nunderlying bill. But in a letter of May 2, I and other colleagues \nindicated that we intended to engage in extended debate on this bill if \nthis Davis-Bacon repeal amendment was adopted, so no one should be \nsurprised by our presence here today.\n  I would like to talk first about the Davis-Bacon piece of \nlegislation, just to summarize it for those who are watching this \ndebate, and then talk about what I consider to be the larger question, \nthe larger issue that is before the Senate, and therefore before the \ncountry.\n  First, on Davis-Bacon, Mr. President, back in the early thirties, \nthis piece of legislation was passed and the basic idea was as follows: \nWhere the Federal Government is involved in construction contracts, we \nwant to make sure that wages that are paid to those workers are \nconsistent with the prevailing wage of the community. In other words, \nthe Federal Government is the big player here, and it is kind of right \nout of Florence Reese's song ``Which Side Are You On?'' Either the \nFederal Government is involved on the side of the contractor in paying \nwages below the prevailing level of the community or the Federal \nGovernment--being a Government that cares not just about the largest \nmultinational corporations in the world, not just about the people who \nhave the financial wherewithal, but a Government that cares about wage \nearners, cares about working families, and says we will make sure that \nour involvement is to assure that the wages paid to working people--in \nthis particular case we are talking about highway construction \nworkers--is consistent with the prevailing wage.\n  Mr. President, I would just simply tell you that proposition is based \nupon a standard of fairness in which I think the vast majority of the \npeople of the United States of America believe.\n  Second, Mr. President, the importance of Davis-Bacon, which is why \nthis piece of legislation has been with us for well over a half a \ncentury, is that by making sure you have some kind of prevailing wage \nstandard you also have higher quality labor and higher quality work \nthat is done. And when it comes to the highways and to the bridges and \nto our physical infrastructure, it is pretty darned important to the \npeople of Minnesota and Michigan and Rhode Island and Virginia and \nelsewhere that the highest quality work is done. That is part of how we \nmeasure benefit and how we measure cost.\n  So, Mr. President, what is at issue is not the underlying bill. What \nis at issue is that within this piece of legislation is this one \nprovision which would repeal Davis-Bacon as it relates to highway \nconstruction work, which I understand is about 40 percent of the work \ncovered by Davis-Bacon. This is no small issue. This is no small issue \nto working people; this is no small issue when it comes to wages; this \nis no small issue when it comes to fair working conditions; this is no \nsmall issue for the Senate; and it is no small issue for people in this \ncountry. I have to tell you, Mr. President, that the larger issue, what \nis really at stake I think can be shown rather graphically by this \nchart.\n  If you look at historical trends in real family income--and the \nsource of this is the Bureau of Census, Department of Commerce --if you \nlook at real family income, what you get between 1950 and 1978 is \nsomething like this. For the bottom 20 percent of people in our \ncountry, real family income in 1993 dollars went up 138 percent.\n  Now, in our country I think people say that is the way it should be. \nThe bottom 20 percent, their family income goes up 138 percent. The \nsecond 20 percent goes up 98 percent. The middle 20 percent, family \nincome goes up 106 percent. The fourth 20 percent --now we are getting \ntoward the top--111 percent, and then the top 20 percent, real family \nincome goes up 90 percent, between the years 1950 to 1978.\n  That is sort of the American dream, Mr. President. That is what \npeople care about, that is real growth in family income. And during \nthis period, we see a trend that is very consistent, with the kind of \nstandard of fairness that people in the country believe in.\n  Now, Mr. President, we look at 1979 to 1993, and what we see is a \ncountry growing apart.\n  As a matter of fact, more recent reports that have come out have \nshown that we have the greatest gap in income in wealth than we have \never had since we started measuring these things.\n  So, Mr. President, we see that between 1979 and 1993, for the bottom \n20 percent, real family income goes down by 17 percent; the second 20 \npercent real family income goes down by 8 percent; the middle 20 \npercent real family income goes down by 3 percent; the fourth 20 \npercent real family income rises by 5 percent; and for the top 20 \npercent, real family income goes up by 18 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, what is really going on here is a debate about \nwhere the Federal Government fits in and what kind of public policy \nthroughout the country is responsive to working families. This is the \nsqueeze that people feel within the country, and I say to my colleague, \nand I say to people who are watching this debate, at the very time that \nreal family income is going down, at the very time that the bottom 80 \npercent of the population feels this squeeze, what are we doing? Some \nare trying to overturn a piece of legislation that has served this \ncountry well and served working families well. We are now trying to \nbring down wages in our communities, and we have a Congress which, up \nto date, has been unwilling to even raise the minimum wage. So this \ndebate is all about fairness. This debate is all about what matters to \npeople in the country more \n\n[[Page S8532]]\nthan any other issue: a good job at a good wage.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield for just a series of questions. \nIf we repeal Davis-Bacon, does that, in any way, depress the wages of \nthat top 20 percent that has already gone up 18 percent?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Certainly not. If you look at average wages in the \nconstruction field, it is about $25,000-$30,000, or thereabouts.\n  Mr. SIMON. Then where, if we pass the repeal of Davis-Bacon, does it \nhave its impact?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Illinois that if we repeal \nDavis-Bacon as it applies to highway construction, or even beyond \nthat--which has everything in the world to do with making sure that we \ndo not depress prevailing wages in our communities--what you are really \ngoing to see is a drop in incomes for the middle 20 percent, the second \n20 percent, and the bottom 20 percent.\n  Mr. SIMON. So what we will be doing if we pass Davis-Bacon is \ndepressing the wages of those who already are losing in our society.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is precisely the point, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. President, the most fundamental flaw of all with this provision \nin the bill is that it depresses the wages of the very families that \nare the most hard pressed in this country. I say to my colleague, we \nare not talking just about the poor, we are talking about middle-income \nworking families, around $25,000, $30,000, a year.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for the purpose of \na question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment of the Senator from Virginia, which is the \ncurrent subject of discussion, relates only to the highway program. And \nin the Senator's presentation, he is sort of talking about all Davis-\nBacon when, in fact, it is only roughly 38 percent of the program.\n  So I think it is important to be accurate here. We are talking about \njust that part of Davis-Bacon relating to the Federal Highway Program, \nare we not, I ask my colleague?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Virginia, I \nused the figure 40 percent earlier, 38 percent or 40 percent; that is \ncorrect. About 40 percent of Davis-Bacon contracts are highway related. \nWhen you consider all of the billions of dollars that we spend on \nhighway construction, I think that's a lot. I mean, 40 percent of \nDavis-Bacon, 40 percent of prevailing wages in communities across our \ncountry, 40 percent that affects these families that are most hard \npressed is not an insignificant percentage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not contest that point, but let us be \naccurate that we are talking about only the Federal Highway Program.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I have been accurate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am not sure the Senator pointed out that \nthis chart--it seems to me the Senator was talking to the entirety of \nDavis-Bacon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Virginia, Mr. President, \nthat before he came in, I first defined Davis-Bacon, I talked about the \npurpose of Davis-Bacon, the public interest accomplishments of Davis-\nBacon, and I then went on and said this amendment dealt with highway \nconstruction as it applies to Davis-Bacon and gave the figure 40 \npercent.\n  What I will now say to my colleague is that we are talking about \nsomething larger than just the highway construction workers and we are \ntalking about a larger question than just Davis-Bacon. What we are \ntalking about is, if you look at the most recent years, an enormous \nsqueeze on really the bottom 80 percent of the population. So that is \nreally the issue here, and that is what I am now trying to pinpoint.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for his questions.\n  So, the reason I am on the floor with Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts and Senator Simon from Illinois is, A, Davis-Bacon passed \nin 1931. Why? To make sure that when the Federal Government is involved \nin these contracts, we are on the side of making sure that the wages \nthat are paid to those workers are at least consistent with the \nprevailing wages of the community and we do not get involved or we are \nnot on the side of employers who depress wages for people in the \ncommunity.\n  B, we support the underlying bill, but this provision should not be a \npart of this bill. We ought to have a separate debate on Davis-Bacon \nbecause of the significance of this. When you are trying to overturn a \npiece of legislation that has been a part of the political and social \nlandscape of this Nation for over 60 years and has been a part of \nfundamental economic justice and has been consistent with the idea that \npeople ought to make decent wages on which they can support their \nfamilies, you do not put it in as part of a highway bill. You deal with \nthe whole legislation separately, and then you have that debate.\n  And then C, what I am now trying to do in this presentation is point \nout again, if I can ask for the first chart, what is really the larger \ncontext. This is what I think American politics is all about in many \nways.\n  From the years 1950 to 1978, the vast majority of people in this \ncountry--and this is the American dream--saw a real increase in real \nfamily income, and from 1979 to 1993, we have seen a growing apart in \nthis Nation. That is a fact. And for the life of me I do not know why \nin the world colleagues would be so anxious to repeal a law that is so \nconsistent with economic justice, economic opportunity, fair wages and \nopportunities for working middle-income families in America.\n  Mr. President, people in the country feel an economic squeeze. People \nare worried about whether or not there are going to be good jobs. Let \nme just present some alternatives to what I think this effort is all \nabout, and I certainly hope my colleagues will support us in blocking \nthis effort, because this effort to repeal this provision of Davis-\nBacon that applies to highway construction workers does not take us \ninto the 21st century. In fact, this takes us back to the 19th century.\n  Let me present an alternative formulation. You say you want to have \nwelfare reform, and we need to reform that system. We are going to have \na debate on welfare reform, and hopefully not on something that is \ncalled welfare reform, but is really an effort to punish women and \nchildren.\n  Here is real welfare reform: A good education, good health care, and \na good job. If we want to reduce poverty in America--say, for example, \nthe poverty that exists 10 blocks from where we are right now in \nWashington, DC, or the poverty in Minnesota, Illinois, Massachusetts, \nRhode Island, or Virginia, the answer is a good education, good health \ncare, and a good job.\n  Mr. President, if you want to reduce violence in this Nation--and we \nall do--you hold people accountable that commit these crimes, no \nquestion about it. But, Mr. President, talk to any judge, police chief, \nor sheriff, and they will all tell you the same thing: We also have to \nreduce violence by focusing on a good education, good health care, and \na good job.\n  Mr. President, if you want to have a stable middle class, people need \na good education, good health care and a good job. If you want to have \na democracy--we have a democracy--that is why we love this country and \nwhy I love being in the U.S. Senate, you have to have men and women who \ncan think on their own two feet and understand the world and the \ncountry and the community they live in. The only way that can happen is \na good education and a good job.\n  Mr. President, this effort to repeal the part of Davis-Bacon that \naffects the highway program is mistaken. This takes us back to the 19th \ncentury, not forward into the 21st century. I simply contend that the \nfuture for our country is twofold. First, we need to understand that \nour real national security is to invest in the skills, intellect, and \ncharacter of young people. The real national security is to make sure \nwe focus on a good education for our citizens. The real national \nsecurity is to make sure we focus on good jobs at decent wages.\n  This effort is mistaken. This effort turns the clock back, and that \nis why, in every way possible, those of us on the floor today intend to \ndefeat this effort to repeal the provisions of Davis-Bacon.\n  I will yield for a question.\n  \n[[Page S8533]]\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would like to ask my colleague this on the chart \nindicating from 1979 to 1993. Can he say whether or not during that \nperiod of time the aggregate numbers he has there were reflective of a \nstraight-line decrease in the share for the people in the lowest 20 \npercent and an increase for the people in the top 20 percent, or if \nthere were fluctuations during that period, and if he is familiar with \nthe year-by-year data during that timeframe?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that I am not familiar with the \nyear-to-year variation thereof. But I think, as a matter of fact, what \nhappened in the United States, in the last decade and a half, is what's \nbeen called the deindustrialization of America. We have seen, in the \nUnited States of America, what Robert Kuttner and others have called a \n``disappearing middle class.'' We have seen in the United States an \neconomy that is producing some jobs, but not the kind of jobs that \nfamilies can count on, because they do not pay a decent wage or, I say \nto my colleague from Michigan, do not provide a decent fringe benefit.\n  So the point is that as you look at this period of time from 1979 to \n1993, we are now in a period where the vast majority of families--\nreally if you get right down to it, the bottom 80 percent--have been \nunder an enormous squeeze.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I have seen this chart, of course, in our Budget \nCommittee meetings and our Labor Committee meetings, and on the floor \nseveral times. I think it may have originated with Secretary Reich from \nthe Department of Labor, who used this chart to argue that the economic \npolicies over that last period, the period in question, 1979 to 1993, \nhave been consistent policies. This chart is usually employed to argue \nthat it has been the Republican policies that were harmful to certain \nsegments of the economy, particularly certain income groups. But I have \ntried to look at this chart in terms of the policies that were in place \nduring that timeframe. What I discovered was that there were some very \nsignificant changes during that timeframe. It begins in 1979. That is \nduring a timeframe in which we had President Carter in office, and we \nhad policies of higher taxes and more regulation. We had very high \ninterest rates in this country and quite high inflation during that \ntimeframe. Those policies were pretty much in effect, Mr. President, \nuntil about 1982, when after 1 year of the Reagan administration, the \nchange in policies took place.\n  Now, between 1979 and 1982, you have a significant decline, a very \nsignificant decline in family income during those years. Then from \n1982, I discover that you have a reversal of course, and I think we all \nrecall that there was a substantial increase for the next 8 years or so \nin family income. It starts back down again around 1989, 1990. And, as \nthe Senator noted, it has gone especially down in the last year or so. \nBut I think that to use this chart to reflect or create the illusion \nthat there has been a sort of straight-line decrease really does not \ncapture the essence of what happened during this timeframe when, in \nfact, there was a sharp decline during the first 3 years of this and a \nsignificant incline for all groups, all quintiles on the chart, for \nabout 8 years, and a decline over the last 3 years. So I am not sure \nthat the 14-year chart really reflects what happened in terms of policy \nor in terms of family income.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to yield the floor in \na while, but let me just say to my colleague, in the spirit of \ncollegiality, because I like debating my colleague from Michigan \nbecause he is so thoughtful, and the country would be a lot better off \nwith more thoughtful debate.\n  First, I did not actually talk about political parties. I did not \ntalk about President Reagan or President Bush. I did not talk about \npolitical parties. And for the families----\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I did not mean to suggest that. The chart has been \npresented under a number of circumstances.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am trying to say it is kind of an academic point for \nthe bottom 80 percent of the population, who really feel an economic \nsqueeze as to whether or not, for a while, it was a little better and \nthen much worse. The fact is that this is what has happened in the \nUnited States in the last few decades. And that's why the vast majority \nof people are under tremendous economic pressure.\n  The second point. There is an interesting correlation between what my \ncolleague from Michigan talked about and the debate we are now having \non the deficit, which is to say that my colleague is quite correct that \nwe actually had a very deep recession in 1982. Those were not good \nyears. And then we had a recovery, although it was a recovery supported \nby a politics and economics of illusion, because it was based on debt. \nThat, of course, was the proposition that we could slash the revenue \nbase, which we did with what was euphemistically called the Economic \nRecovery Act of 1981, and dramatically increase the Pentagon budget and \nother expenditures. And all of that would lead to high levels of \nproductivity, high levels of great jobs, middle-class jobs. And in \naddition, if we wanted to go back to the speeches given then, it would \nlead to reducing the deficit and eliminating the debt.\n  That was a politics of illusion. A politics that prompted an \nexplosion of the debt during that period from under a trillion, as I \nremember, when President Reagan took office, to where we are right now, \nwell over $4 trillion.\n  Mr. President, what we have seen happen is the worst of both worlds. \nOn the one hand, we have piled up record debt, and the interest on that \ndebt robs us of our capacity to invest in ourselves. And, on the other \nhand, we have not been able to invest in the economy and in education \nin such a way that we have an economy that produces the kinds of jobs \nthat people can count on, thus leading to a disappearing middle.\n  In that context, I say to my colleague--and I will yield for a \nquestion from the Senator from Illinois--it simply baffles me why \nSenators would want to eliminate a law that now provides wage earners \nin the construction industry--who are paid right around $25,000 or \n$30,000 a year, with assurance that they will get a decent wage.\n  Why are we now trying to depress people's wages? Why are we now \ntrying to repeal a piece of legislation that has been so important to \nworkplace fairness and fair wages? Why in the world are we trying to \npass a piece of legislation that will depress wages? We can have this \nacademic debate over and over again as to when it went up, down, or who \nis to blame. But that is the central question.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will say that I think it is an academic \ndebate, because the question about wage earners that we are talking \nabout--and we are going to encounter this question in the budget \ndebate--is which policies cause wages and family income to go up, and \nwhich policies cause them to go down.\n  I submit policies of high tax and high regulation tend to cause these \nwage earner family incomes to go down. The concern I have using charts \nlike these is that they do not necessarily reflect a consistent set of \npolicies.\n  During the period that is involved there, we had two very traumatic \nshifts. It began in an era with a policy of higher taxes and low \nregulation, and wages went down. It shifted to a policy of lower taxes \nand less regulation, and family incomes went up dramatically, then \nshifted one last time to policies of higher taxes and higher regulation \nagain, and they have begun to decline.\n  I think we need to examine this. My point today is to reflect the \nfact that there are changes within that timeframe that are reflected in \nchanged policies that I think do affect workers and make these \ninquiries more than academic.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, actually I think we interpret our \nhistory a little differently.\n  As a matter of fact, if we were to just take the period of the \n1980's, and we were to take the Reagan and Bush administrations, what \nwe saw--talking about real income going up--what we saw in this period, \nwhich the Senator views as such a heyday for wage earners, was a \nmassive redistribution of income up the wage scale, leaving low- and \nmoderate-income people behind.\n  This is what was called trickle down economics. It is simply not the \ncase, that middle-income and working families found themselves \nbenefiting from the decades of the 1980's. This was a decade of sharp \nincome inequality, a \n\n[[Page S8534]]\ndecade with a rise in poverty, a decade of fewer jobs people can count \non. We still feel the squeeze.\n  I cannot understand why in the world some of my colleagues now want \nto repeal a piece of legislation that at least makes sure that those \npeople who work get decent wages, and the wages are not depressed for \npeople in the communities.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I could just respond very briefly to my friend from \nMichigan.\n  First of all, I think we have to be very careful. We go through this \nlitany that higher taxes have caused depressed wages. Very interesting. \nAs late as 1986, the average American industrial wage per hour was the \nhighest in the world.\n  Today, 13 nations have higher average wages per manufacturing hour \nthan we do, and every one of them has higher taxes than we do. We have \nto be careful about these kinds of economic myths that are going on out \nthere.\n  Now, there are some reasons. Frankly, both political parties share \nsome guilt. One is the deficit. We just had the Concord Coalition \neconomic study that said if it were not for the deficit in the last two \ndecades, the average family income today would be $15,000 a year \nhigher.\n  The University of Michigan economics professor made a study and said \nthe average family income, if it were not for the deficit, would be 25 \npercent higher. I do not know whose figure is right, but they are huge \nfigures.\n  Both parties share the blame on this. The Reagan tax cut, as Howard \nBaker said, was a riverboat gamble. And it was a gamble that did not \npay off. It was tragic. Democrats voted for it. I was not one of them. \nBut Democrats voted for it, as well as Republicans.\n  The 1986 tax bill, I think, has turned out to be a disaster. I am \npleased to say I voted against that.\n  Both parties share guilt on this. Part of this has nothing to do with \neither political party. That is just the economic trend. We demand more \nand more skills. Part of the reason for those changes are the \nunskilled, their wages are going down; the skilled, their wages are \ngoing up.\n  That is the reason for Bob Reich's statement, ``If you are well \nprepared, technology is your friend; if you are not well prepared, \ntechnology is your enemy.''\n  There was, during the Reagan years, a Democratic Party, so both \nparties share blame. There was kind of euphoria because we were living \non a credit card. It is fun living on a credit card. We spent more \nmoney than we took in. It went very, very well.\n  Now, we have to face up to these things. That is why education, as \npart of that three-part program that Senator Wellstone is talking \nabout, is so important.\n  It all fits into this, because one of the trends in our country today \nis there is a shrinking middle class; not dramatic, but it is \nshrinking. There are few people moving up, and more people moving down.\n  If we repeal Davis-Bacon, that trend will accelerate. That is not \ngood for this country. What we need is to build the middle class. I \nintend to speak on that a little more later on.\n  I think again we have to examine these economic statistics. Both \nparties have plenty of blame to share. We ought to be working together \nto try to rectify this.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. I want to \nrespond to the Senator briefly, and will be pleased to yield to the \nSenator from Michigan for a question in a moment.\n  I wanted to say to my colleague from Illinois, what is puzzling about \nthis effort to repeal Davis-Bacon, is that we now have reached a point \nwhere our official measurement of unemployment is becoming almost \nmeaningless because it is so incomplete.\n  You go State after State, and you have a figure of, say, 3 or 4 \npercent unemployed. That does not say anything about what kinds of jobs \nand what kinds of wages. It does not measure those people who are \ndiscouraged workers. It does not measure those people who are \nunderemployed.\n  The key point, I think, is that what we find in many of our States \nwith an officially defined ``low level'' of unemployment is a \nshockingly high level of families, as much as 50 percent, have incomes \nof under $25,000 a year.\n  That is the squeeze people feel. Why in the world we would be trying \nto repeal a provision that tries to keep the prevailing wages in \ncommunities at a higher level as opposed to depressing wages is what \nconfuses me, and that is what I am so opposed to.\n  I am ready to yield the floor, but I will be pleased to yield for one \nmore question from the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief. I agree with the \ncomments of the Senator from Illinois with respect to the comments we \nall have made with respect to some of the budget problems that have \nhappened. I would assign them a little differently maybe. There was a \ntendency to see, as was implied earlier, that somehow by reducing taxes \nwe generated less revenue for Washington. I always like to remind the \nSenate, what we are talking about when we reduce taxes is letting \npeople keep a little more of what they earn. But I also point out that \nduring the 1980's, the percentage of gross domestic product that ended \nup being paid in taxes did not change. In fact, it remained as it has \nfor literally decades, right around the 19-percent level. What did \nchange, and where I think both parties have the responsibility in \nparticular, is in terms of our spending practices. Obviously, what we \ndid during that decade was spend more. We spent on everybody's \npriorities. We refused to say we have to set some priorities. So it did \ncreate the kind of increased deficits that were referred to.\n   I agree with the assessments that those deficits did hurt. I do not \nknow whether it is 19 or 25 percent. One of those figures was from the \nUniversity of Michigan, so I will tend to be more likely to agree with \nthe ones from my home State, but that clearly was a burden both \nparties, I think, were responsible for.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for just 30 seconds?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for more than 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think one of the reasons people resent \ntaxes so much is they do not see the results. Two nations spend a \ndisproportionately high percentage of their taxation on two things. \nThere is only one nation that spends more among the modern nations, and \nthat nation is Israel, on interest and on defense. No other nation come \nclose to us in this. These are things that do not directly benefit the \naverage person in Michigan, or the average person in Minnesota, or the \naverage person in Illinois or Rhode Island.\n  I think one of the reasons people are so disheartened about \ngovernment is they say: Next year we are going to spend $370 billion on \ninterest, 12 times as much on interest as on education, 22 times as \nmuch on interest as on foreign aid, twice as much on interest as on our \npoverty programs.\n  On defense we are going to spend $270 billion, more than the next \neight countries together.\n  We have to get ahold of our fiscal problems. We have to get ahold of \nour defense spending. Then I think people, if they see they are going \nto get out of their tax money education and health care and jobs and \nthings like that, I think they are going to be more willing to spend \nit.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will finish up, too. I just would \nlike to make two final points. I would like to say to the Senator from \nIllinois that I would add another reason as to why people have a fair \namount of healthy indignation about taxes. Part of it is they want to \nmake sure what they pay for works. But, if I could say this to my \ncolleague from Illinois, there is another reason why people have a \ntremendous amount of skepticism about taxes. That is, ordinary citizens \nhave a sneaking suspicion that they end up paying, but that there are a \nwhole lot of other people who do not pay their fair share. That is \ncalled tax fairness. I make it clear, as I look at these proposals to \nreduce the deficit, including the President's proposal, the President's \nproposal is less harsh but we can do much better when the \nreconciliation bill comes out. Corporate welfare, deductions and \nloopholes and tax giveaways for energy companies and pharmaceutical \ncompanies--these are folks who have enormous clout here. They ought to \nbe asked to tighten their belts too. I can tell you right now that has \n\n[[Page S8535]]\nnot so far been on the table in any real way in any of the proposals. I \nintend to make sure it is.\n  Second, I say to my colleague, he is absolutely right about some of \nthe large military contractors. It is one thing to have a strong \ndefense. It is another thing to be spending money on weaponry that is \nobsolete, wasteful, has nothing to do with a strong defense at all. Why \nin the world is that so sacred? It has a lot to do with who has power. \nWhy are the people we are asking to tighten their belts also the people \nwho have little economic or political clout? Why are we making the cuts \nin some of these areas but then leaving other areas untouched?\n  Finally, I say to my colleague, when it comes to Medicare and \nMedicaid, you cannot do it without health care reform. But I have not \nheard that yet. I would like to see the administration push harder on \nit. I will. You have to have universal coverage and systemwide cost \ncontainment. If that means you have to put a limit on insurance company \npremiums to cost of living times percentage of increase in population, \nyou would save huge amounts of money. It is much fairer. But when it \ncomes to those people and those interests we seem to not be willing to \nask them to be a part of this national sacrifice.\n  So, I do not disagree with my colleague about the importance of \ndeficit reduction and getting to the point where we balance the budget. \nBut I would like for it to be done on the basis of some standard of \nfairness, not based upon the path of least political resistance.\n  Which takes me back full circle to my remarks about Davis-Bacon. This \neffort to repeal Davis-Bacon, which is what this is all about, in a \nbill we all think is important, is an effort to do nothing less than to \ndepress the wages of middle-income and working families in America. It \nshould be defeated. It should be identified for what it is and it \nshould be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would point out to my colleagues, because \nI know Senator Warner is a chief architect of this, I have great \nrespect for Senator Warner. If I were to give an award of courage for \nthe last 2 years in the U.S. Senate to any single Senator, it would be \nan award of courage to Senator Warner for how he has conducted himself \nin a very difficult situation in the State of Virginia. I greatly \nrespect what he has done. He has handled himself with class.\n  But even the best of Senators can be wrong once in awhile. I believe \nSenator Warner has erred in moving to repeal Davis-Bacon, in terms of \nhighway construction. It is interesting that the National Alliance for \nFair Contracting has come up with highway construction costs in low-\nwage States versus high-wage States. Listen to this. Total costs per \nmile on highway construction--and I assume this is State and interstate \nhighways rather than local roads--total cost per mile in the low-wage \nStates, $1,141,000. Total costs of highway construction per mile in \nhigh-wage States, $1,017,000 per mile.\n  The reason, in part anyway--and I have not looked at these statistics \nin detail. I do not know how they were arrived at. But one of the \nthings that every study shows is that if you pay people well they are \nmore productive workers. Davis-Bacon does not only apply to union \nworkers, but the Harvard studies and others also show that union \nworkers are more likely to be satisfied and more likely to be highly \nproductive.\n  My hope is that we would not repeal Davis-Bacon. I think the reality \nis that if you repeal Davis-Bacon you do depress the wages of people \nwho are struggling, people who are in the middle class or people who \nare trying to move up to the middle class.\n  When you see somebody out holding a flag because there is highway \nconstruction, that man or woman is not paid an awful lot of money; paid \nreally probably above the minimum wage but not a great deal above the \nminimum wage. To depress that person's wage, which is what we would do \nif we pass this bill, I do not think is a direction the American people \nwant us to go. We ought to be talking about lifting the wages of \npeople. We ought to be talking about raising the minimum wage, not \ndepressing wages. Yet, that is what we are really asked to do in the \nlegislation that is before us.\n  Does Davis-Bacon need to be modified? There is no question that it \nshould be modified. I had an amendment that Senator Kennedy was a \ncosponsor of in the Labor and Human Resources Committee which applied \nto Davis-Bacon across the board, not simply to highway construction, \nwhich Senator Warner says is about 38 percent of the application of \nDavis-Bacon. It would raise the threshold for coverage from $2,000 to \n$100,000. It would raise the threshold for repair work or alteration \ncompared to new construction to $50,000. The current act, which is \nsometimes called the Copeland Act, is an--incidentally, Congressman \nBacon, who was a cosponsor of Davis-Bacon, was a Republican Member of \nthe House--but the Copeland Act currently requires weekly submission of \npayroll by contractors. We change that. So we reduce paperwork. And on \ncontracts between $50,000 and $100,000 they would not be required to \nsubmit payrolls at all, simply a statement that they are complying with \nthe law. And for the contracts over $100,000, instead of submitting a \nweekly payroll, they could submit a monthly payroll.\n  I think those kinds of changes are the changes that we need. I think \nthey make sense. I hear reports that Senator Hatfield may be coming up \nwith a modification, something like the one that I offered in \ncommittee, and I hope that he does. I hope that somehow we move to a \nmore sensible answer than simply repealing the Davis-Bacon legislation. \nAgain, I see nothing to be gained for the country in highway \nconstruction costs, and in terms of what we are doing for our country \nto lift our people by repealing Davis-Bacon.\n  When people say, ``Well, if you pay less, should not we have to pay \nless for highways?'' The answer comes in productivity or it comes in \nprofits. It is interesting to me. I was contacted as I walked into this \nbody today by someone speaking in behalf of highway contractors who did \nnot want to have Davis-Bacon repealed. I am not saying that he speaks \nin behalf of all highway contractors. But I was surprised to have \nsomeone contact me in behalf of highway contractors.\n  Labor costs per mile, according to the study in low-wage States, \n$216,000; labor costs per mile in high-wage States--my colleagues from \nMichigan and Rhode Island will be interested in this--in high-wage \nStates costs per mile of labor costs are $241,000. Let me just repeat \nthat because I know my colleagues from Michigan and Rhode Island would \nbe persuaded by what I have to say on this now. The study shows in low-\nwage States the labor costs per mile are $216,000, in high-wage States \nthe labor costs per mile are $241,000, and yet the total cost per mile, \nwages, everything--$1.141 million in a low-wage State, $1.17 million in \na high-wage State.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair)\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me also digress for just a moment to \nsay to the Presiding Officer, and to the Senator from Michigan, the \nonly good thing about the Republicans taking over the Senate is \nRepublicans have to preside and Democrats do not have to preside \nanymore. So I welcome the Republicans presiding up there.\n  But again, I say to my friends from Rhode Island, Arizona, and \nMichigan, and elsewhere, the evidence is just overwhelming that all we \nare going to do is depress wages. We are not going to reduce costs in \nhighway construction if we repeal Davis-Bacon. The statistics show \nthat.\n  I do not know why we should want to pass legislation that depresses \nwages for people in this country. You are talking about frequently very \nlow-wage wages at the present time. Senator Kennedy had a chart \nyesterday showing Davis-Bacon wages for carpenters in Tennessee, $6 an \nhour. That is not high wages. Some of you spend that much per hour for \na babysitter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator from Illinois would like to \nengage in a discussion on this point?\n  Mr. SIMON. I would be pleased to. I am sure at the end of the \ndiscussion the Senator from Rhode Island will agree that we should not \nrepeal Davis-Bacon.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is a leap that I am not quite prepared to agree to. \n  \n[[Page S8536]]\n\n  Let me just say this: We have a philosophic difference here. The \nphilosophic difference is as follows: The Republicans are saying let \ncompetition work, let the marketplace take effect just like it is in 85 \npercent of construction. What the Democrats are saying is no, no, no--\nthat we are going to give a special privilege, a fixed wage, as it \nwere, to those who are working on Government jobs; namely, in this \ncase, highway construction. What they are saying is that these wages \nare not going to be fixed by the free market or by what the employer \nwishes to pay or what the workers are prepared to accept. They are \ngoing to be guided solely by what is known as the prevailing wage. We \nall know that the prevailing wage is the union wage. That is a fact. I \nthink you have great difficulty showing many sections of the country \nwhere the so-called prevailing wage under Davis-Bacon is not the union \nwage.\n  So what the Democrats are saying is this is the way we want to do \nbusiness. We want to say that only those companies that have had a \nhistory of paying the union wage, that are big enough to handle all the \ncomplexities involved with the recordkeeping, with the forms, with the \ncompliance with Davis-Bacon, will be able to bid on these jobs. The \nlittle fellow who is out there and has done well, in let us, say home \nconstruction or in sidewalk paving, or driveway paving, he cannot bid \non a paving job for the U.S. Government or for the Highway \nAdministration or for the State highways where there is Federal money \ncontributed. He is out. That is a fact.\n  Davis-Bacon is a protective device for two things: For union wages, \nand union employees, union members, and for the big construction \ncompanies. It is no surprise that the Senator from Illinois is quoting \nsome construction company saying we want to keep Davis-Bacon. Of course \nthey do. And it is probably one of the biggest construction companies \nbecause they can keep everybody else out. The little fellow who comes \nin at a lower price, at a better bid, he is out.\n  To me that is a very, very strange way of doing business. It is \nsaying that competition is not going to prevail. That is really what \nDavis-Bacon says. You cannot have competition except under these \nlimited rules where you are going to pay the prevailing wage.\n  I listened carefully to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nyesterday who had a very vigorous speech. As a matter of fact, all \nspeeches the Senator from Massachusetts gives are vigorous speeches, \nwith the volume turned up on occasion.\n  His point is that you are going to drive everybody else into the \npoorhouse. They are depressing wages, this wicked business of \ncompetition. That is like saying all the companies, the workers that \nwork on the 85 percent of the other construction in the United States \nnot covered by Davis-Bacon. What are we talking about? We are talking \nabout building a building, building a warehouse, building housing, \nbuilding apartment houses. That is not covered by Davis-Bacon unless \nthe Government in some fashion has contributed, as the Senator knows. \nThat is the rules that guide when Davis-Bacon applies.\n  The idea is that everybody that is doing construction in these other \nnongovernment jobs is just in rags, has been beaten down by the \ncompetitive system. That is nonsense. We all know that is nonsense. \nThose who are good, if you are a good worker and have the skills and \ncan produce, you get the job and you get the pay. And to say that \neverybody is working at a minimum wage, a carpenter or a latheman, an \nelectrician, a plumber, whatever it is, is working at some scroungy \nminimum wage because he does not have Davis-Bacon to protect him is \ntotal nonsense. I am sorry that the suggestion has been made. We can \nargue whether we want to have the Government getting into setting these \nwages, as in effect we are doing. That is fine. But to suggest that \neverybody is poverty stricken if Davis-Bacon should be eliminated is \njust not so.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I may reclaim my time and respond to my friend from \nRhode Island, who on most things is very rational and reasonable, he \nhas strayed on this one. I remember way back when taking a course in \nlogic at Dana College, a small liberal arts college in Nebraska, and \none of the things you set up is a series. There is an animal that has \nfour legs. A horse has four legs; therefore, that animal is a horse. \nWell, it turns out that animal is a cat and not a horse, but you start \noff with some premises that are not accurate.\n  Do we want to have the free system? Yes, we want the free system. On \nthat I agree with him. When he says the prevailing wage is the union \nwage, then the Senator from Rhode Island is off base. Only 11.8 percent \nof the nongovernmental employees in this Nation are union workers. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is here and I am sure will bear me out on \nthis. Of the wages that are considered for prevailing wages, only--and \nif I may have the attention of my colleague from Rhode Island--of the \nwages that are considered for determining prevailing wages, only 29 \npercent are union workers. Of the rest, 48 percent are nonunion and \nthen some mixed situations.\n  What Davis-Bacon says is go in and find out what the average wage is \nin Jones County, RI, or whatever the county is in Illinois or Arizona \nand do not let the Federal Government be the source for depressing \nwages for the workers of our country.\n  I think that is sound. That is what Davis-Bacon is all about. And \nthen let businesses that pay the prevailing wage compete. Let the free \nmarket system work. Do not let it work by depressing people who are \nreally struggling for a living.\n  I hope we will do the sensible thing and not repeal Davis-Bacon.\n  I see the presence of the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and I \nyield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues and \nfriends who spoke earlier today about the issue that is before the \nSenate. It is described as a repealing of the Davis-Bacon Act but only \nin regard to the highway system.\n  It has been pointed out that represents 40 percent of all the Davis-\nBacon protection. So it will have a very substantial impact on the \nconstruction workers of this country, depending upon what will be the \nwill of the Senate on this particular issue.\n  As we have heard, even in the early parts of the debate by our good \nfriend from Virginia, what he is basically talking about is taking \napproximately a billion dollars and getting more construction out of \nthat billion dollars. Translated: That is taking more than a billion \ndollars during the life of this program out of the pockets of the men \nand women who work in the construction industry--that is basically what \nis being talked about here--depressing the wages of workers in the \nconstruction industry.\n  Yesterday, I took a few moments to point out what those workers were \nearning across the country. We are talking about men and women in the \nconstruction trade who are earning $26,000, $27,000 a year. Mr. \nPresident, $26,000 or $27,000 a year is hardly enough to pay a mortgage \nand put bread on the table and provide for the education and clothing \nof their kids and look to the future, plus being in an industry which \nis the second most dangerous industry, outside of the mining industry, \nin this country.\n  I reviewed what the workers were getting in different parts of the \ncountry, and we saw in those charts across the country, whether they \nwere in heavy industry or in the residential area, what individuals \nwere making. Some made $9,000, $10,000, $15,000 a year, going up even \ninto the larger figures of up to $42,000 a year.\n  We saw that what we are talking about is their income and the assault \non their income. That is basically what is the issue here. I have \nlistened to the argument made that we are trying to jimmy the whole \ndebate process on this thing in favor of denying competition. What we \nare saying is let us rule out the question of a competition to drive \nwages down when we are investing Federal taxpayers' money. That is what \nDavis-Bacon does.\n  If the companies and corporations are able to compete, showing better \nmanagement, better skills, better administration, they can do it and \nwin the contracts, but we are saying here that we are not going to \npermit driving wages down. We want the taxpayers, the middle-income \nfamilies, to benefit from the opportunity to have real competition, not \non driving wages down in \n\n[[Page S8537]]\nthis country at this time, but having competition on the other \nmeasures. That is what this debate is really all about.\n  I went through some figures yesterday about construction income. If \nyou are a carpenter in Tennessee, you are talking about $9,000 a year \nunder Davis-Bacon. If you are a carpenter in Providence, RI, it is \n$23,000. Mr. President, $23,000 does not go a long way up in New \nEngland when you are paying for home heating oil, paying the mortgage, \nand putting food on the table. It does not go a very long way, and if \nyou repeal Davis-Bacon, you are putting at risk even this income.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield to the Senator, but I want to be \nable to make the case with regard to Davis-Bacon and some other \ncomments about the context of this whole debate. I plan to be here for \nsome time, and I will be more than glad to respond to questions on the \nvarious studies that we have had and some of those that we are going to \nget into.\n  In my State, carpenters working on residential construction make \n$28,000 a year; in Rhode Island, it is $23,000. It is hard to make ends \nmeet if you are working 1,500 hours a year. That happens to be the \nfact.\n  Let me just go back and tell you what will happen if this amendment \nstrikes Davis-Bacon--to give a little example. We are fortunate in this \npublic policy issue to have seen what happens in States where they have \nrepealed Davis-Bacon. So often we debate these issues and we do not \nreally have good information. We have what we think, what I think, what \nthose on the other side might think, or whatever individual Members \nthink. We have some studies. But very interestingly, on the repeal of \nDavis-Bacon, we have some very important information that is directly \nrelated to what happens in terms of wages and in terms of the impact of \nthe repeal of Davis-Bacon, and that is a study that was done in the \nState of Utah.\n  In February 1995, four researchers at the University of Utah--this is \nout in Utah. We are not talking about some college or university in \nsome other part of the country, we are talking about a University of \nUtah study of the economic and social consequences that actually \nresulted when nine States that had prevailing wages repealed them. That \nis the issue here.\n  Under the proposal of the Senator from Rhode Island, he would \neffectively repeal Davis-Bacon on construction.\n  Now we have the example of what happened to nine States, according to \nthe University of Utah. Unlike the CBO reports, or anyone's theoretical \nspeculation about the benefits of repeal, the Utah study provides real \nworld evidence about what happens when contractors are allowed to pay \nless than the prevailing wage. The nine States are: Utah, Arizona, \nKansas, Idaho, New Hampshire, Alabama, Colorado, Florida, and \nLouisiana, which repealed their Davis-Bacon laws between 1979 and 1988.\n  The research should convince any Senator that repeal is not in the \nbest interest of construction workers, the industry, or the Government.\n  First of all, repeal led to lower wages for all construction workers. \nThe average earnings for construction workers in the nine repeal States \nfell from $24,000 before the repeals to $22,000 after.\n  That should not be very difficult for people to figure out. This \nproposal in the highway bill is to drive down those wages of working \nmen and women. I do not know what it is about our Republican friends \nover there, or what they have against working families, but they are \nright out there now trying to say to those that are working 1,500 hours \na year in the second most dangerous industry that we are going to drive \nyour wages down $2,000 more. We ought to be debating how we are going \nto raise the minimum wage. We ought to be trying to honor work, saying \nwork pays, and encouraging people.\n  Now, this is what happened in these States. In the nine repeal \nStates, their incomes went from $24,000 before to $22,000 afterward. \nThe analysis shows that because of the repeal in those States, the \nwages amounted to $1,477 less per worker every year since the State \nrepeal. This is the obvious and expected result of allowing contractors \nto pay less than the prevailing wage. So that is what the result was. \nThat should not be any surprise. You have those supporting the repeal, \nwho have indicated they are going to take that money and use it in \nconstruction at the cost of income for working families that are making \n$27,000. We are not talking about the $100,000, $150,000 or about the \nmillion dollars workers that are skimming on that; we are talking about \nworking men and women earning in the range of $24,000.\n  Now, this is the second one. Slightly increased construction \nemployment. In the repeal States, a 1.7-percent increase in \nconstruction employment that would not have occurred if not for the \nrepeal. But construction employees as a whole were harmed because their \noverall wages fell by 5 percent--much more than their employment \nincreased.\n  Third, as wages dropped, so did State revenues. That is interesting. \nWe have not heard much talk about what the impact is going to be in \nterms of the revenues, in terms of, in this instance, the Federal \nGovernment. We have not had that economic analysis. And we understand \nwhy. That is because the Environment and Public Works Committee does \nnot deal with this issue. They are just picking up some cliches, bumper \nsticker solutions. We all know what Davis-Bacon is about, and we have \ndebated that. We are just going to repeal. We hear that all of the \ntime. Well, I hope they are able to tell us with this repeal what the \nimpact is going to be in terms of the economy. As the wages drop, so do \nState revenues. Utah lost $3 to $5 million in sales tax and income tax \nrevenues.\n  Fourth, repeal led to an increase in construction cost overruns. In \nUtah, cost overruns on the construction of State roads tripled after \nthe repeal. Very interesting. The cost overruns escalated dramatically \nafter contracts were awarded without the Davis-Bacon protections, \nbecause contractors bid low and got the job and then had to be bailed \nout. The amount of cost overruns tripled in the 10 years after repeal \ncompared with the 10 years before.\n  Fifth, repeal led to a less skilled labor force. Union and nonunion \napprenticeship rates fell 40 percent, whereas States that did not \nrepeal the prevailing rate did not lose ground. The best apprenticeship \nprograms that we have in this country are in the construction industry, \nwhich are a reflection of those in the construction industry working \ntogether in the development of these skills. They are the best that we \nhave in this country. And what happens is when these individuals go \nthrough these training programs and work, their results in terms of \nperformance are better. That is pretty logical. One of the attendant \nresults of cutting back on Davis-Bacon is the significant reduction in \nparticipation in apprenticeship programs.\n  So we have the cost overruns, we have a less skilled work force, and \nsixth, we found out that minorities were hurt disproportionately. Their \nshare of apprenticeships fell from 20 percent to 12 percent of \napprenticeships in the repeal States. Minority opportunities to learn \nnew skills and advance in the trades were doubly restricted. The \napprenticeship pie got smaller, and their piece of the pie got smaller.\n  I am waiting for the argument that says if you repeal Davis-Bacon, it \nis going to offer new opportunities for minorities and women. Maybe we \nwill have that argument later in the day. But it is not so. That is why \nnone of the groups representing minorities and women support repeal. \nAll they have to do is look at what happened in the various States.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Rhode Island leaving. I wanted to \ntalk for a few moments, and I will be glad to yield. I do not want to \nbe disrespectful.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be here with the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I wanted to just review this study \nand then get back into this. We have found now that the minorities were \nhurt disproportionately.\n  Seven. The injury rates rose. Construction work, which was already \ndangerous, became considerably more dangerous after repeal. Injury \nrates rose 15 percent, even after controlling for national trends in \nconstruction safety, and other factors, such as unemployment. So there \nis no good reason to believe that these grim consequences would not be \nreplicated on a bigger \n\n[[Page S8538]]\nscale if the Federal Davis-Bacon Act were repealed.\n  In terms of injury rates, for example, a 15-percent nationwide \nincrease would mean 30,000 more serious injuries a year, more than \n670,000 additional lost work days, and direct workers' compensation \ncosts of $300 million, which would be passed on to the Federal \nGovernment in increased construction costs.\n  Collectively, for all construction workers, the research estimates a \nloss of almost $5 billion a year in construction earnings, which would \nresult in a loss to the Federal Government of roughly $1 billion a year \nin income taxes. Clearly, these losses dwarf any benefits the \nGovernment might derive from cutting wages on workers on Federal \nconstruction projects, based on a repeal of Davis-Bacon.\n  So, Mr. President, this is what we are faced with. As I just \nmentioned, we not only have the studies, we have the results of what \nhappened in States where they repealed their State Davis-Bacon. What we \nfound is a significant reduction in workers' salaries, about $2,000, \nfrom $24,000 down to $22,000.\n  If you are interested in depressing the wages of hard-working men and \nwomen in the construction trade, your vote is to repeal Davis-Bacon. If \nthat is what you want to do--say to American workers in the \nconstruction area, men and women averaging $27,000 a year, you are \ndoing too well in America, even though your real purchasing power has \ndeclined over the period of the last 10 years, even though you are \nworking harder, that $27,000 is too much for someone who wants to work \nin the second most dangerous industry, we are going to take back $1,500 \nor $2,000 from you--then go ahead and support the Republican position.\n  If you want to say that the lost revenues the Federal Government is \ngoing to see--and the best estimate from the Utah study is lost \nrevenues of a billion a year--are not much and that our economy is in \nsuch good shape that we can say we are going to deny that billion \ndollars, we do not need that billion dollars either in the deficit, or \nto try and invest in the education of the sons and daughters or the \nchildren or the parents.\n\n  Just go ahead and support that program right over there that repeals \nDavis-Bacon. If anyone is not concerned about the increase in the \ninjury rate that the Utah study has pointed out, the 15 percent, if \nanyone is not concerned about it and you think you have the right \nposition, repeal Davis-Bacon, and the case goes on, Mr. President.\n  I think, quite frankly, those that just believe that this is a nice \nlittle way, somehow, to try to find a magical $1 billion out there and \nwill somehow mean the taxpayers will be better protected, better be \nable to consider the realities we have seen.\n  I think when they do, they will realize that this particular measure \nto repeal Davis-Bacon will have a terrible impact on these families. It \nis basically wrong.\n  What I want to point out, Mr. President, now, is just where these \nworking families are, what we have seen in the States that have \nrepealed the Davis-Bacon Act. In those nine States, we have seen \ndecline in real income for those working families. And we have seen in \nthe charts brought out here earlier what has been happening to the \nworking families over the period of these past years.\n  My good friends from Wisconsin and from Illinois pointed out what has \nhappened from 1950 to 1970. What we found out from 1950 to 1970, when \nthe Nation was growing and expanding, from 1950 to 1978, when we were \ngoing up and growing together, we were all growing together. The bottom \n20 percent was growing; the second 20 percent, almost 100 percent; the \nmiddle 20 percent was growing; the fourth and the top was growing. All \ngroups were growing just about together, and the bottom group was \ngrowing the most.\n  That is what was happening from 1950 to 1978. We heard our good \nfriend from Michigan talking about sometimes we had good growth policy \nand not good growth policy. Therefore, we ought to be more particular.\n  He was pointing out that what was happening in 1980 was not really so \ngood to look at because we were still coming out of the Carter high-\ninterest rates and increasing unemployment. I am familiar with that \nperiod because I differed with the economic policies at that time, as \nwell.\n  If we look now, and I am sorry my friend from Michigan is not here, \nbut if we look now to what has happened from 1983 to 1989, now we have \nthe new federalism. We have not heard much recently about the new \nfederalism. Remember, in the 1980's, we were hearing about federalism, \ntax cuts, budget cuts, increased military spending. That was the new \nfederalism.\n  We have the same economic program now, but the new federalism has \nsomehow disappeared. I do not know why we are not using those words. I \nthink basically the reason they are not using those words is it sends a \nmessage to middle-income families of what has happened to them over the \nperiod of these last years.\n  Taking 1983 to 1989, that will be more in tune with what happened \nduring the Reagan and Bush period. This is what happened. Remember the \nother figures I just discussed? We were all growing together. And now \ntake the top 1 percent; their wealth is 61 percent. The next 19 percent \nis 37 percent. The bottom 80 percent is 1.2 percent.\n  Remember the other chart had virtually the same, a little disparity, \nand the greatest growth was taking place at the end. In 1979 to 1992, \nwho got the growth? This chart shows shares of average household income \ngrowth, the Bureau of Census figures.\n  Here we see the top 25. And we can take the red line, adding it, to \nequal 100 percent. We do not have to have charts like this. Talk to any \nfamily, talk to any worker in this country, and they will say the same \nthing. They will say the only way family incomes stayed competitive is \nthat women entered the work force during the period of the 1980's, and \nthey were just able to hold on to their family income. Although the \nreal wages were going down, they were working harder, and they were \njust able to stay above the waterline. Without that additional kind of \nwork, we have seen what has happened. Family incomes took a beating. \nNow we are asked out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate to accelerate \nthat, repeal Davis-Bacon and drive those working families down even \nfurther in their wealth.\n  That is what they are asking us to do. The proponents of repeal say \ntake that $1 billion out of the pockets of working people and put it \ninto construction. Said another way, that is, take the $1,500 to $2,000 \nout of the pockets of these working families here in construction, and \nput it over somewhere into the distribution of the higher income \nbrackets. That is what is happening.\n  Now, Mr. President, this is what is happening on this particular \nmeasure on Davis-Bacon. If we juxtapose this position, because we are \ntalking about what is happening to working families --that is what this \nissue is really all about, what is happening to working families in \nthis country--we have made the case. We are opposed.\n  We have competition. We ought to have the competition. It ought to be \nbased upon management skills, efficiency, ability to buy cheaper \nmaterials, the ways of being able to do business. But not as a result \nof depressing workers' wages. That is the basic tenet of Davis-Bacon.\n  Just to restate what the obvious was in the other charts, I wish we \nwere out here debating the increase in the minimum wage. That is what \nwe ought to be doing. That is what working families are really \nconcerned about: Making work pay.\n  It used to be that the minimum wage was adjusted periodically, in the \n1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, under Republican as well as Democratic \nadministrations. President Reagan increased the minimum wage on two \ndifferent occasions. George Bush increased it in 1989. Why? Why?\n  They said, ``Because anyone who works in the United States 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, ought to have sufficient income to not be in \npoverty, to put enough food on the table, pay their mortgage, and raise \ntheir children.''\n  That has been true since the 1930's, until now, Mr. President. Until \nnow. Until now, when we find out what has been happening in terms of \nthe minimum wage and its impact on taking families out of poverty.\n  Go back--and this is, again, a response to some of the points raised \nby \n\n[[Page S8539]]\nmy good friend from Wisconsin--and look at the particular year. This is \nthe percent of the poverty line, what a person has to get up to in \norder to be free of poverty. This is for the minimum wage for American \nworkers. We are almost up there during the 1960's and 1970's, and even \n1980's. And here it is. President Bush signed the increase to bring it \nback up, and it went right back down again. This is what is happening \nfor men and women who are working in our economy, trying to make ends \nmeet.\n  For those that advocate the repeal of Davis-Bacon, at least they \nwould have much more credibility, much more credibility, if they said, \n``Look, this is really a construction issue. We are happy to be for \nworking families. We are for the increase in the minimum wage.'' I \ndaresay, you will not find five votes difference between those who want \nto repeal the minimum wage and those who want to repeal Davis-Bacon. It \nis the same group, virtually, the same Senators who want to drive \nconstruction workers down and refuse to give working families any \nincrease in the minimum wage, although Republicans and Democrats over a \nlong period of time have been willing to do it.\n  Why do they not say, ``Look, Senator, you are wrong on the \nconstruction law. It is too bureaucratic, too much paperwork. I am for \nthe minimum wage increase, and I want workers to get it, but this is \nnot appropriate in terms of the construction industry.'' There is \nsilence on it.\n  The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said that only \nover their dead bodies would we increase the minimum wage. They are \ngoing to have an opportunity to lie down in front of that train, \nbecause we are going to make sure that this body will vote on it. We \nare going to make sure you will vote on it and vote on it and vote on \nit.\n  Men and women back in your home States are going to know whether you \nreally honor work, whether you think work pays, or whether you are \nturning your back on working families. That is what has been happening \non the minimum wage.\n  I am always told--``We cannot do the increase in the minimum wage, \nSenator Kennedy''--and am always given a variety of reasons why. But \nlet us look at the facts. I am not going to review the New Jersey \nstudies today that show that the last time we had an increase in the \nminimum wage, the State of New Jersey had an increase in employment. \nBut I will just take a moment of the Senate's time to show what has \nhappened the last seven times we have seen an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  In 1949 we went from 40 cents an hour to 75 cents, the change in the \ninflation rate reached a high of 1 percent. In 1955, the rate was \nincreased from 75 cents to a dollar, and inflation reached a high of \n3.6 percent.\n  From 1961 to 1963, the minimum wage was increased from $1 to $1.25, \nand inflation increased only 0.3 percent; not 3 percent, but only 0.3 \npercent. In 1967 and 1968, the minimum wage was increased from $1.25 to \n$1.60, and inflation remained stable, and did not increase at all.\n  From 1974 to 1976, the minimum wage was increased from $1.60 to \n$2.30, and inflation rate actually decreased--decreased--from 11 \npercent to 6.5 percent. From 1978 through 1981, the minimum wage \nincreased from $2.30 to $3.35, and inflation actually increased and \ndecreased intermittently. Then, from 1990 to 1991, the minimum wage \nincreased from $3.35 to $4.25, and inflation decreased from 5.4 to 4.2 \npercent.\n  In effect, increases in the minimum wage had virtually no impact on \nthe rate of inflation.\n  Let us look at the economy and the impact of an increase in the \nminimum wage on unemployment. If you look at the facts, you cannot make \nthe case that an increase in the minimum wage has had an adverse effect \non employment. You find that it has not had that impact.\n  Let us look back at the increases in the minimum wage since 1949. The \nfirst time the minimum wage was increased, unemployment decreased from \n5.9 to 5.3 percent. Unemployment actually went down.\n  In 1955, the minimum wage was increased from 75 cents to a dollar, \nand unemployment decreased again from 4.4 to 4.1 percent. Again, \nunemployment went down.\n  From 1961 to 1963, when the minimum wage went from $1.00 to $1.25, \nunemployment decreased from 6.7 to 5.5 percent.\n  These facts show that there has been virtually no impact on either \ninflation or unemployment. And nonetheless, we have this blind \nopposition from the other side to any increase in the minimum wage.\n  So, what you are saying out here, Senators, is not just, ``Oh, this \nis a little highway bill. We have to get it by the fall.'' What you are \ndoing is a continuing, ongoing assault on the middle-income families of \nAmerica. We have seen the massive switch in terms of income and wealth \nin this country, from the stability from the 1950's to the early 1970's \nto the enormous dichotomy in the 1980's and 1990's where wealth for the \nwealthiest individuals has gone up, and 80 percent of these workers, \nconstruction workers, are being asked to sacrifice at least $1,500 a \nyear. And at the same time when the Republicans say absolutely no to \nany kind of increase in the minimum wage.\n  President Clinton's proposal on the minimum wage increase, if it \npassed today to bring it to $5.15 would just bring it right back up \nhere where President Bush was. But the answer is, ``No. No, we are not \ngoing to do that. No, we cannot afford in this country to do it. No, it \nis going to cause unemployment and inflation''--in spite of the facts \nand the history that show it is not.\n  So you cannot get away from this question: What is it we are talking \nabout here this afternoon and what will we be voting on on Monday? It \nis real income. It is really an attack, an assault on working families \nfor the privileged, taking the savings of the various cuts and giving \nthem to the wealthiest individuals. It is perpetuating that. That is \nwhat is happening around here. That is what is at risk at this place.\n  Who are these families we are talking about here, who are going to be \nadversely impacted? What is going to be the impact on them? First of \nall, not only do we have, as I mentioned, the assault on the workers \nthemselves, which means you have the assault on all those in \nconstruction and the denial of income to the 12 million who would be \nbumped up if they had some increase in the minimum wage. But what else \nis happening? What else is happening? We are saying to those \nconstruction workers: You care about your parents? You love your \nparents? They had some good Medicare, they had some degree of \nsecurity--we are going to cut their Medicare programs by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the period of the next 7 years. We will raise \nthe out-of-pocket expenses, if the cuts the Republicans have suggested \nwere evenly divided between beneficiaries and providers, $6,400 in the \noutyears. In the 7th year it is $6,400.\n  So, not only are we squeezing you on the Davis-Bacon, not only are we \nsqueezing you by refusing to give you any increase in the minimum wage, \nbut you better start putting some more of those scarce resources away \nbecause you are going to have to pay more out of your pocket to make \nsure that your parents, who are under Medicare, are going to be able to \nlive.\n  And what about their children? What about the children of those \nworking families, those construction workers? If they go to the fine \nschools and colleges up in Rhode Island, of Senator Chafee, or our \nother good friends from Virginia or Vermont or Massachusetts, what you \nare saying is if you are going to be able to qualify for any of those \nStafford loans, you are going to have to pay a third more, a third more \nof indebtedness because of the cuts in terms of the education programs. \nOver the 7-year period, those families will lose more than $1.2 billion \njust from my State of Massachusetts for those scholarships. For the \nStafford loans over the 7 years under the Republican budget that passed \nthrough here--$1.2 billion will be taken out of the pockets of the sons \nand daughters of working Americans--to go where? To continue their \neducation; indebtedness of government transferred onto the indebtedness \nof those children. That will lead to a reduction in terms of the \ncollege opportunities for these kids.\n  And who benefits from all this? You are cutting back on the wages of \nworking families, you are denying an increase in the minimum wage, you \nare \n\n[[Page S8540]]\nsaying their parents are going to have to pay more for Medicare, you \nare saying if their children are going to school, they are going to pay \nmore out of pocket.\n  Then look at the bottom line, at what happens next. The $350 billion \nthat you get in savings goes to the wealthiest individuals of this \ncountry.\n  Let us not kid ourselves, that is what this whole debate is \neffectively about. It is coming in baloney slices but this is the end \nresult of it. You are doing all this for the tax cuts that have just \nbeen reiterated by the Republicans in the House of Representatives this \npast week when they reaffirmed their commitment--because they evidently \nwere getting somewhat jittery about where the Senate Republicans were \ngoing to be on it--they reiterated the $350 billion tax cut for the \nwealthiest individuals.\n  So that is all a part of this. And I have not even mentioned the cuts \nthat were proposed in terms of the day care proposals and the support \nfor working mothers. They will be lucky if they are able to find day \ncare for $6,000 a year in my State of Massachusetts--very lucky. You \ntake the percent of income that working mothers pay for day care and \nyou wonder why they are not out there on the job rolls instead of on \nthe welfare rolls. We are talking about increasing the minimum wage to \ntry to get people off welfare, make work pay, and it is extraordinary \nto me, extraordinary to me for the millions of Americans who would make \nmore by being on welfare--millions of Americans make more by being on \nwelfare; they get the health care in terms of the Medicaid, some of \nthem even get limited amounts of day care help, they get other kinds of \nhelp and assistance in terms of fuel assistance and other kinds of \nbenefits.\n  If you give an increase in the minimum wage, do you know what is \ngoing to happen? Those people are going to have more resources, make \nmore money, and they will not be eligible for these Federal programs \nand we will get savings at the Federal level because we will be paying \npeople a livable wage.\n  I would think those people who want to diminish Government programs \nwould say, Why should the Federal Government continue to subsidize the \nworkers for companies and corporations? Because that is what you are \ndoing. You are paying them a lower minimum wage, and then they are \neligible for the safety net. Who pays for the safety net? The workers \ndo. The employer does not. It is a subsidy for them. We talk a great \ndeal about how we are going to make our American people understand the \nimportance of work, and then we deny them the very wherewithal to make \nwork pay. That is part of this whole point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield in just 2 more minutes.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I hear in this debate that we have to try to \nget our house in order, too. Part of our proposal is to make sure that \nwhatever we pass here in the Congress is going to be applicable to \npeople across this country and also apply to us. I believe that it \nshould. I support those programs. We passed them this year. Congress \ncould have passed them last year. I believe so. You remember all those \nspeeches. I even heard some yesterday in our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee on a different subject saying: Whatever we do, we want to \nmake sure that, if it is going to happen outside the Senate and \nCongress, it ought to be applied to us. I say amen to it.\n  But how interesting it is for those new Members who come to the U.S. \nSenate and sign that little blue sheet that gives them the Federal \nemployees' health insurance program, which is the best health insurance \nprogram in the country; effectively, 11 million Federal employees have \nit, and every one of us has it. The most recent information I have is \nthat there is not a Member of the U.S. Senate who has rejected it.\n  Where are all those voices that say, ``Look, we have it. Why not make \nit applicable to the American people? We have it.'' Is there not a flip \nside to the coin of all those speeches that we had to listen to day \nafter day after day and which we agreed on--it passed overwhelmingly--\nwhich said we are going to make the laws which apply outside applicable \nto the inside? Amen. But how silent they are now. We have it for all \nthose new Members, let alone older Members that get that Federal \nemployees' health insurance, the premium of which is $101 for me with \nthe Federal Government picking up the rest per month, and it gives me \nthe best in terms of health care.\n  How silent we are in this debate about making that available to these \nworking families that are having a tough enough time, who see the \ndepletion of the value of their dollar. They are working harder and are \npaying more and more out for health care. We are shortchanging the \nchildren in terms of education. We are shortchanging the parents in the \ncuts in Medicare. We are denying them a decent kind of income, \ndepressing those wages, refusing to increase it, and they are paying \nmore and more out of their pockets for health care while we in the U.S. \nSenate have just made sure we are covered.\n  Mr. President, all of that really is wrapped in together because you \nare talking about income for families. We faced some of those measures \nearly in this year when we had the budget cuts. We had the debates on \neducation and on children's programs, and on other women's health care \nprograms. That was a part of it. We will have another debate on \nreconciliation. We had debates in the budget with regard to the \nMedicare cuts. That was a part of it.\n  But the bottom line is that we are talking about the families of \nAmerican workers. We are talking about their parents, we are talking \nabout their kids, we are talking about their small children, their \nbabies, and we are talking about their ability in this great country of \nours to be full participants in the economic hopes, dreams, and \neconomic justice of our Nation.\n  I daresay that all of that is what we are basically talking about \nwhen we are talking about the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act.\n  I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  I will yield briefly for a question, and then I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for those following this debate who wish \nto be informed of what will occur for the balance of today and on \nMonday, I will make a brief announcement.\n  But to refocus the procedural as well as the substantive issue, \nprocedurally this bill has been brought up, the national highway bill, \nand on it is a Davis-Bacon amendment. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nperfectly within his rights to discuss a broad range of issues because \nat the present time, it is my understanding he objects to further \nconsideration of the bill, which is within his rights under the rules \nof the Senate.\n  My concern is that when you say that this amendment, that is, the \nDavis-Bacon amendment, takes wages and deprives workers of the ability \nto receive wages and to work, I ask the Senator if in fact what would \noccur here is simply that you take the highway trust fund, which is \nallocating money to the States, and the amendment would simply say that \nno longer would the States be required to take a percentage of those \nfunds and apply it to the Davis-Bacon regulations; those funds would be \nexpended on additional highways, providing additional work, and in a \nsense the same workers would get, relatively speaking, the same amount \nof money, but the people of that State will get additional work \nperformed--more highways, better bridges. So it translates into a work \nproduct to be received by all the residents of the State. And the same \nworkers end up, over a longer period of time, with the same amount in \ntheir pockets.\n  Is not that the case?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, no. That is absolutely not the \ncase. I do not know where the Senator was earlier when I outlined the \nUniversity of Utah study that analyzed the nine States that repealed \ntheir Davis-Bacon laws, which is effectively what you are doing with \nthe construction industry. What you saw in those States is that there \nwas a 1.7-percent increase in employment, but the total income for \nthose workers in all of those States declined 5 percent. That amounted \nto between $1,500 and $1,700 per worker per year; the cost overruns \nwent up three times over what they had been; the injury rates increased \nsignificantly; the total revenues to the States declined; and the total \nrevenues, I think, to the Federal Government declined. The bottom line, \nI will just say, the most important part of that Utah study, is that \n\n[[Page S8541]]\nthe real income for all of these workers declined.\n  Just finally, what we are saying is we want the competition but not \nthe depressed wages. That I think is a basic difference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator can certainly bring up all the \nstudies he wishes. But the practical dollar and cents is, take the \nState of Virginia. We anticipate we get $150 million. Part of it is \nallocation. All of that has to go into highway construction or matters \nrelated to transportation. So it is not as if this money is going to be \nlost. It is going to the States, and simply this amendment translates \nthose dollars into more road construction, bridges, whatever it may \nbe--safety, more construction. And the same workers eventually get the \nsame amount of money.\n  So I do not wish to conclude this debate today on the theory that \nthis amendment reaches in and robs the people of the opportunity to \nwork, or of their wages, or that the people in the States are deprived \nof the benefits that they are entitled to with the payment of their gas \ntaxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8531-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The clerk will read the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 939) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \n     ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask the bill be read for a second time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator make an objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Vermont objects to the second reading--\nobviously not to the first reading, but I object to the second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will be read for \nthe second time on the next legislative day.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nTexas [Mr. Gramm], I rise today to introduce the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act of 1995. This bill is the companion legislation to a measure \nthat was recently introduced in the House of Represenatives by \nCongressman Charles Canady of Florida. Congressman Canady is the \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the \nConstitution which held a hearing on the bill yesterday.\n  Mr. President, partial-birth abortions are first performed at 19 to \n20 weeks of gestation--and often much later. To give my colleagues a \nclear understanding of how well developed an unborn child is that late \nin pregnancy, I have here an anatomically correct medical model of an \nunborn child at 20 weeks' gestation. It is unlikely that the cameras \nwill pick it all up, but this is the actual size of a 20-week child, \nand the bodily features are there--nose, eyes, lips, fingers, toes--\nalmost perfectly formed so that anyone could see that this is a child.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues that this is the smallest that \nthis child could be under this procedure, which begins at 5 months or \n20 weeks. So that this child is aborted in this procedure minimally at \nthis size and much larger as the child grows in the womb.\n  Now, I have brought some photographs to the floor that show perhaps a \nlittle more clearly premature babies of the very same age of many of \nthose babies who are the victims of these partial-birth abortions.\n  This photograph here--this is an AP photograph, by the way--is of \ntiny Miss Faith Materowski. Little Faith Materowski was born at 23 \nweeks of gestation, approximately this size, weighing in at 1 pound and \n3 ounces. This photograph was taken about a month after she was born. \nThe good news is that little Faith Materowski survived, and she \nsurvived because her mother chose to have her receive medical \nattention. She did not choose to have an abortion.\n  In photograph No. 2, we see a little lady named Melissa Mauer. She \nwas born at 24 weeks of gestation, weighing only 14 ounces, Mr. \nPresident--14 ounces--less than a pound. She is shown in the picture \nabout 8 days after her birth, at which point she was breathing on her \nown in an incubator.\n  Unfortunately, Melissa died after briefly struggling for life after 3 \nmonths.\n  In photograph No. 3--this photograph was in the Miami Herald--we see \na healthy little Miss Kenya King, who was born about 22 weeks into \ngestation, so is approximately the size of this model that I am \nholding. She weighed only 18 ounces at birth. She is shown here 4 \nmonths later, home at last with her parents.\n  Now, with a series of illustrations, in a moment I am going to try to \ndemonstrate to you what is done to children like these and like this. \nThis procedure is done to children--not fetuses or some inanimate \nobject--children, Mr. President.\n  Now, as we put the pictures up, keep in mind that Dr. Martin Haskell, \nwho by his own admission performed over 700 of these procedures--they \nare called partial-birth abortions--as of 1993, he told the American \nMedical News he had performed 700 of these. That is the official \nnewspaper of the AMA. So the illustrations and descriptions that I am \nabout to present are technical and from a technical point of view would \nbe found or could be found in one of those journals.\n  In the first illustration, the doctor--excuse me, the abortionist--it \nis interesting that I made a slip there, saying doctor, because were \nthis to be some type of a miscarriage or premature birth, the doctor \nwould be assisting the birth of this child, because the mother wanted \nthe child. But in this case, another decision has been made without the \nchild's consent, of course, and the abortionist reaches in with \nforceps, using the ultrasound aid, and grabs the child with the forceps \nby the foot or leg, and then in the next picture he turns that child \nwith the forceps so that he can pull the child out through the birth \ncanal by the feet.\n  So you can see this being the birth canal, the child--this is a \nchild, like this, and like those three children that we saw in those \nphotographs. \n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n  With this child now, the forceps are around the legs and the child \nnow is being pulled from the birth canal. In the next illustration, the \nabortionist delivers the entire body except for the head of the child. \nSo we now have the abortionist pulling the child all the way out from \nthe uterus with the exception of the head which the doctors tell me is \napproximately 85 to 90 percent of the child.\n  Now, the fourth illustration--this is pretty rough, Mr. President. I \nhave seen a lot in my life. I am 54 years old, and I have seen some \npretty rough things. But I cannot imagine, in a country as great as \nthis why anyone could sanction--whether you be pro-choice or pro-life--\nhow anyone could sanction what I am about to show you happens.\n  If the head of this child comes through the uterus, they must try to \nkeep it alive. So the abortionist has to be certain that the head does \nnot come through the uterus. So he stops the baby from coming through \nthe uterus at the head, and takes a pair of scissors, as you can see--I \nam going to try to demonstrate it here with this little model, which \nwould be just like this, superimposed upon that picture--he takes the \nscissors and places them into the back of the head, into the cranium, \nand opens those scissors, once he sticks them in like that, to open a \ngap in the child's head. After that procedure is done, they insert a \ncatheter into the back of the neck, the back of the cranium, and \nliterally suck the brains out of that child, and as you can see there, \nthe baby is hanging limp, now dead.\n  That is called partial-birth abortion.\n  We are really talking about inches here, are we not? What is a birth? \nNinety percent out of the uterus, is that a birth? One hundred percent \nout of the uterus? Is that what we are going to say is a birth?\n  So a couple of inches and this child can live, but because it is \nprevented from fully coming out of the uterus by the abortionist and he \nthen places the scissors to the back of the head, opens up an incision \nand inserts the catheter into the brain to suck the brains out, because \nthat decision is made by someone other than the child, that child is \ndenied life.\n  Mr. President, by the 19th or 20th week of gestation, when this \nunspeakably brutal method of abortion is used, the child is clearly \ncapable and able to feel what is happening. This is a living human \nbeing.\n  According to neurologists, premature babies born at this stage may be \nmore sensitive to painful stimulation than others. We had testimony \nyesterday at a press conference that I attended with a neurologist who \nindicated that. He does surgery on babies all the time, and he \nindicated point blank that that child would suffer pain in that \nprocedure.\n  I think that most of my colleagues, and certainly most if not all \nAmericans, would be absolutely appalled, sickened, and angered at such \na brutal act committed against another human being. I know I had that \nfeeling. I did not know that this procedure existed, Mr. President, \nuntil a couple of weeks ago, and I have been for 11 years an advocate \nof the pro-life cause, but I never knew this. I never knew this \nhappened, and doctors who are gynecologists have told me that they did \nnot know it either.\n  I just ask my colleagues a very simple question: If you had a dog or \na cat or a pet that you needed to put to sleep, would you do it that \nway? Would you do it that way? Would you insert a pair of scissors into \nthe back of the head of your family pet and suck the brains out to put \nit to sleep, Mr. President? Would anybody do that? This is the United \nStates of America, the greatest country in the world, that says under \nthe Constitution that we have an obligation to protect life. This is \nhappening in America, probably right now as I am speaking. We would not \ndo it to an animal, not a pet, and we do it to our children.\n  Under the Supreme Court Roe versus Wade decision, this partial-birth \nabortion procedure that I just described is legal in all 50 States. So \nanyone listening out there who says, ``That doesn't happen in my \nState,'' it does. Somewhere in your State it is happening probably \nright now. Indeed, addressing the controversy over the partial-birth \nabortion method, the National Abortion Federation has written to its \nmembership stating--and here is the document, here is what they say: \n``Don't apologize: This is a legal abortion procedure.'' And they are \nright, it is legal.\n  But I am going to tell you something, Mr. President, if I have \nanything to do with it, it is not going to be legal very much longer. \nThis is a sickening, disgusting act that should never be tolerated, not \n1 day longer, not 1 minute longer.\n  My good friend--and he is a good friend--the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, Newt Gingrich, has told audiences all over America for \nthe past couple of months that America cannot survive with 12-year-olds \nhaving babies, 15-year-olds killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of \nAIDS and 18-year-olds receiving diplomas that they cannot read, and he \nis right. And I am going to add one more to it. America cannot survive \nwhen some of its doctors turn from being healers to stabbing innocent \nbabies to death when they enter the birth canal. America is not going \nto survive doing that either.\n  Dr. Martin Haskell has claimed responsibility, proudly, for 700 of \nthese partial-birth procedures as of 1993. Pro-choice, pro-life, I do \nnot care what your position is. How can you tolerate this? How could \nyou possibly condone this act? James McMahon, who was profiled in the \nJanuary 1990 article in the L.A. Times makes late-term abortions his \nspeciality--late-term abortions his speciality.\n  In that article, Dr. McMahon coldly claims credit for having \ndeveloped the partial-birth method which he calls ``intrauterine \ncranial decompression.'' Nice way of saying murdering a child that is \nthree-quarters of the way out of a birth canal. ``I want to deal with \nthe head last,'' Dr. McMahon comments icily, ``because that's the \nbiggest problem.''\n  In the United States of America, a doctor who took an oath to save \nlives is killing a child. That is not killing a child? Somebody stand \nup and tell me on the floor of the U.S. Senate that that is not killing \na child. Have the guts to come down here and stand up--I will yield to \nyou--and tell me that is not killing a child.\n  According to the American Medical News, Dr. McMahon does abortions \nthrough all 40 weeks of pregnancy, but he says he will not do an \nelective procedure after 26 weeks--26 weeks. At 26 weeks, many babies \nare capable of living independent of the mother; 40 weeks is a full-\nterm pregnancy. That is nice of him.\n  Mr. President, this grotesque and brutal partial-birth abortion \nprocedure that I have described on the floor of the Senate can be and \nmust be--must be--outlawed. Simply stated, the legislation that Senator \nGramm and I have introduced today will do just that, it will amend \ntitle 8 of the United States Code and provide that ``Whoever, in or \naffecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-\nbirth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under \nthis title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.''\n  Not the woman--the abortionist. Our bill defines ``partial-birth \nabortion'' as ``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \npartially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus \nand completing the delivery.''\n  Thus, the bill would ban not only the brain-suction, partial-birth \nabortion that I described, but any other abortion that involves the \npartial delivery of the child before he or she is killed.\n  The bill specifically prohibits the prosecution of a woman upon whom \na partial-birth abortion is performed. The bill is aimed at the \nabortionist. It is aimed at the brutality of this act. In addition, the \nbill provides a life-of-the-mother exception.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that no matter how one feels about this \nvery controversial issue of abortion, that reasonable people, caring \npeople in this country are going to step up and say, ``This is wrong, \nthis is wrong, and we are going to stop it.''\n  I am going to fight to the last day that this Congress is in session \nto get this bill voted on in the U.S. Senate, and I am going to stand \nup here again and again. I welcome my colleagues who want to come forth \nand defend this. I cannot wait to engage in the debate. Today I am \nintroducing the bill, but there will be a day tomorrow or the \n\n[[Page S8543]]\nnext day when I am looking forward to debating them. I want to hear \nwhat their rationale is for this procedure. I just want to hear their \ndefense of it. Ultimately, I think, if we can get the bill through, the \nSupreme Court will find the bill to be constitutional. I think it \nstands the test of constitutionality. Even in Roe versus Wade, that \ndecision recognized that a newborn child is a person. Is that a newborn \nchild--90 percent birth?\n\n  I am confident that the court will find that the Congress has the \npower to protect unborn children, who have started their journey \nthrough the birth canal, before being brutally killed, before they \ntravel those last few inches. That is all we are talking about, Mr. \nPresident--a few inches. That is the margin between life and death. \nInches. Inches.\n  Do you know that in this procedure if an abortionist was distracted \nand that child came through the birth canal, the child would have to \nsurvive. They could not do this procedure because it is out of the \nbirth canal. That is the tragic irony of all this. That is why they do \nit. That is why they do it, Mr. President, because there is nothing \nmore embarrassing to the abortionist than having the aborted baby live. \nThat has happened. I talked to a woman who is 18 years old who survived \nit, so I know it happens. A beautiful young lady she is, and she is \ncontributing to America.\n  Of these 700 that Dr. Haskell killed, how many Presidents are in that \nnumber? How many doctors who might find a cure for cancer? How many \ninventors? Who knows. We will never know, will we? They are gone--to \nthe scissors.\n  Sticking scissors. Take a pair of scissors when you go home tonight, \nand stick them into your hands a little bit, until you can just feel \nthe nip of it. Or perhaps why do you not try doing it in the back of \nthe neck and see how it feels, see if it hurts.\n  I am going to see that this bill gets on the desk of President \nClinton if it is the last thing I do before we leave this Congress. I \nhope, Mr. President, if you are out their listening, that you will sign \nthis bill and you will stop this. I know how you feel about abortion, \nbut I want to know how you feel about this. I hope you will sign this \nbill, because this is an outrage. It is unbecoming of this country to \neven think about it, and to even have to be here on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and admit that this is happening in this country.\n  So I am looking forward to the debate, as I say. I hope my colleagues \nwho support this will be down on the floor and debating it here in \nfront of all America--this cruel, horrible act against another human \nbeing, a precious little baby that is defenseless. We had a doctor \nyesterday, a gynecologist, who explained all of this, how it all works \nand how you turn the baby so carefully to remove it from the uterus as \nit is being born, and you are so careful with it, you take care of it \nand protect it. But not in this case. It is just a baby, an innocent \nbaby. Surely, we have more important things to do in the United States \nof America than this. How could any doctor who took an oath ever \nperform those, and then brag about it?\n  Mr. President, I think I have made my point. It has, frankly, been a \nvery difficult speech to get through. It is quite emotional for me, and \nI know how the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Minnesota, feels \nabout this issue. It is difficult to get through these remarks. I do \nnot do it to offend people or to be overly graphic. But it is important \nthat we understand that this is happening, and we must use every public \naccess that we have to stop it.\n  So there will be another time, Mr. President, sooner rather than \nlater, when we are going to debate this again right here. I will be \nhere. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, there are press reports that the \nadministration is considering finally normalizing relations with \nVietnam. I know that even after a quarter century this is an emotional \nand difficult issue, especially for the families of our POW/MIA's. But \nI believe strongly that it is time to take this step. The record is \nclear that closer relations will contribute to resolving the remaining \ndiscrepancy cases, and we have many other interests in Southeast Asia \nthat will be furthered by closer relations with our former enemy.\n  The Vietnam war was a tragedy for both the United States and for \nVietnam. More than 58,000 American soldiers and at least 2 million \nVietnamese lost their lives. Countless others were injured. At least \n60,000 Vietnamese are missing a leg or an arm, mostly from landmines. \nThe war produced bitterness on both sides that poisoned relations \nbetween our countries for years.\n  But it is time to put that period behind us. Vietnam is slowly moving \naway from its Communist past. It has taken aggressive steps to promote \nprivate investment and permit a market economy to develop. It has \ninvited representatives of human rights groups to discuss their \nconcerns. The Vietnamese Government is even requiring its senior \nofficials to study English as a way of accelerating its adoption of \nAmerican-style practices.\n  There is no question that Vietnam still has a long way to go. We need \nto continue to challenge Vietnamese officials about reports of torture, \narrests of dissidents, arbitrary detentions, political trials, and \nabuse of prisoners in forced labor camps. We need to press them to \neliminate Vietnam's black-market trade in endangered species. And there \nare other issues.\n  But we need to recognize that the situation has changed. The United \nStates shut the door to Vietnam after the war because its Government \nwas engaging in practices abhorrent to Americans. There are still \nproblems, but 25 years later almost half of Vietnam's citizens had not \neven been born by the war's end. The best way to encourage the \nVietnamese Government to maintain progress toward openness and free \nmarkets is to expand dialog and contact, not refuse it.\n  Obtaining the fullest possible accounting of our POW's/MIA's is \nessential. I have provided funding in the foreign operations \nappropriations bill to help locate the remains of our POW/MIA's. But \nthere is no longer any question that the Vietnamese Government is \ncooperating fully in this effort. They are working closely with our \nliaison office to continue the search for remains. Maintaining \nobstacles to full cooperation between our two Governments at this point \nwill hinder, not reinforce progress, toward completion of this effort.\n  Mr. President, the cold war is over. We have no Soviet Union to hold \nin check any longer, and the largest remaining Communist power, China, \nwhich has a worse human rights record than Vietnam, has been granted \nMFN status.\n  It is time we recognized that times have changed in Vietnam, and in \nour own country, and we should move forward together. I urge the \nPresident to delay no longer in resuming full diplomatic relations with \nVietnam.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Members of this body have had \nexperience in Utah with our winter sports facilities, as my \npredecessor, Jake Garn, invited Senators to come to Utah and enjoy the \nSenators' Ski Cup.\n  It is now my happy duty and privilege to announce to all of the \nMembers of the Senate that the winter sports facilities of Utah have \nnow attracted more than even the U.S. Senate. Just a few minutes ago, \nthe International Olympic Committee announced that Salt Lake City, UT, \nwill be the site of the Winter Olympics in the year 2002. This is a \ndemonstration of the superior facilities that are available in Utah. We \nthink it is well deserved.\n  I want to pay tribute here on the floor to the thousands, if not tens \nof \n\n[[Page S8544]]\nthousands and even hundreds of thousands, of Utahns who have gathered \ntogether to support the Olympic bid. We lost it for the 1998 Olympics \nby one vote. We have learned here in this body how elections can be \ndecided by one vote. There are some who suggested that the awarding of \nthe Summer Olympics to Atlanta in 1996 hurt our bid, as the \nInternational Committee felt they did not want to have Winter and \nSummer Olympics back-to-back in the same country. Be that as it may, \nthe disappointment of losing in 1998 has now been washed away in the \nexcitement of winning in the year 2002.\n  We have a slogan in Utah that has been prepared for the Olympics. It \nis emblazoned on the banners as you come into our city. It is in the \nairports. It is all over the State. It is: ``The world is welcome \nhere.'' We are delighted to be able to announce that the world that has \nbeen welcome in Utah is now coming to Utah. We are looking for the most \nexciting Winter Olympics in history in the State of Utah in just a few \nshort years.\n  We were so excited I had to come over to share this news with the \nMembers of the Senate. I thank the Chair and the Members for the \nopportunity to express this. It is a great day for the people of our \nState and, frankly, for the people of our Nation as well. This is the \nfirst time the Winter Olympics have come back to America since Lake \nPlacid in 1980. I think that is a long enough wait. We are delighted to \nbe able to say, as I said, the world is welcome in Utah. And the world \nis coming to Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8543-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WINTER OLYMPICS IN UTAH\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

We hope in 2002 they do not desert us.\n  The Senator from Virginia is very generous in his remarks.

I would only \nsay the quality and the quantity of the snow in your State, I think, is \nalmost unmatched anywhere in the world, and will be there to greet the \nOlympians.\n  Momentarily I will address the Senate with respect to the calendar on \nMonday.\n  At this time I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The bay, in fact, is one of the world's great \nnatural resources. We tend to take it for granted, since it is right \nhere at hand, so to speak, and I know many Members of this body have \nenjoyed the Chesapeake Bay. The bay provides thousands of jobs for the \npeople in this region. It is a world-class fishery that produces a \nsignificant portion of the country's fin fish and shellfish catch. It \nis a major commercial waterway and shipping center for the region and \nfor much of the eastern United States. And it is an unparalleled \nrecreational center for almost 10 million people.\n  The Chesapeake Bay also provides vital habitat for living resources. \nOver 2,700 plant and animal species live in the bay. It provides a \nmajor resting area for migratory birds and waterfowl along the Atlantic \nflyway, including many endangered and threatened species.\n  I could go on and on about this dimension of the bay, but most people \nare aware of it. Certainly, our Nation's scientists are aware of it and \nhave consistently regarded the protection and the enhancement of the \nquality of the Chesapeake Bay as an extremely important national \nobjective.\n  It is a treasured asset for those of us in Maryland--in fact, for all \nthose who live around the bay in the other States, our neighboring \nState of Virginia, and the States to the north of us. Much of the water \nthat comes into the bay comes from the Susquehanna River which \noriginates in New York State.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is a defining element in Maryland history and a \nkey to the quality of Maryland life throughout our history.\n  When the bay began to experience serious unprecedented declines in \nwater quality and living resources in recent decades, the people in my \nState suffered as well. We lost thousands of jobs in the fishing \nindustry. We lost much of the wilderness that defined the watershed.\n  We began to appreciate for the first time the profound impact that \nhuman activity could have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.\n  Untreated sewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, farm runoff, and \nincreased development resulted in a degradation of water quality and a \ndestruction of wildlife and its habitat.\n  Now, fortunately, over the last two decades we have also come to \nunderstand that humans can have a positive influence on the \nenvironment, and that we can, if we choose, assist nature to repair \nmuch of the damage which has been done.\n  We now treat sewage before it enters our waters. We ban toxic \nchemicals that were killing the wildlife, we have initiated programs to \nreduce nonpoint source pollution, and we have taken aggressive steps to \nrestore depleted fisheries.\n  The States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania deserve much of \nthe credit for undertaking many of the actions that have put the bay \nand its watershed on the road to recovery.\n  All three States have had major cleanup programs. They have made \nsignificant commitments in terms of resources. It is an important \npriority item on the agendas of the bay States. Successive \nadministrations--Governors have been strongly committed, State \nlegislatures, the public. There are a number of private organizations--\nthe Chesapeake Bay Foundation, for example--which do extraordinarily \ngood work in this area.\n  But there has been an involvement of the Federal Government as well \nin helping to bring about the recent successes. It has been an \nessential and critical involvement.\n  Without the Federal Clean Water Act, the Federal ban on DDT, and \nEPA's watershed-wide coordination of Chesapeake Bay restoration and \ncleanup activities, we would not have been able to bring about the \nconcerted effort, the real partnership, that is succeeding in improving \nthe water quality of the bay and is succeeding in bringing back many of \nthe fish and wildlife species that were on their way to simply being a \nmemory.\n  So there has been an important role that has been played by the \nNational Government in serving as a catalyst to bring together the \nState and local effort and the private sector effort. An extraordinary \npartnership has been built that is much greater than the sum of its \nparts.\n  There is a dynamic element that has resulted, as a consequence, that \nhas enabled us to gain a significant momentum in raising the quality of \nthe Chesapeake Bay to the benefit of everyone.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is getting cleaner, but we cannot afford to be \ncomplacent. There are tremendous stresses imposed upon the bay. This is \na fast-growing area of the country, with increased population. The \ncommercial stresses intensify.\n  So we need to address the continuing needs of the bay restoration \neffort. The hard work, investment, and commitment, at all levels, which \nhas brought gains over the last two decades, must not be allowed to \nrelax.\n  The measures I am introducing today are designed to build upon our \nNational Government's past role in the Chesapeake Bay program, the \nhighly successful Federal-State-local partnership to which I made \nreference, that so ably coordinates and directs efforts to restore the \nbay.\n  The proposed legislation reauthorizes the bay program and expands the \nresponsibilities of the Federal agencies with a stake in the future of \nthe bay so as to address continuing trouble spots in the watershed.\n  Difficulties identified by the Chesapeake Bay community include loss \nof wetlands and forests, soil erosion, toxics, nuisance species, and \nshellfish disease.\n  Let me just outline briefly how these various measures seek to \naccomplish this. First among this package of five bills is legislation \nthat carries forward and enhances the role of the Environmental \nProtection Agency as the lead Federal agency committed to cleaning up \nthe bay. It establishes a mechanism for interagency coordination and \ncooperation in the Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.\n  The proposal also calls on EPA to initiate new programs to conduct \nwatershed-wide research, programs to restore essential habitat, and \nprograms to reduce toxics in the watershed.\n  Another bill in this package directs the Coast Guard to develop \nguidelines for ships entering U.S. waters, to limit the opportunity for \nthe introduction of potentially harmful nonindigenous species through \nballast water releases.\n  In other words, the bay is a ship artery. It is a commercial \nwaterway. The Port of Baltimore is one of our Nation's leading ports. \nShips coming into the Chesapeake Bay often release ballast water. The \nconcern is that in the course of doing so they will release into the \nbay species that are nonindigenous to the bay. In other words, species \nthat had been taken on elsewhere in the world and then would be \nreleased into the bay to its detriment.\n  In fact, this legislation builds on the program undertaken in the \nGreat Lakes where nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel, are \nalready causing millions of dollars in damage. We want to avoid such a \nsituation developing in the Chesapeake Bay, and this provision giving \nthe Coast Guard a role to play with respect to the release of ballast \nwater is important in that regard.\n  Third, the package of legislation continues NOAA's role as the \nFederal agency responsible for providing key marine research in the \nChesapeake Bay. It directs NOAA to continue to undertake research on \nand to develop solutions for the diseases that have ravaged oyster \nfisheries throughout the United States and, in particular, in the \nChesapeake Bay. We have been very hard hit by these diseases that have \nvirtually decimated the oyster industry. NOAA is the agency to carry \nforward this key marine research.\n  Fourth, the package of legislation calls on the Army Corps of \nEngineers to provide assistance to State and local governments in the \ndesign and construction of water-related infrastructure, and to assist \nin developing resource protection projects. \n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\n  Let me just give an example of the projects I am talking about. The \nbeneficial use of dredge material which offers a win-win situation. We \nhave to dredge the bay channels for shipping purposes. There is a \nproblem with the disposal of the spoil from that dredging. We now \nrealize that if we move it to eroding islands, we can rebuild the \nislands. In other words, you have a disposal site so that you dispose \nof it in a way that is beneficial to the environment by renewing \nhabitat.\n  We also are interested in the corps addressing sediment and erosion \ncontrol questions, the protection of eroding shoreline, and the \nprotection of essential public works such as waste water treatment and \nwater supply facilities.\n  The final piece of legislation in this package directs the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, acting through the Natural Resources \nConservation Service and through the Forest Service, to encourage the \nplanting of streamside forests in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and in \nother conservation priority areas. In other words, we encourage the \nplanting of forest buffers, which then help to limit the pollution of \nwater resources by reducing the entry of nonpoint pollutants into \nstreams, and by stabilizing stream banks.\n  It is a very important and worthwhile program. By planting these \nbuffer zones of trees we are able to stabilize the stream bank, and \nalso filter out pollutants which otherwise would go into the bodies of \nwater.\n  Mr. President, it is the hope of the cosponsors that most of these \nmeasures will ultimately be incorporated into larger pieces of \nlegislation that are due to be reauthorized or considered this year. \nHowever, if such legislation is not considered or should become stalled \nin the legislative process--the larger legislation covers a whole range \nof issues--it is our intention to try to move forward with this \nlegislation separately.\n  The Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort has been a major bipartisan \nundertaking in this body. It has consistently, over the years, been \nstrongly supported by virtually all Members of the Senate. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this legislation and \ncontributing to the improvement and the enhancement of one of our \nNation's most valuable and treasured natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills \nand a section-by-section analysis of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to support proposals to implement the U.S. goal of \neventually eliminating antipersonnel landmines; to impose a moratorium \non use of antipersonnel landmines except in limited circumstances; to \nprovide for sanctions against foreign governments that export \nantipersonnel landmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n                  the 1995 Landmine Use Moratorium Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today, I spoke of a worldwide \nscourge of landmines and the use of antipersonnel landmines. I noted \nthat there have been few times in history when the nations of the world \njoined together to outlaw the use of a weapon of war.\n  It was done with chemical and biological weapons, because it was \nunderstood that once they were unleashed, they could not be controlled. \nThey maim or kill whoever comes in contact with them, and they do that \nwhether it is civilians or combatants. In fact, if they are in the \nhands of terrorists, they could wreak havoc on whole societies. We had \na terrifying glimpse of that in Japan a few months ago.\n  Now, while chemical weapons are relatively easy to produce, the \npolitical cost of using them is enormous. There is worldwide revulsion \nif they are used, and any perpetrator is branded a war criminal, a \npariah, and ostracized by the entire world community. And so we ban \nthem.\n  We did the same with dum dum bullets, which expand on contact with \nthe human body and cause horrific injuries. They have been outlawed for \na century.\n  I mention this because every weapon may have some military utility, \nas do chemical weapons and dum dum bullets. Some have been repudiated \nas inhumane and a violation of the laws of war.\n  That is what Civil War General Sherman that about landmines over a \ncentury ago. Sherman was no humanitarian, but he condemned landmines as \n``a violation of civilized warfare.'' It was in the Civil War that \nlandmines--actually live artillery shells, were first concealed beneath \nthe surface of roads, in houses, even concealed in flour barrels, where \nthey maimed and killed soldiers and civilians alike. But even though \nSherman and others condemned them, they have been used ever since in \nsteadily increasing numbers.\n  Today, vast areas of many countries have become deathtraps from \nmillions of unexploded landmines. The State Department estimates that \nthere are 80 to 110 million of these tiny explosives in 62 countries, \neach one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep.\n  To give you an idea, Mr. President, this is a landmine in my hand. I \nam sure my colleagues know it is a deactivated landmine, but this is a \nlandmine. It is tiny and costs $3 or $4 to produce. It is all rubber or \nplastic except for one tiny piece of metal about the size of a \nthumbtack. So it is nearly undetectable. If this had been real, in just \ntouching it like this, my arm would be gone and most of my face would \nbe gone. If you step on it, your leg is gone. If you are a child, you \nare probably killed. Children are killed daily on these. In fact, every \nday, it is estimated that 70 people are maimed or killed by landmines. \nThat is one person every 22 minutes. That is 26,000 people every year. \nMost of them are not combatants. They are civilians going about their \ndaily lives--bringing their animals to a field, collecting wood, or \nthey are getting water, or going to market, or they are going to \nbusiness. They are like Ken Rutherford, a humanitarian worker from \nColorado, working with others in Africa.\n  He hit a landmine. As he described it in his very painful and very \ngraphic testimony before the Senate, he sat there holding his foot in \nhis hand, trying to figure out how he could put it back on. Of course, \nhe never did. And there was surgery after surgery. We watched him walk \npainfully to the \n\n[[Page S8559]]\ntable where he testified before the Senate.\n  These pictures, Mr. President, behind me, tell a gruesome story. But, \nin a way, these are the lucky ones--lucky because they survived, but \nunlucky that they are in a country where they will face a lifetime of \nhardship.\n\n  There are tens of thousands of people like them. Many others die, \njust from a lack of blood or from shock, before they can reach a \nhospital. In many of these countries the hospitals are overwhelmed.\n  I do not have the slightest doubt, Mr. President, that any Member of \nthe Senate, Republican or Democrat, could not see what I have seen \nwithout feeling as passionately as I do. Young children with their legs \nblown off at the knees, mothers with an arm or leg missing, hospital \nrows filled with rows of amputees. I have visited these hospitals.\n  My wife, a registered nurse, has visited these hospitals. We know \nwhat they are like. Tim Rieser, from my staff, has traveled to all \nparts of the world to see what landmines have done.\n  Senators Johnston and Specter, Senators Simpson and Nickles saw \nfirsthand what mines can do when they visited a center for amputees in \nVietnam. Most people have not been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, Cambodia, \nBosnia, Angola, or Mozambique where mines have been a fact of daily \nlife and, in most places, still are. There you see, over and over, the \nterrible human tragedy these insidious weapons cause.\n  Civilians are not the only victims of landmines. They have become the \nscourge of the U.N. peacekeepers. An article in this week's issue of \nDefense Week is titled, ``If U.S. Troops Get the Call in Bosnia, Mines \nWill Pose Serious Threat.'' It says American troops sent to former \nYugoslavia would have to combat an estimated 1.7 million mines in \nBosnia alone. It says that mines have been used by all sides in that \nwar to intimidate U.N. peacekeepers.\n  We are called in there as the most powerful nation history has ever \nknown. But we will be facing $3 and $4 and $5 and $8 landmines and be \nbrought to the level of just about any other country, powerful or \notherwise.\n  Landmines have become a cheap, popular weapon in Third World \ncountries, the same countries where American troops are likely to be \nsent in the future. The $2 or $3 antipersonnel mine hidden under a \nlayer of sand or dust can blow the leg off the best-trained, best-\nequipped American soldier, even though he or she represents the most \npowerful nation on earth.\n  Two years ago, almost no one was paying attention to this global \ncrisis. Then the U.S. Senate passed my amendment for a moratorium on \nthe export of antipersonnel landmines. Republicans and Democrats \ntogether joined to pass that.\n  The amendment had one goal: To challenge other countries to join with \nus to stop the spread of these hidden killers. As I spoke to the \nleaders of the other countries, I could tell them this was something--\nand probably the only thing during that same Congress--that united \nSenators as nothing else had, no matter what their party or political \nphilosophy.\n  With the public pressure that grew out of that and the efforts of \npeople around this world, 26 countries have now halted all or most of \ntheir exports of antipersonnel landmines in just 2 years, starting with \nwhat we were able to do here. Mr. President, 26 countries have halted \nall or most of their exports of antipersonnel landmines.\n  If, in my 21 years, I had to point to what I was most proud of, I \ncould not think of anything I could be more proud of or have more pride \nin than knowing men and women both in this body and in parliamentary \nbodies around the world who have joined with the Senate.\n  Last September, in a historic speech to the U.N. General Assembly, \nPresident Clinton announced the goal of eventually eliminating \nantipersonnel landmines. On December 15, the 184 members of the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly passed a resolution calling for further steps toward \nthe eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines.\n  This is the first time since the banning of chemical weapons that the \nnations of the world have singled out a type of weapon for total \nelimination. It reflects a growing worldwide consensus that these \nweapons are unacceptable because they are indiscriminate.\n  They are so cheap, so easy to mass produce, so easy to conceal and \ntransport and scatter by the thousands. They cannot be controlled. They \nare used routinely to terrorize civilian populations.\n  In March of this year, Belgium passed a law prohibiting production, \nexport, and use of antipersonnel mines. Belgium had been a major \nproducer. Now they have outlawed them. Norway did the same just last \nweek. Half a dozen other countries have declared support for a global \nban on these weapons.\n  U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, Pope John Paul II, former \nPresident Jimmy Carter, American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, \nthese are but a few of the world leaders who have called for an end to \nthe use of antipersonnel mines.\n  But despite this progress, the use of landmines continues unabated. \nMillions of new mines are being produced each year, and today the \nRussians are dropping them by the thousands, out of airplanes, over \nChechnya.\n  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that builds on the steps \nwe have taken. It would impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of \nantipersonnel mines, to take effect 3 years from the date of enactment.\n  It would permit the use of these mines along international borders, \nfor example between North and South Korea, in minefields that are \nmonitored to keep out civilians. It also permits the use of Claymore \nmines, which are used to guard a perimeter, and antitank mines.\n  The purpose of the legislation is simple: Like the landmine export \nmoratorium and the nuclear testing moratorium, it aims, by setting an \nexample, to challenge other countries to join to bring an end to the \nmass destruction in slow motion caused by landmines.\n  As a step toward that goal, it would temporarily halt the scattering \nof antipersonnel mines that cause such a massive number of civilian \ncasualties. One person who has worked on this in Cambodia said, sitting \nin my office in Burlington, VT, ``Yes, we clear landmines in Cambodia. \nWe clear them an arm and a leg at a time.''\n  In addition, my legislation would provide for sanctions against \ncountries that continue to export antipersonnel mines.\n  Mr. President, this is a global crisis. Even with all of our power, \nthe United States cannot solve it alone. But neither will it be solved \nwithout strong U.S. leadership.\n  That is what the legislation does. It sets an example. It says, ``For \n1 year, we will take time out.'' We will challenge other countries to \nlive up to what they said at the United Nations last December when they \nagreed to work to rid the world of these weapons.\n  Every ambassador from other countries I have talked to, every leader, \nevery foreign minister, has told me in words the same thing: If the \nUnited States, the most powerful nation history has ever known, if the \nUnited States cannot set the moral leadership, this will not be done. \nBut if the United States sets the example, then it can be done.\n  Our people will be safer. The people in 180 other countries \nultimately will be safer, certainly the people of the 60 or more \ncountries that are littered with mines can now begin to get rid of \nthem. With 500 new landmine casualties each week, resolutions are not \nenough. We have to jolt the world out of complacency. Only the United \nStates can do that.\n  I have two minds about this legislation. I believe it could be the \nspark that leads to international cooperation to stop this senseless \nslaughter, because what we do is being watched around the globe, and \nthere is great support.\n  It will take a determined effort over the next few years, but if our \nleadership gets other governments to join, and I believe it will, \nAmericans who are sent into harm's way in the future will have far more \nto gain from what we do here. Whether we send our men and women in \nuniform, whether we send our people on humanitarian missions, whatever \nelse, to the other parts of the world, they will be safer because of \nwhat we can do here.\n  At the same time, it is only a 1-year moratorium and does not take \neffect for 3 years. Between now and then, \n\n[[Page S8560]]\n82,000 people will die or be horribly maimed by landmines.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, this legislation is the least we can do as \nthe world's only superpower with by far the most powerful military. It \nis the least we can do to stigmatize these weapons, because they are \nindiscriminate and inhumane, whether they are the simple $2 or $3 type \nor the more complex self-destructive type.\n  What is our alternative? To accept that large areas of the world will \nbe forever littered with hidden deadly explosives? I cannot accept \nthat. Or that every 22 minutes of every day of every year someone, \noften a child, usually a civilian, will lose a leg or an arm, or life, \nas the result of a landmine? I and the 40 other Senators of both \nparties sponsoring this legislation cannot accept that. It is a global \ncatastrophe. Landmines are causing more unnecessary suffering than any \nother weapon of war, and people everywhere are calling for the end of \nthis.\n\n  Today, if armies leave the field they take their weapons with them. \nThey take away their guns, their tanks, and their cannons. But they \nleave behind landmines that continue to kill long after anybody even \nremembers what the armies were fighting about. Long after their \nleaders, their generals, their politicians are dead and gone, the \nlandmines stay there. It is the weapon that keeps on killing.\n  There are some weapons that are so inhumane they do not belong on \nthis Earth. Antipersonnel landmines are in that category. This is not a \nweapon we need for our national security. It is a terrorist weapon used \nmost often against the defenseless, like these children here who are no \nthreat to anybody. They are the victims. It is, above all, a moral \nissue.\n  I want to close with a quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, because he \nhas spoken eloquently about the 20 million landmines in Africa that \nhave already destroyed so many innocent lives. Archbishop Tutu said:\n\n       Anti-personnel landmines are not just a crime perpetrated \n     against people, they are a sin. Why has the world been so \n     silent about these obscenities? It is because most of the \n     victims of landmines are neither heard nor seen.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today shows that we \ndo hear, that we do see, and we are going to stop this.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 941. A bill to provide for the termination of the status of the \nCollege Construction Loan Insurance Association (``the Corporation'') \nas a Government-sponsored enterprise, to require the Secretary of \nEducation to divest himself of the Corporation's stock, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n THE COLLEGE CONSTRUCTION LOAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION PRIVATIZATION ACT \n                                OF 1995\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \noffered by the Clinton administration to privatize the College \nConstruction Loan Insurance Association, better known as Connie Lee. I \nam pleased to be joined in the effort by the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Kennedy.\n  Connie Lee was created in the Higher Education Act Amendments of \n1986, and I was pleased to have shepherded this part of that larger \neffort through the Congress. So it is particularly rewarding for me to \nbe here today to begin this exciting transition for Connie Lee.\n  Connie Lee was created with a vital and focused mission--to assist \ncolleges in the repair, modernization, and construction of their \nfacilities. Like many institutions, colleges, and universities need \nmultiyear financing to keep up with their construction and renovation \nneeds. For institutions with strong financial backing and large \nendowments, issuing bonds and securing capital has not been a major \nproblem. Institutions that are less secure and have a lower bond \nrating, however, face major obstacles in obtaining the necessary \nfinancing.\n  It was clear to us in 1986 that we, as a nation, have a major stake \nin assuring that our higher education institutions both literally and \nfiguratively sit on a strong foundation. Connie Lee was created to \naddress this need and, since its incorporation in 1987, it has provided \nincreased access to the bond markets for nearly 100 needy institutions \nthrough bond insurance. Connie Lee has insured bond issues totaling \njust over $2.5 billion and has assisted institutions such as the \nUniversity of Denver, the University of Massachusetts Medical School, \nseveral community colleges, and numerous other institutions in nearly \nevery State.\n  With its significant record, Connie Lee has clearly proven its \nmaturity and strength. Since its founding, Connie Lee has maintained \nits triple-A financial rating, and a recent Standard and Poor's report \nconfirmed its strong financial position. Connie Lee is clearly ready \nfor privatization. Even though the original Federal investment of $19 \nmillion was small, every dollar is clearly needed in our effort to \neliminate the budget deficit.\n  The administration's bill is quite straightforward. It would repeal \nthe section of the Higher Education Act that authorized the creation of \nConnie Lee and governs its activities. In addition, it would provide \nfor the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the 15-percent share the \nGovernment holds in Connie Lee.\n  The Subcommittee on Education, Arts and Humanities of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee will hold hearings on this matter, as well as \nthe proposal to privatize Sallie Mae early next week. While I think the \nadministration's proposal is clearly a good start, there are some \nimportant issues for us to examine in the committee.\n  These issues are modest, however, and I hope that the committee can \nmove quickly on this important and ground-breaking legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Warner, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Burns, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 942. A bill to promote increased understanding of Federal \nregulations and increased voluntary compliance with such regulations by \nsmall entities, to provide for the designation of regional ombudsmen \nand oversight boards to monitor the enforcement practices of certain \nFederal agencies with respect to small business concerns, to provide \nrelief from excessive and arbitary regulatory enforcement actions \nagainst small entities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business.\n\n\n           The small business regulatory fairness act of 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am announcing the opening of \na new front in our fight against oppressive, onerous, and overly \nmeddlesome Government regulations. I believe this new front will, for \nthe time, take the fight outside the beltway and attack regulations and \nagencies where they impact people in their day-to-day lives.\n  Since the election, there has been tremendous activity in reforming \nthe way Federal agencies develop and issue regulations, and I have been \ndeeply involved in this effort as cochair, along with Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, of the Senate Republican Regulatory Relief Task \nForce. As we speak, we are working with Senator Dole and others on his \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, S. 343. These efforts are vitally \nimportant if we are to slow run-away regulation and better control \nFederal agencies. Equally important for small business is to add some \nmeaningful judicial enforcement provisions to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, and I have introduced legislation to accomplish this.\n\n  All of these efforts focus on changing the way agencies enact \nregulations. Today, I announce an effort to reform the way Government \nofficials enforce Federal regulations. After all, most people, most \nsmall business people, do not have the time to concern themselves with \nthe process of reviewing and commenting on proposed and final rules in \nthe Federal Register. Small businesses have to deal with regulations \nwhen the regulator shows up on the doorstep to inspect their facility \nor to enforce a new Federal mandate. As chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business, I have heard numerous horror stories about \nburdensome regulations. But as I have listened and learned from \nbusinessmen and women with real life problems, I have become \nincreasingly convinced that the enforcement of regulations is a problem \nas troublesome as the regulations themselves.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to make fundamental changes in the \nway regulatory agencies think about small \n\n[[Page S8561]]\nbusiness. It should be every regulatory agency's mission to encourage \ncompliance by making rules easier to understand and by not enforcing \ntheir regulations in a way that unnecessarily frustrates law abiding \nsmall businesses. To this end, my bill includes a three part attack on \nunfair enforcement of Government regulations.\n  First, small businesses should be able to understand what is expected \nof them. I want small businesses to know that if they are playing by \nthe rules of the game as expressed in plain English compliance guides \nthe agencies will be required to print, then they have nothing to fear \nfrom inspectors. Sound like common sense? It should be, but for too \nlong agencies like EPA and OSHA have refused to tell businesses how \nthey can avoid the threat of regulatory action. Like the merchant who \nresponds to questions about his product with the phrase caveat emptor, \nsome regulators have taken the attitude that it is not their \nresponsibility to make complying with the law easy, preferring instead \nto punish small business owners who deviate in the smallest way from \nthe most complicated regulation.\n  The second part of my bill is designed to give small businesses a \nplace to voice complaints about excessive, unfair or incompetent \nenforcement of regulations, with the knowledge that their voices will \nbe heard. My bill sets up regional Small Business and Agriculture \nOmbudsmen through the Small Business Administration's offices around \nthe country to give small businesses assurance that their confidential \ncomplaints and comments will be recorded and heard. These Ombudsmen \nalso will coordinate the activities of volunteer Small Business \nRegulatory Fairness Boards, made up of small business people from each \nregion. These boards will be able to investigate and make \nrecommendations about troublesome patterns of enforcement activities. \nAny small business that is subject to an inspection or enforcement \naction will have the chance to rate and critique the inspectors or \nlawyers they deal with. In dealing with small businesses today, \nagencies sometimes seem to assume that every one is a violator of their \nrules, trying to get away with something. Some agencies do a good job \nof fulfilling their legal mandate while assisting small business, but \nmany agencies seem stuck in an enforcement mentality where everyone is \npresumed guilty until proven innocent. I think we should let small \nbusinesses compare their dealings with one agency to dealings with \nanother so that the abusive agencies or agents can be weeded out and \nexposed. Agencies should be vying to see which can fulfill their \nstatutory mandate in a way that helps and empowers small business. We \nneed direct feedback from small businessmen and women around the \ncountry on how well the regulators are doing their jobs.\n\n  The third part of the legislation will create some financial \naccountability at Federal agencies and level the playing field for \nsmall businesses when they disagree with a fine or penalty imposed on \nthem this bill will make the Government inspectors and lawyers \nresponsible for their actions in assessing fines, penalties, and \ncitations because it will allow small businesses to recover their legal \ncosts from the Government when the enforcers and the lawyers have been \nunreasonable. If Federal agencies make excessive demands that they can \nnot sustain in court, then the Federal agency will have to pay the \nlegal fees of the small business. Small businessmen and women in \nAmerican are more than willing to comply with regulations and pay \nappropriate penalties when they are in the wrong. But it is time we put \na stop to powerful Federal agencies swooping down on small businesses \nand insisting on unreasonable fines just because they agency enjoys an \nenormous financial and resource advantage and can afford an expensive \nand time consuming court challenge. If the small business can reduce or \neliminate the penalty, this bill will require the legal costs to be \npaid directly out of the agency's budget.\n  On Monday of this week, the President told the White House conference \nthat he wants Government regulators to stop treating small business men \nand women as criminals and start treating them as partners or \ncustomers.

Mr. President, one of the many controversial \nprovisions of the 1994 crime bill was the requirement that states have \nin place an array of dubious programs, including social rehabilitation, \njob skills, and even postrelease programs, in order to qualify for the \nprison construction grant money contained in the bill.\n  This requirement is yet another manifestation of the criminal rights \nphilosophy, which has wreaked havoc on our criminal justice system. \nThis view holds that criminals are victims of society, are not to blame \nfor their actions, and should be rehabilitated at the taxpayers \nexpense. In their zeal to rehabilitate violent criminals, proponents of \nthis ideology have worked overtime to ensure that murderers, rapists, \nand child molesters are treated better than the victims of these acts \nand that these criminals have access to perks and amenities most hard-\nworking taxpayers cannot afford.\n  Award-winning journalist Robert Bidinotto has revealed myriad abuses. \nFor example, at Mercer Regional Correctional Facility in Pennsylvania, \nhardened criminals have routine access to a full-sized basketball \ncourt, handball area, punching bags, volleyball nets, 15 sets of \nbarbells, weightlifting machines, electronic bicycles, and stairmasters \nfacing a TV, so the prisoners do not have to miss their favorite show \nwhile working out.\n  Or consider David Jirovec, a resident of Washington State who hired \ntwo hit men to kill his wife for insurance money. His punishment? \nRegular conjugal visits from his new wife.\n  At Sullivan high-security prison in Fallsburg, NY, prisoners hold \nregular jam sessions in a music room crowded with electric guitars, \namplifiers, drums, and keyboards.\n  In Jefferson City, MO, inmates run an around-the-clock closed-circuit \nTV studio and broadcast movies filled with gratuitous sex and graphic \nviolence.\n  Perhaps the winner in the race for rehabilitation is the \nMassachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk, MA. There, prisoners \nsentenced to life in prison--known as the Lifers Group--held its annual \nLifers Banquet in the $2 million visitor's center. These 33 convicts--\nmostly murderers--and 49 of their invited guests dined on catered prime \nrib.\n  This is just the tip of the iceberg. These are not isolated \nincidents, but have become commonplace in our criminal justice system. \nViolent criminals have by definition committed brutal acts of violence \non innocent women, children, the elderly, and other citizens. That the \ngovernment continues to take money out of the pockets of law-abiding \ntaxpayers--many of whom are victims of those behind bars--to create \nresorts for prisoners to mull \n\n[[Page S8565]]\naround in is incomprehensible. The rationale for this system is likely \nsummed up by Larry Meachum, commissioner of correction in the State of \nConnecticut: ``We must attempt to modify criminal behavior and \nhopefully not return a more damaged human being to society than we \nreceived.''\n  Mr. President, I reject this liberal social rehabilitation \nphilosophy. I introduced legislation yesterday, the Prison Work Act of \n1995, which has a different message: prisons should be places of work \nand organized education, not resort hotels, counseling centers, or \nsocial laboratories. It ensures that time spent in prison is not good \ntime, but rather devoted to hard work and education. This is a far more \nconstructive approach to rehabilitation.\n  Specifically, the Prison Work Act repeals the social program \nrequirements of the 1994 crime bill and instead makes the receipt of \nState prison construction grant money conditional on States requiring \nall inmates to perform at least 48 hours of work per week, and engage \nin at least 16 hours of organized educational activities per week. \nStates may not provide to any prisoner failing to meet the work and \neducation requirement any extra privileges, including the egregious \nitems listed above.\n  The critics of this legislation are likely to portend that it is too \ncostly or too unworkable. However, as prison reform expert and noted \nauthor John DiIulio has pointed out, one-half of every taxdollar spent \non prisons goes not to the basics of security, but to amenities and \nservices for prisoners. However, these extra perks would be severely \nrestricted under my legislation. No one failing to meet the work and \norganized study requirements would have access to them, and since the \ninmates would be occupied for 11 hours per day fulfilling the work and \nstudy requirement, the opportunity for these costly privileges would be \nreduced. Moreover, to reduce operation costs even further, prison labor \ncould be used to replace labor that is currently contracted out. Thus, \nthese programs could easily be implemented.\n  The other charge will likely be that the Federal Government should \nnot micromanage State prison efforts. However, this bill does not \nmicromanage at all. Rather, States have been micromanaged by the \nFederal courts which have mandated that States provide prisoners with \nevery possible amenity imaginable. For example, Federal Judge William \nWayne Justice of the Eastern District Court required scores of changes \nin the Texas prison system, designed to improve the living conditions \nof Texas prisoners. These changes increased Texas's prison operating \nexpenses tenfold, from $91 million in 1980 to $1.84 billion in 1994--\neven though the prison population only doubled.\n  This legislation will empower State and local prison officials to \noperate their systems in a cost-efficient manner, and will give them \nthe much needed protection from the overreaching Federal courts. More \nimportantly, it will put the justice back in our criminal justice \nsystem and ensure that criminals are not treated better than the \nvictims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8564-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FIFTH ANNUAL DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to observe the \nfifth annual Day of the African Child, a day this year which will focus \ninternational attention on Africa's potential amidst critical \nchallenges.\n  The Day of the African Child was declared in 1991 to commemorate the \nmassacre of South African schoolchildren in the black township of \nSoweto 19 years ago. These elementary and high school children were \nshot and killed simply for protesting the deplorable system of \napartheid education. On this anniversary, we have the opportunity to \ncelebrate the achievements of countries like South Africa, and reflect \non the challenges ahead for the African child--indeed, the next \ngeneration of Africa.\n  There have been considerable strides made in Africa over the last 30 \nyears. In partnership with the international community, the mortality \nrate of children under 5 has decreased by half since 1960. The average \nlife expectancy in the subcontinent is now 54 years, 13 years longer \nthan it was in 1960. Two-thirds of African countries have immunized 75 \npercent of all children under 5, and UNICEF reports that the \ngovernments of Africa expanded the provision of safe water to over 120 \nmillion more people during the 1980's. Primary school enrollment has \nrisen dramatically since the 1970's for both boys and girls, with 69 \npercent of African girls enrolled in primary school now.\n  Yet, hardships continue for many African children. Life expectancy in \nAfrica is still 20 years behind that of developed states. Basic health \ncare is not accessible to half of all Africans. Children in Africa \ncontinue to die at 10 times the rate of children in industrialized \nnations.\n  But today, in addition to hunger and disease, war is also ravaging \nthe minds and bodies of Africa's children. It is no coincidence that \nthe countries with the first, second, and third highest rates of child \nmortality--Mozambique, Afghanistan, and Angola--are those that have \nbeen embroiled in the bloodiest of civil wars. Ethiopia, Somalia, and \nLiberia are close behind.\n  The armed conflicts throughout Africa have taken their toll on the \nchildren. Last year in Rwanda, for instance, almost 100,000 children \nreportedly were killed in just a few months. In Sudan, according to a \n1992 report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, one criterion \nfor conscription was ``the presence of two molar teeth'': as a result, \nalmost 12,500 boys from the ages of 9 to 16 years were enlisted.\n  Last year in Liberia, I raised the issue of child soldiers with \nmembers of the Transitional Government, and was told that this is truly \na problem which is rotting the country. UNICEF estimates that thousands \nof children are participating in Liberia's civil war--either to avenge \nmurders of their family members or to make some hard-found money--and \nthat factions abuse their young soldiers with alcohol, drugs, and \ngunpowder.\n  Mr. President, while we recognize the progress made in Africa thus \nfar, we must not forget these daunting challenges ahead. As we debate \nthe role of the United States in Africa, we must do so with an eye to \nthe future, and with an appreciation for what international partnership \ncan achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8565-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8565-S8566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD\n\n   Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nfifth annual Day of the African Child. As chairman of the African \nAffairs Subcommittee, I have long been concerned about Africa's \nchildren.\n  Earlier this year, the world community lost one of its foremost \nchampions for the cause of children, Mr. James Grant. As head of \nUNICEF, Jim Grant worked tirelessly to improve the lives of children \nall around the world, particularly in Africa. His dedication, energy, \nand moral leadership will be sorely missed. On this day of African \nchildren, we mourn his loss but also celebrate his contributions.\n  Since I first chaired the subcommittee in 1980, there has been real \nand significant progress in improving the lives of children of Africa. \nThrough the commitment of African governments, private voluntary \ngroups, and international organizations like UNICEF, access to \neducation has increased notably. The under-5 mortality rates are now \nhalf what they were in 1960. Malnutrition, while still affecting some \n30 percent of African children, is less pronounced than many had feared \nentering the 1980's.\n  But much remains to be done. I am particularly concerned about the \ndevastating effect of civil conflict on children. While political \nfactions and armed groups fight for power, it is often the most \nvulnerable and voiceless--Africa's children--who are most affected. \nEntire generations have lost opportunities for basic education. Many \nhave lost parents and siblings. From Sudan to Angola, Rwanda to \nLiberia, the brutality of war has scarred millions of innocent \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, the Day of the African Child, June 15, commemorates \nthe 1976 uprising and massacre of the children of Soweto, South Africa. \nTheir struggle to bring down the inhumane apartheid system vividly \nsymbolizes the difficult plight of children in Africa. Their struggle, \nhowever, also represents the possibilities and hope for Africa as \nPresident Nelson Mandela finishes his \n\n[[Page S8566]]\nfirst year as leader of a democratic, nonracial South Africa.\n  Today we celebrate the progress that has been made in bettering the \nlives of African children. But today also stands as a challenge to all \nof us to continue efforts to improve education and basic health care \nfor all the children of Africa. Their future is the hope for the entire \nAfrican Continent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8565-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMEMORATING THE DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today marks the 19th anniversary of \nthe Soweto massacre where more than 100 black South African students--\nchildren--were killed while protesting against the tyranny of South \nAfrican apartheid. These children are martyrs to the cause of freedom \nand justice. Their sacrifices, along with those of many others, \ncontributed to a far brighter future in South Africa than could have \nbeen foreseen at that time. And so, June 16 has been designated by the \nOrganization of African Unity as the ``Day of the African Child.'' On \nthis day, we not only mark the past, but we should also commit \nourselves to creating a brighter future for the children of Africa.\n  Our commemoration of the children of Soweto should be solemn, as we \nreflect on the loss of far too many African children to conflict and \nwar, to disease, to famine, and to the neglect of a world that often \ncares more about amassing material wealth than about ensuring the \nhealth and well-being of all of its children. An African child deserves \nno less than any other child born anywhere else in the world. They \ndeserve to be cared for, to be protected, to have adequate food, \nshelter, and health care, to have safe drinking water, to be educated, \nand to live in a peaceful world. Yet, a child born in sub-Saharan \nAfrica has a life expectancy 20 years shorter than a child born in an \nindustrialized country. An African child is 8 times less likely to \nsurvive infancy and 10 times less likely to survive beyond 5 years old \nthan a child in an industrialized country. The mother of an African \nchild is 29 times more likely to die in childbirth than the mother of a \nchild in the industrialized country. As many as 30 percent of African \nchildren suffer from malnutrition. Only 45 percent of Africans have \naccess to safe drinking water.\n\n  Thanks to U.S. assistance, there has been progress in reducing the \nunder-5 mortality rate, increasing child immunizations and increasing \nlife expectancy over the last 30 years. But clearly, there is much work \nto be done. As we commemorate the Day of the African Child let us also \nrecognize the very positive affect that our foreign assistance has on \nimproving the prospects for Africa's children to have healthy, \nproductive lives--to have no less than what we would want for our own \nchildren.\n  The theme of this year's observance is ``Children in Armed \nConflict.'' War has a devasting affect on children. Prior to 1945, most \nof the victims of war were soldiers. In the 160 wars and conflicts \nsince 1945, 80 percent of the dead and wounded have been civilians--\nmost of them women and children. The effect of armed conflict on \nAfrican women and children has been particularly devastating. Ninety-\ntwo percent of the war-related deaths in Africa are women and children. \nIn the Sudanese war, children die at 14 times the rate of government \nand guerrilla soldiers combined. Most often, in conflict zones children \ndie as a result of the dispersal that leads to malnutrition and \ndisease. Child mortality rates are highest in those countries that are \nravaged by armed conflicts. As we observe the Day of the African Child \nlet us also commit ourselves to playing whatever positive role we can \nthrough diplomacy, support for U.N. peacekeeping operations, or \nwhatever measures appropriate to help resolve those conflicts that \nstill remain on the African Continent. There has been great progress in \nending conflicts on the African Continent over the last decade. Much \nmore has to be done.\n\n  I join today with the Organization of African Unity, the United \nNations Children's Fund and all those who care about the health and \nwell-being of all the world's children in recognizing June 16 as the \nDay of the African Child. I salute the U.S. Committee for UNICEF for \nits hard work in organizing today's celebration. Let us resolve to do \nall that we can to provide hope for Africa's children that they may \nhave the kind of future that each of us wants for our own children.\n  Mr. President, on the topic of aid to Africa, I would like to share \nwith my colleagues a letter I received from a young lady, Miss Julie \nHaronik, from Moline, IL. Julie is 13 years old and she wrote to me \nasking that we maintain the Development Fund for Africa.\n\n  I have received many letters supporting foreign aid to Africa over \nthe last month. Julie's letter demonstrated how a child can sometimes \nbe wiser, more caring, and more compassionate than many adults far \nolder than herself. Among Julie's reasons for supporting aid to Africa, \nshe says that, ``If you cut off aid some projects in Africa that have \nbeen started recently may fall apart without aid [before] they can \nsustain themselves.'' In the last paragraph of Julie's letter she \nwrites:\n\n       You may wonder why a thirteen year old would be concerned \n     about Africa. One reason is that I want society to be on \n     equal terms with all people when I am an adult. Another \n     reason is that if America ever needed an African resource I \n     would hope Africa would help us in our time of need. I also \n     hope for world peace which can be achieved only through \n     kindness, recognizing fellow humans, and helping those in \n     need.\n\n  I am so proud of this young lady both for her world outlook and \ncompassion for others, and for her willingness to write and participate \nin public debate on the political issues of the day. Mr. President, I \nask that the full text of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                       Moline, IL.\n     Senator Paul Simon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simon: Although you may not realize it Africa \n     has come a long way, with outside aid. If you cut off aid \n     some projects in Africa that have been started recently may \n     fall part without aid until they can sustain themselves. \n     Africa still has a way to go, but it is a place of hope. \n     Please don't cut off aid to the Development Fund for Africa!\n       The United States of America has a duty to itself and the \n     rest of the world. That duty is to help all people whether \n     they can repay debts or not. One tenth of one percent of the \n     budget is not very much money to give to those in need. \n     Africa doesn't just take aid from people it has been its own \n     resources, which are scarce. The government's duty is to make \n     sure Africa does not lose all aid, but develop enough not to \n     need it.\n       You may wonder why a thirteen year old would be concerned \n     about Africa. One reason is that I want society to be on \n     equal terms with all people when I am an adult. Another \n     reason is that if America ever needed African resources I \n     would hope Africa would help us in our time of need. I also \n     hope for world peace which can be achieved only through \n     kindness, recognizing fellow humans, and helping those in \n     need. Thank you for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Julie Haronik.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8566-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8566-S8567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CIVIC EDUCATION GATHERING IN PRAGUE\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, during the first few days of \nJune, one of the largest international gatherings of educators and \nrepresentatives of the public and private sectors supporting civic \neducation met in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Four hundred and twenty-five \nrepresentatives from 52 nations participated.\n  Entitled CIVITAS@PRAGUE.1995, the conference was sponsored by 36 \ncivic education organizations from North America, Western and Eastern \nEurope, and the former Soviet Union.\n  A declaration was adopted by CIVITAS participants that asserts the \nessential importance of civic education for developing the support \nrequired for the establishment and maintenance of stable democratic \ninstitutions. Constitutional democracies must ultimately rely upon \ncitizens and leaders possessing a reasoned commitment to those \nfundamental values and principles which enable them to flourish. Stable \ndemocracies, in turn, are vital for economic development, national \nsecurity, and for overcoming destructive religious and ethnic \nconflicts. The declaration also argues that civic education should have \na more prominent place in the programs of all governments and \ninternational organizations.\n  American participation in the project was organized by a steering \ncommittee composed of representatives of the Center for Civic \nEducation, American \n\n[[Page S8567]]\nFederation of Teachers, National Endowment for Democracy, Institute for \nDemocracy in Eastern Europe, Mershon Center at Ohio State University, \nand the Social Studies Development Center at Indiana University. All \nthese groups worked in cooperation with the U.S. Department of \nEducation and the U.S. Information Agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this declaration and in \ngiving greater recognition to the need to improve civic education for \nstudents in the United States and in other nations throughout the \nworld.\n  The text of the CIVITAS declaration follows:\n\n               Civic Education--An International Priority\n\n       On June 2-6, 1995, representatives from fifty-two countries \n     met in Prague at one of the largest international meetings on \n     civic education ever held. The following is a declaration \n     adopted by the participants. A list of the individual signers \n     is available on CIVNET.\n       The wave of change toward democracy and the open economy \n     that swept the world at the beginning of this decade has \n     slowed, and, in some respects, even turned around. Religious \n     and ethnic intolerance; abuses of human rights; cynicism \n     toward politics and government; corruption, crime and \n     violence; ignorance, apathy and irresponsibility--all \n     represent growing challenges to freedom, the marketplace, \n     democratic government, and the rule of law.\n       All this makes clear how central knowledge, skills, and \n     democratic values are to building and sustaining democratic \n     societies that are respectful of human rights and cultural \n     diversity. Once again, we see the importance of education \n     which empowers citizens to participate competently and \n     responsibly in their society.\n       Despite great differences in the more than fifty countries \n     represented among us, we find many similarities in the \n     challenges we face in our civic life. These challenges exist \n     not only in the countries represented here; they also exist \n     in other parts of the world, and in all aspects of social, \n     economic, and political life. People involved in civic \n     education have much to learn from one another.\n       It is time again to recognize the crucial role that civic \n     education plays in many areas of concern to the international \n     community: Shared democratic values, and institutions that \n     reflect these values, are the necessary foundation for \n     national and international security and stability; The \n     breakup of Cold War blocs, while bringing much good, has also \n     created openings for aggressive and undemocratic movements, \n     even in the established democracies themselves; Civic \n     development is an essential element in--not just a side \n     effect of--economic development. Investments and guarantees \n     made by private enterprise, governments, and international \n     financial institutions will fail where political and legal \n     systems fail, and where corruption and violence flourish.\n       The challenge of civic education is too great for educators \n     alone. They need far greater cooperation from their own \n     peoples, governments, and the international community.\n       We seek increased support for civic education--formal and \n     informal--from the widest range of institutions and \n     governments. In particular, we urge greater involvement in \n     civic education by international organizations such as the \n     Council of Europe, the European Union, the North Atlantic \n     Assembly, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe, the United Nations, UNESCO, and the World Bank.\n       We seek an active personal and electronic on-line-exchange \n     (through CIVNET) of curricular concepts, teaching methods, \n     study units, and evaluation programs for all elements of \n     continuing education in civics, economics, and history.\n       We pledge ourselves to create and maintain a worldwide \n     network that will make civic education a higher priority on \n     the international agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8566-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8567-S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE 31ST CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the United Auto Workers are \nconcluding their 31st Constitutional Convention today in Anaheim, CA. \nThis is a momentous occasion, marking the end of one era and the \nbeginning of another for one of the world's most important labor \norganizations. Owen Bieber, who has held the presidency for the past 12 \nyears, has retired and has handed over his duties to Stephen Yokich, \nthe incoming president. Each of these leaders, with over 75 years of \nservice to the UAW between them, has made it his life's work to fight \nfor workers' rights both in the United States and around the world. \nThey carry on an outstanding tradition of progressive union leadership \nthat was established by the late Walter Reuther and continued by \nLeonard Woodcock and Douglas Fraser.\n  Owen Bieber has dedicated more than 45 years of his life to promoting \nfair labor standards. Bieber went to work right after high school \nbending wire for car seats at the McInerney Spring and Wire Company in \nGrand Rapids, Michigan. In 1948, he became a member of UAW Local 687, \nthus beginning a journey that would see him rise to the highest level \nof the organization. Bieber was quickly voted in to several leadership \npositions and in 1956, he was elected president of Local 687. Bieber \nserved as president of the local until 1961, when he was appointed to \nbe a staff representative for UAW Region 1D. He remained with UAW \nRegion 1D for the next 20 years. He was elected regional director in \n1974, and reelected in 1977. In 1980, delegates to the Union's 26th \nConstitutional Convention elected him to be an international vice-\npresident and he then took charge of the UAW's largest department--\nGeneral Motors. His final step to the presidency of the UAW came at the \n27th Constitutional Convention in Dallas in 1983. Since then, he has \nbeen reelected every 3 years, with his fourth and final term beginning \nin 1992.\n  Owen Bieber has always been committed to the belief that in order for \nU.S. industry to be successful, there must be a strong partnership \nbetween management and labor. As UAW president, Bieber's strategy of \nbuilding new cooperation with the auto companies laid the foundation \nfor future success. It is this strategy that has allowed the U.S. auto \nindustry to bounce back and once again lead the world. Bieber has \nworked to increase security for union members while at the same time \nhelping improve the quality of both work and work life in the plants. \nBieber has focused the union on efforts to raise wages, protect jobs, \nstrengthen work place safety and ensure fully paid health care. Under \nBieber's leadership, the UAW established and fostered successful \nbargaining relationships with Japanese manufacturers. Bieber also \nexpanded membership in the UAW to include workers in the media, \nacademia, and government.\n  Owen Bieber has also expressed a strong commitment to civil and human \nrights, both at home and abroad. During his tenure as president, the \nworld saw workers win their basic rights in countries such as Poland \nand South Africa. These struggles were strongly supported by the UAW. \nIn 1986, Bieber negotiated on behalf of South African workers who were \njailed without being charged with a crime. A high point of his career \ncame in 1990, when Bieber had the opportunity to escort recently freed \nNelson Mandela through Ford Motor Company's Rouge plant.\n  Throughout the years, Bieber has always remained committed to his \nlocal community. He has also been a strong booster of the city of \nDetroit, where the union is headquartered. His broad civic involvement \nhas included such organizations as the NAACP and the United Way.\n  Owen Bieber has always shown the highest regard and respect for the \nAmerican worker. This giant of a man has also been a booming voice for \na tough and fair American trade policy. It is only fitting that now, as \nhe retires, we have an administration that is willing to stand up for \nAmerican manufacturers and American workers and to insist that foreign \nmarkets are as open to our products as our markets are to imports.\n  The new president, Stephen Yokich, has spent the past three decades \nworking on behalf of labor. The UAW has always meant a great deal to \nYokich and his family. Both of Yokich's parents and grandfathers were \nmembers of the UAW. Yokich has been one the UAW's strongest \nnegotiators. Yokich has been in charge of UAW's General Motors \nDepartment since 1989. He was on hand to oversee the downsizing of GM's \nwork force. Yokich's handling of the situation enabled more workers to \nkeep their jobs and has ultimately led to a more cooperative \nrelationship between the UAW and GM. One of his main responsibilities \nin the near future will be to increase UAW membership, a task that will \nbenefit from his great personal energy.\n  It is heartening to see that the leadership of one of the world's \nmost important labor organizations will remain in able hands. I know my \nSenate colleagues join me in congratulating these two outstanding \nleaders for the extraordinary work they have done on behalf of our \nNation's workers and for their efforts to make our automobile \n\n[[Page S8568]]\nindustry the foremost example of American manufacturing. I ask that the \ntext of the remarks of Owen Bieber at the UAW's 31st Constitutional \nConvention be placed in the Record following my statement.\n  The text of the remarks follows:\n\n                         Remarks of Owen Bieber\n\n       Brothers and sisters, I cannot tell you how much that video \n     tribute, and how much your warm applause means to me.\n       What I can tell you is that when all is said and done--it \n     is you and those you represent who have--time and again, \n     inspired me.\n       It is your passion for justice, your love of your country \n     and your love for the UAW that drives this union.\n       It is you who have created the opportunities for me to take \n     the UAW's message from California to South Africa.\n       It is the clout of one-point-three million active and \n     retired UAW members, that has carried me to the offices of \n     Presidents and Senators and CEO's.\n       Without this union, a young worker in an auto parts plant \n     in Grand Rapids, Michigan could hardly dream of meeting Lech \n     Walesa or Nelson Mandela or Bill and Hillary Clinton--let \n     alone actually do so.\n       It is also the collective UAW that has generated the great \n     team of colleagues I have had the privilege to work with over \n     the years.\n       Leonard Woodcock and Doug Fraser, especially, have been \n     there for advice and counsel whenever I needed them.\n       Ken Bannon, Don Ephlin, Martin Gerber, Pat Greathouse, \n     Irving Bluestone, Marc Stepp, Odessa Komer, Olga Madar and \n     retired board members have also remained loyal supporters and \n     advisors.\n       I cannot think of anyone I would rather have had on my side \n     and at my side for the battles we've been through than Steve \n     Yokich, Stan Marshall, Ernie Lofton, Carolyn Forrest, and \n     Secretary-Treasurer, Bill Casstevens.\n       In case you don't already know this, let me tell you that \n     the thing about the president's staff is that they are \n     supposed to be kind of invisible.\n       But believe you me, without Dick Shoemaker and the rest of \n     my fine staff and department heads, this union would be \n     nowhere near as effective as we have been.\n       There are many unsung warriors in the UAW army, but I think \n     there are none who contribute more than our clerical staff, \n     and I thank them for the great work they do.\n       I want to say a special word about my personal secretary, \n     Mary Shoemaker, who has been of great help to me and I thank \n     her for that.\n       You know when you elect a president of the UAW--whether \n     they like it or not--you are electing their family to serve, \n     as well.\n       The family, too, must adjust to the travel and the long \n     hours and the phone calls that can come at any time.\n       They, too, carry the weight of the office.\n       In my own case, my wife, Shirley, has, in essence, worked \n     for this union for many years.\n       Thanks to all of those I have mentioned and many, many more \n     that I have not--it is a remarkable life I have had.\n       It is, I hope, a life that has taught me a thing or two \n     along the way.\n       Brothers and sisters, as I look back across the twelve \n     years you have given me the honor of serving you as president \n     . . . and as I look forward to the future--one thing in \n     particular stands out as strong and clear as the sun on a \n     bright, shiny morning.\n       It is this:\n       When you put the opportunities that are before us, together \n     with the rock solid strengths of this union--I have no doubt \n     that the UAW's future will be even greater than our past.\n       Let me speak, for a moment, of the nature of our times and \n     the opportunities they create.\n       As many of you have heard me say before, a new economic \n     order has upset boundaries and assumptions that guided our \n     society for many decades.\n       Corporate globalization . . . new technology . . . the end \n     of the cold war . . . and the relentless commercialization of \n     our values are pulling and tugging with great force at our \n     social fabric.\n       As a result, fear and frustration are being expressed from \n     many points on the compass.\n       We hear it in the bitterness of the debate over affirmative \n     action and immigration.\n       We felt it in the explosion in Oklahoma City.\n       It is part and parcel of the coast-to-coast angry talk show \n     voices that denounce the legitimacy of our government . . . \n     day . . . after . . . day . . . after . . . day.\n       By the way, as First Lady Hillary Clinton suggested back in \n     Michigan recently--aren't any of those people ever in a good \n     mood?\n       Not that I can tell.\n       As I have said, it's obvious that many people react to \n     political, social and economic change with fear and \n     uncertainty.\n       I, however, see something very different.\n       I see a time of hope and opportunity.\n       Why is that?\n       What do I see that others don't?\n       I see the drive that inspires men and women to band \n     together for justice, as we in the trade union movement have \n     done.\n       My friends, I have spent all of my adult life in this \n     union.\n       And believe you me, I know first-hand that life for our \n     members now is better than it was when I joined the UAW . . . \n     forty-seven years ago.\n       Much better.\n       Brothers and sisters, a lifetime spent in the UAW does not \n     make one fearful of change.\n       To the contrary, a lifetime in the UAW makes one aware of \n     the desire and the ability of working people to control their \n     own destiny.\n       A lifetime in the UAW makes one aware of the value of \n     collective action.\n       Call it solidarity . . . call it brotherhood and sisterhood \n     . . . call it what you will--it is what happens when the \n     power of community hooks up with the power of justice.\n       As I said in the video we saw earlier--that is a tradition \n     that I have been proud to uphold.\n       I am proud of what this union did for our members, during \n     very difficult times.\n       When you look back at the 80's and 90's, if there was any \n     kind of insurance . . . any kind of protection . . . any kind \n     of good fortune that a working man or woman could have that \n     delivered more than being a member of the UAW--I cannot think \n     what it might be.\n       The record speaks for itself.\n       No union did better at defending the standard of living of \n     its members. None.\n       In insecure times . . . did we break new ground on job \n     security?\n       Yes, we did.\n       Did we make our workplaces healthier and safer?\n       We sure did.\n       Did we set out to defend the core idea of employer-paid \n     health care that previous UAW generations fought so hard to \n     win?\n       And did that idea come under attack in every single \n     negotiation we entered?\n       You know it did.\n       But you know, too, that UAW members held on to employer-\n     paid health care during a time when millions of workers were \n     losing that benefit.\n       And what about our retirees?\n       Did we take care of those who built this great union?\n       We sure did.\n       And did we uphold the UAW's pioneering tradition, when it \n     came to gaining worker involvement in decisions on sourcing \n     and quality and manufacturing design?\n       Did we break new ground when it comes to education and \n     training, child care services and assistance for workers' \n     personal problems?\n       You know the answer.\n       Add it all up and this whole union has a lot to be proud \n     of.\n       Brothers and sisters, as well as we have done at the \n     collective bargaining table, that is by no means the extent \n     of our accomplishments.\n       Let's look at our impact on politics and legislative \n     issues.\n       A very good place to begin is with the fight that's going \n     on right now to bring fairness to the economics of global \n     trade.\n       I don't know if you noticed or not, but the Wall Street \n     Journal recently paid this union quite a compliment.\n       In a lead editorial, they said, in so many words, that the \n     reason that something is done about trade is because the UAW \n     has made so much noise and created so much pressure on this \n     issue.\n       Well, brothers and sisters, on behalf of the thousands of \n     UAW members who have fought long and hard for fairness from \n     the Japanese, I propose we accept the compliment from the \n     Wall Street Journal with a big round of applause.\n       And while we're at it, let's also give a cheer to President \n     Bill Clinton for standing up to the Wall Street Journal and \n     the rest of the free-trade hypocrites--not to mention the \n     Japanese themselves.\n       It's about time we had a President with the guts to act on \n     this issue.\n       Brothers and sisters, the President is exactly right when \n     he says that one-way trade is not free trade at all.\n       He is taking a lot of heat in this struggle and he deserves \n     our support.\n       It is time for us to, show, again, where we stand.\n       Let us write and call our Senators and House members in \n     support of the President's courageous position on auto trade \n     with the Japanese.\n       Let me go further.\n       It is also important to mobilize now because the President \n     needs our help in fighting the budget-cut atrocities that the \n     Republicans will try to impose on our country's working \n     families in the next one-hundred days.\n       As we approach these battles--let us not surrender to \n     defeatism.\n       I tell you, brothers and sisters: the Republicans are \n     weaker now than they were when Congress convened last \n     January.\n       They do not have a popular mandate to wreck the country and \n     it is our job to make sure they know that.\n       Let me tell you one more thing.\n       It is critical that we line up with President Clinton now \n     for one more reason.\n       The 1996 elections will be here sooner than you can blink \n     an eye.\n       And make no mistake about it--it is Bill Clinton who is \n     standing between us and Phil Gramm . . . or Bob Dole . . . \n     or, God forbid, Pat Buchanan, coming to live in the White \n     House in January of 1997.\n       Need I say more?\n       I don't think so.\n       Turning now to another subject--as we all know, there is a \n     huge gap between the accomplishments of the UAW . . . and how \n     we are perceived.\n     \n[[Page S8569]]\n\n       Generally speaking, unions do not get the credit we deserve \n     for what we contribute to the lives of our members or the \n     well-being of our society.\n       Well, you know what, brothers and sisters--I say the time \n     has come to quit believing what our critics say about us.\n       I say it's time to rely not on what somebody else says, but \n     on what we know.\n       It is time to say--enough--to those who say that the trade \n     union movement is too weak and too small and too old-\n     fashioned to make a difference in today's world.\n       It is time to quit believing the propaganda put out by \n     corporations, politicians and the media who want us to feel \n     powerless and be powerless so that they may be even more \n     powerful.\n       Brothers and sisters, ask yourself this question . . . if \n     we're so damn weak, why have powerful corporations spent \n     hundreds of millions of dollars to create a union-busting \n     industry in this country?\n       And just why do they work so hard to make union organizing \n     so difficult?\n       And have you ever wondered about this: Why does the media \n     write our obituary . . . over and over and over again?\n       Let's really think about this.\n       You don't read story after story about how the Prohibition \n     Party is dead do you?\n       Of course not.\n       That's because the Prohibition party really is dead!\n       They don't have to write their obituary over and over like \n     they do ours.\n       Sometimes I wonder who is it they are trying to convince--\n     themselves, or us?\n       Either way, my friends--it's time to quit believing this \n     baloney about how weak we are.\n       It is time to put our media-induced inferiority complex \n     behind us.\n       It's time for us to stand up to convicted felons and right-\n     wing wackos like G. Gordon Liddy, Rush Limbaugh, and Bo \n     Gritz.\n       There is nothing to be gained by keeping our mouths shut, \n     and our pens in our pockets.\n       Let's start talking back to talk radio and writing more \n     letters to the editor than ever.\n       Let's be clear here about something else.\n       It is not trade unions that are dinosaurs left over from \n     some other age.\n       It's the G. Gordon Liddy's who find themselves in the wrong \n     century and I'm sick and tired of those who try to tell us \n     differently.\n       The truth is the truth.\n       It is trade unions who have proven time and again that we \n     can and do adapt to new circumstances.\n       The UAW was born from the challenges created by the new \n     industrial economy of the 1930's.\n       Since then we've shifted from peace to war and back again.\n       We've been leaders in integrating minorities into our \n     economic, political and social life.\n       We've brought trade unions into new sectors of the economy \n     and new places on the globe.\n       From the Chrysler bailout forward, we helped American \n     industry turn around from its deepest peacetime crisis ever.\n       We've helped Ford and GM and John Deere and lot's of other \n     companies change with the times.\n       And just so there is no confusion in anyone's mind--this \n     entire union remains one-hundred percent solid in supporting \n     the struggle of our members at Caterpillar.\n       They are trying to keep that company from backsliding \n     completely into the nineteenth century.\n       And they have our full support.\n       You know, when you look at it closely, the basic situation \n     now is very much the same as it was sixty years ago when this \n     great union was founded.\n       Now, as then, the questions before us have to do with how \n     to distribute the wealth that dynamic new economic \n     developments have the potential to create.\n       We are a richer country today than we have ever been.\n       Yet more people are poor.\n       We were once a rich country that led the world in the just \n     distribution of wealth.\n       Now, we lead the industrialized world in how unfairly \n     wealth is distributed.\n       That is not just sad. It's dangerous.\n       For if there is one lesson that emerges from the twentieth \n     century, it is this: How fairly wealth is distributed has a \n     great deal to do with how much wealth gets created.\n       We have also demonstrated in the past, that we will commit \n     the financial means to sustain us in long and difficult \n     collective bargaining and organizing campaigns.\n       Speaking of organizing, all across this union, in \n     workplaces large and small, we have demonstrated that we can \n     help workers organize under the most difficult conditions.\n       Not only is that true in our traditional industrial base--\n     it's true in the growing service sector as well.\n       In fact, the UAW is now represented in just about every \n     section of the economy.\n       By way of example, Local 6000, which represents the state \n     employees of Michigan, is now the largest local in the entire \n     UAW.\n       There is another kind of diversity that is also a basic UAW \n     strength.\n       Our union unites whites, blacks, Latinos . . . and men and \n     women, as does no other organization in American life.\n       In a time of media manipulation and hate-mongering--that \n     unity is a mighty weapon in the fight for justice and \n     democracy.\n       In that same spirit, I would also point out that the UAW \n     has a solid and growing core of experienced, dynamic and \n     talented trade union women.\n       The UAW also possesses widely respected technical expertise \n     in its legal; research; health and safety; retired workers, \n     communications; social security; community service; political \n     action and other departments.\n       And speaking of political action--we have a political army \n     of active and retired members that is second to none.\n       Another great strength is the leadership that is nominated \n     to take the reins of this union.\n       They are battle tested. They are smart. They are dedicated \n     and hard-working. They have a clear vision of the future.\n       They are the right leaders, in the right time, at the right \n     place to do what needs to be done.\n       What's more, come next fall, they will have the added \n     advantage of dynamic new leadership in the AFL-CIO.\n       Finally, the most important reason for my confidence in our \n     future is represented right here in this room.\n       It is the membership of this union--the men and women that \n     elected you to be here--that make up our ultimate weapon.\n       It is you, and those like you, in workplaces all over this \n     country who build this union and keep it strong.\n       And it is you for whom I have been proud to work as your \n     president.\n       I welcome, therefore, this opportunity to say thank you for \n     all that you have done for me * * * and all that you have \n     meant to me over the years.\n       No matter how trying the times, I knew that I could always \n     count on you.\n       I knew that with teamwork in the leadership and solidarity \n     in the ranks--I could call on this membership at any time.\n       And I have done so, many times.\n       You have never let me down.\n       You have never let your union down.\n       For that, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n       And on Thursday I will hand over the gavel knowing that \n     this union's future will be even greater than its past.\n       Thank you again for everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8567-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8569-S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I'm sure my colleagues are \naware, this week Washington has been host to the White House Conference \non Small Business. This officially sanctioned conference brings small \nbusinesspeople from all over the country together to make \nrecommendations to the President and the Congress regarding policy \nchanges that are needed to improve the Nation's business climate.\n  In the past, many of the proposals made by the Conference have later \nbeen adopted by both the executive and legislative branches. The \nprocess of bringing together those that our actions affect directly for \ntheir input is a fine example of the kind of communication and \ndemocratic governance that sets our Nation apart.\n  I take the recommendations of the Conference most seriously. Rhode \nIsland is a State of small business. Of the nearly 25,000 firms doing \nbusiness in my State, over 21,000 of those have fewer than 20 \nemployees. Enterprises with less than 20 employees account for more \nthan 50 percent of the payroll expenditures in our State each year.\n  Clearly, then, what helps small business helps Rhode Island. One of \nthe most important themes Rhode Island's delegation has sounded \nthroughout the Conference and the preliminary activities associated \nwith its is the extraordinary role the Small Business Administration \n[SBA] has played in our State.\n  As my colleagues will recall, Rhode Island suffered a double-whammy \nin the early 1990's. We had the same recession experienced by the rest \nof the Nation--but it was quite a bit worse in our manufacturing State. \nOn top of that recession, we also had a private deposit insurance \ncollapse that led to the closing of many of our credit unions, the \nlender of choice for many of our small businesses. The net result was \nan economic downturn compounded by a credit crunch of considerable \nproportions.\n  It was at this point that our Providence SBA office began to work \nwith our surviving private lenders to establish designated small \nbusiness lending funds that the SBA would consider guaranteeing on a \ncase-by-case basis. This activist, entrepreneurial approach is one \nimportant ingredient in the small business recovery that has occurred. \nLending is up; in 1994 the SBA backed nearly 300 loans in Rhode Island, \nAnd in 1995 expectations are that the agency will guarantee over 500 \nsmall business loans. \n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\n  This rapid expansion is also a function of the Federal Government's \ndecision to use fees to offset the cost of expanding SBA lending \nauthority. It is likely that further reductions in SBA's subsidy rate \nwill be used to preserve the SBA's ability to meet demand at the same \ntime that SBA's cost of doing business are reduced. I applaud this and \nother changes being made at SBA that will allow programs to continue \neven while SBA does its part in reducing the Federal deficit.\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, the SBA is important to Rhode Islanders. I look \nforward to working with the chairman of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Bond, and other small business backers as we work \nour way through this year's appropriations bills and try to preserve \nthe positive contributions of the SBA.\n  As further evidence of Rhode Islanders' strong support for this \nprogram, I ask that a resolution recently approved by the Rhode Island \nGeneral Assembly be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Small Business Administration was created \n     in 1953 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to foster the \n     growth of small entrepreneurs, and\n       Whereas, our Nation's economic prosperity is linked \n     directly to the health of the small business community, and\n       Whereas, the Rhode Island business community is comprised \n     of over 97 percent small businesses, and\n       Whereas, small businesses have grown 49 percent since 1982, \n     they employ 54 percent of the American work force, account \n     for 50 percent of the gross domestic product, and account for \n     71 percent in new job growth in 1993, and\n       Whereas, the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 504 and \n     7(a) financing programs are a public/private partnership that \n     leverages private dollars and allows for continued access to \n     capital for Rhode Island's small business community, and\n       Whereas, SBA's technical resources including the Small \n     Business Development Center at Bryant College and the Service \n     Corps of Retired Executives provide much needed counseling to \n     the Rhode Island small business community, and\n       Whereas, the Rhode Island SBA District Office has approved \n     over 800 loans totaling $168.5 million in guarantee and 504 \n     financing to the Rhode Island small business community from \n     October 1992 to present, and\n       Whereas, this financial assistance has played a vital role \n     in reviving the Rhode Island economy; now be it\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of Rhode \n     Island and Providence Plantations hereby respectfully \n     requests the United States Congress to financially support \n     the U.S. Small Business Administration and its 7(a) and 504 \n     financing programs, as well as its education/training and \n     advocacy programs, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit a duly certified copy of \n     this resolution to the Speaker of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and the President of the United States \n     Senate, and to the Rhode Island Delegation in the Congress of \n     the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/16/senate-section/article/S8569-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8570-S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETI- TION AND DEREGULATION ACT\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 652) entitled the ``Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act,'' as passed by the Senate on June 15, \n1995, is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 652\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to increase competition in \n     all telecommunications markets and provide for an orderly \n     transition from regulated markets to competitive and \n     deregulated telecommunications markets consistent with the \n     public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       This Act is intended to establish a national policy \n     framework designed to accelerate rapidly the private sector \n     deployment of advanced telecommunications and information \n     technologies and services to all Americans by opening all \n     telecommunications markets to competition, and to meet the \n     following goals:\n       (1) To promote and encourage advanced telecommunications \n     networks, capable of enabling users to originate and receive \n     affordable, high-quality voice, data, image, graphic, and \n     video telecommunications services.\n     \n[[Page S8571]]\n\n       (2) To improve international competitiveness markedly.\n       (3) To spur economic growth, create jobs, and increase \n     productivity.\n       (4) To deliver a better quality of life through the \n     preservation and advancement of universal service to allow \n     the more efficient delivery of educational, health care, and \n     other social services.\n\n     SEC. 5. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur \n     innovation and the development of new services. A competitive \n     market place is the most efficient way to lower prices and \n     increase value for consumers. In furthering the principle of \n     open and full competition in all telecommunications markets, \n     however, it must be recognized that some markets are more \n     open than others.\n       (2) Local telephone service is predominantly a monopoly \n     service. Although business customers in metropolitan areas \n     may have alternative providers for exchange access service, \n     consumers do not have a choice of local telephone service. \n     Some States have begun to open local telephone markets to \n     competition. A national policy framework is needed to \n     accelerate the process.\n       (3) Because of their monopoly status, local telephone \n     companies and the Bell operating companies have been \n     prevented from competing in certain markets. It is time to \n     eliminate these restrictions. Nonetheless, transition rules \n     designed to open monopoly markets to competition must be in \n     place before certain restrictions are lifted.\n       (4) Transition rules must be truly transitional, not \n     protectionism for certain industry segments or artificial \n     impediments to increased competition in all markets. Where \n     possible, transition rules should create investment \n     incentives through increased competition. Regulatory \n     safeguards should be adopted only where competitive \n     conditions would not prevent anticompetitive behavior.\n       (5) More competitive American telecommunications markets \n     will promote United States technological advances, domestic \n     job and investment opportunities, national competitiveness, \n     sustained economic development, and improved quality of \n     American life more effectively than regulation.\n       (6) Congress should establish clear statutory guidelines, \n     standards, and time frames to facilitate more effective \n     communications competition and, by so doing, will reduce \n     business and customer uncertainty, lessen regulatory \n     processes, court appeals, and litigation, and thus encourage \n     the business community to focus more on competing in the \n     domestic and international communications marketplace.\n       (7) Where competitive markets are demonstrably inadequate \n     to safeguard important public policy goals, such as the \n     continued universal availability of telecommunications \n     services at reasonable and affordable prices, particularly in \n     rural America, Congress should establish workable regulatory \n     procedures to advance those goals, provided that in any \n     proceeding undertaken to ensure universal availability, \n     regulators shall seek to choose the most procompetitive and \n     least burdensome alternative.\n       (8) Competitive communications markets, safeguarded by \n     effective Federal and State antitrust enforcement, and strong \n     economic growth in the United States which such markets will \n     foster are the most effective means of assuring that all \n     segments of the American public command access to advanced \n     telecommunications technologies.\n       (9) Achieving full and fair competition requires strict \n     parity of marketplace opportunities and responsibilities on \n     the part of incumbent telecommunications service providers as \n     well as new entrants into the telecommunications marketplace, \n     provided that any responsibilities placed on providers should \n     be the minimum required to advance a clearly defined public \n     policy goal.\n       (10) Congress should not cede its constitutional \n     responsibility regarding interstate and foreign commerce in \n     communications to the Judiciary through the establishment of \n     procedures which will encourage or necessitate judicial \n     interpretation or intervention into the communications \n     marketplace.\n       (11) Ensuring that all Americans, regardless of where they \n     may work, live, or visit, ultimately have comparable access \n     to the full benefits of competitive communications markets \n     requires Federal and State authorities to work together \n     affirmatively to minimize and remove unnecessary \n     institutional and regulatory barriers to new entry and \n     competition.\n       (12) Effectively competitive communications markets will \n     ensure customers the widest possible choice of services and \n     equipment, tailored to individual desires and needs, and at \n     prices they are willing to pay.\n       (13) Investment in and deployment of existing and future \n     advanced, multipurpose technologies will best be fostered by \n     minimizing government limitations on the commercial use of \n     those technologies.\n       (14) The efficient development of competitive United States \n     communications markets will be furthered by policies which \n     aim at ensuring reciprocal opening of international \n     investment opportunities.\n\n     SEC. 6.

The \n     Commission may, consistent with this Act (and the amendments \n     made by this Act), modify any provision of the Modification \n     of Final Judgment that it administers.\n       (d) GTE Consent Decree.--This Act shall supersede the \n     provisions of the Final Judgment entered in United States v. \n     GTE Corp., No. 83-1298 (D.C.

BROADCAST REFORM.\n\n       (a) Spectrum Reform.--\n       (1) Advanced television spectrum services.--If the \n     Commission by rule permits licensees to provide advanced \n     television services, then--\n       (A) it shall adopt regulations that allow such licensees to \n     make use of the advanced television spectrum for the \n     transmission of ancillary or supplementary services if the \n     licensees provide without charge to the public at least one \n     advanced television program service as prescribed by the \n     Commission that is intended for and available to the general \n     public on the advanced television spectrum; and\n       (B) it shall apply similar rules to use of existing \n     television spectrum.\n       (2) Commission to collect fees.--To the extent that a \n     television broadcast licensee provides ancillary or \n     supplementary services using existing or advanced television \n     spectrum--\n       (A) for which payment of a subscription fee is required in \n     order to receive such services, or\n       (B) for which the licensee directly or indirectly receives \n     compensation from a third party in return for transmitting \n     material furnished by such third party, other than payments \n     to broadcast stations by third parties for transmission of \n     program material or commercial advertising,\n\n     the Commission may collect from each such licensee an annual \n     fee to the extent the existing or advanced television \n     spectrum is used for such ancillary or supplementary \n     services. In determining the amount of such fees, the \n     Commission shall take into account the portion of the \n     licensee's total existing or advanced television spectrum \n     which is used for such services and the amount of time such \n     services are provided. The amount of such fees to be \n     collected for any such service shall not, in any event, \n     exceed an amount equivalent on an annualized basis to the \n     amount paid by providers of a competing service on spectrum \n     subject to auction under section 309(j) of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)).\n       (3) Public interest requirement.--Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed as relieving a television broadcasting \n     station from its obligation to serve the public interest, \n     convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's review of any \n     application for renewal of a broadcast license for a \n     television station that provides ancillary or supplementary \n     services, the television licensee shall establish that all of \n     its program services on the existing or advanced television \n     spectrum are in the public interest. Any violation of the \n     Commission rules applicable to ancillary or supplementary \n     services shall reflect upon the licensee's qualifications for \n     renewal of its license.\n       (4) Definitions.--As used in this subsection--\n       (A) The term ``advanced television services'' means \n     television services provided using digital or other advanced \n     technology to enhance audio quality and video resolution.\n       (B) The term ``existing'' means spectrum generally in use \n     for television broadcast purposes on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Ownership Reform.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall modify its rules for \n     multiple ownership set forth in 47 CFR 73.3555 by--\n       (A) eliminating the restrictions on the number of \n     television stations owned under subdivisions (e)(1) (ii) and \n     (iii); and\n       (B) changing the percentage set forth in subdivision \n     (e)(2)(ii) from 25 percent to 35 percent.\n       (2) Radio Ownership.--The Commission shall modify its rules \n     set forth in 47 CFR 73.3555 by eliminating any provisions \n     limiting the number of AM or FM broadcast stations which may \n     be owned or controlled by one entity either nationally or in \n     a particular market. The Commission may refuse to approve the \n     transfer or issuance of an AM or FM broadcast license to a \n     particular entity if it finds that the entity would thereby \n     obtain an undue concentration of control or \n\n[[Page S8581]]\n     would thereby harm competition. Nothing in this section shall require \n     or prevent the Commission from modifying its rules contained \n     in 47 CFR 73.3555(c) governing the ownership of both a radio \n     and television broadcast stations in the same market.\n       (3) Local marketing agreement.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to prohibit the continuation or renewal of any \n     television local marketing agreement that is in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act and that is in compliance with \n     the Commission's regulations.\n       (4) Statutory restrictions.--Section 613 (47 U.S.C. 533) is \n     amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) The Commission shall review its ownership rules \n     biennially as part of its regulatory reform review under \n     section 259.''.\n       (5) Conforming changes.--The Commission shall amend its \n     rules to make any changes necessary to reflect the effect of \n     this section on its rules.\n       (6) Effective date.--The Commission shall make the \n     modifications required by paragraphs (1) and (2) effective on \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Term of Licenses.--Section 307(c) (47 U.S.C. 307(c)) is \n     amended by striking the first four sentences and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``No license shall be granted for a term longer than 10 \n     years. Upon application, a renewal of such license may be \n     granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed 10 \n     years, if the Commission finds that the public interest, \n     convenience, and necessity would be served thereby.''.\n       (d) Broadcast License Renewal Procedures.--\n       (1) Section 309 (47 U.S.C. 309) is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following:\n       ``(k)(1)(A) Notwithstanding subsections (c) and (d), if the \n     licensee of a broadcast station submits an application to the \n     Commission for renewal of such license, the Commission shall \n     grant the application if it finds, after notice and \n     opportunity for comment, with respect to that station during \n     the preceding term of its license, that--\n       ``(i) the station has served the public interest, \n     convenience, and necessity;\n       ``(ii) there have been no serious violations by the \n     licensee of this Act or the rules and regulations of the \n     Commission; and\n       ``(iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee \n     of this Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission \n     which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.\n       ``(B) If any licensee of a broadcast station fails to meet \n     the requirements of this subsection, the Commission may deny \n     the application for renewal in accordance with paragraph (2), \n     or grant such application on appropriate terms and \n     conditions, including renewal for a term less than the \n     maximum otherwise permitted.\n       ``(2) If the Commission determines, after notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that a licensee has failed to meet \n     the requirements specified in paragraph (1)(A) and that no \n     mitigating factors justify the imposition of lesser \n     sanctions, the Commission shall--\n       ``(A) issue an order denying the renewal application filed \n     by such licensee under section 308; and\n       ``(B) only thereafter accept and consider such applications \n     for a construction permit as may be filed under section 308 \n     specifying the channel or broadcasting facilities of the \n     former licensee.\n       ``(3) In making the determinations specified in paragraphs \n     (1) or (2)(A), the Commission shall not consider whether the \n     public interest, convenience, and necessity might be served \n     by the grant of a license to a person other than the renewal \n     applicant.''.\n       (2) Section 309(d) (47 U.S.C. 309(d)) is amended by \n     inserting ``(or subsection (k) in the case of renewal of any \n     broadcast station license)'' after ``with subsection (a)'' \n     each place it appears.\n       (3) The amendments made by this subsection apply to \n     applications filed after May 31, 1995.\n       (4) This section shall operate only if the Commission shall \n     amend its ``Application for renewal of License for AM, FM, \n     TV, Translator or LPTV Station'' (FCC Form 303-S) to require \n     that, for commercial TV applicants only, the applicant attach \n     as an exhibit to the application a summary of written \n     comments and suggestions received from the public and \n     maintained by the licensee in accordance with section 73.1202 \n     of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, that comment on the \n     applicant's programming, if any, characterized by the \n     commentor as constituting violent programming.\n\n       Subtitle B--Termination of Modification of Final Judgment\n\n     SEC. 221.

The Commission may not \n     find that provision of alarm monitoring services by a Bell \n     operating company is in the public interest until it finds \n     that it has the capability effectively to enforce any \n     requirements, limitations, or conditions that may be placed \n     upon a Bell operating company in the provision of alarm \n     monitoring services, including the regulations prescribed \n     under subsection (c).\n       ``(c) Regulations Required.--\n       ``(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1995, the Commission shall \n     prescribe regulations--\n       ``(A) to establish such requirements, limitations, or \n     conditions as are--\n       ``(i) necessary and appropriate in the public interest with \n     respect to the provision of alarm monitoring services by Bell \n     operating companies and their affiliates, and\n       ``(ii) effective at such time as a Bell operating company \n     or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is authorized to \n     provide alarm monitoring services; and\n       ``(B) to establish procedures for the receipt and review of \n     complaints concerning violations by such companies of such \n     regulations, or of any other provision of this Act or the \n     regulations thereunder, that result in material financial \n     harm to a provider of alarm monitoring services.\n       ``(2) A Bell operating company, its affiliates, and any \n     local exchange carrier are prohibited from recording or using \n     in any fashion the occurrence or contents of calls received \n     by providers of alarm monitoring services for the purposes of \n     marketing such services on behalf of the Bell operating \n     company, any of its affiliates, the local exchange carrier, \n     or any other entity.

NONAPPLICABILITY OF MODIFICATION OF FINAL JUDGMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of any \n     judicial order, no person shall be subject to the provisions \n     of the Modification of Final Judgment solely by reason of \n     having acquired commercial mobile service or private mobile \n     service assets or operations previously owned by a Bell \n     operating company or an affiliate of a Bell operating \n     company.\n\n                    TITLE III--AN END TO REGULATION\n\n     SEC. 301. TRANSITION TO COMPETITIVE PRICING.\n\n       (a) Pricing Flexibility.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission and the States shall \n     provide to telecommunications carriers price flexibility in \n     the rates charged consumers for the provision of \n     telecommunications services within one year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. The Commission or a State may \n     establish the rate consumers may be charged for services \n     included in the definition of universal service, as well as \n     the contribution, if any, that all carriers must contribute \n     for the preservation and advancement of universal service. \n     Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this section for \n     the purpose of allowing a regulated telecommunications \n     provider to respond to competition by repricing services \n     subject to competition shall not have the effect of using \n     noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services.\n       (2) Consumer protection.--The Commission and the States \n     shall ensure that rates for telephone service remain just, \n     reasonable, and affordable as competition develops for \n     telephone exchange service and telephone exchange access \n     service. Until sufficient competition exists in a market, the \n     Commission or a State may establish the rate that a carrier \n     may charge for any such service if such rate is necessary for \n     the protection of consumers. Any such rate shall cease to be \n     regulated whenever the Commission or a State determines that \n     it is no longer necessary for the protection of consumers. \n     The Commission shall establish cost allocation guidelines for \n     facilities owned by an essential telecommunications carrier \n     that are used for the provision of both services included in \n     the definition of universal service and video programming \n     sold by such carrier directly to subscribers, if such \n     allocation is necessary for the protection of consumers.\n       (3) Rate-of-return regulation eliminated.--\n       (A) In instituting the price flexibility required under \n     paragraph (1) the Commission and the States shall establish \n     alternative forms of regulation for Tier 1 telecommunications \n     carriers that do not include regulation of the rate of return \n     earned by such carrier as part of a plan that provides for \n     any or all of the following--\n       (i) the advancement of competition in the provision of \n     telecommunications services;\n       (ii) improvements in productivity;\n       (iii) improvements in service quality;\n       (iv) measures to ensure customers of non-competitive \n     services do not bear the risks associated with the provision \n     of competitive services;\n       (v) enhanced telecommunications services for educational \n     institutions; or\n       (vi) any other measures Commission or a State, as \n     appropriate, determines to be in the public interest.\n       (B) The Commission or a State, as appropriate, may apply \n     such alternative forms of regulation to any other \n     telecommunications carrier that is subject to rate of return \n     regulation under this Act.\n       (C) Any such alternative form of regulation--\n       (i) shall be consistent with the objectives of preserving \n     and advancing universal service, guaranteeing high quality \n     service, ensuring just, reasonable, and affordable rates, and \n     encouraging economic efficiency; and\n       (ii) shall meet such other criteria as the Commission or a \n     State, as appropriate, finds to be consistent with the public \n     interest, convenience, and necessity.\n       (D) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission, \n     for interstate services, and the States, for intrastate \n     services, from considering the profitability of \n     telecommunications carriers when using alternative forms of \n     regulation other than rate of return regulation (including \n     price regulation and incentive regulation) to ensure that \n     regulated rates are just and reasonable.\n       (b) Transition Plan Required.--If the Commission or a State \n     adopts rules for the distribution of support payments under \n     section 253 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by \n     this Act, such rules shall include a transition plan to allow \n     essential telecommunications carriers to provide for an \n     orderly transition from the universal service support \n     mechanisms in existence upon the date of enactment of this \n     Act and the support mechanisms established by the Commission \n     and the States under this Act or the Communications Act of \n     1934 as amended by this Act. Any such transition plan shall--\n       (1) provide a phase-in of the price flexibility \n     requirements under subsection (a) for an essential \n     telecommunications carrier that is also a rural telephone \n     company; and\n       (2) require the United States Government and the States, \n     where permitted by law, to modify any regulatory requirements \n     (including conditions for the repayment of loans and the \n     depreciation of assets) applicable to carriers designated as \n     essential telecommunications carriers in order to more \n     accurately reflect the conditions that would be imposed in a \n     competitive market for similar assets or services.\n       (c) Duty to Provide Subscriber List Information.--\n       (1) In general.--A carrier that provides local exchange \n     telephone service shall provide subscriber list information \n     gathered in its capacity as a provider of such service on a \n     timely and unbundled basis, under nondiscriminatory and \n     reasonable rates, terms, and conditions, to any person \n     requesting such information for the purpose of publishing \n     directories in any format.\n       (2) Subscriber list information defined.--As used in this \n     subsection, the term ``subscriber list information'' means \n     any information--\n       (A) identifying the listed names of subscribers of a \n     carrier and such subscribers' listed telephone numbers, \n     addresses, or primary advertising classifications, as such \n     classifications are assigned at the time of the establishment \n     of service, or any combination of such names, numbers, \n     addresses, or classifications; and\n       (B) that the carrier or an affiliate has published, caused \n     to be published, or accepted for publication in a directory \n     in any format.\n       (d) Confidentiality.--A telecommunications carrier has a \n     duty to protect the confidentiality of proprietary \n     information of, and relating to, other common carriers and \n     customers, including common carriers reselling the \n     telecommunications services provided by a telecommunications \n     carrier. A telecommunications carrier that receives such \n     information from another carrier for purposes of \n     provisioning, billing, or facilitating the resale of its \n     service shall use such information only for such purpose, and \n     shall not use such information for its own marketing efforts. \n     Nothing in this subsection prohibits a carrier from using \n     customer information obtained from its customers, either \n     directly or indirectly through its agents--\n       (1) to provide, market, or bill for its services; or\n       (2) to perform credit evaluations on existing or potential \n     customers.\n       (e) Regulatory Relief.--\n       (1) Streamlined procedures for changes in charges, \n     classifications, regulations, or practices.--\n       (A) Section 204(a) (47 U.S.C. 204(a)) is amended--\n       (i) by striking ``12 months'' the first place it appears in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and inserting ``5 months'';\n       (ii) by striking ``effective,'' and all that follows in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and inserting ``effective.''; and\n       (iii) by adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission \n     a new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or \n     practice on a streamlined basis. Any such charge, \n     classification, regulation, or practice shall be deemed \n     lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in the case of a \n     reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase in \n     rates) after the date on which it is filed with the \n     Commission unless the Commission takes action under paragraph \n     (1) before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is \n     appropriate.''.\n       (B) Section 208(b) (47 U.S.C. 208(b)) is amended--\n       (i) by striking ``12 months'' the first place it appears in \n     paragraph (1) and inserting ``5 months''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``filed,'' and all that follows in \n     paragraph (1) and inserting ``filed.''.\n       (2) Extensions of lines under section 214; armis reports.--\n     Notwithstanding section 305, the Commission shall permit any \n     local exchange carrier--\n       (A) to be exempt from the requirements of section 214 of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 for the extension of any line; \n     and\n       (B) to file cost allocation manuals and ARMIS reports \n     annually, to the extent such carrier is required to file such \n     manuals or reports.\n       (3) Forebearance authority not limited.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the \n     Commission or a State to waive, modify, or forebear from \n     applying any of the requirements to which reference is made \n     in paragraph (1) under any other provision of this Act or \n     other law.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On average, a child in the United States is exposed to \n     27 hours of television each week and some children are \n     exposed to as much as 11 hours of television each day.\n       (2) The average American child watches 8,000 murders and \n     100,000 acts of other violence on television by the time the \n     child completes elementary school.\n       (3) By the age of 18 years, the average American teenager \n     has watched 200,000 acts of violence on television, including \n     40,000 murders.\n       (4) On several occasions since 1975, The Journal of the \n     American Medical Association has alerted the medical \n     community to the adverse effects of televised violence on \n     child development, including an increase in the level of \n     aggressive behavior and violent behavior among children who \n     view it.\n       (5) The National Commission on Children recommended in 1991 \n     that producers of television programs exercise greater \n     restraint in the content of programming for children.\n       (6) A report of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, \n     dated May 1993, indicates that there is an irrefutable \n     connection between the amount of violence depicted in the \n     television programs watched by children and increased \n     aggressive behavior among children.\n       (7) It is a compelling National interest that parents be \n     empowered with the technology to block the viewing by their \n     children of television programs whose content is overly \n     violent or objectionable for other reasons.\n       (8) Technology currently exists to permit the manufacture \n     of television receivers that are capable of permitting \n     parents to block television programs having violent or \n     otherwise objectionable content.\n\n     SEC. 503. RATING CODE FOR VIOLENCE AND OTHER OBJECTIONABLE \n                   CONTENT ON TELEVISION.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress on Voluntary Establishment of Rating \n     Code.--It is the sense of Congress--\n       (1) to encourage appropriate representatives of the \n     broadcast television industry and the cable television \n     industry to establish in a voluntary manner rules for rating \n     the level of violence or other objectionable content in \n     television programming, including rules for the transmission \n     by television broadcast stations and cable systems of--\n       (A) signals containing ratings of the level of violence or \n     objectionable content in such programming; and\n       (B) signals containing specifications for blocking such \n     programming;\n       (2) to encourage such representatives to establish such \n     rules in consultation with appropriate public interest groups \n     and interested individuals from the private sector; and\n       (3) to encourage television broadcasters and cable \n     operators to comply voluntarily with such rules upon the \n     establishment of such rules.\n       (b) Requirement for Establishment of Rating Code.--\n       (1) In general.--If the representatives of the broadcast \n     television industry and the cable television industry do not \n     establish the rules referred to in subsection (a)(1) by the \n     end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, there shall be established on the day \n     following the end of that period a commission to be known as \n     the Television Rating Commission (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``Television Commission'').

SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration of the Department of Commerce recently \n     submitted to the Congress a report entitled ``U.S. National \n     Spectrum Requirements'' as required by section 113 of the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923);\n       (2) based on the best available information the report \n     concludes that an additional 179 megahertz of spectrum will \n     be needed within the next ten years to meet the expected \n     demand for land mobile and mobile satellite radio services \n     such as cellular telephone service, paging services, personal \n     communication services, and low earth orbiting satellite \n     communications systems;\n       (3) a further 85 megahertz of additional spectrum, for a \n     total of 264 megahertz, is needed if the United States is to \n     fully implement the Intelligent Transportation System \n     currently under development by the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (4) as required by part B of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 921 et seq.) the Federal \n     Government will transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum from \n     exclusive government use to non-governmental or mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use between 1994 and 2004;\n       (5) the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report submitted to \n     Congress under section 113 of the National Telecommunications \n     and Information Administration Organization Act by the \n     National Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     states that, of the 235 megahertz of spectrum identified for \n     reallocation from governmental to non-governmental or mixed \n     use--\n       (A) 50 megahertz has already been reallocated for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (B) 45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use,\n       (C) 25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for exclusive \n     non-governmental use,\n       (D) 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for both \n     exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental and non-\n     governmental use, and\n       (E) the final 45 megahertz will be reallocated for mixed \n     governmental and non-governmental use by 2004;\n       (6) the 165 megahertz of spectrum that are not yet \n     reallocated, combined with 80 megahertz that the Federal \n     Communications Commission is currently holding in reserve for \n     emerging technologies, are less than the best estimates of \n     projected spectrum needs in the United States;\n       (7) the authority of the Federal Communications Commission \n     to assign radio spectrum frequencies using an auction process \n     expires on September 30, 1998;\n       (8) a significant portion of the reallocated spectrum will \n     not yet be assigned to non-governmental users before that \n     authority expires;\n       (9) the transfer of Federal governmental users from certain \n     valuable radio frequencies to other reserved frequencies \n     could be expedited if Federal governmental users are \n     permitted to accept reimbursement for relocation costs from \n     non-governmental users; and\n       (10) non-governmental reimbursement of Federal governmental \n     users relocation costs would allow the market to determine \n     the most efficient use of the available spectrum.\n       (b) Extension and Expansion of Auction Authority.--Section \n     309(j) (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``(1) General authority.--If mutually exclusive \n     applications or requests are accepted for any initial license \n     or construction permit which will involve a use of the \n     electromagnetic spectrum, then the Commission shall grant \n     such license or permit to a qualified applicant through a \n     system of competitive bidding that meets the requirements of \n     this subsection. The competitive bidding authority granted by \n     this subsection shall not apply to licenses or construction \n     permits issued by the Commission for public safety radio \n     services or for licenses or construction permits for new \n     terrestrial digital television services assigned by the \n     Commission to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to \n     replace their current television licenses.'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2) and renumbering paragraphs \n     (3) through (13) as (2) through (12), respectively; and\n       (3) by striking ``1998'' in paragraph (10), as renumbered, \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``2000''.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Federal Relocation Costs.--Section 113 \n     of the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration Act (47 U.S.C. 923) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(f) Relocation of Federal Government Stations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In order to expedite the efficient use \n     of the electromagnetic spectrum and notwithstanding section \n     3302(b) of title 31, United States Code, any Federal entity \n     which operates a Federal Government station may accept \n     reimbursement from any person for the costs incurred by such \n     Federal entity for any modification, replacement, or \n     reissuance of equipment, facilities, operating manuals, \n     regulations, or other expenses incurred by that entity in \n     relocating the operations of its Federal Government station \n     or stations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to \n     any other frequency or frequencies.

RENEWED EFFORTS TO REGULATE VIOLENT PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Violence is a pervasive and persistent feature of the \n     entertainment industry. According to the Carnegie Council on \n     Adolescent Development, by the age of 18, children will have \n     been exposed to nearly 18,000 televised murders and 800 \n     suicides.\n       (2) Violence on television is likely to have a serious and \n     harmful effect on the emotional development of young \n     children. The American Psychological Association has reported \n     that children who watch ``a large number of aggressive \n     programs tend to hold attitudes and values that favor the use \n     of aggression to solve conflicts''. The National Institute of \n     Mental Health has stated similarly that ``violence on \n     television does lead to aggressive behavior by children and \n     teenagers''.\n       (3) The Senate recognizes that television violence is not \n     the sole cause of violence in society.\n       (4) There is a broad recognition in the United States \n     Congress that the television industry has an obligation to \n     police the content of its own broadcasts to children. That \n     understanding was reflected in the Television Violence Act of \n     1990, which was specifically designed to permit industry \n     participants to work together to create a self-monitoring \n     system.\n       (5) After years of denying that television violence has any \n     detrimental effect, the entertainment industry has begun to \n     address the problem of television violence. In the spring of \n     1994, for example, the network and cable industries announced \n     the appointment of an independent monitoring group to assess \n     the amount of violence on television. These reports are due \n     out in the fall of 1995 and winter of 1996, respectively.\n       (6) The Senate recognizes that self-regulation by the \n     private sector is generally preferable to direct regulation \n     by the Federal Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the entertainment industry should do everything possible \n     to limit the amount of violent and aggressive entertainment \n     programming, particularly during the hours when children are \n     most likely to be watching.\n\n     SEC. 703. PREVENTION OF UNFAIR BILLING PRACTICES FOR \n                   INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED OVER TOLL-FREE \n                   TELEPHONE CALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Reforms required by the Telephone Disclosure and \n     Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the reputation \n     of the pay-per-call industry and resulted in regulations that \n     have reduced the incidence of misleading practices that are \n     harmful to the public interest.\n       (2) Among the successful reforms is a restriction on \n     charges being assessed for calls to 800 telephone numbers or \n     other telephone numbers advertised or widely understood to be \n     toll free.\n       (3) Nevertheless, certain interstate pay-per-call \n     businesses are taking advantage of an exception in the \n     restriction on charging for information conveyed during a \n     call to a ``toll-free'' number to continue to engage in \n     misleading practices. These practices are not in compliance \n     with the intent of Congress in passing the Telephone \n     Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act.\n       (4) It is necessary for Congress to clarify that its intent \n     is that charges for information provided during a call to an \n     800 number or other number widely advertised and understood \n     to be toll free shall not be assessed to the calling party \n     unless the calling party agrees to be billed according to the \n     terms of a written subscription agreement or by other \n     appropriate means.\n       (b) Prevention of Unfair Billing Practices.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 228(c) (47 U.S.C. 228(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking out subparagraph (C) of paragraph (7) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(C) the calling party being charged for information \n     conveyed during the call unless--\n       ``(i) the calling party has a written agreement (including \n     an agreement transmitted through electronic medium) that \n     meets the requirements of paragraph (8); or\n       ``(ii) the calling party is charged for the information in \n     accordance with paragraph (9); or''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(8) Subscription agreements for billing for information \n     provided via toll-free calls.--\n       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (7)(C), a \n     written subscription does not meet the requirements of this \n     paragraph unless the agreement specifies the material terms \n     and conditions under which the information is offered and \n     includes--\n       ``(i) the rate at which charges are assessed for the \n     information;\n       ``(ii) the information provider's name;\n       ``(iii) the information provider's business address;\n       ``(iv) the information provider's regular business \n     telephone number;\n       ``(v) the information provider's agreement to notify the \n     subscriber of all future changes in the rates charged for the \n     information;

TELECOMMUTING PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) Telecommuting is the practice of allowing people to \n     work either at home or in nearby centers located closer to \n     home during their normal working hours, substituting \n     telecommunications services, either partially or completely, \n     for transportation to a more traditional workplace;\n       (2) Telecommuting is now practiced by an estimated two to \n     seven million Americans, including individuals with impaired \n     mobility, who are taking advantage of computer and \n     telecommunications advances in recent years;\n       (3) Telecommuting has the potential to dramatically reduce \n     fuel consumption, mobile source air pollution, vehicle miles \n     traveled, and time spent commuting, thus contributing to an \n     improvement in the quality of life for millions of Americans; \n     and\n       (4) It is in the public interest for the Federal Government \n     to collect and disseminate information encouraging the \n     increased use of telecommuting and identifying the potential \n     benefits and costs of telecommuting.\n       (b) Telecommuting Research Programs and Public Information \n     Dissemination.--The Secretary of Transportation, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall, \n     within three months of the date of enactment of this Act, \n     carry out research to identify successful telecommuting \n     programs in the public and private sectors and provide for \n     the dissemination to the public of information regarading--\n       (1) the establishment of successful telecommuting programs; \n     and\n       (2) the benefits and costs of tele- commuting.\n       (c) Report.--Within one year of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to \n     Congress its findings, conclusions, and recommendations \n     regarding telecommuting developed under this section.\n\n     SEC. 706.

FINDING.\n\n       The Congress finds that effective steps for improving the \n     efficiency and proper management of Government operations, \n     including enactment of a new law or laws to require (1) that \n     the Federal rulemaking process include cost/benefit analysis, \n     including analysis of costs resulting from the loss of \n     property rights, and (2) for those Federal regulations that \n     are subject to risk analysis and risk assessment that those \n     regulations undergo standardized risk analysis and risk \n     assessment using the best scientific and economic procedures, \n     will be promoted if a moratorium on new rulemaking actions is \n     imposed and an inventory of such action is conducted.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--Until the end of the moratorium period, a \n     Federal agency may not take any regulatory rulemaking action, \n     unless an exception is provided under section 5. Beginning 30 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     effectiveness of any regulatory rulemaking action taken or \n     made effective during the moratorium period but before the \n     date of the enactment shall be suspended until the end of the \n     moratorium period, unless an exception is provided under \n     section 5.\n       (b) Inventory of Rulemakings.--Not later than 30 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     conduct an inventory and publish in the Federal Register a \n     list of all regulatory rulemaking actions covered by \n     subsection (a) taken or made effective during the moratorium \n     period but before the date of the enactment.\n\n     SEC. 4.
