We thank Thee for their faith in a Creator God, \nthe equality of all humans, and the conviction that the Creator endowed \nHis creatures with inalienable rights which Government was to secure, \nreceiving its authority from the consent of the governed.\n  In a day of instantaneous communication universally, the words and \nactions of national leadership are observed by the people as they are \nbeing said and done--instantly. Not uncommonly, they are misunderstood, \nor seen and heard out of context, which breeds misunderstanding, anger, \nand cynicism.\n  Mighty God, encourage Your servants to recover the vision of our \nfounders, to seek wisdom from the Scriptures, and the guidance of God. \nMay Thy blessing rest upon every person who labors so tirelessly in \nthis vortex of rapid information through press, radio, and television. \nCover their families with Your grace and love and protection, and \nremind them as often as necessary that, though they sought their \noffice, their position has been ordained of God.\n  Gracious Father, thank you for the privilege of serving Your servants \nfor all these years.\n  In the name of Jesus, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3761-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HALVERSON, SENATE CHAPLAIN\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as the Acting President pro tempore noted, \ntoday marks the end of Dr. Richard Halverson's 14 years as Chaplain of \nthe Senate.\n  Some people say that the Senate Chaplain has one of the best jobs in \nWashington. After all, whenever he speaks, all Senators are quiet. And \nthat is a luxury we do not extend to anybody else.\n  I joined with many Senators in saluting Dr. Halverson when he \nannounced his retirement last year. But I wish to take a minute this \nmorning to once again thank Dr. Halverson for his service, his \ndedication, and his friendship. He should also be thanked for his \npatience and for agreeing to stay on for many months while we searched \nfor someone to fill his shoes. And we look forward to Dr. Ogilvie's \nfirst official day as Chaplain on Monday.\n  I know that all Senators join me in wishing Dr. Halverson and his \nwife, Doris, many, many more years of health and happiness.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Dr. Halverson\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in \ncongratulating Dr. Halverson for his 14-plus years of service to the \nU.S. Senate, not only to the Senate as a body but to each and every \nMember of this group of Senators, and also to each and every member of \nthe entire Capitol complex. I have had the pleasure of watching, \nworking with, and worshiping with Dr. Halverson, and in his presence he \nemanates love. He emanates love in his actions, in his words, and by \nhis presence. He has been a mentor to me and countless others, but also \nto our staffs and to the elevator operators and to the interns and to \nthe pages. He has shown his love by his actions, and we have really \nbeen blessed by his presence. For his years of service we are very \ngrateful. Many of us are eternally grateful, and we thank him for that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n              Tribute to the Reverend Richard C. Halverson\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, our Senate Chaplain, Dr. Richard C. \nHalverson, our dear friend, is retiring today and has delivered his \nlast official prayer. He has been a great Chaplain. During his tenure, \nDr. Halverson has proved himself over and over again, not only to be a \ncomforting spiritual guide but also a wonderful friend and adviser to \n[[Page S3762]] the entire Senate family, which includes all of its \nworkers: elevator operators, the police, the pages, the waitresses, the \nwaiters, the electricians. Every conceivable worker has in some way or \nform felt his influence. His ministering support has been helpful to us \nimmeasurably as we wrestled with difficult personal, political, and \npolicy issues.\n  While he is not a Catholic and I am not a Catholic, it seems to me \nthat the Catholic Church has a title that is befitting Dr. Halverson, \nand that is ``Father.'' He is father of the entire Senate family and we \nwant to wish him well.\n  The Chaplain of the Senate is one of its 5 officers, and probably its \nmost visible. Many people around the country watch as he opens the \nSenate's day with a prayer, or introduces the guest Chaplain to conduct \nthe prayer. Dr. Halverson has been superb at arranging for guest \nChaplains, thereby giving wide representation to the many diverse \nreligious denominations in our Nation. As Chaplain, he has provided \npastoral services to Members and our staffs, most of whom are far away \nfrom their own churches and ministers as well as to the entire Senate \nfamily. His soothing countenance and understanding manner have made us \nfeel more at home here in the Senate.\n  Beginning his service on February 2, 1981, the Reverend Dr. Richard \nHalverson is the 60th Senate Chaplain. A native of North Dakota, he is \na graduate of Wheaton College and the Princeton Theological Seminary. \nHe has been awarded honorary doctoral degrees by Wheaton and Gordon \nColleges, and has served churches in Kansas City, MO; Coalinga and \nHollywood, CA; and for 23 years at his last pastorate at the Fourth \nPresbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD.\n  Dr. Halverson has been deeply involved as an associate in the \nInternational Prayer Breakfast movement in Washington, and I have had \nthe personal pleasure of working with him since coming to the Senate. \nHe has been active with this prayer breakfast for almost 40 years. He \nhas served as chairman of the board of World Vision and president of \nConcern Ministries. He has authored several books, including ``A Day at \na Time,'' ``Be Yourself . . . and God's,'' ``Between Sundays,'' ``No \nGreater Power,'' and ``We the People.''\n  He has traveled extensively through his associations with World \nVision, the prayer breakfast movement, and pastors' and leaders' \nconferences in Asia, Australia, South America, Africa, and Europe.\n  Mr. President, Dick Halverson is an outstanding example of why the \nSenate has always had a Chaplain. He has been completely devoted to the \nSenate and we are grateful for his many years of service. We sincerely \nappreciate him, we will miss him, and we wish him and his wonderful \nwife, Doris, all the best as they move on to a well-deserved \nretirement. Dr. Halverson has left his mark on this body, and it will \nnot be the same without him. The Senate is better for having had his \nguidance and wisdom for 14 years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n           Thank You, Dick Halverson, On Behalf Of All Of Us\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Book of Sirach, as I interpret it, \ntells us that from what comes out of our lips we will know what is in \nour hearts. Frankly, I want to say that there can be no doubt what is \nin Dick Halverson's heart. For he has the kindest, most loving words at \nhis lips for everyone, all the time, of anybody I have ever known. He \nhas been a personal spiritual influence on this Senator and many \nothers. And that is not all. The people of this place were all part of \nhis mission. I do not think it should go unnoticed that, instead of \njust Senators saying some kind remarks that he is entitled to, that \nthere are many around the Senate who wish they could be here so they \ncould say thank you.\n  I do not know how to do that, really, on behalf of all of them, but \nat least I will try, and say: Dick, we love you. We think you are one \nof the finest things that ever happened to this place. I hope that I \nspeak for the thousands of non-Senators that you chose to help, of all \nreligions, all creeds, all walks of life. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n              The Example of Chaplain Richard C. Halverson\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, echoing the remarks of my friend from New \nMexico, I think it would truly be a unique hour in the history of the \nSenate if we could let the policemen and the maids and the janitors \ncome up for an hour and talk about Dick Halverson.\n  None of us could express what this whole family of the Senate would \nsay about this wonderful man who is a devoted follower of Jesus and who \nlives that example every day, more so than any person I have ever \nobserved in my life; and whose religion is not only through the spoken \nword, but most of all through example.\n  Benjamin Franklin, who first suggested that sessions of the then-\nContinental Congress be opened with prayer, once said that true human \nhappiness is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that \nseldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day.\n  The Members of the Senate have enjoyed such daily advantages--I would \nnot really call them small--having been blessed over the past 14 years \nby the thoughtful opening prayers of the Chaplain of the Senate, Dr. \nRichard Halverson.\n  In all that time, Dr. Halverson has been a real pastor to the Senate \nas a whole, sharing our long sessions, agonizing with us at times of \ndifficult decisions, and helping us wrestle with the great moral \nconcerns of our Nation. He has been there for each of us from the \nmajority leader to the policemen to the waiters, conscious of the \nspecial pressures of our responsibilities, and of the pressures those \nresponsibilities place on our families. He has brought to his duties a \ndeep compassion and a deep concern for the moral climate of our Nation. \nHe has shared his knowledge of the Scriptures and the thoughts of great \nspiritual leaders through the ages from many faiths, bringing to our \nattention passages from books and poems and his own meditations that he \nthought would be helpful to us as a body, through his prayers and \npastoral letters, and as individuals in a variety of thoughtful ways.\n  Before he came to minister to the Senate, Dr. Halverson ministered to \nPresbyterian congregations from the Midwest to Hollywood to Maryland. \nWe have benefited from his long experience and understanding of human \nfrailty and human needs, and of the capacity of human beings to be \ncompassionate, wise, and courageous as well. A committed follower of \nJesus who lives his beliefs, he has never tried to impose his personal \nbeliefs, but has worked hard to help us live up to ours, and to help us \nfind the wellsprings of moral and ethical action as legislators and \nleaders.\n  I would like to think I speak on behalf, as the Senator from New \nMexico has, of everyone here, the thousands of people in the Senate \nfamily, when we say to Dick Halverson, our friend, our colleague, our \nmentor, our adviser, and most of all our example: Thank you and God \nbless you and your family.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n               Dr. Halverson, Chaplain With An Open Heart\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I do not have a formal statement but I \nadd my best wishes to Dr. Halverson. I am reminded that when Jesus was \non the cross, he forgave a prostitute and a thief. I think there are \nvery few people in the world that have hearts as open and as forgiving \nas Dr. Halverson.\n  Three years ago, in a discussion about crime, Dr. Halverson and I \ndecided to try to bring some gang members to Washington on the day of \nthe National Prayer Breakfast. So the next year we did, and this year \nwas the second time we did that. We brought, as I remember, about 35 \ngang members. These are some pretty tough youngsters, the hoods, they \nare called, Crips and Bloods and Inca Boys and so on. We tried, through \nDr. Halverson's leadership, to take them to the National Cathedral on \nthe day of the Prayer Breakfast, and tried to show them a little \ndifferent way of conducting their lives.\n  I know Dr. Halverson has that same attitude as Jesus himself, that \nthere \n[[Page S3763]] should be forgiveness in all of our hearts. No one is \nlost if you really to try to help them.\n  I certainly wish him good luck. I want him to know that program he \nstarted now will be in its third year. I intend, with the help of my \ncolleagues, to carry that on.\n  My best wishes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        Dr. Halverson, A Brother\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Dr. Halverson is a good example of why we \nshould think twice about term limits. These past 14 years have gone by \nso quickly for those of us who have participated in the Senate Prayer \nBreakfast weekly. I know many are here who have done that, who have \ngone on Wednesday morning. The one thing that really drew us to that \nwas not our participation with our colleagues, but it was the magnet of \nDr. Halverson. We have developed the concept of calling each other \nbrother, and I really and truly feel a sense of being a brother to Dr. \nHalverson.\n  Many of us have come through periods of great strain in our lives \nwhile still serving in the Senate. If there has been one steadying hand \nin this Senate to all of us, it has been Dick Halverson. In terms of \njust the camaraderie that surrounds the breakfast table on Wednesday \nmorning, he always has something to add to really bring a little \nsparkle into life before the breakfast starts. Particularly, I recall, \nas Senator Nunn did, the times when we would go around the table and \nask if anyone knew of any person who was connected with the Senate who \nought to be remembered in our prayers. And, invariably, Reverend \nHalverson would tell us of members of the staff or a member of the \nfamily of a member of the staff or a person who was formerly with the \nSenate, to bring back to us the reality of the world outside of the \nbeltway, outside of, really, the formality of the Senate.\n  I cannot remember the number of times we have conferred about the \nPresidential Prayer Breakfast over the years. I really think one of the \nguiding forces that has kept that great institution going and made it \nso meaningful, as the Senator from Colorado said, to people beyond the \nscope of our lives, is Dick Halverson.\n  I suggested several years ago that we start inviting a representative \nfrom each of the State legislatures to come to the Presidential Prayer \nBreakfast and that has become meaningful, due to the work of Dr. \nHalverson and Doug Coe who, together, have brought so many people into \nthe family of Christ, working together with us here in the Senate \nPrayer Breakfast.\n  We shall miss his leadership, not only here opening the Senate in the \nmorning, but we shall miss his friendship as we pass one another in the \nhall and as he comes by at the lunch table, or as he just takes time to \nvisit with us here on the floor.\n  I have seen Members of the Senate retire, and we have expressed here \non the floor our regret. But this is a retirement that will affect each \nof our lives, I think. We look forward to his successor and developing \na relationship with his successor. But in my life, and particularly in \nterms of my approach to religion as I see it, I shall miss the steady \nhand of Richard Halverson. And I regret deeply that the time has passed \nso fast.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                 The Reverend Dr. Richard C. Halverson\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am really honored to have the \nopportunity to join in an expression of gratitude and tribute and, \nreally, thanks to Chaplain Halverson.\n  His presence has really enriched the 6 years that I have been \nprivileged to be in the U.S. Senate--by the warmth and grace of his \npersonality, by the strength of his faith, and by the profound depth of \nhis humanity and kindliness, the spirit of kindliness which just emits \nfrom him all the time.\n  He also has reminded us, by his daily public words as Chaplain, of \nthe words that are over the door to the Chamber, which are ``In God We \nTrust.'' And he has reminded us, in the words of the Psalmist, that the \nhonor that we have been given here comes from the Lord. With that \nrecognition, I think he has helped us proceed with more of both a sense \nof humility and a sense of purpose than we would otherwise have had.\n  Chaplain Halverson is a true student of both the Old and the New \nTestament. He is a son of both the Old and the New Testament. And I \nthink in his life he has been an exemplar of the values that are \ncontained in the aspirations that are expressed for those of us here in \nhis daily life.\n  So I cannot thank him enough. I cannot tell him how much I hope we \nhave the opportunity to stay in touch. And I can benefit from his \ncounsel and personal warmth and strength.\n  I wish him all of God's blessings with his family in the years ahead.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                 The Reverend Dr. Richard C. Halverson\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to add to the accolades that are being given \nthis morning to a wonderful leader in the U.S. Senate, and they are \nwell deserved.\n  I have been here a short time compared to many of my compatriots who \nare talking today. But when I came the first day, I remember getting an \ninvitation from Reverend Halverson to come to the weekly prayer \nbreakfast that the Senate holds. I must say, when I started going to \nthose, I felt that was the one hour that we had together on a very \nbipartisan basis--Jewish Members, Catholic Members, Baptist Members, \nEpiscopalian Members--all coming together to share a quiet moment in an \notherwise sometimes stormy week.\n  It has made a difference in my service in the Senate, and I cannot \nimagine that we would have been so strong had we not had the leadership \nof Reverend Halverson telling us how very important it was for us to \ncome together in this very bipartisan way to talk about the things that \nbring us together rather than the things that sometimes divide us on \nthis floor.\n  I have heard Members who have been here for years talk about personal \nthings that he has done for members of their staff who were in trouble. \nThe personal testimonies are legion around here about this man.\n  We will all miss him. But we will all remember what a strong leader \nhe has been and how much better off we are for having him among us.\n  So I know all of us wish him Godspeed, but not farewell, because we \nhope that he will be back many times in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                 The Reverend Dr. Richard C. Halverson\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is a long way from Pingree, ND, to the Halls of the \nU.S. Senate. And I would like to just be a part of a book that could be \nwritten about this young man's life.\n  We sort of entered his life when we came here in 1989, and they say \nin every man's life or every person's life there has to be what we call \nin the West, in the corral, a snubbing post--something to latch onto, \nsomething that is permanent, that has value, and those values were \ndrawn from the soils of the High Plains and Northern High Plains of \nthis great country. I guess those sorts of personalities blend, and \nthey grow together.\n  That is what happened when I met Dr. Halverson. Not only does he \nwrite the prayer and give the prayer for this body on a daily basis, \nbut he is counselor to us all in the long hours, and to our staffs. All \nof us have experienced tragedies in our staffs' lives and in our \npersonal lives, and he was there to be a minister.\n  That will not be forgotten by this family and by this man who stands \namong the peers in this body.\n  So we say ``farewell,'' not ``goodbye''--just farewell. We hope that \nhe does not cut us out of his life. We hope he will come by and share \nsome North Dakota stories with us.\n  And we wish him Godspeed.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3761-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3764-S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  [[Page S3764]] I yield the floor.\n               A FOND FAREWELL TO REV. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 1988, when I ran for reelection to the \nHouse of Representatives, I was, shortly after that both surprised and \nalso very privileged to be considered for appointment to fill the \nvacancy created when Senator Dan Quayle was elected to the Vice \nPresidency. I was fortunate enough to receive that appointment to the \nSenate. I then resigned my House seat, and I was appointed to the \nSenate beginning in 1989.\n  I had several thoughts when that decision came down, but one of the \nvery first thoughts that I had was the fact that I would have the \nprivilege of serving in an institution in which Rev. Dick Halverson was \nChaplain. We are fortunate to have been graduates of the same \ninstitution, Wheaton College.\n  I followed Chaplain Halverson's career as minister of the Fourth \nPresbyterian Church and his chaplaincy here in the Senate. So I had an \ninkling of the kind of man he was and deemed it a great privilege to be \nable to come here and serve with him.\n  I have observed few, if any, people that in my opinion better \nexemplify the walk of the Lord and the love of the Lord than Dr. \nHalverson. He has been a great inspiration to me. He is a humble \nservant of God.\n  We see him publicly, and most of the world sees him publicly, giving \nthe opening prayer to the Senate. And those of us who are privileged to \nserve in the Senate see him on Wednesday morning in our Senate prayer \nbreakfast. We have the opportunity to see him on the floor as he \nlistens to our debate. And we know of his work behind the scenes, in \ntotal confidentiality, and his counsel to the Senators.\n  But what most do not see is the work that Dr. Halverson has done \nthroughout the Senate for the Senate family. I think the thing I \nappreciate the most about Dick Halverson is that he sees us as God sees \nus. He sees us all as one. He shows respect to all persons. It is the \nexample of Christ embodied in this man, who has served us so faithfully \nas our Chaplain.\n  We have heard some wonderful tributes here this morning. But I do not \nthink any of the tributes that we can provide could begin to equal the \ntributes that we would hear if the guards and the cooks and the clerks \nand the staff and all those who serve us in the U.S. Senate could come \nto this floor and tell us what Dr. Halverson has meant in their lives. \nThe guard at the door, the cook in the kitchen, the maintenance man \nworking in the basement, and the staffers working in the back offices, \nare just as important to Dr. Halverson's ministry as the Senators who \nspeak on this floor. That is a story that will not really be told and \nwhich most of the world has not heard. But that is the example of a \nChrist-like walk that has meant the most to me.\n  And so, if I could, on behalf of the thousands of people who support \nus so that we can come here and stand in the spotlight, I want to pay \ntribute to Dr. Halverson and all that he has meant in their lives and \nfor all that he has done. I wish he and his dear wife many, many years \nof happiness together, rest, and well-deserved relaxation. I know he \nwill keep us in his thoughts and prayers as he views the Capitol from \nhis apartment and looks over this city that he loves so much and this \ninstitution into which he has poured his life and his love. We will \nmiss you deeply.\n  Your successor, Dr. Ogilvie, is a fine man of God. He has huge shoes \nto fill. God's grace will allow him to do that. But you will be deeply \nmissed. Your legacy lives in our hearts and in the hearts and minds of \nthe thousands of people you have touched during your chaplaincy here, \nand we thank you for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nByrd] is recognized.\n\n\n                      A GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this morning, we heard the Reverend Dr. \nRichard C. Halverson offer his last prayer before the Senate. Dr. \nHalverson has been an inspiration for all of us over these many years, \nthroughout which we have been blessed by his friendship, his \nfellowship, and his pastorship. And we shall miss him.\n  Tennyson's words, ``I am a part of all that I have met,'' applies to \nour association with Dr. Halverson. He has ministered to us and to our \nfamilies. When Erma, my wife, was in the hospital a few years back, he \ncame to the hospital and prayed for Erma, prayed with Erma, prayed with \nme. When I lost my grandson, the oldest of our grandchildren in April \n1982, Dr. Halverson delivered the prayer and the message at the \nmemorial service.\n  His life has touched my life in many ways. He has inspired us with \nhis prayers, with his dedication to the service here, with his \ndedication to this large family of his, with his dedication to his \nspotless Savior, Jesus Christ.\n  As Dr. Halverson goes away, he takes something of us with him, but he \nleaves something of himself with us.\n\n     ``Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer\n     Thought it scarcely worth his while\n     To waste much time on the old violin,\n     But held it up with a smile:\n     ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,\n     ``Who'll start the bidding for me?''\n     A dollar, a dollar''; then, ``Two!'' ``Only two?\n     Two dollars, and who'll make it three?\n     Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;\n     Going for three----'' But no,\n     From the room, far back, a gray-haired man\n     Came forward and picked up the bow;\n     Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,\n     And tightening the loose strings,\n     He played a melody pure and sweet,\n     As a caroling angel sings.\n\n     The music ceased, and the auctioneer,\n     With a voice that was quiet and low,\n     Said: ``What am I bid for the old violin?''\n     And he held it up with the bow.\n     ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?\n     Two thousand! and who'll make it three?\n     Three thousand, once, three thousand, twice,\n     And going, and gone,'' said he.\n     The people cheered, but some of them cried,\n     ``We do not quite understand\n     What changed its worth.'' Swift came the reply:\n     ``The touch of a master's hand.''\n\n     And many a man with life out of tune,\n     And battered and scarred with sin,\n     Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,\n     Much like the old violin.\n     A ``mess of pottage,'' a glass of wine;\n     A game--and he travels on.\n     He is ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,\n     He's ``going'' and almost ``gone.''\n     But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd\n     Never can quite understand\n     The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought\n     By the touch of the Master's hand.\n\n  Dr. Halverson spoke to us often about that Master from Galilee. Dr. \nHalverson was something of a master himself. As he ministered to his \nflock, he gave of himself. And he continued to serve when his body \nsought retirement. His ready smile, his kind voice, his ever-ready hand \nextended in Christian fellowship--all these, we will miss.\n  We live in a very skeptical town. It is full of doubters and skeptics \nand cynics. But Dr. Halverson always represented the solid rock of \nfaith, a steadfast belief in a higher power that has governed the \ndestiny of this Nation from its beginnings.\n  This town, and every other town in America, large and small, needs to \nturn back to the old values that made America great, the old values \nthat Dr. Halverson taught and that he emulated and that he followed in \nhis daily walk with us.\n  Emerson, a great contemporary of Thoreau, said:\n\n       The true test of civilization is, not the census, nor the \n     size of cities, nor the crops--no, but the kind of man the \n     country turns out.\n\n  This country needs to return to the old values that were taught by \nDr. Halverson. The country would turn out better men, and those of us \nwho are already turned out would become better.\n  Since its inception, the Christian movement has rested on the \nfoundation of the personal witness of the individual believer.\n  During his several valuable years among us as the Senate Chaplain, \nDr. Richard C. Halverson has served as a twentieth-century model of \nthat ageless witness--one man, though an ordained clergyman of a \ndistinguished community of believers, moving among us, sharing a love \nthat he borrowed from his relationship with God, shedding light in \ndarkness, drying the tears of ``those who mourn,'' giving hope to the \ndowncast, and, sometimes through his presence alone, reassuring \nthousands--thousands--here on Capitol Hill and, through the electronic \neye, reassuring millions that life--even political life--has eternal \nmeaning. It causes us, \n[[Page S3765]] or ought to cause us, to pause amidst the strife that we \nendure on the political battlefields, pause and be still and know that \n``I am God.''\n There is life beyond the Senate. There is a life beyond a political \nparty. And that there is a life beyond this life.\n\n  I pity--I pity--one who does not believe in immortality. I cannot \ncomprehend a belief that is without God. I cannot comprehend the worth \nof a life on this Earth if there is no assurance of a life beyond the \ngrave, no assurance of immortality, if there is no assurance that I \nwill ever again see, with my tired eyes, my departed grandson.\n  We are daily caught up in the gewgaws of political life, and our \nsocial life. Many of these things are, of course, worthwhile. But there \nwill come a day and a time, if my mind is still clear, when I will look \nforward to crossing that mystic sea to the eternal land where Michael, \nwhere my parents, and the couple who raised me, and the friends of \nyesteryear will be waiting to greet me. It is up to me to be prepared, \nwhen the time arrives, for the narrow gate that leads home.\n  No man is good. I do not pretend to be a religious man. We all have \nour faults and we all fall short of our duty. We are all unworthy. We \nget caught up each day in the little chores and the demands that are \nmade upon us as public servants. It is easy to forget how really tiny \nwe are, how really insignificant we are. I have often thought that I \nwould like to have gone to the Moon, just to be able to look back on \nthis tiny, tiny, tiny speck which we know as our earthly planet, and \nthen try, while looking down from that magnificent orb, to imagine tiny \nman and how insignificant and how small man truly is--less than a \nparticle of dust traveling through this ephemeral life. How vain is \nman! How proud, vainly proud, is mortal man! I sometimes wonder if I am \nnot the vainest, the vainest of men.\n  Even in leaving this work here as our Chaplain, Dr. Halverson has \ncaused Senators today to reflect upon things that are lasting, things \nthat are eternal. Darwin, in his treatise--as he expounds his theory of \nnatural selection and conveys his impressions regarding the selection \nof the fittest as a microscopic organism evolves from virtual \nnothingness--speaks of a Creator. Darwin speaks of a Creator--of God.\n  So it is that through all of the ages, men of all races, in all parts \nof the Earth, have believed in a Higher Power, a creator.\n  Throughout Dr. Halverson's tenure as our Chaplain, he led us to a \ngreater knowledge of, and a closer relationship with, our Creator, and \nmore than once I have benefited from Dr. Halverson's ministry--a \nuniversal ministry not restricted by sectarian or even other-than-\nChristian boundaries. Just as important, however, I have benefited by \nDr. Halverson's personal friendship. That friendship has brightened my \nlife and enriched my work here as a Senator, and for that, I am \ngrateful to him.\n  In the years that lie before Dr. Halverson, I wish him every \nhappiness and every fulfillment that his exemplary spirit and pure \nheart might enjoy. And in that Great Eternal Beyond, I look forward to \ncontinuing the friendship and fellowship that are the promise to all of \nthose whose daily walk is as Dr. Halverson's walk has been among us \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  I think of Dr. Halverson as one who exemplifies the faith of the poor \ncouple who raised me. I think of my own coal miner Dad as one of the \nfew truly great men whom I have met in this life. He had very little \neducation acquired in the halls of learning, but he was a man who owed \nno man a penny when he died. I never heard him use God's name in vain \nin all the years that I lived with him--a humble, hard-working coal \nminer.\n  And the woman who reared me from the day my mother died--I was then 1 \nyear old. The woman who reared me was a woman of great religious \nconviction. Not a religious fanatic--I hold no brief for religious \nfanatics or any other fanatics. She lived a simple, good life. Many \ntimes, when I have driven to West Virginia, arriving at 2 o'clock in \nthe morning, she would open the door, and I would hear her say, \n``Robert, can I fix you something to eat?''\n  And when it came time for me to return to Washington, she would say, \n``Robert, you be a good boy. I always pray for you.''\n  It is that kind of ministry that touches the human heart. And it was \nthat kind of ministry that Dr. Halverson gave to us here.\n  As Dr. Halverson departs our company on this side of the Capitol, I \nsay to Dr. Halverson, ``Well done, well done. You have served us and \nyour country well, and we will never forget you.''\n\n     Last night, I passed beside the blacksmith's door,\n     And heard the anvil ring the vesper chime,\n     And looking in, I saw upon the floor,\n     Old hammers worn with beating years of time.\n     ``How many anvils have you had,'' said I,\n     ``To wear and batter all these hammers so?''\n     ``Only one,'' the blacksmith said, then with twinkling eye,\n     ``The anvil wears the hammers out, you know.''\n     And so the Bible, the anvil of God's word,\n     For centuries, skeptic blows have beat upon,\n     But, though the noise of falling blows was heard,\n     The anvil is unharmed, the hammers gone.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Illinois.\n                 Chaplain Halverson Has Served Us Well\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nwords of praise of Dr. Halverson that Senator Byrd just provided us. I \ncannot do it with the same eloquence. I hate to say it, the few poems I \nmemorized back when I was in grade school and high school I cannot \nrecite now. But I wish I had Senator Byrd's recollections or ability to \nrecall things so vividly.\n  Every once in a while someone says, ``Why do you need a Chaplain in \nthe Senate?'' We go through the same pains and agonies that everyone \nelse does, and we have, in addition, the stress of being here.\n  I hope I never have to go through what the Senator from West Virginia \nhas gone through, seeing a grandchild die. I cannot imagine how tough \nthat must be. But I know having a Chaplain, not just for Members of the \nSenate but for our staffs--Chaplain Halverson was there to help anyone \nassociated with the Senate who had problems, and the same is true of \nChaplain Ford in the House.\n  When I was in the House, I can remember one of my colleagues looked \nas if something was wrong. I sat down next to him. I said, ``Everything \nall right?''\n  He said, ``I just got word that my son committed suicide.''\n  I will never forget it. He needed help, and it is important to each \nof us and important to the Nation that we provide that.\n  I have noticed Chaplain Halverson--yes, he is good to each of us who \nis in the Senate, but I think equally important, he is good to all the \nstaff. I can remember serving in the House with someone who was always \ngood to his colleagues, but he was mean to elevator operators and \nothers. Frankly, I never had any respect for him, even though he was a \nperson of great ability. One of the things I really appreciate about \nChaplain Halverson's service is he was available to everyone. He has \nserved this Senate, he has served all of us very well. I want to \nassociate myself with the remarks of Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n               The Impact of Chaplain Halverson on People\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of my friend from Illinois on the remarkable eloquence of our \nsenior colleague from West Virginia. I was thinking during his remarks \nhow much they will be appreciated in printed form by Chaplain Halverson \nhimself during the course of his retirement. They show a thoughtfulness \nand a sense for history and our culture which is unique with our friend \nfrom West Virginia.\n  One particular set of remarks made by my friend from Illinois were \nparticularly appropriate, I think, and they had to do with the impact \nof Chaplain Halverson on the other people, other than the Members in \nthe Senate.\n  One of the great occasional pleasures I can remember would be to walk \ndown one of the Hallways here or in one of the Senate office buildings \nwith the Chaplain and see how the faces of all we passed, all of the \npeople who serve us and serve this body, would simply \n[[Page S3766]] light up when they saw the face of the Chaplain and how \nhe was never in too much hurry not to stop and have a good word or two \nof greeting for each and every person.\n  He was truly a Chaplain not just for 100 Senators but for all of the \nbroad Senate family and for those in some sudden need who were just \nhere as visitors as well.\n  As he retires and leave us, my own remembrance, my own memory of him \nwill be of a man who comes closer in character to what we read about \nwhen we read about the saints and the great religious leaders in \nhistory, that he partakes of more of those qualities than any other \nindividual whom I have been privileged to know, not just during my \ncareer here but during my life.\n  Chaplain Halverson, at some different time and some different place, \nmight well end up being nominated a saint because his character was and \nremains a saintly character, who brings joy and sustenance and strength \nand peace into the lives of all with whom he associates.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I also thank Senator Dole, the majority leader, for \nhis thoughtfulness in asking Senators to come to the floor today, to \ncome to the Chamber and to be present when Dr. Halverson uttered his \nlast prayer here in the Chamber. I think that was a very good thing to \ndo, and I appreciate very much the majority leader's having done that, \nand told him so when he was here earlier.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3764-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, President Clinton was asked, at his most \nrecent news conference, how he could explain the ethical controversies \nsurrounding his administration--and these are the words of an inquiring \npress--``* * * after [he] came into office promising the most ethical \nadministration in history.''\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss how the President \nreacted to that inquiry at his news conference.\n  First, he responded to allegations about Roger Altman's ethical \ntroubles. President Clinton stated that:\n\n       Roger Altman resigned even though he had violated no law \n     and no rule of ethics.\n\n  There are two problems with that statement. First, Roger Altman \nresigned because bipartisan members of the Senate Banking Committee \nfound that he misled Congress in sworn testimony. I hope that President \nClinton did not mean to suggest that misleading Congress in sworn \ntestimony is ethical.\n  And, second, Altman did not really resign. Several months later, he \nwas still performing functions for the Treasury Department.\n  That is not the commitment to ethics that the President promised the \nAmerican people.\n  President Clinton also mentioned former Agriculture Secretary Mike \nEspy. The President said that Secretary Espy's actions involved ``* * * \na few thousand dollars, all of which he has reimbursed.''\n  I think Secretary Espy made a number of significant contributions as \nAgriculture Secretary. But, once again, I have to take issue with the \nPresident. The purity of the Nation's food supply is vital. Laws have \nbeen on the books for decades to prevent the Agriculture Department \npersonnel from taking any payment that might influence their decisions \nregarding food product safety. And ethics is about the adherence to \nrules. The fact that amounts involved might have been petty may relate \nto appropriate punishments. But it does not relate to or excuse an \nethics violation, if one occurred.\n  The President's comments that Mr. Espy is the only Cabinet Secretary \nto resign based on ethics challenges to actions taken while in office \nis technically true. But this is only because Commerce Secretary Ron \nBrown has not resigned. It is simply not true, as the President has \nrepeatedly said, that the charges relating to Secretary Brown concern \nonly his conduct prior to taking office. Significant ethical issues \narise from the manner in which he reported various financial \ntransactions on his ethics disclosure forms once he assumed office. \nVarious conflicts of interest are alleged to have arisen after he \nbecame Secretary of Commerce as well.\n  I am also concerned that the President seems to think that somehow it \nis a matter of less concern that a person in his administration is \naccused of ethical conduct prior to joining his administration than \nafterward. What does that say about the vetting process that was \nfollowed?\n  Does the President suggest that the ethics of a person he chose for \nhis administration matter only with respect to actions they took while \nin office? Remember, Vice President Agnew resigned because of actions \nhe took prior to assuming that office.\n  I think that it is not asking too much of the President, who promised \nthe toughest ethical standards in history, that his appointees be \nethical in their current positions and that they have records of acting \nethically.\n  However, the President said that we are ``creating a climate here in \nwhich a lot of people will be reluctant to serve.'' Let me make crystal \nclear that, in fact, we are trying to create a climate in which people \nwho are not ethical, including a number this President has appointed, \nare very reluctant to serve.\n  President Clinton also said that under the independent counsel law \ninvestigations cannot be controlled. The President said that if a \ncertain number of Members of Congress ask for an independent counsel, \nthen the prospect of a counsel is triggered. Mr. President, I am \npleased to have supported the independent counsel law over many years \nin times of both Republican and Democrat Presidents. President Clinton \nmade reauthorization of that statute a priority, so he should not \ncomplain about that law.\n  But we should be clear about the terms of the statute. A particular \nnumber of Senators cannot demand that an independent counsel be \nappointed. What Members of Congress can do is force the Attorney \nGeneral to conduct an investigation and to make a decision. But the \ndecision to ask for an independent counsel is the Attorney General's \nalone.\n  For instance, a majority of Republicans on the House Judiciary \nCommittee wrote the Attorney General to ask that an independent counsel \nbe appointed to prosecute Ira Magaziner on the contempt charges arising \nfrom the health care task force litigation that the Justice Department \ndefended. Attorney General Reno conducted an investigation, but she \ndecided not to ask for the appointment of an independent counsel. In \nthe other instances in which an independent counsel was appointed, it \nwas the President's own Attorney General who sought the appointment \nbecause the circumstances warranted it. Members of Congress cannot \nforce an appointment.\n  President Clinton also said that with respect to his administration, \n``You would be hard pressed to cite examples that constitute abuse of \nauthority.'' In fact, it is very easy in regard to the health care \nreform task force. A violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act by \nthe health care task force is one example. Failure to immediately put \nassets in a blind trust, as all other recent Presidents did, while \nthose assets included a fund that shorted health care stocks, is a \nsecond example. A third example is Travelgate; \n[[Page S3767]] that was an abuse of authority. And, of course, there \nare many others.\n  Mr. President, the Olympic games include the high jump. The gold \nmedal is awarded to the person who jumps the highest, not to the person \nwho sets the bar the highest but fails to scale it. President Clinton \nmay honestly believe that his administration has set the ethics bar the \nhighest of any of his predecessors. But that is irrelevant because so \nmany people he has appointed are not clearing that bar.\n  With ethics, it is not the standard that is set but the standard that \nis met that counts. The fact is that this administration is not \npracticing what it preaches in the area of ethics. And that fact is \nunfortunately reducing public trust in Government. When President \nClinton is questioned about the ethical performances of his \nadministration, as he was in a news conference, he should make amends, \nnot excuses. He should make sure that his appointees live up to the \nstandards he believes are so high. Until then, the questions will \ncontinue.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate our \ncolleagues in the House for acting this week to bring our tort system \nunder control. The bill passed by the House earlier this week imposes \nall attorneys fees on a party who turns down a settlement offer if the \nfinal judgment is not more favorable to the offeree than that which he \nturned down. It also would eliminate junk science from the courtroom \nand require courts to sanction attorneys who file frivolous claims.\n  The House action constitutes an important first step toward reforming \nour civil justice system.\n  I also would like to take a few moments to respond to the criticism \nrecently leveled at attempts to reform our tort system.\n  President Clinton and his Attorney General have called the House \nreform bill ``too extreme.'' His counsel Abner Mikva went even further, \nclaiming that the bill would ``tilt the legal playing field \ndramatically to the disadvantage of consumers and middle-class \nAmericans.''\n  Some of our colleagues and the American Trial Lawyer's Association, \none of President Clinton's most generous and loyal contributors, would \nlike this characterization to take hold.\n  Opponents of tort reform would like it if the American people were to \nsee changes in our civil justice system as a boon to big corporations \nand the rich rather than a broad-based set of reforms that will help \nconsumers, victims, and the general public at the expense only of a \nhandful of individuals and lawyers who bring frivolous lawsuits.\n  To hear much of the public debate you would think that tort reform is \na struggle between corporate fat cats who want to injure the public \nwith impunity and legal barracudas who seek only to feed on small \nbusiness and the tort victims who must entrust lawyers with their \nclaims. But this heated rhetoric in my judgment, helps no one, in fact \nit keeps us from focusing on the issue at hand--making our tort system \nmore just and fair.\n  I come to this debate, not to attack lawyers, but to help victims and \nconsumers. I take exception to the charge that tort reform is anti-\nconsumer, particularly given the faults in the system as it stands.\n  Is it really pro-consumer to have a system like the current one in \nwhich those who are injured--consumers of legal services--receive only \n43 cents of every dollar in damages awarded?\n  Is it really pro-consumer to have a system in which, as reported in a \nrecent Conference Board survey, 47 percent of firms withdraw products \nfrom the marketplace, 25 percent discontinue some form of research, and \n8 percent lay off employees, all out of fear of lawsuits?\n  Does it really help consumers and the middle class to have a system \nin which, according to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five \nsmall businesses decides not to introduce a new product, or not to \nimprove an existing one, out of fear of lawsuits?\n  Are we and our children better off when pharmaceutical companies stop \nproducing helpful drugs like the DPT vaccine out of fear of lawsuits?\n  In this last case, that of DPT, two of the three companies making the \nvaccine stopped production in 1985 because they could not afford to \ndeal with all the suits arising from the always highly suspect and now \nclearly disproved theory that it might in very rare instances cause \nbrain damage. To conserve the limited supply remaining the Centers for \nDisease Control recommended that doctors no longer vaccinate children \nover age 1, leading to who knows how many illnesses in small children.\n  Is it really pro-consumer to have a system in which poor, \nunsophisticated clients in particular must hire lawyers, without fully \nknowing how much they will pay or what their options for legal services \nare?\n  Are our communities better off when the parents of Little Leaguers \nare afraid to have their kids play or organize games for fear of being \nsued?\n  Legal reform is in everyone's interest. The tort reform bill Senator \nMcConnell and I have introduced would lower prices, establish a legal \nconsumer's right to know what he or she is purchasing and at what cost, \npromote early settlements, and reduce time and cost to injured parties, \nas well as often innocent defendants.\n  Our bill would curb windfall profits in lawsuits--thus reducing the \nprice ultimately paid for goods by the consumer--by capping punitive \ndamages and eliminating joint and several liability.\n  The bill would empower clients in their dealings with lawyers by \nrequiring that attorneys disclose in writing, to any client with whom \nthey have entered a contingency fee agreement, both the actual services \nperformed and the precise number of hours expended on performing them. \nThe bill also would require lawyers to tell clients that they may pay a \npercentage of their award or, alternatively, pay an hourly fee.\n  Thus we would protect consumers' right to know how much they are \npaying and for what services. We recognize this right to know in all \nother markets and should do so in the legal services market as well.\n  Our bill also would reform contingency fees by providing that, if a \nplaintiff receives a settlement offer and still wants to go to trial, \nthe lawyer would receive the usual contingency percentage only on the \nportion of the award that is above the original offer.\n  Besides preventing lawyer over-reaching, this last contingency fee \nreform also will encourage early settlements, thus saving transaction \ncosts \n[[Page S3768]] for plaintiffs and defendants, and ultimately consumers.\n  Our bill also would allow defendants, by making an early offer, to \nlimit their exposure to certain damages and legal fees.\n  If a potential defendant agrees to pay in full for economic losses \nand the plaintiff accepts the offer there obviously would be no \nlawsuit. Under our bill, should the plaintiff not accept the offer, he \nor she still can sue, but can only recover noneconomic damages if they \nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally acted \nagainst the plaintiff's rights.\n  Besides discouraging lawyers and litigants from unreasonably holding \nout for more money and higher fees unless it clearly is warranted, this \nreform also would discourage defendants and their insurance companies \nfrom dragging out litigation in hopes of making plaintiffs give up \ntheir suits and go away.\n  Promoting early settlements, reducing insurance and legal transaction \ncosts and thus reducing prices and stimulating production and \ninnovation, and protecting the legal consumer's right to know. Those \nare the reforms we seek to institute for the good of all members of the \nAmerican community.\n  Which brings me to my final point. Community is one of President \nClinton's favorite terms. The President even wants a new covenant to \nbind us together as a people. Well I too am a proponent of community. I \nthink it is important for Americans to join together in their homes, in \ntheir churches, and on their neighborhood baseball fields to learn one \nanother's needs, form common habits, and see one another more as \nbrothers and sisters than as strangers.\n  But Americans join together less and less, out of fear that an \naccident on the Little League baseball field will land them in court. \nAccidents happen, we all know that. But in my judgment, if we all spend \nall of our time trying to avoid them, or at any rate avoid paying for \nthem in court, we will not have much time or energy left over to form \nthe bonds of community that hold our society together.\n  Without the bonds formed on our ballfields and in our local civic \nhalls we will lose that sense of our duty to be decent and civil to one \nanother that maintains our civilization.\n  Our current tort system, by turning neighbors into potential \ndefendants and/or plaintiffs, discourages us from coming together, and \nthat is a major reason why I believe it must be changed. We must reform \nthe system to reward the neighborly, who seek to settle disputes \nquickly and so reduce the fear of being sued that hangs over too many \nrelationships in our society today.\n  As we proceed with legal reform in the Senate, I would urge that we \nconsider everyone's needs and interests--victims who should receive \nquick and fair settlements, consumers who should not have to pay higher \nprices or have their product choices and economic opportunity stifled \nby high legal costs, and members of our own communities, whom we should \nnot be tearing apart through explosive rhetoric but rather bringing \ntogether in a spirit of trust and cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a week ago, we finished a debate about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. In that debate, there \nwas a great deal of discussion about the desire of Members of Congress \nto see the Government balance its books and produce a balanced budget.\n  It is interesting to me today, on Friday, that we find a week later \nsome of those who boasted the loudest about wanting to balance the \nFederal budget are now deciding that what we really need to do is to \ncut taxes. In fact, they are just marking up in the other body a $188 \nbillion tax cut bill, which I assume is popular and I assume that in \ntheir polling has shown to be something that the American people would \nfavor. So they decide that the road to fiscal policy health, at least \nfrom their perspective, is to offer the American people a tax cut.\n  Often what is popular is not always right, and that is the case with \na proposed tax cut at this point in our country's history. All of us \nwould like to be able to say to our constituents, we would like lower \ntaxes for you. In fact, if we are signing up, let me sign up for a zero \ntax rate for my constituents.\n  I am sure that most of them would like to not pay any taxes if they \ncan avoid doing so, but they understand the responsibility to do so. \nThey understand the need to keep our streets safe and have a police \ndepartment, to have a Defense Department to keep our country secure, to \npay for education, to pay for the things that make life worthwhile in \nthis country. They understand the need to pay some taxes. They do not \nwant those payments wasted. They want them invested in the future of \nour country.\n  But at a time when we have a significant debt and a very significant \nbudget deficit, for those who bellowed the loudest about changing the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget to 7 \n[[Page S3769]] days later now tell us that their plan really includes \nreducing Federal revenues by $188 billion reminds me a little of \nwatching ponies at the circus, all gussied up, prancing around in a \ncircle, never going anyplace, just showing off.\n  The question is, Are you going to balance the budget or not? You do \nnot balance the budget by cutting this Nation's revenues and increasing \none of the largest accounts, defense spending. That is not an \narithmetic that I learned in a high school class of nine. There might \nbe a new math out there someplace that comes with these new Republicans \nwho have arrived in Washington, but if it is a new math, I do not think \nit adds up.\n  At least from my standpoint, I say to the Contract With America and \nthose who wrote it, I say to the President, I say to others who believe \nthere ought to be a tax cut, you are wrong. Our job is simple. Our job \nis to cut Federal spending and use the savings to cut the Federal \nbudget deficit. That is our job. It is not our job to be weather vanes, \nspinning to the latest moment of public passion and deciding it is \npopular now to be talking about tax cuts. It is our job now to be \ntalking about spending cuts and reducing the budget deficit and putting \nus on a path towards balancing this Federal budget.\n  So again I say the proof is not in what people say, but it is in what \npeople do. Those who now come trudging along with a proposal for a \nmassive tax cut, much of which will go to the wealthiest of Americans, \ndo no service to this country in the search for a balanced budget. I, \nfor one, believe our job is clear. It is not to cut taxes, it is to cut \nspending and use the savings to cut the budget deficit. The sooner we \ndo that in a serious way, the better this country's future will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3768-4", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3769-S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak this morning about \none other issue. In this morning's newspaper, a columnist named \nKrauthammer wrote a column. It was entitled ``Social \nSecurity `Trust Fund' Whopper.'' His column was one of the most \nByzantine pieces of journalism that I have seen in some long while, and \nI have seen a few in my public career.\n  It demonstrates to me that you can be an awfully good writer without \nknowing anything about math or accounting. In fact, when I read this \ncolumn this morning by Mr. Krauthammer, it occurred to me \nthis is a candidate for O.J. Simpson's defense team. Facts and evidence \nseem irrelevant.\n  Let me go through just a bit of this column and talk about some of \nthe conclusions.\n  Mr. Krauthammer's contention is that the Social Security trust fund \nis a ``fiction.'' He says, it is a pay-as-you-go system and he says \nthere, incorrectly, by the way, we are accumulating surpluses in the \ntrust fund today so that ``with so many boomers working today'' that \n``produces a cash surplus.''\n  Mr. Krauthammer, I think, pulled away from the research table a \nlittle too soon; at least his research comes up a little short. The \nsurplus this year in the Social Security trust fund is not because we \nhave so many boomers working and they produce a cash surplus, it is for \na very specific reason. Mr. Krauthammer would know it had he researched \nit or remembered it.\n  In 1983, we passed a Social Security reform bill and in that bill \nmade a specific, conscious decision to increase the FICA tax, in order \nto produce revenues that exceeded expenditures during this period and \nleading up through about the year 2019. We did that deliberately \nbecause we knew we were going to need those revenues later.\n  This is not a surplus that is an accident as a result of more people \nworking. That is not what it is about. This is a deliberate strategy, \nand he could determine that by simply going back and reading the 1983 \nSocial Security Reform Act. I, incidentally, helped write that. I was \non the Ways and Means Committee at the time, so I would know something \nabout that.\n  I would tell him, in future columns, he might want to remember, it is \nnot an accident. It is not how many people are working versus how many \nretired. This was a deliberate strategy embarked on in 1983 to \naccumulate a deliberate pool of national savings in order to meet a \nneed after the baby boomers retire.\n  Mr. Krauthammer says the Social Security trust fund is a fiction. \nWell, the money that is collected from the pay-checks of workers and \nfrom those who employ them in this country is deposited in a trust fund \nthat invests them in Government securities. The trust fund is in the \nsame position as a young boy who just received as a birthday gift a \n$100 U.S. savings bond. Both possess assets, redeemable by the Federal \nGovernment. So the proposition that the trust fund is a ``fiction,'' as \nMr. Krauthammer suggests, demonstrates, in my judgment, a profound lack \nof knowledge.\n  Perhaps the best way to demonstrate the bankruptcy of this argument \nby Mr. Krauthammer would be to use the year 2002, just focus on one \nyear, 2002, when my friends who proposed the balanced budget amendment \nsay the budget would be in balance.\n  Let us take a look at that year only. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, in the year 2002, we will in that one year alone raise \n$111 billion more in Social Security receipts than we need in spending. \nThat surplus, as I have said before, is part of a long-term plan to \nsave for the period when we are going to need the extra money.\n  Now, under the constitutional amendment that was offered, in the year \n2002, the operating budget of the United States would show a zero \nbalance. But, of course, in order to show the zero balance the $111 \nbillion surplus in the Social Security trust fund account would have to \nbe used to get there. Without using the Social Security surplus for \nthat year, the operating budget deficit would not be zero, would not be \nin balance, but would in fact show a deficit of $111 billion.\n  The legislative promise that was made in 1983 was that that $111 \nbillion would be saved in a trust fund to be used later. But, of \ncourse, if it is used to reduce the operating budget deficit, there is \nthen no forced pool of national savings with which to fund the baby \nboomers' retirement later.\n  Now, I would say if Mr. Krauthammer's view, and for other proponents \nI would say, if their view of double-entry bookkeeping is that you can \nuse the same money twice, then I understand the rationale for his \ncolumn this morning, and I understand the rationale for their argument. \nIt is, of course, a fraud, but it is still a column or it is still an \nargument. If, however, he, like most people, understands you can only \nuse money once, it is either here or it is there. It is not both here \nand there. Then the balanced budget achieved by the constitutional \namendment in the year 2002 was not in balance at all. It was $111 \nbillion in deficit.\n  To me at least that looks like Washington as usual. It looks like \nWashington the way it always works, I guess an environment which Mr. \nKrauthammer is part of and comfortable with. But it is still, \nnonetheless, not honest budgeting.\n  Let me use an example probably closer to home. Let us assume a \ncolumnist makes speeches and gets speaking fees, big speaking fees, and \nuses a portion of those speaking fees to put them in a 401(k) to save \nfor later in life.\n  Now, let us assume that after putting money away in a 401(k) from \nspeaking fees, that person goes on a spending binge and spends more \nthan their current income, and simply takes the money out of the 401(k) \nto cover the extra spending that occurred. And I suppose that person \ncould say, well, I spent no more than I had; I spent all my income plus \nall my savings.\n  It is true they spent no more than they had, but it is also true they \ndepleted their savings; they have no 401(k); it is gone. And that is \nthe point.\n  That is the point about the year 2002. And that demonstrates it is \nnot honest budgeting if you promise to save in a trust fund and use it \nto balance the rest of the budget. That is the point Mr. Krauthammer \nmisses, and it is the point others miss.\n  I feel a bit strongly about this, as my colleagues understand, \nbecause I helped write the 1983 Social Security Reform Act when I was a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee. I would not have ever supported \nor cast a vote for that kind of proposition if someone had said to me, \n``let us increase payroll taxes, let us tell the American workers that \nthose moneys will go into a trust fund, let us use that \n[[Page S3770]] trust fund--which comes from a regressive tax--and \ninstead balance the Federal budget deficit.'' I guarantee you that \nwould not have gotten two votes in the Senate or the House. No one, I \nmean no one, here would have had the bad judgment to decide to \nsubstantially increase a payroll tax, promise it will be put in a trust \nfund, and then claim later that it is used to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit. But that is exactly what has happened in the past. It is \nexactly what would have been enshrined in a requirement in the \nconstitutional amendment in the future.\n  I regret that people like Mr. Krauthammer write articles with such a \nprofound lack of understanding about the facts. They have every right \nto do that. But the fact is we have every right to challenge those who \nwrite as carelessly as he did.\n  Mr. President, we have a challenge, all of us, to start doing instead \nof talking. We offered yesterday a proposal for a new budget process. \nIt said let us do this. If we believe, and I do, that we can balance \nthe budget by the year 2002 without using Social Security trust funds, \nand we should, then let us decide on a budget procedure that brings a \npoint of order, a 60-vote majority to overcome, against any budget that \ncomes to this floor without a 7-year plan to get to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. Let us see if people are willing to bite into this \nproblem with real teeth. Let us decide soon whether this is a lot of \ntalk or whether this is honest concern by people involved who are \nwilling to do some heavy lifting.\n  At least in the last 24 hours, the news that the same people who were \ntrumpeting the constitutional amendment for the balanced budget are now \noff deciding that what they want to do is have a very big tax cut, much \nof the benefits to go to the wealthiest Americans, does not seem to me \nthat they are very serious about reaching a balanced budget in this \ncountry's future. I for one think a tax cut proposal in the midst of \nthe kind of deficits and debt we have makes no sense at all. It is the \nultimate in political posturing and the ultimate, in my judgment, \nfailure to be willing to come to grips honestly with the serious \nproblem this country faces.\n  At least speaking for myself, and I hope for others, we should not \nhave a debate anymore about who wants balanced budgets. I do. I am \nwilling to join in any group, in any way, on any day, in a bipartisan \nway to take tough medicine, to cut Federal spending in the right way, \nand to move this country toward a balanced budget. That ought to be the \nobligation of all of us working together in the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, let me say first that I agree with three-\nfourths of what my colleague from North Dakota has just said. First, I \nthink it makes absolutely no sense to be talking about a tax cut now. I \nthink it is just absolutely irrational. It politically makes sense but \nit does not make sense any other way. And so I agree with him.\n  Let me point out one other area where we can save money and do a \ngreat deal of good for the people in our country. That is if we pass a \nminimum wage bill. If we pass a minimum wage bill, we will spend less \nmoney on food stamps; we will spend less money on welfare. That is very \npractical. I do not know the precise numbers, but I saw one figure \nyesterday that we will save approximately $1.8 billion a year if we \npass a minimum wage bill, in terms of a Federal budget. I do not know \nhow thoroughly documented that is.\n  Where I differ slightly from my colleague from North Dakota--I agree \nwith him that we ought to be moving away from reliance on the Social \nSecurity trust fund in balancing the budget, and we came very close to \nan agreement on that--where I do differ is that it seems to me that the \nKrauthammer column is correct in saying the great threat to Social \nSecurity is the debt. Because if we do not change our policies, we will \nend up monetizing the debt, printing money, devaluing our currency. We \nare already seeing some of that. I want to comment on that in just a \nmoment. We are already seeing some of that, just in the days since we \nfailed to pass the balanced budget amendment last Thursday.\n  I am a cosponsor of the bill to move, by legislation, toward a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. There are two problems with that. I \nhope it can have some impact. I, frankly, do not think ultimately it is \ngoing to work, because as soon as the squeeze gets on we simply change \nthe law. That is the reality. There is a second problem with it. \nAssuming that it works. And that is interest by the financial markets \nis composed of two things. One is they want to have a margin of profit. \nThat is always going to be there. The second thing the financial \nmarkets do is they put into interest, a hedge against inflation. So \nevery study, CBO, Data Resources, Inc., Wharton--all of them say if we \npass a balanced budget amendment interest rates will go down. We have \nseen what has happened to interest rates since a week ago Thursday. We \ndid not pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  There will be no similar confidence in the financial markets by any \nstatutory change that we make. So we will be paying a premium on \ninterest for our failure to pass a constitutional amendment. We will \nspend hundreds of billions of dollars, in my opinion--and no one knows \nthis precisely--unnecessarily on interest because of our failure to \npass a balanced budget amendment.\n  Data Resources, Inc., one of the two most prominent econometric \nforecasters in the Nation, predicts that, by the year 2002, if we pass \nit, the prime rate will drop 2.5 percent. Wharton says 4 percent. But \nData Resources, 2.5 percent. They say half the savings that we must get \ncan come from interest savings. That is a very significant savings.\n  Finally--and this is not in relation to the comment of my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, but to what has happened--I notice the international \npublications are very clear in pointing to our failure to pass the \nbalanced budget amendment. Some of the domestic publications are, too, \nthough there is much more focus on Mexico as a reason for the fall of \nthe dollar. The reality is, if we had our fiscal house in order, what \nwe have done by guaranteeing $20 billion in loans to Mexico would be \njust a blip on the horizon. A $20 billion loan guarantee for a country \nwith a $6 trillion economy is not that significant an item. But when \nyou compound it with our failure to pass a balanced budget amendment, \nthen you have a problem.\n  I would like to quote a few items here, if I can find them. \nYesterday's Los Angeles Times lead story, ``Greenspan Asserts Deficit \nSank Dollar. Fed chief says defeat of balanced-budget amendment sent \nwrong signal to global markets. He says Washington must cut deficit to \nease pressure on greenback.''\n  Then let me read the lead story by James Risen.\n\n       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday \n     blamed last week's Senate defeat of the balanced-budget \n     amendment for the sudden plunge in the value of the dollar \n     and pointedly warned Congress that the currency will remain \n     under pressure until Washington tackles the deficit.\n\n  There are a number of stories along the same line. I am not going to \nbother reading all of them at this point.\n  The point is, it is easy for us here to point to Mexico and say that \nis the cause of our problem. The reality of the cause of our problem is \nright here in the U.S. Senate, and we have to face up to that reality. \nThe longer we postpone facing up to that reality, the greater the \njeopardy we put the dollar in and all the ramifications that will have \non the standard of living of our people.\n  I hope we will face up to reality.\n  Mr. President, since I do not believe anyone else seeks the floor \nright now, let me glance through a few of these things here. Here is \nthe Financial Post, from Great Britain, ``The Current U.S. \n[[Page S3771]] Dollar Crisis Was Exacerbated by Congress' Inability To \nGet the Balanced Budget Amendment Passed.''\n  Here is the Independent, also a British publication.\n\n       * * * defeat of the balanced budget amendment only \n     reinforced in foreign eyes Washington's reputation for \n     incurable fiscal profligacy. And most important of all, the \n     tectonic plates of interest rate expectations have abruptly \n     shifted.\n\n  AFX News. I confess I do not know where that is from.\n\n       I think some of the support the dollar got from the \n     election of the Republican Congress has faded with the defeat \n     of the balanced budget.\n\n  Quoting some analyst here.\n  Here, from Singapore, the Straits Times.\n\n       The dollar's fall began last Friday, after Federal Reserve \n     Board member, Mr. Lawrence Lindsay, told reporters that the \n     yen-dollar rate had not reached a ``critical level.''\n       It coincided with the failure of the U.S. Senate to pass a \n     constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget.\n       The failure was seen as a lack of political will by the \n     United States to tackle its twin deficits--budget and trade \n     deficits--widely seen as among the factors contributing to \n     the weak dollar.\n\n  And the stories go on. Here is one from Japan, the Daily Yomiuri.\n\n       The move was accompanied by news that the U.S. Senate voted \n     down an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have \n     forced balancing of the national budget by 2002. This \n     combination caused the mark to soar, followed by the surge of \n     the yen.\n\n  And the stories go on.\n  Clearly we have the ability here to get ahold of this thing. We ought \nto do it for the future of our country. But it is affecting us right \nnow, and I hope in some way we can find one more Member of the U.S. \nSenate who will vote for a constitutional amendment. I think when that \nhappens, if that happens, you will see a reversal. Obviously, I cannot \npredict and guarantee this. But the evidence is pretty overwhelming. \nYou are going to see a reversal of what has happened to the dollar.\n  I hope we do the sensible thing.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3770-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the time is long overdue for the Federal \nGovernment to establish a realistic wage standard for the American \nworker. The real value of the minimum wage has deteriorated markedly \nsince 1979. At its current level of $4.25 per hour, the minimum wage \nwill fall to its lowest real value in 40 years if Congress fails to \ntake action. In the late 1950's the real value of the minimum wage was \nworth more than $5 per hour by today's standards and in the mid-1960's \nit peaked at $6.28. However, because Congress has failed to respond to \ninflation over the last 20 years, the real value of the minimum wage is \nnow 27 percent lower than it was in 1979, and has fallen by almost 50 \ncents since 1991.\n  The decrease in the value of the minimum wage has widened the gulf \nbetween rich and poor, making it even more difficult for hard-working \nfamilies to make ends meet. In 1993, I strongly supported President \nClinton's expansion of the earned income tax credit [EITC] which raised \nthe income of 15 million households--helping many families rise above \nthe poverty line. Today a family of four with one worker working year \nround, full-time at the current minimum wage would earn $8,500 and \nreceive a tax credit of $3,400 for a total annual income of \napproximately $14,700. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates \nthat in 1996 the poverty line for a family of four will be $16,092. \nTherefore, under the current minimum wage, workers can work full-time \nfor an entire year and still fall $1,300 below the poverty line.\n  One of the most common arguments put forth by opponents of the \nminimum wage is that an increase would ultimately rob the economy of \njobs and income. The idea is that by increasing the minimum wage, \nbusinesses will have to pay fewer workers more, resulting in lower \nemployment rates. Recent evidence has indicated that this argument is \nseriously flawed. A 1992 study by Princeton economists David Card and \nAlan Kruger in New Jersey found ``no evidence'' that a rise in New \nJersey's minimum wage reduced employment. In fact, just the opposite \nwas true. Card and Krueger's research indicates that ``the increase in \nthe minimum wage increased employment.'' These findings were echoed by \nNobel Prize winning Economics Professor Robert Solow of MIT when he \nstated, ``The main thing about minimum wage research is that the \nevidence of job loss is weak.''\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the American economy can afford a \nreasonable increase in the minimum wage. In fact, it stands to reason \nthat more money in the pocket of the American workers means that more \nmoney is being spent and purchasing power is increased. As Henry Ford \nso aptly stated, ``If you cut wages, you just cut the number of your \ncustomers.''\n  In debating the economic value of this important policy decision, we \nmust be careful not to overlook what I believe to be the heart of the \nmatter--the American worker. Historically, Congress has acted to ensure \nminimum standards of decency for working Americans. Measures to protect \nworkers from unsafe and unfair working conditions were enacted under \nthe belief that, as a society, we should support a basic standard of \nliving for all Americans. It is in this spirit that minimum wage laws \nhave been updated through the years. It is my strongly held view that \nthese actions appropriately reflect the values and beliefs at the very \ncore of our society--the idea that if you work hard and play by the \nrules, you deserve the opportunity to get ahead.\n  As long as we fail to act, we send the message to working families \nacross the country that hard work and sound living is not enough. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, two-thirds of all minimum \nwage earners are adults who are struggling to achieve a decent standard \nof living for themselves and their families. The objective of the \nminimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of \npoverty and off Government assistance. An hourly rate of $4.25 is not \nenough to cover the average living expenses of a family of four. It is \nunthinkable to me that in what is arguably the wealthiest Nation in the \nworld, there are families out there right now trying to choose between \nbuying groceries for their children or heating their homes.\n  As the Senate prepares to take up the debate on welfare reform, it is \nimportant to note that the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that \nthree out of every five workers earning the minimum wage or below are \nwomen--and the current minimum wage falls significantly short of \nenabling single mothers to achieve self-sufficiency. How can a single \nmother be expected to be able to provide food, clothing, shelter, \nmedical care, and child care on $4.25 an hour? In my view, instead of \nmaintaining barriers to work, we should be helping to tear them down.\n  Mr. President, Americans want to work. They want to be able to \nadequately provide for themselves and their families. But they are \nworking for less and are becoming increasingly frustrated in the \nprocess. It is critical that we recognize the reality of minimum wage \nearners and take steps to help them rise above poverty. President \nRoosevelt once called for ``a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.'' \nThe American worker deserves no less, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting efforts to increase the Federal minimum wage.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3771-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3771-S3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             EPA DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS SHOULD PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my displeasure with \naction taken by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Yesterday, in their markup of regulatory moratorium legislation, on a \nparty-line vote, the Governmental Affairs Committee rejected an \namendment by Senator Glenn to allow long-overdue EPA regulations \nprotecting citizens from parasite contamination in drinking water to \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, just under 2 years ago, my colleagues will perhaps \nremember \n[[Page S3772]] the national headlines delivering the grim news that \ncitizens of Milwaukee were dying as a result of an infestation by the \nparasite cryptosporidium in the city's drinking water. By the time the \nparasite infestation had fully run its course, 104 Milwaukee residents \nhad died, and over 400,000 had suffered from a debilitating illness.\n  What was the cause of the infestation? Government inaction. While we \ncan all talk at length, and with good justification, about examples of \nover-regulation, we must recognize that there are instances in which \nthe Federal Government has not done enough to protect our citizens. Mr. \nPresident, parasite contamination in drinking water is one of those \ncases. The 104 deaths and 400,000 illnesses in Milwaukee are but one \nexample attesting to that fact. In reality, while the Milwaukee \nincident is the largest reported outbreak in U.S. history, it is just \none of many outbreaks nationwide. Other major outbreaks in recent years \ninclude a 1987 cryptosporidium outbreak in Carrollton, GA, that \nsickened 13,000 people, and a 1992 cryptosporidium incident in Jackson \nCounty, OR that caused 15,000 people to become ill. There are numerous \nother examples of parasite contamination nationwide.\n  In reaction to the lack of Federal Government action in this area, \nthe city of Milwaukee has gone ahead with its own efforts to protect \nits residents against water-borne parasites such as cryptosporidium. \nBut other communities are still vulnerable.\n  Mr. President, I support efforts to require a thoughtful cost-benefit \njustification to be made for Federal regulations. I think that that \nmakes eminent sense given the complexity of risks that exist today. But \nI urge my colleagues to exercise some judgment and common sense when it \ncomes to matters as important and as dangerous as parasite \ncontamination in drinking water. We can sit in our towers of \nphilosophical purity and vote party line on matters of general policy, \nbut when it comes to life and death realities for the people of this \nNation, we must use common sense.\n  So again Mr. President, I am upset by the actions of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee yesterday to prevent EPA from moving forward with \nregulations to protect our citizens from parasite contamination in \ndrinking water. It is my hope that when the regulatory moratorium \nlegislation reaches the floor, my friends on the other side of the \naisle will use their good common sense when it comes to clear dangers \nin our drinking water. We should not be voting party line, when lives \nare on the line.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3771-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JESSE LEWIS, JR.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

Lewis & Associates received the 1994 Travel Industry of \nAmerica's Marketing and Promotion Creativity Award in the broadcast/\nradio category for an Alabama Bureau of Tourism commercial. Jesse, Jr. \nwas also nominated for Business Person of the Year last year. He had a \nwide circle of friends crossing racial, economic, and social lines. He \nwas extremely energetic and contributed much of his time to many civic \norganizations, especially those having to do with the city of \nBirmingham. He sat on the board of directors of the Birmingham Urban \nLeague.\n  Jesse Lewis, Jr.'s death at such a young age leaves a great void in \nhis community and the business world of which he was such an integral \npart. He had already accomplished so much professionally, and so much \nmore was confidently expected of him. He truly enjoyed the admiration \nand respect of those who knew him, including his loyal clients.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Jesse's parents, Jesse and Helen \nLewis, and his brother James in the wake of their tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3772-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE WILLIAM HUTCHINS COLE\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN.

Mr. President, a long-time fixture of the Mobile, AL, \narea, Korbet's Restaurant closed in January after serving customers--\nincluding me and some of my staff--at the same location for 45 years. \nThe restaurant on Airport Boulevard was a part of Mobile's Loop area \nbeginning in 1949, when owner Nick Catranis' mother and father-in-law--\nGeorge and Katie Kordomenos--moved there from their Victory Cafe in \ndowntown Mobile. The name for the restaurant came from the first three \nletters of their last name combined with the first three of a partner's \nname.\n  Nick Catranis married Ethel Kordomenos and joined her family's \nbusiness in 1963, managing Korbet's for the next 32 years.\n  Nick issued a letter to his loyal customers in December giving a \nheartfelt description of his family's struggle against changing times \nand the personal sacrifice it took to keep the operation running. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks. It is illustrative of the kinds of difficulties \nmany small companies face in today's increasingly competitive business \nclimate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, it was sad to see Korbet's close. It was \none of the last of a vanishing breed of mom-and-pop businesses that add \nso much flavor and character to a community or neighborhood. I \ncongratulate Nick and Ethel Catranis for bringing so much dining \npleasure to the Mobile area for so many years, and wish them all the \nbest for the future. Korbet's is sorely missed.\n\n                              [Exhibit 1]\n\n\n                                          Korbet's Restaurant,\n\n                                      Mobile, Ala., Dec. 27, 1994.\n       Dear Korbet's Restaurant Customer: Korbet's Restaurant has \n     been a part of many families in the Mobile area since 1949.\n       Mr. and Mrs. George Kordomenos started Korbet's in 1949 \n     when they came to this location from the Victory Cafe in \n     downtown Mobile. Their devotion to their profession, to the \n     community and their desire to succeed \n     [[Page S3773]] made Korbet's Restaurant an institution in \n     Mobile. They created a Mobile tradition for what would be a \n     family gathering place for generations: a place where people \n     proposed marriage and returned year after year to celebrate \n     their anniversary; a place where people celebrated, \n     graduations, retirements and other occasions; a place where \n     families gathered for Thanksgiving and other holidays.\n       In return they accomplished ``the American Dream.'' They \n     helped their relatives back in the country that they left, \n     they educated their children and saw their grandchildren \n     become doctors, businessmen and pharmacists.\n       In 1963, my wife and I came into the family business and \n     worked together with Mom and Dad. Then, in 1968, Dad, Mr. \n     George Kordomenos, passed away and as you all know, Mother, \n     Mrs. Katie Kordomenos, passed away last year.\n       Managing this restaurant for 32 years has taken its toll on \n     me, I have become too wrapped up in my work. I have missed \n     many things in my life such as not seeing my children grow \n     up.\n       On January 14, 1995, Korbet's Restaurant will close its \n     doors and will no longer serve Mobilians.\n       This decision is not a sudden one; it has taken much \n     contemplation, has stirred many emotions, and has been of \n     great consideration for many months. We feel that we have \n     served the community as best as we personally could. As we \n     move out of the restaurant business and diversify, we feel \n     that we will be serving our community in other ways.\n       My belief for success has been that you have to get down in \n     the trenches and work with your employees. That is what I \n     have done and together, we have been successful.\n       However, in recent years the restaurant industry has made \n     many changes; our governing bodies have imposed many new \n     taxes, regulations, and restrictions and so the time has come \n     for us to move on.\n       Turning one's back on a business such as this is hard to \n     do. I am lucky and blessed that I'm able.\n       My wife Ethel, my children, and I want to thank each and \n     every one of you, our customers and fellow workers, for your \n     loyalty throughout the years. We sincerely regret this move.\n       We want to thank our many suppliers who have made our \n     survival possible by providing quality products so we may \n     serve our many customers throughout the years.\n       To all the realtors of Mobile and the many politicians who \n     had their business meetings here and in turn molded and \n     reshaped the city of Mobile--they changed the borders, the \n     subdivisions, the streets, the shopping centers--we thank \n     them and feel that we were a part of all this, too.\n       To the many busboys and busgirls that worked here during \n     their school years: this being their first job in life, and \n     where we tried to instill in them and try to teach them the \n     importance of work in life, and where they have gone and \n     become professionals, good citizens, and raised families. We \n     thank them for their contribution.\n       To the many waitresses, cooks, cashiers, and managers who \n     worked endless, long and hard hours and have raised their \n     families and educated their children: we thank you for your \n     contribution.\n       To our many loyal customers and the many that we have \n     spoiled: nothing could have been possible without your \n     loyalty--we will always cherish your friendship and loyal \n     patronage.\n       And finally, to my wife and children, whom I deprived many \n     things for 32 years by working all day and all night often \n     till 2:00 a.m., thank you for your support.\n       And now Korbet's Restaurant will go down in history as \n     other great family businesses have, such as Hays Davis \n     Packing, Constantines Restaurant, Gulas Restaurant, \n     Metropolitan Restaurant, Government Street Lumber, Wintzell's \n     Restaurant and many others.\n       On behalf of our management and staff, we want our \n     customers to know you will be missed.\n       And so as the world goes around, so must we.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Nick and Ethel Catranis.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3772-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE TO RESPOND TO GULF WAR VETERANS' NEEDS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last month we commemorated the 50th \nanniversary of Iwo Jima. Iwo Jima holds a special place in our national \nconsciousness because of the mythic heroism of those who fought there--\nand because of the ultimate sacrifice made by those who died there.\n  Grateful as we are to the veterans of Iwo, the truth is: Every \nveteran has performed an act of heroism, and every veteran deserves \nthis Nation's support. Not simply our gratitude. But our support, while \nthey are on the battlefield, and after they leave it.\n  This week, during an address to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nPresident Clinton announced a number of initiatives that will provide \nfor some of our newest veterans--the veterans of the gulf war--the \nsupport which they clearly need and deserve.\n  I want to focus in particular on one of those initiatives.\n  The President announced that he is creating a Presidential advisory \ncommittee on gulf war veterans' illnesses. This will be the first fully \nindependent panel to examine the issues surrounding what has come to be \nknown as gulf war syndrome, the chronic medical problems suffered by \nmany gulf war veterans and, in some cases, their spouses and children.\n  There are currently 30 studies being conducted on the gulf war \nsyndrome.\n  The advisory committee will act as a clearinghouse. It will \ncoordinate research efforts into the causes and treatment of gulf war-\nrelated illnesses.\n  It will also conduct aggressive outreach efforts to make sure that \ngulf war veterans and the medical professionals who treat them are kept \nfully informed of any advances.\n  The advisory committee will work with the Departments of Veterans \nAffairs, Defense, and Health and Human Services. And they will report \ndirectly their findings and recommendations directly to the President \nbefore the year is out.\n  America showed 4 years ago during the gulf war what we can accomplish \nwhen we mobilize all our resources to achieve a goal.\n  The veterans of that conflict are now relying on us to marshall our \nresources once again to provide them with the medical care they need \nand deserve.\n  Whether an injury is diagnosed or undiagnosed; whether it was caused \nby a bullet, by some invisible, poisonous gas, or by any other factor, \nit is still a service-related injury, and the man or woman who suffered \nit deserve our support.\n  In the last session I worked with my friend and colleague Senator \nRockefeller to develop legislation that would give VA the authority to \npay compensation to ailing gulf war veterans, even if the exact nature \nof their illness has not yet been diagnosed. Congress passed that \nlegislation because it was the right thing to do.\n  For more than a decade, I fought to gain compensation for veterans \nwhose illnesses were caused by exposure to agent orange in Vietnam. \nThat battle was won eventually, but only after a science proved what \ncommonsense already told us: that there was a clear scientific link \nbetween agent orange and the illnesses.\n  Let us not repeat that mistake.\n  When the men and women who fought in the gulf were called to serve \nthey did not say, ``Let us conduct a study.'' They did their duty.\n  Now a grateful Nation should do its duty.\n  The President's advisory committee will help us perform that duty \nwith the least possible duplication or delay.\n  As a veteran myself, and as a grateful American, I salute the \nPresident's initiative.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3773-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3773-S3774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  MR. PRESSLER. Mr. President, It was just ten months ago when Israeli \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein came before this \nbody--and the world--to make an unprecedented call for peace in the \nMiddle East. This week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher travels \nto Israel in an effort to jump start the peace process and help forge \nan agreement between Israel and Syria over perhaps the most vexing \nissue of the peace process: the status of the Golan Heights. However, \nas the people of Israel know all to well, the road to peace is a long \nand arduous one. Now more than ever, we must bolster our support for \nour greatest ally in the Middle East--Israel--and adopt her mission of \nregional peace as our own.\n  Without a doubt, a peaceful environment of mutual self-determination \nand co-existence in the Middle East is advantageous for the United \nStates. I need not remind this body of the binding political and \ncultural ties that this country maintains with Israel and the great \npotential that an Arab-Israeli peace would have for the United States. \nThe peace process is not solely an opportunity for improved Arab-\nIsraeli affairs, but a unique occasion upon which the United States may \nattempt to ally herself with countries that, in the past, have \nvehemently refused to open their doors to the West.\n  [[Page S3774]] Syria represents perhaps the last great obstacle to \nregional peace. The Syrian mandate for a single, complete Israeli \nwithdrawal from the Golan Heights has resulted in a year and a half \nimpasse in Syria-Israel negotiations. Arbitrary demands for withdrawal \nas a condition of cooperation cannot be viewed as a good faith effort \nto achieve peace. Without a doubt, Israel is correct to insist upon a \ncomprehensive peace agreement with ironclad security arrangements \nbefore it begins any pullback from the strategically vital Golan \nHeights. Israel should not be asked to risk the security of her people \nin return merely for the possibility of better relations with Syria.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that Secretary Christopher's latest \nround of shuttle diplomacy with Israel and Syria results in a renewal \nof the peace process. Clearly, Secretary Christopher needs to convey to \nthe Syrian government that real concessions must be made in order for \nthe Syrians to demonstrate they are serious about peace. The United \nStates cannot agree to turn a blind eye to Syria's drug trade in \nexchange for cooperation in the peace process. Rather, Syria must take \nthe initiative to stop being a safe-haven for terrorists and drug \nlords. That kind of action represents a genuine commitment to the \npeace-making process. Paper pledges and handshakes do not suffice.\n  Some have suggested that the recent peace talks are just cause for \nthe United States to scale back its financial commitments with Israel. \nI disagree. The United States can best support the fragile peace \nprocess by continuing its investment in Israel's economic and military \nstrength. The financial assistance we provide each year is in our \nnational interest. Without it, Israel would be unable to deter \npotential threats and would fall victim to regional extremists. An \neconomically vigorous Israel is the single most important element to \nsustain any peace agreement with her neighbors. For the past forty-six \nyears, we have refused to manipulate Israel by bartering economic \nassistance for political influence. We have continually voted to avoid \njeopardizing Israel's stability, at the bequest of our constituencies \nand our consciences. That course of action has put us on the path to \npeace. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to pursue our present course \nrather than consider options that have the potential of debilitating \nour sole democratic ally in the region during this delicate transition.\n  Eleven years ago, Congress endorsed the relocation of the United \nStates Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem--a symbolic \nrecognition of Jerusalem as the true capital of the State of Israel. It \nis time to call upon the United States government to begin the formal \nprocess of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital city. To be sure, \nthe acknowledgement of Jerusalem as the political center of Israel \nwould not alienate the religious rights of Arabs or Christians. As \nPrime Minister Rabin recently stated before the Knesset, ``[Jerusalem] \nhas been * * * and forever will be the capital of the Jewish people.'' \nBy clarifying our position now, instead of during sensitive ``final \nstatus'' negotiations, the United States would expedite the peace \nprocess. In doing so, we would represent the American people, assist \nour ally, and help preclude any existing false hopes among \nPalestinians.\n  Mr. President, though I no longer sit as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I will continue to monitor closely the events in \nthe Middle East. Very few current foreign policy issues bear greater \nrelevance to this nation than the security of the people of Israel. We \nmust stand side by side with Israel's democratically elected leadership \nin the struggle for lasting peace. As the world's sole superpower, we \nmust be unrelenting in our support of our allies, especially Israel who \nbravely stands alone as the Middle East's sole democracy. It is the \nresponsibility of the United States to foster the peace process, and \nnot to undermine our ally's regional goals during this time of \ntransition. We must work to see the day when the people of Israel can \nturn to all its neighbors in the Middle east and say ``Shalom \nAleichem''--``Peace be with you.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3773-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 889, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n        A bill (H.R. 889) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations and rescissions to preserve and enhance the \n     military readiness for the Department of Defense for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1995, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n       Pending:\n       Bumpers amendment No. 330, to restrict the obligation or \n     expenditate of funds on the NASA/Russian Cooperative MIR \n     program.\n       Kassebaum amendment No. 331 (to committee amendment \n     beginning on page 1, line 3), to limit funding of an \n     Executive order that would prohibit Federal contractors from \n     hiring permanent replacements for striking workers.\n\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending \namendment, which is the Kassebaum amendment.\n  I would like to make one brief point. Later I will probably speak on \nsome other points. But in 1935 when Congress passed the National Labor \nRelations Act, section 13 stated:\n\n       Nothing in this act, except as specifically provided for \n     herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or \n     impede, or in any way diminish, the right to strike, or to \n     affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.\n\n  Then in 1938 in the Mackay radio case, the Supreme Court interpreted \nthat as permitting permanent striker replacement. But that really did \nnot happen in our country to any great extent and has not happened up \nuntil very recently. By tradition, we have worked things out, and we \nhave avoided what most Western industrialized countries have outlawed. \nBut the point I want to make is that in the discussion on the floor of \nthe Senate, it has been assumed that the President's Executive order is \nas sweeping as our proposal last year on prohibiting permanent striker \nreplacement. It is nowhere near as sweeping. It gives no additional \npowers to the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Let me just read two pertinent sections. This is the President's \nExecutive order.\n\n       It is the policy of the Executive Branch in procuring goods \n     and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient \n     administration and completion of Federal Government \n     contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with \n     employers that permanently replace lawfully striking \n     employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be \n     exercised consistent with this policy.\n\n  Then section 4(a):\n  ``When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently \nreplaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may''--no mandate--\n``may debar the contractor thereby making the contractor ineligible to \nreceive government contracts.''\n  It is much more restrictive than the legislation that we had before \nus last year that a majority of the Senate voted for but because of our \nfilibuster rules we were unable to pass.\n  I will hold off saying anything further at this point, Mr. President. \nI will have some further comments before long.\n  I see my colleague, the new Senator from Oklahoma, here. I believe he \nwishes to speak.\n  So I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 331 \noffered by the Senator from Kansas to the committee amendment on page \n1, line 3 of the bill.\n  [[Page S3775]] The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been very disturbed during the \ndebate on the defense supplemental appropriations. I just wanted to \nmake a couple of comments not directly addressing the Kassebaum \namendment but the appropriations itself.\n  I really believe this is one of the few times that I can stand here \nand say I do not know for sure how I am going to vote on this. I am a \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee. When I was in the House \nof Representatives, I was a member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I find that we are in a way endorsing what I refer to as a flawed \nforeign policy when we come up in our forces to have supplemental \nappropriations to pay for various maneuvers and various missions that \nour military has pursued while we clearly disagree with those. As an \nexample, I would suggest that, if the President had come to Congress, \nor to the Senate, and said is it going to cost $17 million to send \ntroops to Rwanda, we probably would say ``no'' and we would not have to \nincur these costs.\n  The same thing would be true in Somalia--recognizing that in Somalia \nwe originally sent them in December, under a previous administration, \nhowever. I think they were sent over for a humanitarian mission not to \nexceed--I believe it was--90 days initially. Then after that, each \nquarter we would have resolutions in order to try to bring the troops \nback home. That ended up costing $17 million.\n  If the President had come to Congress and asked Congress to \nappropriate $312 million to send troops to Bosnia without a well-\ndefined mission there, certainly not having anything to do with our \nNation's events, without having anything to do with our Nation's \nsecurity, I suggest we would have said ``no.''\n The same thing is true; $367 million to Cuba, and then there is Haiti. \nThis appropriation is going to have $595 million to support what nobody \nreally knows we are doing in Haiti. I can assure you, Mr. President, \nthat if the President had come to Congress and said we are going to ask \nyou for $595 million so we can send troops into Haiti to help them with \nproblems they are having, it would have been rejected. So here we come \nalong later and are forced to do it.\n\n  I hesitated in voting against it, Mr. President, because it is not \nthe military's fault. It is not their policy. They did not decide to go \ninto Haiti. It was not their idea to go to Somalia, Bosnia, or Rwanda. \nIf we do not do this, they are going to be forced into taking it out of \ntheir personnel accounts, their operation accounts, R accounts. And \nthere are no spare dollars right now in any of those accounts. In fact, \nwe are operating under a budget in this fiscal year that is comparable \nto the budget we had in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts.\n  So I have sat in these meetings and talked to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Chief of Staff in the various \nservices. I listened to them about the problems they have right now \nwith their budget, in trying to keep America strong. I cannot \nconscientiously say take it out of our R budget just because I \ndisagreed with the missions for which this money is being spent.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted to get on record that I am very disturbed \nwith the system. I hope we can establish some type of a system where \nthose of us who are going to be asked to appropriate the money to pay \nfor these missions will have some voice in making the decisions as to \nwhat we are doing with our armed services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may get back to mundane things that we \ntalk about here, amendments--and it is good, not simply as a tribute to \nthe Chaplain but it is good for us to pull ourselves back and remind \neach other there are things more important than these amendments we \nvote on, and we too easily forget.\n  Mr. President, let me comment again on the amendment that is before \nthe Senate. It is very easy to forget we are talking about people, real \npeople who are struggling for a living when we talk about people who go \non strike.\n  I just have been going through some testimony given a couple of years \nago by people who were struggling. I just this morning was with Senator \nKennedy, who held an informal session with a number of people who spoke \non the need for a minimum wage. Two people I remember particularly. One \nis--and I believe I have his name correctly--David Dow, who has two \nchildren, a daughter 2, a son 1. He and his wife went 1 year to \ncollege. Then their first child was coming along so they had to quit.\n  They are struggling on the minimum wage. They cannot afford health \ninsurance. They are paying $75 a month for their student loan, making \nthat payment on the minimum wage. And he just told about the struggle \nhe is going through.\n  These are real people we deal with when we are talking about a \nminimum wage. It is not some theoretical thing.\n  There was a small employer there who said he would like to pay the \nminimum wage if everybody else had to raise their minimum wage so we \nwould all be on the same level.\n  We are talking about--and here they are judgment calls; I recognize \nthat, but we are talking about trying to maintain some sense of balance \nin our society. I think that is what is needed in this area of \npermanent striker replacement. All the other Western industrialized \nnations, with the exception of Great Britain, Singapore, and Hong Kong, \noutlaw permanent striker replacement. Italy, Greece, France, Germany, \nPortugal, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland--I am sure I am \nforgetting a few--Japan, all of them outlaw permanent striker \nreplacement, and they do it for a very solid reason, that there is an \nimbalance. I say this as a former employer who was in business myself. \nThere is an imbalance. Obviously, it is a struggle for a small business \nperson. It was not easy for me in business. But as an employer I am at \nan advantage over somebody who is just struggling to pay a mortgage and \nto get by.\n  And so we had built into our structure certain things that give some \npower to the employees. While we have not outlawed it as a result of \nthe Mackay Radio decision in the Supreme Court of 1938, with only three \nexceptions in large businesses we have exercised self-restraint and \navoided having permanent striker replacements.\n  I think it is important that continue. I have been working with both \nsides in the Caterpillar strike in Illinois. Let me add I have great \nrespect for Don Feits, the chief executive officer of Caterpillar, and \nOwen Biever, the president of the United Automobile Workers.\n  My feelings are, if we just turned this whole thing over to the two \nof them, we would get it worked out. But if at Caterpillar you were to \nhave permanent striker replacements, in a community like Peoria, it \nwould just tear that town apart. It just would not be good. I think \nvirtually everyone recognizes that. While that is a more volatile \nsituation because of the concentration of employees of one company, I \nthink we have to recognize we have to have balance, and that means, \namong other things, labor and management working together more than we \nhave traditionally done. Germany has something they call mitbestimmung \nwhere an officer of the union is on the board of the corporation, but \nwhen that corporation talks about what they might offer to the unions \nin terms of concessions when they go to a contract, that union \nrepresentative absents himself. But that way the unions get a chance to \nunderstand the problems of management and management gets to understand \nthe problems of the unions.\n  It is also important they work together and get together for a cup of \ncoffee, a beer, whatever, and just talk things over informally. Do not \nwait until you get to contract time. But occasionally we have \nsituations that get to the extreme, and I do not think we should let \nthat extreme go to the point of having permanent striker replacements. \nI think that puts things out of kilter. I do not think we should be in \na situation where we want to encourage it.\n  The President's Executive order does one thing and one thing only. It \nsays if we are going to buy supplies, we will not buy them from people \nwho have permanent striker replacements, or at least we have that \noption. That is up to the Secretary of Labor.\n  My hope is that we will not adopt the Kassebaum amendment. My hope \nis, \n[[Page S3776]] frankly, that the President, if that should be part of \nthis bill, even though he needs this emergency supplemental \nappropriation, would veto it and say give me a clean bill on what we \nneed in the Defense Department. I know that postpones things for the \nDefense Department, and I know they would not be happy about it, but \nthe better answer is for us not to accept the Kassebaum amendment and \nto move ahead and maintain this important balance between labor and \nmanagement that we need in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as \nin morning business for no longer than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3774-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have before me at this moment the \nNational Journal's Congressional Daily. It is a report of the \nactivities of Congress on a daily basis, referring to what committees \nare doing both in the House and the Senate and also reporting on the \nexecutive branch of Government. It is one of those documents that many \nof us often refer to as an accurate accounting of the day-to-day \nactivities of the U.S. Congress.\n  I thought it was appropriate to bring before us at this time. A week \nago, we finalized debate and voted on a balanced budget amendment to \nour Constitution. At that time, we failed to get the necessary 67 votes \nby 1 vote. Immediately following that, we saw a precipitous drop in the \nvalue of the dollar on world currency markets, which actually continued \nthrough most of this week, only to be abated by Alan Greenspan coming \nto Capitol Hill and talking to a House committee on the need for \ncongressional action as it relates to deficit reduction. That seemed \nto, at least for a time, level out the decline of the dollar.\n  One of the things that has concerned me--and I see the Senator from \nIllinois on the floor at this moment, who was one of the major leaders \nin the balanced budget amendment issue--and has concerned the Senator \nfrom Illinois for so long is the inability of Congress to manage the \ndeficit. And even though there have been many tries made over the last \nseveral years, it was this inability that brought me, several years \nago, to the conclusion that only a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget would change this scenario.\n  I am not going to speak of the intentions of this President, but I \nwill only say that this President, since he came to office, convinced \nthis Congress that with a major tax increase in what was called a \ndeficit reduction package, that he could reduce the deficit, he could \ncontrol the out-of-control Federal budget.\n  Yet, this year we saw this President bring to the Hill a budget that \nis not reflective of a declining deficit. In fact, most assume that \nthis administration has largely given up on their ability to bring the \ndeficit near balance and that it is now moving up again. The reason I \nthought it was appropriate at this moment to mention that is that, in \ntoday's Congressional Daily, it says President Clinton's fiscal 1996 \nbudget would cause the Federal deficit to climb $82 billion higher by \nthe year 2000 than the administration has estimated, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The article goes on to talk about preliminary studies or examinations \nwhich show that, by 2000, the deficit will still be in the $276 \nbillion-and-climbing range.\n  The point I want to make is very simple. Once again, it is clearly \nreflective that this Congress and this President cannot and have not \nbeen able to control the Federal deficit. While this President may have \ntried, it is obvious that, under their own budget figures, whether it \nis lack of an adequate estimate or whether simply a failure to make the \nnecessary cuts, he, too, is missing a Federal budget deficit projection \nin his own budgets by $82 billion.\n  That is a phenomenal amount of money under anyone's estimation and \ncertainly it is by ours. If the budget were out of balance by $82 \nbillion, then I think the Senator from Illinois and I would say, well, \nthat is a major and a good-faith effort. But this is the estimate of a \nbudget that is out of balance by nearly $300 billion, as it will be $82 \nbillion higher.\n  Those are the problems we face that I think so clearly dramatize, day \nafter day, year after year, why we need a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Idaho in \nhis efforts in this area. I would give the President a little more \ncredit than he might in terms of what the President did in 1993. There \nis no question we made some progress on the deficit.\n  But the budget that has been submitted by the administration is \nillustrative of the fact that these things kind of ebb and flow. They \ngo up and down like a roller coaster. Right now, I think the mood in \nCongress, after our lengthy discussion of the constitutional amendment, \nis we want to do something. And I think we may pass some statutory \naction to move us in that direction. I have no confidence, however, \nthat statutory action this time, any more than in the past, is going to \nget us there. Because while today the mood is ``Let's do something \nabout the deficit,'' tomorrow, who knows what the mood will be? And so \nwe will move away from that.\n  So I join my colleague in believing that that is the direction in \nwhich we have to go and one of these days, I believe it will happen.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SIMON. I withdraw my request.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3776-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3776-S3780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I suggest to both of my good friends, \nthe Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Illinois, why do we not \njust quit talking about the balanced budget amendment and get on with \nbalancing the budget?\n  The President has proposed an $83 billion tax cut. Let us vote it \ndown. The Republicans, in their so-called Contract With America, have \nurged that we have something like a $200 billion tax cut. Let us also \nvote that down. Let us get out here and say that we are against any tax \ncuts at this time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, I am not ready to yield just yet.\n  Let us say we are against tax cuts; just vote them both down. This is \nno time to talk about tax cuts while balancing the budget.\n  We are all concerned about budget deficits. We are concerned about \npassing this huge debt on to our children and grandchildren. Let us do \nsomething about it. Let us do it now.\n  We have heard the advertisement on TV, ``Do it here. Do it now.'' Let \nus vote down both proposals for tax cuts.\n  Why do we not consider a tax increase? Let us increase taxes. Surely, \nwe could sit down and, working together, could come up with a \nreasonable tax increase that would be calculated and directed toward \nreducing the deficits.\n  We have operated on a national credit card now for 14 years. During \nthe 12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations, we were on a \nnational credit card binge: Enjoy today, pay later. Let our children \nand grandchildren pay for our profligacy. Live for today.\n  One can only cry so much over spilt milk, and it does not do any good \nafter awhile. So why do we not just get on with balancing the budget? \nLet us help this President. Let us help him to balance the budget. \nFirst of all, vote his $83-billion tax cut down.\n  I have been somewhat critical of the tax cut that the President has \nadvocated. I try to be constructive about it. But I think we also ought \nto be critical of the more-than-$200-billion tax cut \n[[Page S3777]] that is being advocated by our Republican friends. That \nis not going to balance the budget.\n  ``Oh,'' they say, ``we will offset our tax cut. We can find $189 \nbillion to offset it.'' Let us take a look at what they are going to \noffset, first, Mr. President. And then, whatever can be offset, \nwhatever can be reasonably offset, let us apply that to the deficit.\n  Now, the Senator asked me to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nyielding.\n  The Senator asked a question, and the question was: Why not pass a \ntax increase? I suggest to the Senator from West Virginia that we \npassed, under the Clinton budget in 1993, what has been characterized \nas the largest single tax increase in our Nation's history.\n  All too often, we go back and say what a great job the administration \ndid and we have these wonderful reductions in the deficit. I suggest to \nthe Senator from West Virginia that a lot of people out there are \nlearning that that kind of talk is not being very honest.\n  There was an article in Reader's Digest, I believe it was last \nDecember, the name of which was ``Budget Baloney.'' In that article, \nthey said, to let you know how they do things in Washington, a guy who \nhas $5,000 who wants a $10,000 car, all he does is say, ``Well, I \nreally wanted a $15,000 car, but I settled on a $10,000 car. So I \nreduced the deficit by $5,000.''\n  We played games for so long that I think we have an awareness and an \nunderstanding by the public out there that they did not have in years \npast.\n  I can recall one of your very good friends that you served with, \nSenator Carl Curtis of Nebraska, way back in 1972 was trying so hard to \nconvince the American people that we could not continue on this road of \nincreased deficits. Our deficit in 1972 was $15 billion. I remember \nthis so well, because they tried to get the people of America to \nunderstand how significant the debt was, and they stacked up $1,000 \nbills until they were the height of the Empire State Building to try to \nimpress upon people how significant the debt was. The debt at that \ntime, in 1972, was $240 billion.\n  The first question you asked was, you know, why do we not do \nsomething about it if we want to reduce the deficit? That is a very \nlegitimate question.\n  But I think that we, in the two bodies here in Congress, have \ndemonstrated over the past 40 years that we are incapable of doing it \nwithout having some type of discipline there that we are forced to \nadhere to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contribution.\n  Here we go again, saying that we need some kind of discipline to \nforce us to act.\n  I do not know when we are going to stop breaking the mirror in the \nAlice in Wonderland story.\n  The Senator says we passed--we passed in 1993--the greatest tax \nincrease. No, ``we'' did not pass it. Not a Senator on that side of the \naisle voted for that tax increase. Not a Senator. Not a House Member on \nthe Republican side of the aisle voted for that tax increase. Moreover, \nnot one Republican on the Senator's side of the aisle or in the House \non the Republican side voted for that same 1993 legislation, which, \noverall, reduced the budget deficits by somewhere between $450 billion \nto $500 billion. And it really has done better than that. The deficit \nhas decreased 3 consecutive years in a row.\n  The Senator does not want to vote for a tax increase, but the \nSenator's party is advocating a tax cut of over $200 billion.\n  Now, who can possibly stand with a straight face and say, ``Let's cut \nthe deficit,'' and, at the same time, come in here day after day and \ntalk about the President and how he has failed to cut the deficit, how \nthe President has failed to exemplify leadership, who could do that \nwith a straight face, and then turn around and say, ``Let's cut \ntaxes''?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I will yield in a moment.\n  The Senator's party is the party that is out here advocating cutting \ntaxes louder than anybody else.\n  I think it is folly to cut taxes in this climate. It is folly, \nwhether it is my President advocating it, or whether it is the so-\ncalled Contract With America. It is silly.\n  I cannot look my grandchildren in the eye and say ``Well, I am for \ncutting taxes. I would rather have you live with the problems that we \nleave.'' I cannot say that to my grandchildren. ``I would rather have \nyou live with the problems that we have created in our time. I prefer \nthat you increase taxes in your day and time.''\n  Do not talk to me about cutting taxes. I think that is a bad message.\n  But we say, ``Cut taxes.'' What utter folly! Now, the Senator's party \nis advocating cutting taxes. I do not see how they can do that with a \nstraight face and come here on this floor, day after day after day and \nmoan and groan and gnash their teeth over the fact that the balanced \nbudget to the Constitution has been voted down. Now they say that that \nis the cause of the drop in the dollar. That is the cause of this, \nthat, everything else.\n  But yet, not a word do they say--not a word--about the $200-plus \nbillion tax cut that is being advocated by the so-called Contract With \nAmerica.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will yield in a moment, Mr. President.\n  Furthermore, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, who says we have \nplayed games, we are playing games. Yes, I was here when we played \ngames during the Reagan administration. Read David Stockman's book, and \nhe will tell the Senator from Oklahoma who played the games down in the \nOval Office. He will tell the Senator who played the games in the \nReagan administration with hidden asterisks.\n  I urge all Senators to read David Stockman's book. As a matter of \nfact, I may bring a portion of it to the floor after a while and read \nit. It is enlightening. Yes, I was here when the Reagan administration \nblew into town. And in all of the 39 previous administrations--182 \nyears of administrations under various political parties--the Nation \nhad accumulated a total debt of less than $1 trillion.\n  I saw Mr. Reagan get on television with that chart, pointing to that \nstack of what he called, would represent a stack of $1,000 bills, \n``Have a stack four inches thick and you will be a millionaire.'' He \nsaid it would take a stack of $1,000 bills 63 miles high to be \nrepresentative of the debt that had been accumulated in all the \nadministrations going back to the year 1789.\n  He never appeared on television with that chart again, Senator. Know \nwhy? Because during his administrations the debt reached to a total of \nover $3 trillion, and then, during the Bush administration, it reached \n$4 trillion. So, to represent that debt on the chart, with $1,000 bills \nstacked into the stratosphere and beyond, would probably require a \nstack of bills that would reach 252 miles into the sky, or some such.\n  I saw the debt triple. I saw it quadruple. Further, may I say to the \ndistinguished Senator, I went down to see Mr. Reagan. I urged him not \nto press for his triple tax cut in 1981. He proposed a 3-year tax cut--\nthe first year 5 percent, the next year 10 percent, and the third year, \n10 percent--all in one passage. I urged him to at least leave off the \nthird year until we could evaluate the economy, the deficit, what was \nhappening to the dollar, interest rates, unemployment. At least, leave \noff the third year and wait 2 years, and then if he felt compelled to \ngo for the third year, then try it. Why go for a 3-year tax cut all at \nonce? He never could tell me why, never. He looked at his little card, \nthe notes on the card, but he never could answer that question.\n  So now we have the aftermath of the Reagan tax cuts of 1981. I voted \nfor his tax cuts. I have always regretted it. My constituents back home \nsaid ``Give the man a chance. Give this new President a chance.'' I \ngave him a chance. I have regretted it ever since. There is blame \nenough to go around, Senator.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has talked about the last 40 years. Do not \ngo back that far. Just go back to the fiscal year 1981 budget. Start \nthere. Start there and see then what happened.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree with two-thirds of what my \ncolleague from West Virginia has to say, and he knows I differ on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I do believe, however, in the immediate choices that we face, one is \na tax \n[[Page S3778]] cut. I think it makes absolutely no sense. When I was in \nthe House I voted against the Reagan tax cut and I voted against the \nDemocratic tax cut. We were in a bidding war, we are in a bidding war \nagain. I am going to vote against the Republican vote, and I am going \nto vote against the Democratic tax cut. I do not think they make any \nsense at all.\n  In terms of tax increases, I think the political reality is we can \nonly pass them if they are for designated purposes. The American \npublic--if we need it for balancing the budget, it is very \ninteresting--53 percent of the American public says they are for \nbalancing the budget, even if it means they have to sacrifice. I think \nthey are willing to face that.\n  In 1990, if I may be immodest, I faced reelection. One of the things \nmy opponent, a very distinguished woman who served in the House, Lynn \nMartin, used against me, is that I said I think we need increases in \nFederal taxes to balance the budget.\n  I can remember reading in Roll Call that I was destined to defeat. I \nended up getting the biggest plurality of any contested Senator of \neither political party running for reelection that year. I think people \nwant to be told the truth.\n  The reality is on tax increases--if we take the 18 Western \nindustrialized countries as a percentage of our income--we pay a lower \npercentage than any of the other countries. We have the lowest tax on \ngasoline of any country outside of Saudi Arabia. We have the lowest tax \non cigarettes. We do not have a value-added tax that many countries \nhave. But I think the reality is we have to tie any kind of revenue \nincrease with something concrete, like a health program. Or like \ngetting rid of the deficit.\n  As my colleague who is presiding, Senator Craig, knows, I have said \nall along that I think we have to combine cuts in spending to achieve a \nbalanced budget with increases in revenue. I think that is the reality.\n  I do believe--and here I differ with my colleague from West \nVirginia--I do believe the only way we are really going to get a \nbalanced budget is with constitutional restraint. I respect the fact \nthat he and I differ on that question. I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. We do not have to wait. We do not have \nto wait for a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. I agree.\n  Mr. BYRD. Putting that aside entirely, I have many reasons for \nopposing the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am not \nagainst amending the Constitution. I have voted for five amendments to \nthe Constitution since I have been in the Senate. Enough of that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. The framers saw a need for amendments at some point in \ntime, so they provided a way to do that in the Constitution itself. But \nI am opposed to amending the Constitution to write fiscal theory into \nit, fiscal policy. I am also opposed to destroying our constitutional \nsystem of mixed powers and checks and balances by a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  I respect those who differ with me, but why do we keep on talking \nabout a constitutional amendment? We Senators have as much power as \nSenators in the year 2002 will have. Why wait?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will in a moment. Why wait? Why not do it now? Instead, \nwe continue to hear those who are up here every day pining over the \nloss of the balanced budget amendment, still bewailing the loss of the \nconstitutional amendment that they say would give us discipline, that \nwould put a little iron in our backbone; that great constitutional \namendment, still crying over it, weeping, bemoaning the days of the \npast when the Senate voted down that monstrosity--killed it.\n  I hope that Senators will stop whining and weeping and bemoaning that \nvote. Let us get on with balancing this budget that they want so much \nto do. Let us get on with doing something for our children and \ngrandchildren, which the Senators say they want so much to do. And, \nfirst of all, may I say to my friends on the other side, stop talking \nabout Mr. Clinton until you yourselves are willing to vote for a \ndeficit reduction package that he helped us to work out. You did not \ndemonstrate your willingness to do that.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma was not here at that time, of course. But \nRepublican Senators did not demonstrate a willingness in 1993 to \nexercise a little discipline, a little steel in the backbone. They used \nthe excuse, and still use it, that it increased taxes.\n  I say, let them haul down the banner, haul down their own party \nbanner of a tax cut. It is silly--silly--whether you use the old math \nor the new math. How in the world can anyone with a straight face get \nup here day after day and complain about a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment that was rejected and, at the same time, \nsupport a so-called Contract With America that would advocate a $200-\nbillion-plus tax cut? That is what the Republican leadership is doing, \nadvocating over $200 billion in tax cuts to the middle class.\n  If we really mean business about reducing the deficit, that will \nbring more relief to the middle class and every other class in this \ncountry and to our children and to our children's children, let us get \non with balancing the budget, and not rule out the raising of taxes. \nThat is a tool that could be used to balance the budget and to decrease \nthe deficit. I am not on the Finance Committee or the Ways and Means \nCommittee, but I certainly am open to suggestions as to how we might \nenact a tax increase that would be calculated and directed toward \nreduction of the deficit. There are many people in this country who can \nafford such a tax. Do not put the tax option off the table. At least \nleave it on the table as something to consider.\n  Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has asked \nthe question a couple of times that I previously answered, and that \nquestion is, What are we doing? I think, I say to the Senator, that if \nwe have demonstrated that we have been incapable of doing it, that we \nare incapable of facing up to that insatiable appetite for spending \nmoney that future generations will have to pay back, year after year \nafter year, then that should be evidence enough the discipline, the \nword you do not seem to like, is necessary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, I like the word discipline. I like it. I like the word \ndiscipline. I have no problem with the word discipline. Let us \ndiscipline ourselves now. Let us not wait until we garble and scar the \nConstitution waiting on some magic discipline that that might give us. \nLet us exercise discipline now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me repeat to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have demonstrated we are incapable of doing it----\n  Mr. BYRD. No, we are not incapable.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Year after year after year.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Some 48 States--in 1941 in Oklahoma, we were incapable of \ndoing it. We passed a balanced budget amendment and it worked.\n  I want to address one other thing that you mentioned and----\n  Mr. BYRD. On that point--Mr. President, I have the floor--on that \npoint about the States, the States do not balance their budgets in the \nsense that we are talking about balancing the Federal budget. The \nStates have operating budgets. The States have capital budgets, and the \nSenator knows that. And to use that old canard is to fool the American \npeople. The American people know that the States do not balance their \nbudgets. The States borrow money, the States are in debt, the States \nare going more and more into debt every year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. They borrow money, but the difference is the States pay \nthe money back.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh----\n  Mr. INHOFE. The cities pay it back. I served in the State \nlegislature.\n  Mr. BYRD. So did I.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I served as mayor of a major city, the city of Tulsa, and \nwe have those constraints beyond which we cannot spend. It has worked \nvery effectively. I did not get to the point I wanted to.\n  Mr. BYRD. On that point, let us stay with that point. I was majority \nleader when the Governors and the mayors of the country came to \nWashington with \n[[Page S3779]] their hats in their hands and their hands out.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, not this mayor. I was a mayor when you were majority \nleader.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not say anything about the Senator. I was saying I \nwas majority leader once. I was majority leader twice, and I saw the \nGovernors of the States and mayors. I talked with them on the \ntelephone. They called me on the telephone. They wanted this help; they \nwanted this aid; they wanted that aid; they wanted this appropriation \nincreased. Do not talk to me about the great job the mayors and \nGovernors have done throughout this country in balancing their budgets \nwithout help from the Federal Government.\n  Now, that is not to say that mayors and Governors have not taken \nstrong actions to try to curtail expenditures. I do not say that at \nall. But do not come here trying to tell this Senator that the States \nbalance their budgets. They do not do it, and they get a lot of help \nfrom the Federal Government. I know. I have met them right there, back \nthere in my office and right over here in that office when I was \nleader. Do not tell me that stuff.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. BYRD. I know different. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I wanted to address this subject of the tax increase that \nyou seem to be advocating at this time. There is a great \nmisunderstanding about tax increases. When you look at what our problem \nis today, I offer a very friendly alternative to your philosophy, and \nthat is, our problems are not that we are taxed too little, we are \nspending too much.\n  When you talk about a tax reduction that has been offered, you are \nalso talking about spending reductions that are going to be offered at \nthe same time.\n  I would like to suggest also that perhaps you share the philosophy of \nthe chief financial adviser to the President, Laura Tyson, when she \nsaid that there is no relationship between the level of taxation and \neconomic activity, and herein is the problem that we are having in \ncommunicating within this body and with the administration.\n  You are talking about the tax cuts during the eighties, during the \nReagan years and the Bush years, keeping in mind just a few of those \nyears did we have even control of one of the Houses, so it took both \nHouses to do it.\n  In 1980, the total revenues----\n  Mr. BYRD. We did not have control of the White House.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will read the Constitution which he has in \nhis pocket there and very available to him----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am sure that he will see that it is the constitutional \nresponsibility of Congress to develop the budget, to pass the budget on \nto the President.\n  In 1980, the total revenues that were derived from the income taxes \namounted to $244 billion. In 1990, 10 years later, the total revenues \nthat were derived were $466 billion. In that interim period, in the \n1980's came the largest marginal tax reductions, as the Senator has \nalready mentioned, that we probably have had in any 10-year period in \nthis Nation's history.\n  The maximum rate then went down from 70 percent to 28 percent. We had \nsome help as far as capital gains taxes are concerned. And yet during \nthat time we actually increased the revenue from those sources.\n  The fact is that for each 1-percent increase in economic activity we \nincrease revenues by $24 billion. And if we can increase economic \nactivity, we can increase revenues. What has been suggested by many of \nthe conservative think tanks using the CBO's projections is that we can \nbalance the budget without cutting any programs. We can balance the \nbudget without reducing any programs. The 2-percent-growth concept \nwhich we have already talked about, the Senator and I have, on the \nfloor of this body, is one that would actually bring the budget into \nbalance in approximately 8 years and not reduce one Government program; \nwithout a tax increase.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to the Senator, the Congress has cut the Presidents' \ndeficits. Since 1945, over that period of 50 years, Congress has \nappropriated something like $200 billion less than the accumulated \nbudgets that have been requested by the various Presidents who have \noccupied the White House during those years. Congress has a good \nrecord.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will grant the Senator that on occasion Presidents have \nleft their philosophy feeling they could not get a budget passed and \nhave gone to Congress such as was the case with President Bush at the \nfamous meeting out at Andrews Air Force Base where he decided to go \nahead and agree to a tax increase.\n  I think now in retrospect, and I think he believes the same thing, \nthat was a mistake.\n  Before I catch a plane, I have one other area the Senator mentioned I \nfeel compelled to address which is the issue of grandchildren.\n  The Senator might remember here a few weeks ago--it seems as if we \nhave been addressing this subject now for quite a few weeks--I had \noccasion to give a talk over here for about an hour and 10 minutes with \nthe picture of two beautiful children behind me, and those two children \nwere my grandchildren.\n  If we are to look at this in a compassionate way, I think that should \nbe the driving force for our actions today because virtually everyone \nwho has made any kind of a prediction, CBO included, has said that if \nwe do not change from the way we have been doing business for the last \n10 years and the last 40 years, if you project that forward, someone \nwho is born today such as my two grandchildren, who are less than 2 \nyears old, will have to pay 82 percent of their lifetime income in \ntaxes.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator advocates increases in taxes. I \nbelieve, and I believe the people who voted in the election on November \n8 believe, that we can do it without increasing taxes but cutting the \nsize of Government.\n  I used two charts here in the Chamber to show that those individuals \nwho were opposing the balanced budget amendment were also the same ones \nwho historically on the record are the biggest taxers and spenders in \nCongress, in both Houses. And also I showed on a chart that those \nindividuals who lost the election, the 66 House Members that are not \nhere after the November 8 election, and the eight Senators who either \nretired or are not here for one reason or another, all of them had a \nNational Taxpayers Union rating of D or F. That is the universally \naccepted rating for those people who tax and spend. And all of them had \nvoted for the 1993 stimulus bill, which was the largest spending \nincrease, and the 1993 tax increase, which was the largest tax \nincrease.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I saw those lovely pictures of the Senator's \ngrandchildren, and we all love our grandchildren. I have been loving my \ngrandchildren for almost 30 years now. But if we really want to do \nsomething for those grandchildren, those two lovely grandchildren whose \npictures the Senator so proudly and prominently displayed on the floor, \nlet us get on with the business of reducing the deficits now. We do not \nhave to have any constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We \nhave the tools in our own hands now. If we really want to help those \ngrandchildren, let us get on with balancing the budget. Let us speak \nout against tax cuts for the middle class, whether they are being \nadvocated by Mr. Clinton or by the so-called Contract With America.\n  Now is not the time for a tax cut. And let us not remove possible tax \nincreases from the table when it comes to consideration. There must be \nsome heads in this Chamber who have the expertise, who serve on the tax \nwriting committees, who could devise a tax increase that would be \ncalculated to reduce the deficit, which could be directed solely to the \nreduction of the deficit.\n  I know it is not easy to vote for a tax increase. I have been in \npolitical bodies--I am in my 49th year of serving in various and sundry \nlegislative bodies. It is not easy to vote for tax increases. It is \nalways easy to vote for tax cuts. But I think we have to forget the \neasy road now and at least consider increasing some taxes. We do have \nto continue to cut spending. I carry no brief for protecting all \nspending. There is some \n[[Page S3780]] spending we have to do as a Government of a great \npeople. We have to invest in our people's future.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One last comment before I leave.\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I will yield to the Senator. I am conscious of the \nfact that he needs to catch a plane. But let me finish what I was about \nto say.\n  There is not only a Federal fiscal deficit but there is also an \ninvestment deficit. I was at the 1990 summit with Mr. Bush and with the \nRepublican leadership and with the Democratic leadership in both ends \nof the Capitol. I said at the summit, we have an investment deficit. We \nneed to build up our infrastructure, both human and physical. Any \nbusiness or company that does not improve its plant and equipment and \nkeep its employees trained to the new mode of manufacturing or \nproduction of things is going to go under. Business has to invest. Our \ncountry needs to invest. And spending moneys for infrastructure is \nwise. We just cannot cut everything.\n  During the Reagan years, and up to now, we have continued to cut \ndomestic discretionary spending. It has been cut to the bone. I say to \nthe Senator, we will have cut over the next 5 years--in the 1993 \ndeficit reduction package, we cut Government spending. We cut domestic \ndiscretionary spending. And we put the level of spending on a 5-year \ndownward glide. We froze it, meaning that we would not take into \naccount inflation from year to year.\n  Not only that, but the amendment that was offered in the Finance \nCommittee by Mr. Exon and Mr. Grassley further cut $26 billion below a \nfreeze. That $26 billion was reduced to a $13 billion cut in conference \nwith the other body. So we are operating below a freeze in \ndiscretionary spending.\n  That is not to say we cannot cut more. But we cannot take defense off \nthe table and say we will not touch it and still balance the budget and \nhave a tax cut. All of these goodies--if you have a tax cut at the same \ntime--we cannot do it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. One more comment. It was not my intention to use so much \nof the Senator's time.\n  I can only say, I am going to catch a plane. I am going back to \nOklahoma where real people are, where the people spoke loudly and \nclearly in the November 8 election when they said: We want to downsize \nthe scope of Government; we do not want to have Government involved in \nour lives to the degree that Government now is involved.\n  You and I probably will disagree philosophically with the role of \nGovernment. But the bottom line is, and I say it one last time, we have \ndemonstrated we cannot do it, that either we cannot or will not do it.\n  I have not given up. I would like to serve notice to everyone in this \nChamber, I believe we will get that one additional vote because the \npeople are now identifying what is going on in this country and they \nare going to be heard.\n  I have the utmost respect for the Senator from West Virginia, but I \nsuggest if you take a trip back to West Virginia, you will hear the \nsame thing there.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on that point, may I say to my friend, he \ndoes not need to instruct me about going to West Virginia. When he says \nhe is going to Oklahoma where ``real people are,'' he does not have to \ntravel that far. West Virginia is within an hour and a half's drive. \nWest Virginians are ``real people.'' The people of Oklahoma are real \npeople. The people of West Virginia are real people.\n  May I say to the Senator, I came here when I was a little wet behind \nthe ears, too. For me to say to another Senator that he ought to go \nback to his own State and see what the people say--that is a little \nbit--that is stretching one's credibility a little bit.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would say I appreciate the compliment, to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, because this is the first time since I have reached \nthe age of 60 I have been called wet behind the ears.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course, a person who is 77, who has been in this body 37 \nyears, can remember when he, this Senator from West Virginia, came here \nwhen he, too, was wet behind the ears. But I have never said to a \nSenator: You ought to go back to your own State and see what the people \nthink. Leave me and my fellow West Virginians to ourselves.\n  Does anybody else want me to yield? I yield to the--I will either \nyield the floor or yield to the lady.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was just going to ask the Senator \nfrom West Virginia--I would like to make a statement totally off this \nsubject in morning business talk. But I certainly do not want to \ninterrupt the Senator if he is in the middle of continuing his speech \non the amendment. I was really asking for a clarification of his \nability to yield me some time, but I do not want to interrupt.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia yields the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3776-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3780-S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A STRAITJACKET FOR LILLIE RUBIN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, our regulatory reform debate has \nranged from the sublime to the ridiculous and back. Today I would like \nto weigh in briefly on the side of the ridiculous.\n  The dressing room of a fine women's clothing store may seem like an \nodd place for the EEOC to intrude in a way that perfectly illustrates \nregulatory excess, but that is exactly where we find ourselves today. \nThe firm in question, Lillie Rubin, is a successful 49-year-old \nbusiness with 60 affiliates, specializing in clothes for women. But the \nEEOC is measuring Lillie Rubin for a new outfit, and I think it seems \nlike more of a straitjacket than a woman's dress.\n  In opposition to its own regulations and its own previous decisions, \nthe EEOC has ruled that a Lillie Rubin store in Phoenix must employ \nmale salespeople, and it is demanding that they be allowed to work in \nthe store's fitting rooms where female customers try on clothes. I know \nthis does not sound like an EEOC case so much as an ``I Love Lucy'' \nrerun, but it is true.\n  However much our society has changed, I still believe that certain \nstandards prevail, and I believe this dress store's customers should \nnot be guinea pigs in a new Government experiment. I am astounded that \nan agency of the Government would seek to strong-arm a private business \ninto violating basic standards in such an outrageous way. It is beyond \nmy understanding why the EEOC would try to force a business such as \nLillie Rubin to sacrifice the privacy of its customers in order to \navoid Government censure.\n  But customer privacy is not all that Lillie Rubin would be \nsacrificing if it is forced to comply with this EEOC ruling. What the \nEEOC has concocted is a remedy that could well drive away Lillie \nRubin's customers and hurt its business.\n  This is more than regulatory intrusion. The EEOC decision, if not \nreversed, will leave the company in an exposed financial position.\n  As a final blow, EEOC is insisting that Lillie Rubin pay for \nnewspaper advertisements to publicize that it may be vulnerable to EEOC \nclaims by men who have applied in the past or might in the future.\n  The EEOC's approach to Lillie Rubin has been highhanded and arbitrary \nin the extreme, and bizarre, I think, as well. According to the \ncompany, one EEOC investigator told a company representative that \n``Some women like it'' when there are males in the dressing room when \nthey disrobe.\n  Mr. President, I ask you, is that what the taxpayers of America want \ntheir hard-earned dollars to pay for from our Government employees? Is \nthat what this Congress wants the people to whom we are delegating our \nauthority to implement regulations to do? Of course not. I am sure \nPresident Clinton would not want an agency of his executive branch to \nbe putting forward a policy that forces men into women's dressing \nrooms. Surely he realizes by now that it is impossible for one \nindividual, regardless of how powerful, to even think that this would \nhappen and to come to grips with the regulatory gridlock that has been \ncreated here.\n  I think this argues even more for a regulatory moratorium. If these \nkinds of things are out there happening in the real world, and if \nregulators are \n[[Page S3781]] going to this extreme, I think it is time to have a \nmoratorium that says: Hold it. Time out. Let us bring common sense into \nthis process and let us find out how big the problem is.\n  I think this Lillie Rubin example is one more in a multitude of \nexamples that we have heard talked about on the House floor in the last \nfew weeks, and on this floor, talking about trying to put parameters \nand common sense into our regulatory framework. The EEOC's treatment of \nLillie Rubin is tailor made--if I could use a pun--to show how \nbureaucratic intrusiveness is sapping the productivity of American \nbusiness and how it is costing Americans billions of dollars every \nyear.\n  I hope we can put common sense into the system. I hope this just \nillustrates how much we need to put common sense into the system. And I \nhope the EEOC will hear this put in context and retreat from such a \nridiculous requirement of a women's dress store to hire male \nsalespeople and allow them into the dressing rooms.\n  This is something we must stop. I hope the regulatory moratorium bill \nwill be the first step to allow us to say: Enough is enough. This is \nnot the way our American taxpayers expect their taxpayer dollars to be \nused.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kassebaum \nstriker replacement amendment. I strongly support the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Kansas. The Executive order is one \nmore example of the President's bypassing the legislative process to \naccomplish his own agenda just as he did with the Mexican bailout which \nhas been the subject of a Banking Committee hearing this morning and it \nis proving to be a monetary Vietnam.\n  More importantly, this amendment is essential to overturn an \nExecutive order which would unilaterally resurrect archaic labor \npolicies that undermine our national effort to move our economy \nsuccessfully into the competitive international markets of the 21st \ncentury.\n  The President's action places at risk the integrity of our entire \nsystem of collective bargaining which is based on a delicate balance of \nthe rights of employees to withhold their labor and the right of \nmanagement to continue business operations during a strike. The \nPresident suggests that the ban on permanent replacement workers by \nbusinesses engaged in Federal contracts will lead to the more efficient \nperformance of such contracts. This is ridiculous and is totally wrong. \nI am convinced that by upsetting the balance between labor and \nmanagement, the entire system of collective bargaining will break down \nresulting in more strikes, business bankruptcies, and fewer jobs.\n  While this Executive order is limited to Federal contracts, the \nintent of the President and the opponents of this amendment is clear. \nThey seek to return this country to labor policies which history has \nrejected as proven failures over and over. This Executive order \nembodies a labor policy completely at odds with current realities in \nthe international marketplace.\n  It is contrary to the interests of working Americans striving for \nsuccess in a global economy where free trade is the order of the day. \nIt panders to special union interests who seek to protect their own \nprivileged position at the expense of other working people. And it is a \ncynical attempt to delay congressional consideration of the priorities \nwhich voters last November clearly indicated they were most interested \nin.\n  The Congress has on many occasions debated the merits of banning \npermanent replacement workers. The most recent occasion was during the \nlast Congress when the administration's proposal to overturn a 60-year \ninterpretation of the National Labor Relations Act was defeated by a \nCongress controlled by the President's own party.\n  Last week, the President actively fought against the balanced budget \namendment. This week he issues an Executive order on striker \nreplacement knowing that it will be used by supporters to halt \ncongressional consideration of legislation which the administration \nopposes.\n  In November the voters spoke unmistakably about their expectations \nfor the 104th Congress. In my opinion during the first 100 days of this \nCongress the electorate does not expect us to devote our time and \nenergies to long-settled issues which were recently revisited and \nreaffirmed.\n  My colleague from Kansas has offered a reasonable proposal limited to \nthis fiscal year. I believe that at some point during this Congress we \nshould consider legislation which would permanently nullify the \nPresident's Executive order. At a later date I will welcome a full \ndebate on striker replacement with those who support the President's \naction, but not at this time.\n  I encourage opponents of this amendment to allow the Senate to \ncontinue with our consideration of the defense supplemental \nappropriations and then proceed with other important issues such as the \nline-item veto, welfare reform, product liability reform, tort reform, \nand a regulatory moratorium.\n  These are the issues that last November voters expected us to \nconsider at this time, I think, and it is time we get on with \nconsidering them at a rapid rate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity this afternoon \nto address some of the issues in question that have been raised by the \nKassebaum amendment and hopefully resolve the questions that have been \nraised so that we will be able to move beyond the Kassebaum amendment \nto address the underlying issue which is the appropriations which are \nnecessary for our national defense and national security.\n  This particular proposal is not really appropriate on this particular \nmeasure. But it has been the desire of a number of our Members to \ncontinue the debate and discussion on the measure rather than consider \nthe urgency of the underlying proposal.\n  So I welcome the chance to respond to a number of the questions that \nhave been raised including the questions that have been raised by my \nfriend from North Carolina in his own comments.\n  The argument we hear over and over is the President is changing the \nlaw, that Congress gave employers the rights to use permanent \nreplacements and the President is taking away that right. Let us look a \nlittle closer at this argument.\n  In the first place, Congress never gave employers the right to use \npermanent replacements. The National Labor Relations Act never uses the \nterm and it was not in the act of 1935, and it is not there today. What \nCongress did say was very different. Section 13 states very plainly:\n\n       Nothing in this act, except as specifically provided \n     herein, shall be construed so as to either interfere with, or \n     impede, or in any way diminish the right to strike, or to \n     affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.\n\n  But nevertheless it is true that employers can use permanent \nreplacements. If they did not get that right from Congress, where did \nit come from? The answer, of course, is the Supreme Court's decision in \nthe 1938 case of Mackay Radio where the Court interpreted the act to \nallow the use of permanent replacements despite the statute's \nproscription against diminishing the right to strike. But even Mackay \ndid not give employers the right to use permanent replacements. It \nmerely said the National Labor Relations Act does not prohibit their \nuse.\n  The Court said that the powers of the National Labor Relations Board \nand the act's legal machinery could not be used to stop employers from \nusing permanent replacements. Has President Clinton changed that law or \nattempted to change it? No, he has not. Any Senator who will take the \ntime to read the Executive order will see that he has not. It is still \nlegal under the National Labor Relations Act to use permanent \nreplacements.\n  There is no back pay remedy in the Executive order for workers whose \njobs \n[[Page S3782]] are taken from them. There is no power granted to the \nNational Labor Relations Board to go to the court and get an order \nblocking the employer's use of permanent replacements. Those are the \npowers and remedies the Congress debated in the last Congress when we \nconsidered S. 55, not the President's power to administer Federal \ncontracts. President Clinton has not given the National Labor Relations \nBoard any of the powers that Congress debated in S. 55 nor has he given \nthe Board any new powers at all.\n  So to say the Executive order is an end run around the Congress is \nuntrue. The Congress never debated whether the President should \nexercise his procurement powers to prevent the kind of lengthy and \nbitter strikes that occur when Federal contractors use permanent \nreplacements. We have never debated whether it makes sense, as I \nbelieve it does, for the President to prevent situations from occurring \nwhere unusually lengthy strikes led us to long periods where critical \nproducts such as fighter jet engines or missile guidance systems are \nproduced entirely by any untrained workers brought in as permanent \nreplacements for 20- or 30-year skilled veterans. I believe it does not \nmake sense for the President to do that. It does make sense for the \nPresident to do what he can to protect the Government's procurement \nprocess from that sort of situation.\n  But no one should doubt that he has the power to do so. This power \nmay be inherent in the Executive. But in any case, Congress has given \nthe President this authority through the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act.\n  (Mr. SMITH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now, Senator Kassebaum might want to take that power \naway, but there is no end run here. Congress gave the power, gave the \nPresident the authority to oversee contracting by the Federal agencies \nand Executive Order 12954, is an exercise of that authority.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that over the period of the weekend our \nMembers will have a chance to review the Department of Justice's legal \nmemoranda supporting that authority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that memorandum be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1995.\n     Memorandum for Janet Reno, Attorney General.\n     From: Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General.\n     Re: Executive Order No. 12954, entitled ``Ensuring the \n         Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of \n         Federal Government Contracts''.\n       On March 6, 1995, we issued a memorandum approving as to \n     form and legality a proposed executive order entitled, \n     ``Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration of \n     Federal Government Contracts.'' On March 8, 1995 the \n     President signed the proposed directive, making it Executive \n     Order No. 12954. This memorandum records the basis for our \n     prior conclusion that the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act vests the President with authority to issue \n     Executive Order No. 12954 in light of his finding that it \n     will promote economy and efficiency in government \n     procurement.\n\n\n                                   I\n\n       Executive Order No. 12954 establishes a mechanism designed \n     to ensure economy and efficiency in government procurement \n     involving contractors that permanently replace lawfully \n     striking workers. After a preamble that makes and discusses \n     various findings and ultimately concludes that Executive \n     Order No. 12954 will promote economy and efficiency in \n     government procurement, the order declares that ``[i]t is the \n     policy of the Executive branch in procuring goods and \n     services that, to ensure the economical and efficient \n     administration and completion of Federal Government \n     contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with \n     employers that permanently replace lawfully striking \n     employees.'' Exec. Order No. 12954, Sec. 1. The order makes \n     the Secretary of Labor (``Secretary'') responsible for its \n     enforcement. Id. Sec. 6. Specifically, the Secretary is \n     authorized to investigate and hold hearings to determine \n     whether ``an organizational unit of a federal contractor'' \n     has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees either \n     on the Secretary's own initiative or upon receiving \n     ``complaints by employees'' that allege such permanent \n     replacement. Id. Sec. 2.\n       If the Secretary determines that a contractor has \n     permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the \n     Secretary is directed to exercise either or both of two \n     options. First, the Secretary may make a finding that all \n     contracts between the government and that contractor should \n     be terminated for convenience. Id. Sec. 3. The Secretary's \n     decision whether to issue such a finding is to be exercised \n     to advance the government's economy and efficiency interests \n     as set forth in section 1. Id. Sec. 1 (``All discretion under \n     this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this \n     policy.'') The Secretary is then to transmit the finding to \n     the heads of all departments and agencies that have contracts \n     with the contractor.\\1\\ Each such agency head is to terminate \n     any contracts that the Secretary has designated for \n     termination, unless the agency head formally and in writing \n     objects to the Secretary's finding. Id. Sec. 3. An agency \n     head's discretion to object is also limited to promoting the \n     purpose of economy and efficiency as set forth in the policy \n     articulated in section 1.\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Secretary's second option is debarment. If the \n     Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently \n     replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary is to \n     place the contractor on the debarment list until the labor \n     dispute has been resolved, unless the Secretary determines \n     that debarment would impede economy and efficiency in \n     procurement. The effect of this action is that no agency head \n     may enter into a contract with a contractor on the debarment \n     list unless the agency head finds compelling reasons for \n     doing so. Id. Sec. 4.\n       Executive Order No. 12954, taken as a whole, sets forth a \n     mechanism that closely ties its operative procedures--\n     termination and debarment--to the pursuit of economy and \n     efficiency. The President has made a finding that, as a \n     general matter, economy and efficiency in procurement are \n     advanced by contracting with employers that do not \n     permanently replace lawfully striking employees. \n     Additionally, the President has provided for a case-by-case \n     determination that his finding is justified on the peculiar \n     facts and circumstances of each specific case before any \n     action to effectuate the President's finding is undertaken.\n\n\n                                   ii\n\n       The Supreme Court has instructed that ``[t]he President's \n     power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an \n     act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown \n     Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952). The \n     President's authority to issue Executive Order No. 12954 is \n     statutory; specifically, the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (``FPASA''). That statute \n     was enacted ``to provide for the Government an economical and \n     efficient system for . . . procurement and supply.'' 40 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 471. The FPASA expressly grants the President \n     authority to effectuate this purpose,\n      ``The President may prescribe such policies and directives, \n     not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, as he \n     shall deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said \n     Act, which policies and directives shall govern the \n     Administrator [of General Services] and executive agencies \n     in carrying out their respective functions hereunder.'' \n     Id. Sec. 486(a). An executive order issued pursuant to \n     this authorization is valid if (a) ``the President acted \n     `to effectuate the provisions' of the FPASA,'' and (b) the \n     President's ``action was `not inconsistent with' any \n     specific provision of the Act.'' American Fed'n of Gov't \n     Employees v. Carmen, 669 F.2d 815, 820 (D.C. Cir. 1981) \n     (quoting 40 U.S.C. Sec. 486(a)). We are not aware of any \n     specific provision of the FPASA that is inconsistent with \n     Executive Order No. 12954. Therefore, we turn to the \n     question whether the President acted to effectuate the \n     purposes of the FPASA.\n       Every court to consider the question has concluded that \n     Sec. 486(a) grants the President a broad scope of authority. \n     In the leading case on the subject, the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting en \n     banc, addressed the question of the scope of the President's \n     authority under the FPASA, and Sec. 486(a) in particular. See \n     AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C. Cir.) (en banc), cert. \n     denied, 443 U.S. 915 (1979). A plausible argument that the \n     FPASA granted the President only narrowly limited authority \n     was advanced and rejected. See id. at 799-800 (MacKinnon, J., \n     dissenting). After an extensive review of the legislative \n     history of that provision, the court held that the FPASA, \n     through Sec. 486(a), was intended to give the President \n     ``broad-ranging authority'' to issue orders designed to \n     promote ``economy'' and ``efficiency'' in government \n     procurement. Id. at 787-89. The court emphasized that \n     ```[e]conomy' and `efficiency' are not narrow terms; they \n     encompass those factors like price, quality, suitability, and \n     availability of goods or services that are involved in all \n     acquisition decisions.'' Id. at 789; see also Peter E. Quint, \n     The Separation of Powers under Carter, 62 Tex. L. Rev. 786, \n     792-93 (1984) (although Sec. 486(a) ``easily could be read as \n     authorizing the President to do little more than issue \n     relatively modest housekeeping regulations relating to \n     procurement practice * * *. The Kahn court found \n     congressional authorization of sweeping presidential power * \n     * *.''); Peter Raven-Hansen, Making Agencies Follow Orders; \n     Judicial Review of Agency Violations of Executive Order \n     12,291, 1983 Duke L.J. 285, 333, n.266; Jody S. Fink, Notes \n     on Presidential Foreign Policy Powers (Part II), 11 Hofstra \n     L. Rev. 773, 790-91 n.132 (1983) (characterizing Kahn as \n     reading Sec. 486(a) to grant President ``virtually \n     unlimited'' authority).\n       The court then concluded that a presidential directive \n     issued pursuant to Sec. 486(a) is authorized as long as there \n     is a ``sufficiently close nexus'' between the order and the \n     criteria of economy and efficiency. Kahn, 618 \n     [[Page S3783]] F.2d at 792. Although the opinion does not \n     include a definitive statement of what constitutes such a \n     nexus, the best reading is that a sufficiently close nexus \n     exists when the President's order is ``reasonably related'' \n     to the ends of economy and efficiency. See id. at 793, n.49; \n     Harold H. Bruff, Judicial Review and the President's \n     Statutory Powers, 68 Va. L. Rev. 1, 51 (1982) (``in AFL-CIO \n     v. Kahn, the court stated an appropriate standard for \n     reviewing the basis of a presidential action--that it be \n     `reasonably related' to statutory policies'') (footnote \n     omitted).\n       As one commentator has asserted, under Kahn, the President \n     need not demonstrate that an order ``would infallibly promote \n     efficiency, merely that it [is] plausible to suppose this.'' \n     Alan Hyde, Beyond Collective Bargaining: The Politicization \n     of Labor Relations under Government Contract, 1982 Wis. L. \n     Rev. 1, 26. In our view a more exacting standard would invade \n     the ``broad-ranging'' authority that the court held the \n     statute was intended to confer upon the President. See Kahn, \n     618 F.2d at 787-89. In addition, a stricter standard would \n     undermine the great deference that is due presidential \n     factual and policy determinations that Congress has vested in \n     the President. See, e.g., Henry P. Monaghan, Stare Decisis \n     and Constitutional Adjudication, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 723, 738 \n     (1988).\\2\\\n       We have no doubt, for example, that Sec. 486(a) grants the \n     President authority to issue a directive that prohibits \n     executive agencies from entering into contracts with \n     contractors who use a particular machine that the President \n     has deemed less reliable than others that are available. \n     Contractors that use the less reliable machines are less \n     likely to deliver quality goods or to produce their goods in \n     a timely manner. We see no distinction between this \n     hypothetical order in which the President prohibits \n     procurement from contractors that use machines that he deems \n     unreliable and the one the President has actually issued, \n     which would bar procurement with contractors that use labor \n     relations techniques that the President deems to be generally \n     unreliable, especially when the Secretary of Labor and the \n     contracting agency head each confirm the validity of that \n     generalization in each specific case.\n       The preamble of Executive Order No. 12954 sets forth the \n     President's findings that the state of labor-management \n     relations affects the cost, quality, and timely availability \n     of goods and services. The order also announces his finding \n     that the government's procurement interests in cost, quality, \n     and timely availability are best secured by contracting with \n     those entities that have ``stable relationships with their \n     employees'' and that ``[a]n important aspect of a stable \n     collective bargaining relationship is the balance between \n     allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving \n     worker rights.'' The President has concluded that ``[t]his \n     balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are \n     hired.'' In establishing the policy ordinarily\\3\\ to contract \n     with contractors that do not hire permanent replacement \n     workers, the President has found that he will advance the \n     government's procurement interests in cost, quality, and \n     timely availability of goods and services by contracting with \n     those contractors that satisfy what he has found to be an \n     important condition for stable labor-management relations.\n       The order's preamble then proceeds to set forth reasonable \n     relation between the government's procurement interests in \n     economy and efficiency and the order itself. Specifically, \n     the order asserts the President's finding that ``strikes \n     involving permanent replacement workers are longer in \n     duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of \n     permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a \n     broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the \n     problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently \n     replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated \n     knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent \n     employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the \n     businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, \n     which rely on that employer to provide high quality and \n     reliable goods or services.'' We believe that these findings \n     state the necessary reasonable relation between the \n     procedures instituted by the order and achievement of the \n     goal of economy and efficiency.\n       It may well be that the order will advance other \n     permissible goals in addition to economy and efficiency. Even \n     if the order were intended to achieve goals other than \n     economy and efficiency, however, the order would still be \n     authorized under the FPASA as long as one of the President's \n     goals is the promotion of economy and efficiency in \n     government procurement. ``We cannot agree that an exercise of \n     section 486(a) authority becomes illegitimate if, in design \n     and operation, the President's prescription, in addition to \n     promoting economy and efficiency, serves other, not \n     impermissible, ends as well.'' Carmen, 669 F.2d at 821; see \n     Rainbow Nav. Inc. v. Dep't of the Navy, 783 F.2d 1072 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1986); Kimberly A. Egerton, Note, Presidential Power \n     over Federal Contracts under the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act: The Close Nexus Test of AFL-CIO \n     v. Kahn, 1980 Duke L.J. 205, 218-20.\n       Since the adoption of the FPASA, Presidents have \n     consistently regarded orders such as the one currently under \n     review as being within their authority under that Act. As the \n     court explained in Kahn, Presidents have relied on the FPASA \n     as authority to issue a wide range of orders. 618 F.2d at \n     789-92 (noting the history of such orders since 1941, \n     especially to institute ``buy American'' requirements and to \n     prohibit discrimination in employment by government \n     contractors). Not surprisingly this executive practice has \n     continued since Kahn. For instance, President Bush issued \n     Executive Order No. 12800, which required all government \n     contractors to post notices declaring that their employees \n     could not ``be required to join a union or maintain \n     membership in a union in order to regain their jobs.'' 57 \n     Fed. Reg. 12985 (April 13, 1992). The order was supported \n     solely by the statement that it was issued ``in order to * * \n     * promote harmonious relations in the workplace for purposes \n     of ensuring the economic and efficient administration and \n     completion of Government contracts.'' Id.\\4\\ This long \n     history of executive practice provides additional support for \n     the President's exercise of authority in this case. See Kahn, \n     618 F.2d at 790.\\5\\ This is especially so where, as here, the \n     President sets forth the close nexus between the order and \n     the statutory goals of economy and efficiency.\n       It may be that in individual cases, a contractor that \n     maintains a policy of refusing to permanently replace \n     lawfully striking workers may nevertheless have an unstable \n     labor-management relationship while a particular contractor \n     that has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers may \n     have a more stable relationship. As to such situations, \n     however, the Secretary and the contracting agency heads \n     retain the discretion to continue to procure goods and \n     services from contractors that have permanently replaced \n     lawfully striking workers if that procurement will advance \n     the federal government's economy and efficiency interests as \n     articulated in section 1 of Executive Order No. 12954.\\6\\ We \n     recognize that, even with these safeguards, it could happen \n     that a specific decision to terminate a contract for \n     convenience or to debar a contractor pursuant to the order \n     might not promote economy or efficiency. The courts have held \n     that it remains well within the President's authority to \n     determine that such occurrences are more than offset by the \n     economy and efficiency gains associated with compliance with \n     an order generally. See Kahn, 618 F.2d at 793.\\7\\\n       Similarly, it would be unavailing to contend that Executive \n     Order No. 12954 will secure no immediate or near-term \n     advancement of the federal government's economy and \n     efficiency procurement interests. Section 486(a) authorizes \n     the President to employ ``a strategy of seeking the greatest \n     advantage to the Government, both short- and long-term,'' and \n     this is ``entirely consistent with the congressional policies \n     behind the FPASA.'' Id.\n      emphasis added); cf. Contractors Ass'n v. Secretary of \n     Labor, 442 F.2d 159, 170 (3d Cir.) (deciding on basis of \n     president's constitutional rather than statutory \n     authority), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 854 (1971).\n       The FPASA grants the President a direct and active \n     supervisory role in the administration of that Act and endows \n     him with broad discretion over how best ``to achieve a \n     flexible management system capable of making sophisticated \n     judgment in pursuit of economy and efficiency.'' Kahn, 618 \n     F.2d at 788-89. As explained above, the President has set \n     forth a sufficiently close nexus between the program to be \n     established by the proposed order and the goals of economy \n     and efficiency in government procurement.\\8\\\n       Finally, we do not understand the action of Congress in \n     relation to legislation on the subject of replacement of \n     lawfully striking workers to bear on the President's \n     authority to issue Executive Order No. 12954. The question is \n     whether the FPASA authorizes the President to issue the \n     order. As set forth above, we believe that it does. Recent \n     Congresses have considered but failed to act on the issue of \n     whether to adopt a national, economy-wide proscription of the \n     practice applying to all employers under the National Labor \n     Relations Act (``NLRA'').\\9\\ This action may not be given the \n     effect of amending or repealing the President's statutory \n     authority, for the enactment of such legislation requires \n     passage by both houses of Congress and presentment to the \n     President. See Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. \n     Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. \n     252 (1991); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). To contend \n     that Congress's inaction on legislation to prohibit all \n     employers from hiring replacement workers deprived the \n     President of authority he had possessed is to contend for the \n     validity of the legislative veto.\n       In Youngstown Sheet & Tube, it was considered relevant that \n     Congress had considered and rejected granting the President \n     the specific authority he had exercised. 343 U.S. 586. There, \n     however, the President did not claim to be acting pursuant to \n     any statutory power, but rather to inherent constitutional \n     power. In such a case, the scope of the President's power \n     depends upon congressional action in the field, including an \n     express decision to deny the President any statutory \n     authority. Id. Youngstown Sheet & Tube is inapposite here \n     because the President does not rely upon inherent \n     constitutional authority, but rather upon express statutory \n     authority--Sec. 486(a) of the FPASA. See Kahn, 618 F.2d at \n     787 & n. 13.\n       Moreover, we note that Congress's action was far from a \n     repudiation of the specific authority exercised in Executive \n     Order No. 12954. Even if a majority of either house of \n     Congress had voted to reject the blanket proscriptions on \n     hiring permanent replacements for lawfully striking workers, \n     contained in H.R. 5 and S. 55, this would denote no more than \n     a determination that such a broad, inflexible rule applied in \n     every labor dispute subject to the NLRA would not advance \n     the \n     [[Page S3784]] many interests that Congress may consider when \n     assessing legislation. The order, by contrast, does not apply \n     across the economy, but only in the area of government \n     procurement. Nor does the order establish an inflexible \n     application, rather it provides the Secretary of Labor an \n     opportunity to review each case to determine whether \n     debarring or terminating a contract with a particular \n     contractor will promote economy and efficiency in government \n     procurement and further permits any contracting agency head \n     to\n      override a decision to debar if he or she believes there are \n     compelling circumstances or to reject a recommendation to \n     terminate a contract if, in his or her independent \n     judgment, it will not promote economy and efficiency. In \n     sum, the congressional action alluded to above simply does \n     not implicate the narrow context of government procurement \n     or speak to the efficacy of a flexible case-by-case regime \n     such as the one set forth in the order.\\10\\\n       The Kahn opinion fully supports this view. There the \n     President promulgated voluntary wage and price guidelines \n     that were applicable to the entire economy. Contractors that \n     failed to certify compliance with the guidelines were \n     debarred from must government contracts. See Exec. Order No. \n     12092, 43 Fed. Reg. 51,375 (1978). The order was issued in \n     1978 against the following legislative backdrop: In 1971 \n     Congress passed the Economic Stabilization Act, which \n     authorized the President to enforce economy-wide wage and \n     price controls. In 1974, a few months after the Economic \n     Stabilization Act expired, the Council on Wage and Price \n     Stability Act (``COWPSA'') was enacted. COWPSA expressly \n     provided that ``[n]othing in this Act * * * authorizes the \n     continuation, imposition, or reimposition of any mandatory \n     economic controls with respect to prices rents, wages, \n     salaries, corporate dividends, or any similar transfers.'' \n     Pub. L. No. 93-387, Sec. 3(b), 88 Stat. 750 (1974).\n       The court concluded that ``the standards in Executive Order \n     12092, which cover only wages and prices, are not as \n     extensive as the list in Section 3(b). Consequently, we do \n     not think the procurement compliance program falls within the \n     coverage of Section 3(b), but rather is a halfway measure \n     outside the contemplation of Congress in that enactment.'' \n     Kahn, 618 F.2d at 795. Similarly, Executive Order No. 12954 \n     is a measure that operates in a manner (case-by-case \n     determination) and a realm (government procurement \n     exclusively) that was outside the contemplation of Congress \n     in its consideration of a broad and inflexible prohibition on \n     the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers.\n\n\n                                  iii\n\n       Congress, in the FPASA, established that the President is \n     to play the role of managing and directing government \n     procurement. Congress designed this role to include ``broad-\n     ranging authority'' to issue orders intended to achieve an \n     economical and efficient procurement system. Executive Order \n     No. 12954, ``Ensuring the Economical and Efficient \n     Administration and Completion of Federal Government \n     Contracts,'' represents a valid exercise of this authority.\n                               footnotes\n\n       \\1\\We will refer to this class of officials generically as \n     agency head(s).\n       \\2\\We do not mean to indicate a belief that Executive Order \n     No. 12954 could not withstand a stricter level of scrutiny. \n     We simply regard the employment of such a standard to be \n     contrary to the holding of Kahn, as well as the view of the \n     purposes of the FPASA and its legislative history upon which \n     that decision expressly rests.\n       \\3\\Again, the order does not categorically bar procurement \n     from contractors that have permanently replaced lawfully \n     striking workers. The sanctions that the order would \n     authorize would not go into effect if either the Secretary, \n     with respect to either the termination or the debarment \n     option, or the contracting agency head, with respect to the \n     termination option, finds that the option would impede \n     economy and efficiency in procurement.\n       \\4\\This order is also significant insofar as it \n     demonstrates that Executive Order No. 12954 is not the first \n     in which a president has found that more stable workplace \n     relations promote economy and efficiency in government \n     procurement.\n       \\5\\Of course, the President's view of his own authority \n     under a statute is not controlling, but when that view has \n     been acted upon over a substantial period of time without \n     eliciting congressional removal, it is `entitled to great \n     respect.' . . . [t]he `construction of a statute by those \n     charged with its execution should be followed unless there \n     are compelling indications that it is wrong.''' Kahn, 618 \n     F.2d at 790 (quoting Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve Sys. v. First Lincolnwood Corp., 439 U.S. 234 (1978), \n     and Miller v. Youakim, 440 U.S. 125, 144 n.25 (1979)).\n       \\6\\The authority of an agency head is diminished somewhat, \n     though not eliminated entirely with respect to procuring from \n     a contractor that the Secretary has debarred. An agency head \n     may procure from a debarred contractor only for compelling \n     reasons. See Exec. Order No. 12954, Sec. 4. Nevertheless, the \n     Secretary has authority to refuse to place a contractor on \n     the debarment list in the first instance if the Secretary \n     believes that debarment would not advance economy and \n     efficiency.\n       \\7\\``[W]e find no basis for rejecting the President's \n     conclusion that any higher costs incurred in those \n     transactions will be more than offset by the advantages \n     gained in negotiated contracts and in those cases where the \n     lowest bidder is in compliance with the voluntary standards \n     and his bid is lower than it would have been in the absence \n     of standards.'' Kahn, 618 F.2d at 793.\n       \\8\\Moreover, we note that under the Supreme Court's recent \n     decision in Dalton v. Specter, 114 S. Ct. 1719 (1994), it is \n     unlikely that the President's judgment may be subject to \n     judicial review. It is clear that Sec. 486(a) gives the \n     President the power to issue orders designed to promote \n     economy and efficiency in Government procurement. See 40 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 486(a); Carmen, 669 F.2d at 821; Kahn, 618 F.2d \n     at 788-89, 792-93. The Supreme Court has recently \n     ``distinguished between claims of constitutional violations \n     and claims that an official has acted in excess of his \n     statutory authority.'' Dalton, 114 S. Ct. at 1726. The Court \n     held that where a claim ``concerns not a want of \n     [presidential] power, but a mere excess or abuse of \n     discretion in exerting a power given, it is clear that it \n     involves considerations which are beyond the reach of \n     judicial power. This must be since, as this court has often \n     pointed out, the judicial may not invade the legislative or \n     executive departments so as to correct alleged mistakes or \n     wrongs arising from asserted abuse of discretion.''\n       Id. at 1727 (quoting Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South \n     Dakota, ex rel, Pevne, 250 U.S. 163, 184 (1919)); see also \n     Smith v. Reagan, 844 F.2d 195, 198 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \n     488 U.S. 954 (1988); Colon v. Carter, 633 F.2d 964, 966 (1st \n     Cir. 1980); cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985); \n     Chicago Southern Air Lines Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 \n     U.S. 103 (1948).\n       Judicial review is unavailable for claims that the \n     President had erred in his judgment that the program \n     established in the order is unlikely to promote economy and \n     efficiency. The FPASA entrusts this determination to the \n     President's discretion and, under Dalton, courts may not \n     second-guess his conclusion. The Court made it clear that the \n     President does not violate the Constitution simply by acting \n     ultra vires. See Dalton, 114 S. Ct. at 1726-27. Judicial \n     review is available only for contentions that the President's \n     decision not only is outside the scope of the discretion \n     Congress granted the President, but also that the President's \n     action violates some free-standing provision of the \n     Constitution.\n       \\9\\In the 102d Congress, The House of Representatives \n     passed a bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to \n     make it an unfair labor practice for an employer to hire a \n     permanent replacement for a lawfully striking employee. See \n     H.R. 5, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. (1991). The House passed this \n     legislation on a vote of 247-182. See Cong. Rec. H5589 (daily \n     ed. July 17, 1991). The Senate considered legislation to the \n     same effect. See S. 55, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The \n     legislation was not brought to the floor for a vote because \n     supporters of the measure were only able to muster 57 votes \n     to invoke cloture. See Cong. Rec. S8237-38 (daily ed. June \n     16, 1992).\n       Likewise, legislation to categorize the hiring of permanent \n     replacement workers as an unfair labor practice was \n     considered in the 103d Congress. The House of Representatives \n     approved the legislation on a vote of 239-190. See Cong. Rec. \n     H3568 (daily ed. June 15, 1993). Again, the Senate did not \n     bring the bill to a vote, because its supporters were unable \n     to attract the supermajority required to invoke cloture. See \n     Cong. Rec. S8524 (daily ed. July 12, 1994) (fifty-three \n     senators voting to invoke cloture).\n       \\10\\We have found no indication in the legislative history \n     that those opposing the proposed amendments to the NLRA even \n     considered the specialized context of government procurement. \n     See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 110, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. at 33-49 \n     (1993) (stating minority views); H.R. Rep. No. 116, 103d \n     Cong. 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 42-62 (1993) (minority views); H.R. \n     Rep. No. 116, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 16-17 (1993) \n     (minority views); H.R. Rep. No. 116, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., \n     pt. 3, at 11-15 (1993) (minority views). Moreover, we note \n     that at least some of the opposition to the legislation was \n     based in part on concerns regarding the breadth of the \n     legislation, see H.R. Rep. No. 116, pt. 1, at 45 (minority \n     views) (emphasizing absence of ``a truly pressing societal \n     need'' (emphasis added)), as well as its inflexibility, see \n     id. at 62 (views of Rep. Roukema).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will highlight a couple of essential parts of the \nmemorandum.\n\n        On March 6, 1995, we issued a memorandum approving as to \n     form and legality a proposed executive order entitled, \n     ``Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration of \n     Federal Government Contracts.'' On March 8, 1995 the \n     President signed the proposed directive, making it Executive \n     Order No. 12954. This memorandum records the basis for our \n     prior conclusion that the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act vests the President with authority to issue \n     Executive Order No. 12954 in light of his finding that it \n     will promote economy and efficiency in Government \n     procurement.\n\n  I will come back to that issue because I think it is basic to both \nthe rationale for the Executive order and reaches the heart of the \nwhole debate on this issue.\n\n       Executive Order No. 12954 establishes a mechanism designed \n     to ensure economy and efficiency in Government procurement \n     involving contractors that permanently replace lawful \n     striking workers.\n       Executive Order No. 12954, taken as a whole, sets forth a \n     mechanism that closely \n     [[Page S3785]] ties its operative procedures--termination and \n     debarment--to the pursuit of economy and efficiency. The \n     President has made a finding that, as a general matter, \n     economy and efficiency in procurement are advanced by \n     contracting with employers that do not permanently replace \n     lawfully striking employees. Additionally, the President has \n     provided for a case-by-case determination that his finding is \n     justified on the peculiar facts and circumstances of each \n     specific case before any action to effectuate the President's \n     finding is undertaken.\n\n  The rest of the memorandum goes on with citations in support for this \nPresident's authority in a very, I find, persuasive and convincing way.\n  What did the President base his Executive order on? He based it, \neffectively, on the pursuit of economy and efficiency. Procurements are \nadvanced by contracting with employers that do not permanently replace \nlawfully striking employees.\n  So it seems to be appropriate that we give some consideration to what \nhas been happening over the period of recent years with regard to \nvarious disputes involving the permanent replacement of striking \nworkers per year.\n  This chart shows some, I think, very powerful and persuasive evidence \njustifying the Executive order. What we see in this chart is the rather \ndramatic increase in the numbers of strikes in which permanent \nreplacements have been used over the period from 1935 all the way to \n1991. What you do see, particularly, is that in the last 2 or 3 years \nthe numbers have been going up dramatically.\n  Since we find out that they have been going up dramatically, we can \nask ourselves, what has been the result? This chart reflects the \naverage number of strikes involving permanent replacements per year by \ndecade. So it is the concern of the President in connection with \nGovernment purchasing to take notice of the number of strikes that have \nbeen taking place in which permanent replacement strikers have been \nused. This is interesting in reflecting the increased numbers of \nreplacement workers.\n  We have to ask ourselves, why is that important? Why should we take \nnotice of this dramatic increase in permanent replacement strikes? \nWell, it is interesting for this reason, Mr. President. With the \ndramatic increase, we take note that strikes involving permanent \nreplacement workers are substantially longer in duration than other \nstrikes. One study done at the University of Notre Dame indicates that \nstrikes involving permanent replacements last seven times longer than \nstrikes that do not involve permanent replacements.\n  Other evidence suggests that the mere threat to use permanent \nreplacement workers is associated with the longer strikes. So we have \nthis phenomenon, increasing numbers of strikes, which are utilizing the \npermanent replacements, increasing powerful evidence that the strikes \nthemselves last dramatically longer than other labor disputes.\n  Clearly, the President has an important responsibility, primarily in \nthe area of our national defense, to make sure that we are going to be \nable to have our weapons systems and procurement be done in a way that \nis going to meet his responsibilities, to make sure that we are going \nto get good product, good quality, good performance, top-skilled people \nthat are going to be working on the various systems which are so \nimportant to our fighting men.\n  Well, not only are the strikes longer involving permanent strikes, \nbut there is another phenomenon, and that is what has happened to \nproductivity in the areas of where the permanent replacements have \ntaken place. We now know that the number of strikes in which permanent \nstrikers are used has been increasing dramatically, and the strikes \nthemselves last longer. But we can also ask ourselves what has been \nhappening in terms of the productivity in those companies, where they \nhave made the judgment to select permanent replacements.\n  Mr. President, I will just quote part of the findings from research \nby Prof. Julius Getman, professor of law at the University of Texas Law \nSchool to be included in a forthcoming book,\n       The data that I have collected in my study of the Paper \n     Workers strike in Jay, Maine from 1987 to 1988 is strongly \n     supportive of the conclusion that hiring permanent \n     replacement workers is harmful to productivity. This is true \n     not only because the replacement workers are almost certain \n     to lack the experience and know-how of the workers they \n     replace, but because permanent replacement is totally \n     inconsistent with the goal of the labor-management \n     cooperation necessary for improving quality and productivity.\n       * * * In any large enterprise, because of the Laidlaw \n     doctrine, in the period after the strike terminates, \n     significant numbers of former strikers will return.\n       * * * The anger among the groups will inevitably effect \n     productivity. It will make employees suspicious of \n     cooperation and unwilling to take part in new approaches to \n     productivity.\n       * * * Managers, who are aware they will be required to \n     rehire a former striker whenever a replacement worker either \n     quits or is fired, will be loath to impose discipline on the \n     replacement workers or crossovers. If they treat the strikers \n     differently, they commit an unfair labor practice. At the \n     Androscoggin mill all sides agree that the lack of discipline \n     was harmful to productivity.\n\n  Then it continues in the study of the Androscoggin mill, pointing out \nthe difference in atmosphere, the difference in productivity that \nexisted prior to the time of the striker replacements. And drawing the \nconclusion that, on the issue of productivity, there had been a very \nsignificant diminution in the productivity of those companies that use \nthe striker replacements.\n  So, Mr. President, I make the point which is the obvious one that the \nPresident has noted, that there are an increasing number of strikes, \nincreasing number of permanent replacement workers, that productivity \nin those areas deteriorates. And, obviously, the President does have \nthe authority and the power to issue such an Executive order as has \nbeen summarized in the Attornrey General's memorandum.\n  Mr. President, we have been asked earlier about the precedents. Is \nthis Executive order unprecedented? I have an interesting memorandum \nhere, Mr. President, that I have developed that reviews the recent \nExecutive orders that have been done under the Republican Presidents \nand also this one to put it in some proportion. I think in any fair \nevaluation you would find that there is far more excessive use of \nexecutive authority, particularly by President Bush in his Executive \norder basically on the prehire issue, which is basically in conflict \nwith the law itself prohibiting the prehiring agreements, even though \nthe National Labor Relations Act itself specifically permits the \nprehiring agreements.\n  Several Senators from the other side of the aisle took to the Senate \nfloor yesterday to suggest that President Clinton's Executive order \nprohibiting Federal contractors from permanently replacing lawfully \nstriking workers is completely unprecedented. They stated on this \nfloor, as though it were an undeniable fact, that there has never \nbefore been an Executive order that has prohibited Federal contractors \nfrom undertaking an otherwise legal act.\n  Mr. President, these Senators are simply and plainly wrong. And Mr. \nPresident, we do not have to go back very far in our history to prove \nthat they are wrong.\n  In late October 1992 President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12818 \nprohibiting Federal contractors from entering into pre-hire agreements. \nThe agreements are also sometimes called project agreements. Project \nagreements are collective-bargaining agreements commonly used in the \nconstruction industry. They establish labor standards, the terms and \nconditions of employment for workers on construction sites before any \nof the workers are hired. President Bush's Executive order prohibited \nany Federal contractor working on a construction project from entering \ninto a project agreement with a union.\n  President Bush justified this Executive order in many ways. He argued \nthat he wanted to open up the bidding process. He wanted to reduce \ncosts. Some of us took note that he made his announcement just a few \ndays before the Presidential election in 1992 and the fact that \nimmediately after he issued the Executive order he was endorsed by the \nAssociated Builders & Contractors, a well-known lobbying group for \nnonunion and antiunion construction contractors.\n  Regardless of his reasons, President Bush and his allies in this body \nnever tried to suggest that it was unlawful for construction employers \nand unions to enter into project agreements.\n  [[Page S3786]] There is good reason for that, Mr. President. The \nNational Labor Relations Act specifically and expressly permits \nconstruction employer and construction unions to enter into project \nagreements or pre-hire agreements. Permit me to read the relevant \nsection of the National Labor Relations Act, section 8(f).\n\n       (f) [Agreements covering employees in the building and \n     construction industry] It shall not be an unfair labor \n     practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an \n     employer engaged primarily in the building and construction \n     industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or \n     who, upon their employment, will be engaged) in the building \n     and construction industry with a labor organization of which \n     building and construction employees are members (not \n     established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in \n     section 8(a) of this Act [subsection (a) of this section] as \n     an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of \n     such labor organization has not been established under the \n     provisions of section 9 of this Act [section 159 of this \n     title] prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such \n     agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership \n     in such labor organization after the seventh day following \n     the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the \n     agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires \n     the employer to notify such labor organization of \n     opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives \n     such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified \n     applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement \n     specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for \n     employment or provides for priority in opportunities for \n     employment based upon length of service with such employer in \n     the industry or in the particular geographical area: \n     Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the \n     final proviso to section 8(a)(3) of this Act [subsection \n     (a)(3) of this section]: Provided further, That any agreement \n     which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this \n     subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant \n     to section 9(c) or 9(e) [section 159(c) or 159(e) of this \n     title].\n\n  In sum, President Bush's Executive Order No. 12818 not only \nprohibited an otherwise legal practice. It prohibited a practice \nspecifically and expressly protected by the National Labor Relations \nAct.\n  Let us contrast that decision by President Bush with this decision by \nPresident Clinton. This Executive order would prohibit Federal \ncontractors from permanently replacing lawfully striking employees. \nNowhere in the National Labor Relations Act is there any express \nlanguage that gives employers a right to permanently replace lawful \nstrikers.\n  Further, Congress has never spoken on this issue. My distinguished \ncolleague from Texas stated on the floor of this Body yesterday that \nthe Senate had rejected legislation that would have prohibited the use \nof permanent replacements. Once again, the Senator is simply and \nplainly wrong.\n  This body never got the chance to vote on the striker replacement \nlegislation. A majority of Senators were ready to enact a bill that \nprohibited all employers from using permanent replacements. But a \nhandful of Senators from the other side of the aisle filibustered that \nlegislation. They never permitted it to come to a vote. Mr. President, \nthat happened not once, but twice.\n  So, Mr. President, the fact is that there is a precedent for this \nExecutive order. The fact is that this Executive order is well within \nthe President's authority--an authority that Congress has specifically \ndelegated to the President in our procurement laws. The fact is that \nthis amendment interferes with the President's ability to serve as our \nFederal Government's Chief Executive Officer and in that role to assure \nthat the taxpayers get the quality goods and services they deserve in a \ntimely way from reliable Federal contractors.\n  So here we had an action by a former President trying to effectively \noverride the existing statute with an Executive order and we did not \nhear really the complaint at that time about the use of the executive \npowers compared to issuing of the Executive order at the present time \nwhich takes into consideration the very substantial and I find \noverwhelming evidence as to what is happening in contracting in our \ncountry with the use of the permanent striker replacements and the real \ndanger that that presents to the administration or to the taxpayers in \nterms of both the quality and the on-time delivery and the efficiency \nof the various products.\n  I think, when you examine that, you will see the justification, the \nlegal justification and I think the commonsense justification, for the \nissuing of that particular proposal.\n  Mr. President, we heard during the course of the debate yesterday \nanother point that was made, those points being made about why are we \ndoing this; why are we taking this action? Are we really not looking \nout after some special interests when the President issues this \nparticular order?\n  I took the time to review some of the stories where the permanent \nstriker replacements have been actually used and put in place to try \nand get some context for the issuing of this order and what it really \nis all about in human terms.\n  What I have just put in the Record is the memorandum from the Justice \nDepartment that details the legality of this action, looking at \nstatutes and legal precedents. I have also included memoranda and \nstudies that have been done in analyzing what has happened at a number \nof companies that have used permanent striker replacements and I have \nreferred to other studies.\n  But I think it is appropriate, Mr. President, to really take a look \nat who these people are that are being affected, whose lives are being \naffected and families are being affected by the permanent striker \nreplacements.\n  I would like to just take a moment or two to discuss different \nsituations where permanent striker replacements have been used and \nquote from some letters from some of those individuals so we get some \nidea as to what we are talking about here this afternoon, who is really \nbeing benefited, whose lives will be affected and whose will not by \nthis action.\n  Mr. President, there has been a bitter strike going on in California \nthat illustrates many of the points that we have been making about the \neffects of an employer's decision to permanently replace its strikers. \nThe strike at Diamond Walnut pitted a small group of determined women, \nmany working at or near the minimum wage, struggling for dignity \nagainst an employer that sought to cut their wages and eliminate their \njobs.\n  When these workers went out on strike, the company permanently \nreplaced them. The workers' lives were ruined in many cases, and their \nfamilies suffered without money, without health insurance, without the \ncertainty of knowing when they would next have a steady, reliable \nsource of income.\n  If this Executive order had been in effect, Mr. President, Diamond \nWalnut would not have been able to make this ruthless decision to \ndiscard workers--many of whom had worked for the company for 10 or 20 \nyears--without itself suffering the threat of losing millions of \ndollars in contracts with the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government had contracts with this company in terms of \nhelping and assisting in the export of millions and millions of dollars \nof its products overseas.\n  Here we have the American taxpayers' funds being used to help and \nassist this company that has been exploiting its workers.\n  And that is really the issue. It is whether the Federal Government \nwill halt the additional kinds of benefits that it is going to give to \nvarious companies that are committed toward the hiring of the permanent \nstriker replacements. If they are not--even the majority of the other \ncompanies, they are not going to be affected or impacted--but we have \nto ask ourselves if they are going to do that, whether we ought to be \nbenefiting them through various kinds of Federal contracts.\n  Permit me to tell some of the stories of the workers and their \nfamilies that have been devastated by Diamond Walnut's decision to \npermanently replace these strikers. These are the people President \nClinton promised to stand up for.\n  Benny Pacheko was with Diamond for 5 years as a mechanic. Since the \nstrike, he has been going financially backward. He is terribly afraid \nof losing everything, having to sell all of his assets because he \ncannot afford insurance premiums.\n  He writes, ``The mental stress is horrendous. I feel I can't maintain \nwhat I have. All I have worked and saved for is going down the drain.''\n  [[Page S3787]] Benny is on disability due to an industrial accident \nwhile working for Diamond. He cannot get a job because of the effects \nof the accident.\n  ``Thanks,'' he writes, ``from the bottom of my heart for being \nconsiderate and understanding of the situation.''\n  And he talks about how difficult it is to face life every single day.\n  Dorothy Granger was a lift driver for 13 years. This is not a \ntraditional job for women. It is not easy finding work when you are \nover 30 and the work you do is usually done by men. Companies would \nrather hire a man for the job. It is what they are used to. Of course, \nthey will not tell you that.\n\n       The strike is really affecting me financially. Bills are \n     piling up and there's no money to pay them. I need my job. My \n     husband and I are without medical insurance and I pray that \n     nothing goes wrong.\n\n  Here is Gladys White, 47 years old. She started at Diamond in 1973 as \na production worker. After 7 years, she begged to be moved to another \narea. The solvents Diamond used had burned her lungs and had given her \nheadaches constantly. She got her transfer, although she was upbraided \nfor having an active imagination. The chemicals could not possibly have \ncaused her to fall ill, or so her supervisors and company nurses said.\n  But her health continued to deteriorate and in 1989 she was diagnosed \nwith sarcodosis, fibrosis, and tuberculosis. She went out on \ndisability.\n  The strike caused her to lose her health benefits. She has to be on \nmedication which costs $100 per month. She has been denied Social \nSecurity disability.\n\n       My children try to help me, but it is a hardship for them. \n     I am living with them as I cannot afford to live alone.\n\n  And she wants to thank those that are interested in her case.\n  This is another worker named Rachael.\n\n       I was a production worker with Diamond Walnut for 13 years. \n     I have always worked hard and am self-supporting. I have \n     tried looking for another job, but my age is holding me back. \n     People don't want to hire those of us over 40.\n       Being on strike is so stressful. It takes a terrible toll \n     on a person, both mentally and physically. I do not know what \n     will happen from day to day. Without medical insurance I am \n     frightened all the time that I will get sick and have no way \n     to pay for medical treatment and end up losing everything to \n     the State.\n\n  Here is another fellow.\n  Raul, a single father who was with Diamond Walnut for 11 years. He \nwas counting on accrued time to turn into a nice retirement in another \n8 to 10 years.\n  ``I'm starting over,'' he says, ``and I'm too old to start over. I'm \nan electrician and there are lots of openings for electricians out \nthere. But when they come up it is only for one or two positions, and \nthere are hundreds of applications. My age hasn't seemed to be a \nproblem, but then that isn't something they'd tell me to my face.''\n  Meanwhile, he has cashed in his life insurance and his savings bonds. \nHis son was working but has been laid off. His daughter, still in high \nschool, is working as many hours as possible. Her dreams of going to \ncollege are on the shelf now.\n\n       That is what hurts the most. I wanted so much to be able to \n     help her through school. Now, even if she goes to State-\n     funded community college, I can't afford to buy her books. \n     But we're doing okay. We take each day as it comes. We have \n     each other.\n\n  Ray Barbaza, a lift driver, worked his way up to that position over a \nperiod of 12 years. Sole supporter of his family.\n\n       The loss of benefits hit us hard. One time this last year \n     we were all sick. I had to apply for MedCal. That was \n     embarrassing enough, but my son requires special medication \n     and I had to go through every department they could find and \n     get their ``seal of approval.'' They made me feel like trash. \n     Now I know how the homeless feel, having to throw dignity \n     away and picking up the food basket. People should be \n     productive and have pride in their ability, and take care of \n     their own, but when you need help you swallow your \n     humiliation and do what you have to do.\n\n  The stories go on, Mr. President. This was a plant where these \nworkers took reduction of their pay when the company was facing a \ndifficult circumstance. Profits then went up dramatically. They tried \nto get some recovery in terms of their wages and were permanently \nreplaced. The Federal Government comes and helps to assist the \ncompanies. They are making dramatic profits. What has happened \neffectively is most of the workers have been replaced, and those that \nhad been working over a lifetime for those companies are now facing a \nvery grim future indeed.\n  Mr. President, I have some letters here that have been sent to our \nSecretary of Labor, who has been so involved in this issue, as well as \nin the minimum wage issues and other issues affecting working men and \nwomen in this country. He will go down in history, I think, as one of \nthe really extraordinary Secretaries of Labor.\n  He has received a number of letters from men and women, because they \nunderstand how committed he is to their well-being. Secretary Reich has \nbeen kind enough to share three letters that tell the stories of three \nfamilies that have suffered because a Federal contractor has used the \ntaxpayers' money to permanently replace its striking workers.\n  This is on the Bridgestone/Firestone issue. Here is a letter to Mr. \nReich, from Steve Barber.\n\n       I wrote you a letter a few months ago when my URW local 713 \n     went out on strike after negotiations with Bridgestone/\n     Firestone failed. Since then I have been permanently replaced \n     by replacement workers. I have a wife and four children; two \n     children are still at home, we support a daughter in her \n     first year away at college, and our oldest son is serving his \n     country in the U.S. Army.\n       At age 45, after almost 23 years at Bridgestone/Firestone, \n     everything I've worked for is gone. As I walked picket this \n     cold Superbowl night, I saw many young people leaving the \n     plant. They now have my job. My advice to them: Do not start \n     a family, do not get a 30-year mortgage on a home, do not \n     count on retirement or a long-range future with that company. \n     For someday, possibly sooner than in my case, for one reason \n     or another, you, too, will be used and discarded like a paper \n     plate, your youth spent entirely for nothing.\n       I was discarded because I believed I had a legal right to \n     strike in this land of the free and the home of the brave. I \n     was discarded because I belong to a labor union and don't \n     believe in giving up my hard won rights, and I won't cross \n     over into what is now a nonunion plant.\n       The past 7 months I have hoped and prayed this dispute \n     would be fairly resolved. I appreciate the support you, \n     President Clinton and the many other Senators and \n     Congresspeople have given us in trying to find a just \n     solution to this situation. All I ask in closing is that you \n     and President Clinton use any and all the powers at your \n     disposal to end this senseless disruption that has changed \n     and ruined the lives of my family, my fellow workers and my \n     community.\n\n  And here is a second letter:\n\n       Dear Mr. Reich: I am writing to you regarding the \n     Bridgestone/Firestone strike that has been ongoing for the \n     past 6 months. My father is employed by the company, and he \n     is a good father who has always been there for his children. \n     However, he is a very proud man who would find it difficult \n     to ask for help. I, on the other hand, am more than willing \n     to do so.\n       The recent development of Bridgestone/Firestone threatening \n     to fire all of the striking employees and permanently replace \n     them has hit our entire family extremely hard. Although I and \n     my brother and sister are grown and on our own, my father is \n     nearing retirement and greatly needs to know that he will be \n     financially secure in his golden years.\n       We are of the working class and do not have the luxury of \n     worrying about such things as capital gains tax cuts or \n     upper-class frills.\n\n  Needless to say how appropriate this letter is to read, today, after \nwhat we saw the House Ways and Means Committee do yesterday in terms of \nproposing the special consideration for capital gains, the benefits for \nwhich will go to the wealthiest individuals in this country. It is \ninteresting we are debating this issue here that involves men and women \nwho are workers trying to make a go of it to bring up their children, \nto pay their taxes, and to work, and here we are on the other side of \nthe building where we meet this afternoon, just 24 hours ago, seeing \nproposed very substantial, effectively giveaways, to some of the more \nfortunate wealthiest individuals in our country.\n  Now, I get back to the letter.\n\n       Needless to say, we will not receive tax credits for laptop \n     computers. My mother, my siblings, and myself are all \n     teachers with a strong work ethic.\n\n  This is what this whole issue is about. This is about teachers. It is \nabout workers, workers' families, about their children. It is about \npeople that want to be a part of the whole American system.\n\n       However, I now fear all that my father has worked for \n     during the largest portion of his life will be ripped away \n     from him.\n       [[Page S3788]] I know you are aware of this problem as I \n     heard you explain on television that the Government cannot \n     force Bridgestone/Firestone to settle with the union; \n     however, I do feel there is much that can be done. The \n     Government does not have to take a strictly hands off policy \n     as they did not do this with either the Chrysler or savings \n     and loan bailouts. In this case, economic pressures would \n     certainly be a good motivator. Neither our Government nor its \n     citizens should do business with a company who would \n     permanently replace its legally striking work force, nor \n     should they be legally allowed to do so.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. This company wanted to go out and get the \npermanent striker replacements, so be it. All that the Executive order \nis saying is that they are not going to get additional business. We are \nnot going to use additional kinds of taxpayers' funds to help assist \nthis company. It has made that judgment. That is what this issue is all \nabout, in order that we will protect the outcomes of the products that \nare being purchased by the Federal Government, and make sure that they \nwill be top of the line, good products, made by a well-trained and \nwell-disciplined work force.\n  The letter continues:\n\n       I am pleading with you to assist us in our fight which may \n     now seem hopeless in the wake of the November elections. On \n     the other hand, my father always says, ``You can't gain \n     anything worthwhile without a struggle--this country was born \n     in a struggle!'' I urge you to aid us in our struggle until a \n     resolution to this strike is reached and until a law is \n     passed that will protect all striking workers in the future \n     from being replaced.\n      After all, union members should not be persecuted for \n     standing up for what they believe in and going out on a \n     legal strike. Striking is one of the few acts of leverage \n     that union members have to be heard.\n\n  That is from Marilana Hurst.\n  Here is just one other item to the Secretary, a short letter:\n\n       The American factory worker desperately needs help.\n       I need your help.\n       After 26-plus years, I have been permanently replaced by \n     Bridgestone/Firestone at the Decatur, Illinois facility, for \n     no apparent reason.\n       I have a factory-related permanent injury but it in no way \n     affected my position as mold change/cleaner setup person.\n       Since Bridgestone bought our plant we have given scores of \n     concessions, including * * *.\n\n  And he mentions some of the health plan givebacks.\n\n       Our total efforts as union members at 3 of the Bridgestone/\n     Firestone plants have made them some of Bridgestone's most \n     profitable plants, with Decatur, Illinois, Firestone Tire the \n     most profitable tire plant Bridgestone had in the world in \n     1993 according to their own books.\n\n  These are companies that have had enormous success, incredible \nprofits. This is what we are talking about, the extraordinary \nphenomenon that has taken place in this country over the period of \nthese last several years where we have had record profits from so many \nof the companies, for the companies and for individuals. Yet, the \npeople who have not participated in that kind of enhancement of our \neconomy are the men and women who are out there working on the \nfrontline.\n  They are the ones who, in many instances, have given their lives to \ncompanies and plants and factories and then are being discarded. There \nare two kind of employers, as we all understand. There are those who \nbelieve that the workers are an asset, that they should be trained, \nrespected, and be a part of an enterprise with the idea that they are \ngoing to commit themselves to that enterprise and that enterprise is \ngoing to grow and expand.\n  This morning at a forum we held on increasing the minimum wage, we \nheard the extraordinary story of Mr. Curry, who owns three hardware \nstores on the south shore of Massachusetts, and is able to compete with \nthe biggest operations in the country. He starts his people off at $10 \nan hour for a minimum wage with decent benefits. He does not have the \nturnover; he does not have to expend the money to train more people. He \nhas good workers. He does not have absenteeism. He does not have the \nsick days that other companies have, and he provides a savings \nincentive also.\n  A number of those people who have worked there 5 and 6 years now have \nsavings of $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, which they never imagined in the \npast. They are good workers. He has virtually no turnover, and had a \n38-percent increase in sales last year, is able to do a job, and \nrespects every one of the workers. He is not discarding them, throwing \nthem out after a lifetime of dedication and commitment and work.\n  All we are saying is, if you are going to do that, Mr. Corporation, \nif you are going to do that, Mr. Executive, if you are going to treat \nyour people like that, we do not want to support that with American \ntaxpayers' money. We do not want to do it, not just because we do not \nwant to, but because what we see when we do is more disruption, poor \nquality, poor productivity, and poor turnout on many of these items. \nThat is what is unacceptable.\n  I welcome the fact that the President is looking out after the issues \nof quality and productivity and output, particularly with regard to the \nareas of greatest need, and that is in the area of national security \nand defense.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, we produce in my own State of Massachusetts \nat General Electric the engines for the F-15's, F-16's, F-18's, the \nadvance fighter, and many of the best helicopter engines, as well. We \nwant to make sure that the servicemen and women who are flying those \nplanes are going to have the best in terms of the skills of workers who \nknow how to build those engines, not permanent replacements for a few \nbucks cheaper an hour. I want to make sure that those men and women who \nare going to be flying in those planes and using weapons to defend \ntheir lives are going to have the very best. I am not prepared to take \nchances on it. That is what this is all about.\n  The letter I read was from Glen Buckner of Decatur, IL.\n  Mr. President, I will have other letters as well, but the point, I \nthink, has been made, and that is that what we are basically talking \nabout are the interests of working families. We hear so easily bantered \naround, ``Well, this is special-interest legislation for special-\ninterest groups.'' You have heard who these people are. They are the \nmen and women who are on Main Street, USA, who are the backbone of this \ncountry, and have built this Nation and made it the industrial power \nthat it is. They are the ones committed and dedicated and loyal to \ntheir companies and to their corporations and who are trying, after \nthey have tightened their belts and worked with company officials in \norder that the companies survive, to be able to participate in the \nexpansion of the market--oh, no; oh, no; that is not possible.\n  That has been the record across this country. That has been the \nrecord across this country over the period of the last 12 or 15 years. \nThat is something that has been a new phenomenon, and that is why it is \nimportant as well that we have this particular action.\n  Finally, Mr. President, having addressed both the legality of the \nPresident's position and the rationale for the issuance of this \nExecutive order, I reviewed briefly today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Simon, Senator Harkin yesterday, Senator Moseley-Braun, and \nmany others who have talked, the citizens who are really affected by \nit. We now hopefully know who are the ones being impacted, and they are \nthe families across this country, hard-working men and women. These are \nworkers. They are the ones who are prepared to work the 40 hours a \nweek, the 52 weeks of the year. These are the ones who are trying to \neducate their kids, trying to make sure their parents are going to live \nin some peace, some respect, and some dignity, and are facing the \nvarious pressures from all sides, particularly in these past weeks, I \nmight add, that are threatening their lives or their families' lives.\n  That is why I think it is really extraordinary, as I mentioned \nyesterday, why it is that after we in this Congress spent a number of \nweeks debating the unfunded mandates issue, which we should and we did, \nand reached a conclusion on that, and then debated for a series of \nweeks the whole issue on the balanced budget and the changes in the \nConstitution and we have debated that and we reached some judgment and \ndecisions, extremely important measures that we have been focusing on \nand addressing. There may be Members who agree and differ, but \nnonetheless the level and the nature of that debate and discussion was \nclearly motivated by individuals who were pursuing a national interest.\n  The next measure--the next measure--that we are debating on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate is not how we are going to enhance the quality of \nlife of \n[[Page S3789]] working families in this country; not what we are going \nto do about the children in this Nation, the increased numbers living \nin poverty; not what we are going to do about those young teenagers, \nnot about how we are going to enhance their possibilities in schools \nand education; not about the children of working families trying to \nwork their way through college; we are not even talking this afternoon \nabout the security in the communities of these working families; we are \nnot talking about the air they breathe; we are not talking about the \nwater they drink; we are not talking about the quality of life of their \nparents. No, what we are talking about this afternoon is how we are \ngoing to diminish their economic power in being able to fight for a \ndecent wage to provide for their families.\n  That is what we are debating here. We debated it yesterday, and we \nare debating it today. We are going to be debating it on Monday. We are \ngoing to have a cloture vote on that to see how we can jam, how we can \nsqueeze, how we can pressure down the economic rights of working men \nand women. That is what we are debating here.\n  As I mentioned the other day, at the end of the debate today, who \namong us is going to go on back to their house and say, ``Look, I did \nsomething in the U.S. Senate today that is going to give a little more \nhope to children, to a mother in terms of a day-care program.\n We are not going to be able to do all the things we want, but we are \ngoing to do a little something. It is going to be better tomorrow or \nthe next day.'' Or, ``I am going to do something to strengthen the \nquality of education.'' Who is going to leave here tonight believing \nthat? Or, ``I am going to do something that is going to mean greater \neconomic good for the workers of the country.'' Who is going to do it? \nNo one is going to do it.\n\n  What we are going to do, some of us, is go back and say that we tried \nto work for working men and women against an overwhelming onslaught \nthat somehow believes we are out of skew in terms of the power of the \nworking people.\n  I am on the Human Resources Committee. What have we been facing over \nthe period of the last week? Repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act. Let us go \nahead and repeal that act. Who benefits from the Davis-Bacon Act? The \naverage income for working families is $27,000 a year for some of the \ntoughest work in this country, working in construction--$27,000 a year.\n  What in the world have we got against working families that are \nmaking $27,000 a year? Is that what is ringing across this country, we \nhave to undermine their ability to make that amount of money? Is that \nwhat people are crying about? Not in my State of Massachusetts.\n  We are trying to diminish their ability by the changing of just the \nprevailing wages. Maybe there are suggestions and ideas of how to make \nit more efficient. Maybe it has to be adjusted to eliminate paperwork. \nThat is fine. We have had hours of hearings on that.\n  We have had hours of hearings about what they call the 8(a)(2) \nprovisions of Taft-Hartley. What effectively that means is let us \neliminate the real essence of the Taft-Hartley Act so we can eliminate \ncompany unions. Why? Because of the power, the power that is out there \nin the trade union movement?\n  I have difficulty, in reading my mail, seeing that that is something \nof a burning, passionate interest to the people of our State. What they \nwant is decent jobs with good benefits and a good future and doing \nsomething about violence in the community and strengthening education.\n  But, oh, no, here we are trying to do something to undermine workers \nunder Davis-Bacon. We are trying to do something about changing Taft-\nHartley laws, about the power, the power of workers, trying to \nrepresent economic interests of working people.\n  What are we saying? It is all out there. That is part of the things \nwe have been doing in January and February. And then in the meantime \nwhat are we doing about the children of these working families? Well, I \nwill tell you what we are doing. We are cutting back on giving any kind \nof day care support to families. We are cutting right back on that. The \nfamilies that are trying to make it, both parents trying to work, \nneeding a little day care, we are cutting back on that program.\n  And then we have a son or daughter that we would like to be able to \nhelp, because we live in a major city, to make sure that kid over the \ncourse of the summer, for those parents who are working hard to keep \nthem in school, make sure you try to keep them out of trouble. Oh, no, \nwe are cutting all the summer jobs programs, not only for this summer \nbut the summer beyond that. We cannot wait to do that. Cut that out, \ntoo. Cut that out, too.\n  So now we have done that. And just by the way, if you happen to have \na child, because you are out there working, who happens to get into a \ngood community college or State college, you have, as in my State, the \nhighest public college tuition in the country under my Governor. We had \nan excellent university system. In those budget cuts, we are sticking \nit in Massachusetts to college students with higher fees and higher \ntuition. So we are No. 3 in the country in terms of the costs going up.\n  But we are not satisfied at what has happened up there. We are going \nto say that anyone who borrows the money is going to have to also pay \nthe interest for that borrowing while they are in school. And in the \nmeantime, you might have the idea you want to work while you are in \nschool in a work-study program. Who qualifies for work-study programs? \nMiddle-income working families. We are going to eliminate that as well. \nYou are going to have to pay more, and we are going to deny you the \nopportunity to work while you are going to school.\n  Mr. President, you have to ask yourself what has happened out there, \nwhat has happened across our society, that we are declaring war? That \nis what this is. We will have seen battlegrounds in countries that have \nbeen at war that will be not as adversely impacted as what we are doing \nto working families, to their children, the very small.\n  I have not even mentioned cutting back on the WIC programs. I have \nnot even mentioned cutting back on the school lunch programs, cutting \nback in terms of special education for economically disadvantaged, \ncutting back on their teachers. We have not even talked about that out \nhere.\n  So not only are we diminishing the power of those who are attempting \nto work and want to work--two members of that family--we are after \ntheir children, the very small, the most vulnerable, those in their \nearly teens who may need that opportunity to begin working when they \nare 13, 14, and 15 in programs that bring together the public and \nprivate sectors in extraordinarily cooperative ways as they have done \nin Boston, MA, the great, great cooperation in the public and private \nsector, as they have in education with the Boston compact that \nbasically says to any kid that is able to gain entrance into college, \nthey are prepared to raise the funds to augment and supplement that \nprogram so that kid can go on into school and college, the public and \nprivate sector working together. We are drawing that right on back. We \nare unraveling it, pulling the threads on those kinds of agreements and \ncontracts.\n  On a Friday afternoon, with the American public as concerned as they \nare about the state of our economy, with more hopeful news today as we \nhave seen unemployment go down across our Nation with some 350,000 new \njobs which have been created, we are out here now talking about how we \nare going to undermine the working families.\n  Mr. President, I have not even mentioned the suggestions that have \nbeen made, as I look over and see my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia, who has been such an advocate on the health care issue, I \nhave not even mentioned the kind of concern that must be out there for \nall of our senior citizens when they read the articles in the newspaper \nby our friend and colleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \ntalking about the hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare cuts that \nthey are going to pursue in the period of this Congress that are going \nto impact our senior citizens.\n  And the other side of that, Mr. President, is to do what with them? \nGive tax advantages to the wealthiest companies and corporations and \nindividuals. Now, that is the view that many working men and women must \nlook at in \n[[Page S3790]] terms of where we are in the Congress. It is not a \nhopeful picture.\n  Mr. President, I am sure they are asking why, what did they ever do, \ntrying to provide for their families, what did they ever do to deserve \nthat kind of a threat? It is difficult enough, difficult enough, if you \nare looking at the real incomes of working families, the working poor, \nthe lower--the four-fifths effectively, most dramatically in the three-\nfifths of our various tax filings, but almost four-fifths that have \nbeen constantly going down, constantly falling further behind.\n  Here we are out on the floor of the Senate with a proposal which says \nthat if the company is going to have permanent strike replacements, we \nare not going to give them additional kinds of Federal largesse. And we \nhave those who are so antiworker they are prepared to hold up the \ndefense appropriations bill and to have us spending days here, which I \nwelcome the opportunity to do, to speak for the working families. But \nwe take up the time of the Senate to do it.\n  Mr. President, it just is unwise to attempt to tamper with the \njustification, legality, or public policy purpose for the President's \nExecutive order. I will look forward to having more to say about it \nlater in the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I just listened, as I always do, very \nclosely to my friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and not \nonly identify myself with what he says but the compassion with which he \nsays it, and the persistence. He never quits. There is no Senator in \nthis body or in the recent history of this body who ever fought so hard \nfor so many things so constantly, whatever the hour, the day or the \nnight, than the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  He has been talking a lot because not enough of us have come down to \nthe floor to help him. You can hear the hoarseness in his voice. I have \nheard cracks in his voice, and they have been when he has spoken at the \nfunerals of, most recently, his mother, and to mourn the death of his \ntwo brothers, Robert and John. I heard cracks in his voice then. He did \nhis best to prevent that, and then, at the end, could not quite avoid \nit. And I think we all sort of wanted that to happen so we could share \nin his grief.\n  But if you hear cracks in his voice now it is because he is fighting \njust for what they would fight for. But he is tired. His voice is \ntired, but his spirit is not. I respect him.\n  There is a fellow sitting next to him by the name of Nick Littlefield \nwho ought to be a Senator in this body from somewhere. He is Senator \nKennedy's chief of staff and he is everywhere where he needs to be. His \noptimism and his fighting spirit is matched, obviously, by the man with \nwhom he works. But there is not any good cause or battle that Nick \nLittlefield will stay away from. So with the two of them on this floor \nall by themselves except for the junior Senator from West Virginia, I \nam proud to be down here this afternoon.\n  That is not to say I do not have a great deal of respect for the \nPresiding Officer who, I expect if he wanted to mix it up, would do \npretty well, too. Although I suspect we might be on different sides on \nthis particular issue.\n  Mr. President, everything he said is true, I might say to the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts. I hope that come next Sunday he will see \n1,000 children bused in from all over this country, being fed by \nMembers of the Congress--dinner, lunch--and then joining hands with \nMembers of Congress, literally surrounding the Capitol. Literally hands \naround the Capitol--little children and children not so young--but all \nchildren who are about to have their hot lunches taken away or their \nbreakfasts taken away or something else taken away from them by the \nzeal that exists around here to cut back on what is necessary for some \npeople in our country to survive and to live while finding ways to \nincrease the wealth of some of us who, frankly, do not need a whole lot \nmore.\n  It is all very perplexing to me. I grew up in one party, the \nRepublican Party. I became a Democrat at the time that President John \nF. Kennedy was President because I worked in the Peace Corps. Then I \nworked for the State Department, then VISTA. But over these past couple \nof months, this period of time alone has made me understand--not that I \nhad to--why I did what I did and became a Democrat.\n  Because we are talking about lives at stake in the matter of this \nKassebaum amendment. We are talking about situations where I myself \nhave seen families torn apart.\n  Probably one of the most famous examples of strikers being replaced--\nat least in the recent years, and maybe not the most famous, but the \nmost famous to me--took place in West Virginia, at a place called \nRavenswood Aluminum. It lasted a year and a half. It was terribly \nbitter. It was terribly dangerous. It was so dangerous that people \nwanted to stay away from the area.\n  The Ravenswood story is about people of West Virginia who are not \nnecessarily born with a silver spoon when they are born. They have to \nwork. So when Ravenswood locked out its own workers, and replaced them \nwith something called permanent replacements, we literally saw \nsituations in families with a striker-replacer brother and a striking \nbrother; or brother/sister, in the same household. Husband/wife; \nbrother/sister; uncle/nephew. Those scars still exist, and the anger \nand what it did to that community have not yet fully healed.\n  I gave a speech there not long ago. That community has not yet \nrecovered. That is what they still talk about and the crisis was \nseveral years ago.\n  So I associate myself with what my friend from Massachusetts has \nsaid. I also want to note the irony, which I think he perhaps raised \nbefore but I did not hear it, and that is the irony that the Kassebaum \namendment is holding up a package before us to reduce the deficit and \nsupplement the Defense Department.\n  Let me start by emphasizing that this question posed by Senator \nKassebaum's amendment is clearly stalling the passage of a bill which \nhas enormously broad support for very obvious reasons. The Kassebaum \namendment has slowed down a bill that would cut the Federal deficit by \n$1.5 billion as soon as it is signed into law. I do not know how long \nit takes to print up a bill and send it over to the White House, but I \nexpect it could be by Monday or Tuesday. The President would sign it \nand the deficit would go down $1.5 billion as a result.\n  We have been here for the last several weeks and month or more \ndebating deficit reduction. How to do it, by an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution? Or by human endeavor?\n  The Kassebaum amendment has slowed down a bill that will make our \nmilitary forces more capable of dealing with national security \nemergencies or dangers, which is something not only folks on this side \nof the aisle talk about, but almost to a person the folks on that side \ntalk about constantly. This will not happen for as long as this \namendment prevents it from happening.\n  So let us be very sure that the American people understand what is in \nfact going on, on this floor. A week and 1 day ago, 28 Senators put \ntogether this bill, to both replenish critical parts of the budget for \nthe Defense Department and cut Government spending in order to reduce \nthe deficit. We could have passed that bill yesterday. Everybody was \nhere. It is hard to do that today because very few people are here. We \ncould have appointed Senate negotiators to work out the final details \nwith the House. They could have met over the weekend. I expect they \nwould have met over the weekend. They would have been meeting today. \nThey probably could have reached an agreement today--and seen the \nFederal deficit come down as a result, after the President's pen struck \nthe bill and signed his name.\n  But instead we have an effort to strengthen our military forces and \nto cut Government spending being held up by this amendment that has \nabsolutely nothing to do with either of these critical objectives.\n  I find that ironic, I have to say. I just find that ironic. It is \nincredible to me to see this impasse over a deficit reduction bill \nafter every single Senator on the other side of the aisle, except for \none lone voice, who some want to drive from his party, spent more than \na \n[[Page S3791]] month demanding the passage of a constitutional \namendment because they felt so clearly that there could be no other way \nto reduce the deficit.\n  The fervor on the other side of the aisle over the balanced budget \ndebate was remarkable. There was an awesome display of unity and \nsinglemindedness. Once again, we are seeing proof that the balanced \nbudget amendment is a very different matter than actually cutting \nGovernment waste. It is one thing to talk about it. It is another thing \nto do it--it's another thing to actually take tangible, real steps to \ncut that budget deficit. We are ready to do it. So if my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are so determined to really deal with the \ndeficit, then why are they throwing up roadblocks to this amendment, \nwhich is an Executive order of substantial simplicity, which I will get \ninto in a moment?\n  The Senate, although I suspect we could convince very few Americans \nof it, particularly when we do things like this, is not a political \nconvention. It is supposed to be the place where we use our powers, our \nbrains, our judgment, our convictions to get important work done.\n  I thought we had agreed on the need for this bill before us. In fact, \n28 Senators last week, by a unanimous vote in the Appropriations \nCommittee, did agree on that. That is where I understand 28 Senators to \nbe--Republicans and Democrats--unanimous in their support for this \nbill. All the Senators who voted for this bill agreed that military \nreadiness and deficit reduction should take priority over everything \nelse that could take place during the course of this week. Nothing \ntranscended that in importance, a proper judgment by both political \nparties.\n  But I guess that is not the case with some of our colleagues. I guess \nI am wrong. Instead, we have to burn up time talking about an amendment \nthat tries to stop the President from doing something that is quite \nsimple, that deserves support from both business and working families.\n  The President's Executive order, which this amendment attacks and \nseeks to defeat, is an effort to impose a basic condition on Federal \ncontracts that by definition are financed by American taxpayers. We are \nnot even talking about totally private arrangements. The condition in \nthe Executive order says that businesses that want Federal contracts--\nand there is no law saying that a business has to seek Federal \ncontracts--should not be ones that deal with valid, legal labor \ndisputes by hiring workers to permanently replace their own employees.\n  The President's Executive order does not take away a business' \nability to hire temporary replacements when dealing with a dispute. I \nrepeat: If there is a labor dispute or a strike, a business can hire \ntemporary workers for the duration of the dispute or the strike. And, \ntherefore, this order does not expect a business to stop production. \nThis order does not expect to close one iota of anybody's operations \ndown or do anything to lose one dime of business. It simply upholds the \nprinciple that when the law--that is, the Federal law--gives workers a \nright to collectively bargain, or the right to protest conditions or \npractices, then employers do not have the right to punish those workers \nby eliminating their jobs for good.\n  That is not very complicated. I do not think that is particularly \ndifficult to swallow. In fact, it was something that was fairly broadly \naccepted in the business community until all of a sudden it suddenly \nbecame an issue because some people wanted to make it one, and it has \nbeen one ever since.\n  So we have these votes more or less on an annual basis. We have a \nFederal law that gives workers the right to collectively bargain. That \nis established fact in this country. Some people like that. Some people \ndo not like that. But that is the law. And it is available to anyone \nwho collectively bargains.\n  They have the right to protest conditions. Well, I work in a State, \nand so do the rest of us, where conditions are not what they ought to \nbe in a few places. Since all of us here in the collective body politic \ntend to get around our States a great deal, visiting plants and \nfacilities, we see situations like this unless we close our eyes. We \nsee situations like this. It is not very often, but we do see them and \nwe do know that in our hearts. We know that.\n  So if workers lawfully and legitimately protest unsafe conditions or \npractices, then employers do not have the right to punish those workers \nby permanently eliminating their jobs. Replace the workers while the \ndispute is going on, that is permissible. Operations do not cease. \nProfits do not cease.\n  If you come to West Virginia and you have 100 job offers--at a Rite-\nAid Drugstore or somewhere else--you will get 1,000 to 1,500 \napplicants, Mr. President. I suspect in some parts of the State of the \nPresiding Officer, that is true, too. It is uplifting in one way. It is \njust incredibly sad in another. People are so hungry to work that 1,500 \npeople turn out for 50 jobs, jobs that often do not offer any health \nbenefits. But they are jobs and they are better than not having jobs, \nand people want to work in both the State of Pennsylvania and the State \nof West Virginia. So people turn up.\n  This Executive order does not and cannot prohibit permanent \nreplacements in all labor disputes. It simply says to businesses that, \nif you want to benefit from Federal contracts paid for by the \ntaxpayers, you need to uphold certain standards, standards long \nestablished, long followed, long not disputed, accepted until all of a \nsudden they became an issue. The American people are constantly telling \nus they want Congress to get their money's worth when taxes are spent \non Government programs and contracts and benefits.\n  Mr. President, I would argue that the Executive order is designed to \ndo exactly that. Look at the research. It is a fact. Strikes involving \npermanent replacements last seven times longer than strikes that do not \ninvolve permanent replacements. So that is seven times more grief and \neconomic and personal and family and community agony that need not be. \nThose are the facts.\n  If there are permanent replacements, the strikes, the worker \ndisputes, the worker-management disputes will go on seven times longer. \nStrikes involving permanent replacement workers tend to be much more \nhostile, much more painful for both sides, and often turn what could be \na fairly brief period of disagreement and negotiation into a much \nlonger and often, I am sorry to say, violent impasse: gunshots, attacks \non the roads, baseball bats, intimidation from both sides.\n  Permanently replacing striking employees can mean trading in \nexperienced, skilled workers for inexperienced men and women. It does \nnot have to mean that. It does not always mean that. But it can mean \nthat. That is not to the advantage of anyone either, particularly if \nthe business wants to continue to make a profit, to do well, and to \ncompete on an international basis.\n  Mr. President, asking businesses that want Federal contracts to \nresist dealing with labor-management disputes in ways that are more \ncostly, in ways that are more contentious and contrary to the principle \nof collective bargaining and cooperation, is not something that should \nbe holding up a deficit reduction and military readiness bill, in this \nSenator's opinion.\n  I suggest to all of my colleagues that it is not in anybody's \ninterest to struggle over the issue of replacement workers with so much \nblustering conflict amongst ourselves. Congress should be encouraging \ncooperation and doing everything we can. That is what all of the study \ngroups on competitiveness tell us to do. We should encourage \ncooperation between both management and labor and between business and \nworkers. We should treat the idea of collective bargaining as a \nfriendly and, frankly, a very American concept.\n  There is nothing wrong, Mr. President, with collective bargaining. It \nis the way that people improve their conditions. It has a stark \npattern. I remember going to South Korea 10 years ago. They did not \nreally have any labor unions in South Korea 10 years ago. As of about 2 \nor 3 years ago, they had over 3,000. What has happened? Yes, there have \nbeen some incidents, some strikes, and that is natural as a labor union \nand a company try to come to terms with each other. Wages have started \nto increase, conditions have started to improve. The national wealth of \nSouth Korea is now growing enormously. Japan went through this. I spent \n3 years as a university student in Japan, at a time when labor was not \n[[Page S3792]] strong, and then it became strong and now Japan has a \nhigher industrial wage than the United States. The average worker makes \nmore money there than they do here. And Japan is not particularly known \nas a country that is hard to do business with, if you get along with \nthe Japanese. If you are an American company it could be harder, but \namongst themselves, they do well.\n  So we should not treat the idea of collective bargaining as some kind \nof bizarre concept. It is inherent to the roots of this country and, \nquite frankly, I do not know where we would be without it. If half of \nthis body really wants to encourage employers to resist problem solving \nand dispute resolution by hiring permanent replacements, then that is \nencouraging more conflict in the workplace and in our communities. \nAgain, strikes are seven times longer where permanent replacements \nbecome the issue.\n  As I indicated before, I have great, painful knowledge about what \nhappens in these situations. If you go to the community of Ravenswood, \nWV, a beautiful community in Jackson County, right by the Ohio river, \nemployers were deciding whether to lock out their own workers, 1,700 of \nthem--that is an enormous work force in that part of West Virginia--\nwith permanent replacements. They made that decision. Everybody in West \nVirginia, including this Senator, watched the hurt that this labor \ndispute caused; it was genuine hurt--this is not a political speech. It \nwas a genuine hurt within families. Families were just torn apart \nbecause, on the one hand, the need to work, and on the other hand, the \nneed to play fair. This tore families asunder, and it was real. \nFamilies still do not speak to each other because of this issue. We \nwatched this for over a year and a half in West Virginia, a State that \ncan ill afford to have 1,700 people not working because an employer had \nthe ability to punish its workers this way, and this employer tried \nvery hard to punish his workers that way. It was violent and it was \nscary, and it hurt the image of West Virginia badly. We will never know \nhow many families might have been saved from financial ruin, if the \nemployer would have simply dealt with the labor dispute and gotten it \nresolved quickly.\n  Mr. President, I truly do not believe Republicans in the Senate need \nto take up the cause of businesses that want the power to punish \nworkers with something called permanent replacements. We are talking \nabout a relatively few number of businesses--the relatively few who, in \na strike, will decide to punish in this extreme manner. Sometimes an \nemployer will take this action during the course of the dispute and \nsometimes that will be the purpose of the dispute from the very \nbeginning--to break the union, or something else. But it is the few. It \nis not many. But when it happens, it is awful. So we are not talking \nabout a typical situation; we are talking about a very untypical \nsituation. That excessive power simply is not necessary. The Executive \norder under attack by the Kassebaum amendment would still retain any \nbusiness' lawful ability to bring in temporary workers, while a labor \ndispute or strike is getting resolved. But the point is that we should \nencourage cooperation, we should encourage resolutions to conflicts.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both come from States where there is a \nlot of coal mining. I can remember the days when, in my State, there \nwere constant things called ``temporary restraining orders'' going \nbefore judges. Every time there was a dispute at the face of a mine \nbetween a worker and management over some little issue, or some big \nissue, the first thing they did--and the parallel is in the tort reform \nbill, where I expect the Presiding Officer and I will be on the same \nside--the first thing they did was call a lawyer and go to court. Then, \nof course, everybody got hostile and anxious, and the dispute went on \nforever, and no coal got mined and people did not make money and people \ncould not put food on the table. The temporary restraining order--\nwhatever happened in court--would be appealed.\n  Finally, management and workers decided in the coal industry in our \nState to simply say this is ridiculous, we are both losing. They sat \ndown and worked out a way of working out their disagreements, which was \nto say that when a dispute occurred over a working condition or some \nrule or something at the face of a mine, which is underground where the \nwall of coal is, that the worker and the foreman at that area simply \ntalked and worked it out right there. They agreed, workers and \nmanagement, that this would be the system. I may have to fault my \nmemory on this, but I think for 8 or 10 years, we had no temporary \nrestraining orders whatsoever. Mining employers and workers simply \ndecided that they were going to improve labor-management relations and \nthey wanted it to work better. They wanted to be able to export coal \nwhich meant Japan, South Korea, and Canada had to depend upon the coal \ncoming. Therefore, there had to be dependability and consistency that \nwas in the interest of both workers and management. So they settled \ntheir disputes. I am talking about nothing different here.\n  But even if there is a situation where there is a labor dispute, \nstill a company can bring in replacement workers until the dispute is \nresolved. The point is, we should encourage the cooperation and \nresolutions to conflicts. We should try to prevent painful, costly, \ndivisive situations that break out--in Ravenswood and the other \ncommunities that have been discussed on the floor over the past day or \nso.\n  Again, I cannot understand why the President of the United States \nshould not be allowed to condition Federal contracts on practices that \nwould make us more sure that taxpayers' money would be spent \nefficiently. The logic of that, again, is where you do not have \npermanent replacements you have much shorter labor disputes by a factor \nof 7 and, therefore, money is saved for the taxpayers.\n  There is a lot of talk on this floor about playing by the rules. This \nSenator does some of it and a lot of Senators do some of it. Should not \nthe President of the United States be able to suggest that businesses \nthat want Federal contracts play by the rules as well? I mean, is that \nnot reasonable? It is very obvious from statistics that workers and \ntheir families do not want to resort to strikes. When has there been a \nstrike that has not been destructive of workers' interests, and \nespecially in the short term?\n  People, generally, in this country want to work hard and make a good \nincome and support their families. People have no choice but to work \nhard. But when the rare dispute breaks out, they should not have to \nfear the elimination of their jobs just because of a disagreement over \nwages or health benefits or safety standards. And I believe that \ndeeply.\n  The Kassebaum amendment should be defeated on many grounds. It is a \ndisruption to the first time this year that this body has finally been \nable to do something real about the Federal deficit and Government \nspending. The amendment is an effort to take the President's ability \naway to set some practical standards on how Federal contracts are given \nout. And this amendment will only encourage more labor-management \nconflict and strife, and everybody here knows that. If this amendment \nprevails there will be more of it which is not in anyone's interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside the divisive tactics over issues \nthat have to do with workplace and with relations between business and \nworkers. Ask the families in Ravenswood, WV, what happened when an \nemployer is allowed to respond to a labor dispute with permanent \nreplacements. The answer is pain. The answer is suffering. And it is \nall totally unnecessary.\n  Everyone in the Senate should take a fresh, objective look at this \nissue, which is very hard for people to do. The lines are so set on it. \nToo many people here stopped actually thinking about this issue long \nago and took positions. And in this case, I think that those who oppose \nthis would do well to take a fresh look and not think about who is on \nthe side of business and who is on the side of organized labor and what \nkind of points can we build up. That is irrelevant. All 100 of us \nshould be on the side of cooperation. All 100 of us should be working \nto uphold the law that grants workers the right to collectively \nbargain. All 100 of us should insist that we get on with the job that \nthe bill before us is about, which is called reducing the Federal \ndeficit and increasing our national security.\n  I feel a special sense of obligation, I say to the Presiding Officer, \nbecause I \n[[Page S3793]] voted against the balanced budget amendment. I feel a \nspecial sense of obligation to get about the business of deficit \nreduction. I mean, there will be some areas where I will disagree with \nthe majority, but there will be many areas where I will agree. I feel \nan obligation. Reducing the deficit helps the people of my State, too, \nin terms of future generations. Just as I think it was wise not to \ninclude, hopefully not to include, Social Security in any budget \nbalancing effort, because people have a right to retire with dignity \nand confidence.\n  So I hope this amendment will be defeated. I think that is important. \nThis issue comes up every year and I know it is treated sort of \nautomatically by both sides. But it is not an automatic issue. It is an \nextremely real and personal one. It has to do with the fundamental \nrights of people. It is not something which happens that often. We \ncreate more havoc in taking up this fight every year than if we let the \nPresident simply go out and do what Presidents ought to be able to do \nin the interest of business and working people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKassebaum amendment.\n  I must admit, Mr. President, that in listening to some of the debate \ntoday, I have felt like I am in a time warp. Congress has had this \ndebate last year, the year before last. We have been here before. And, \nin earlier debates on legislation that would have prevented employers \nfrom using permanent replacements during an economic strike, that \nlegislation did not pass.\n  Notwithstanding Congress' failure to pass this legislation, it's \nback. The President has gone ahead on his own and by Executive order \nunilaterally imposed a major overhaul of labor law on Federal \ncontractors.\n  I know there has been discussion on the floor on Executive orders \nissued by Republican administrations, but there cannot be any doubt \nthat the current effort is unprecedented: This Executive order does not \nuphold existing law--it voids it.\n  I would urge my colleagues on both sides of labor issues to think \ntwice about the type of precedent that this creates. This Executive \norder relies on the fact that use of replacements purportedly lengthens \nlabor disputes. Does that mean that our next President can come along \nand by Executive order outlaw the right to strike by employees of \nFederal contractors?\n  The Executive order issued this week does not uphold rights \nguaranteed under law; it abrogates them. And the President's striker \nreplacement policy is not merely an exercise of procurement \nprerogative, it regulates private labor relations and restricts private \nrights guaranteed under law.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support Senator Kassebaum's amendment \nto withhold funds for this Executive order's implementation and \nenforcement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The practice of permanently replacing workers who are \nexercising their right to strike, as guaranteed by longstanding Federal \nlabor law, is wrong. It is wrong to punish striking workers for \nexercising their rights, and it is wrong to use replacement workers to \ndisrupt the collective bargaining process.\n  Since 1935, the National Labor Relations Act has expressly protected \nthe right of workers to strike over economic conditions. Moreover, the \nact promises workers that they cannot be discharged by their employer \nfor exercising this right.\n  Under current interpretations of the law, employers are not violating \nthe National Labor Relations Act when they hire replacement workers \nduring a strike and promise to make those positions permanent. Rather, \nthese employers are taking advantage of a true anomaly in Federal labor \nlaw, one which sets out a dubious distinction between firing a striking \nworker and permanently replacing that worker.\n  To the worker, however, it is of little comfort to know that he or \nshe has been permanently replaced rather than fired. The result in both \ncases is the same, and the right to strike becomes a right to lose your \njob.\n  I believe strongly that the Congress must pass legislation to get rid \nof this anomaly in Federal labor law. Unfortunately, a minority of the \nSenate was able to block passage of such a bill last year.\n  Having said that, however, I must emphasize that the President is not \nattempting to do by Executive order what Congress was prevented from \ndoing last year.\n  There can be no disagreement that our Founding Fathers entrusted \nCongress with the power to adopt the laws of the land. To the executive \nbranch, they assigned the duty of implementing those laws.\n  If the Executive order issued by President Clinton upset this balance \nof power, I would strongly oppose it. But it does not.\n  Rather than usurping the policymaking role of the Congress, this \nExecutive order sets out the terms under which the executive branch \nwill fulfill its own constitutional role.\n  Implementing the laws passed by Congress involves the procurement of \ngoods and services by the Federal Government. To do this, the Federal \nGovernment enters into contracts with suppliers, as any business would \ndo.\n  In these dealings, the Government wants the same things that \nbusinesses want: a quality product, a reasonable price, dependable \nservice. And like any business, the Federal Government selects the \nsuppliers it believes are best able to meet these objectives.\n  Indeed, with precious taxpayer dollars at stake, I'm sure most \nAmericans want the Government to do business with only the most stable \nand reliable companies.\n  Are companies that replace their workers during a lawful labor \ndispute the most stable and reliable suppliers for the executive \nbranch? The President--the CEO of the executive branch--has determined \nthat they are not.\n  The use or threatened use of permanent replacement workers makes \nstrained labor-management relations even more contentious. In fact, \ndisputes involving replacement workers last seven times longer than \ndisputes that do not.\n  A company that replaces its workers during an ongoing dispute is \ntrading in its experienced employees for inexperienced ones. This \nnecessarily raises questions about the timeliness of delivery and \nquality of product these replacement workers will produce.\n  Should the Federal Government take a gamble on products that might \nnot be up to snuff? The President has determined that it should not.\n  let's not forget that NASA and the Defense Department spend a large \npercentage of the Federal Government's total procurement dollars. When \nit comes to space and defense programs, it is critical that these \ndollars go to contractors of the highest caliber.\n  On the other hand, it must be noted that this Executive order will \nnot prevent the Defense Department or any other Federal agency from \ncontracting with the supplier that best fits its needs.\n  In fact, the order specifically guarantees the flexibility of an \nagency to enter into contracts with companies that have been debarred \nby the Secretary of Labor if a compelling reason can be shown.\n  My Republican colleagues are suggesting that President Clinton has \ntaken an extraordinary step by issuing this Executive order. On the \ncontrary, Executive orders have been used throughout the years by \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents alike to set forth important \npolicies of the Federal Government.\n  And addressing the issue of labor-management relations in an \nExecutive order is not new, either. President Reagan did it in 1981 \nwhen he permanently banned the striking PATCO members from returning to \ntheir jobs as air traffic controllers.\n  And President Bush did it twice in 1992 when he issued Executive \norders to prohibit the use of prehire agreements on Federal \nconstruction contracts and to require Federal contractors to post \nnotices with regard to union membership.\n  What it comes down to, then, is this: President Clinton has revised \nthe executive branch's procurement policy--nothing more. And he has \ndone it in a way that will help ensure that the Federal Government \nobtains the best goods and services it possibly can from its suppliers.\n  [[Page S3794]] If the chairwoman of the Senate Labor Committee \ndisagrees with this policy, she should introduce legislation to \noverturn it.\n  That bill should be the subject of hearings by her committee and \nconsidered through the normal legislative process, not tacked on to a \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The chairwoman is attempting her own end run around the legislative \nprocess. I urge my colleagues to reject this effort and to get down to \nbusiness with what is a very important measure to our national defense.\n              impact of rescission on doe cleanup program\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns \nabout the impact this rescission will have on DOE's nuclear weapons \ncleanup effort. The bill we have on the floor today reduces current \nyear money for the cleanup program by $100 million. Other amendments \nbeing discussed may add to this cut. And we see where the House energy \nand water appropriations bill will reduce this year's funds for the \nprogram by an additional $45 million.\n  Quite simply, if this trend continues one outcome can be guaranteed. \nThe cost to the taxpayer to complete the DOE cleanup--over the life of \nthe program--will increase dramatically. By dragging our heels and \nrefusing to adequately fund this program, we stretch out the time it \nwill take and will increase the overall cost--not to mention the \nincreased risks to workers and the public who may be exposed to \nradiation as a result of these delays.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to discuss up front what the \nDOE cleanup budget is and is not. The majority of DOE's cleanup budget \nis dedicated to simply maintaining millions of tons of radioactive \nwaste and scrap and thousands of contaminated facilities in a \ntemporarily safe and secure condition while we try to figure out what \nto do with this material over the long haul.\n  Let me repeat that. The majority of the DOE cleanup budget doesn't \nactually pay for anything to be cleaned up. The majority of DOE's \ncleanup budget pays for things like waste management and nuclear \nmaterials and facilities stabilization. While there are most certainly \nways to reduce these so-called landlord costs--and DOE, under Secretary \nO'Leary and Assistant Secretary Grumbly are actively seeking ways to do \njust that--these costs simply cannot be wished away, nor reduced \nentirely. Only about one-quarter of the cleanup budget pays for \nenvironmental restoration, or actual cleanup.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues may be interested in learning \nwhat the fastest growing part of DOE's environmental budget actually \nis. I can tell them what it is not. It is not environmental \nrestoration. In fact the fastest growing portion of DOE's cleanup \nbudget is the category of nuclear materials and facilities \nstabilization. This category represents costs to maintain closed \nnuclear weapons production facilities in a stable mode until their \nfinal decontamination. These costs are often referred to as landlord \ncosts. They represent administrative costs, utility costs, and unique \nsafety related costs that are absolutely necessary to maintain whether \nthe facility is\n operating or shutdown. These costs only go off the books when the \nfacility is finally decommissioned.\n\n  Over the last several years, as policy decisions have been made to \nshut down these production facilities, these landlord costs have been \ntransferred to the Environmental Management Program from the Defense \nProgram within DOE. DOE's fiscal year 1996 budget request illustrates \nthis process issue vividly. The fiscal year 1996 budget request for the \nEnvironmental Management program includes $843 million to manage former \ndefense facilities at Savannah River, Mound, and Pinellas which no \nlonger have a production mission. Prior to this year's budget, these \ncosts were born by DOE's Defense programs office. Budget cutters should \nkeep this fact in mind when examining the Environmental Management \nbudget. The scope of work--the number of facilities, people, and \ninventory which must be managed--within the EM program has expanded \ndramatically over the past several years.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleague may know, my legislative and \noversight work in environment, safety and health issues grew out of my \nconcern about the condition of our country's nuclear weapon production \ncomplex. Ohio happens to be the location of 3 of the 17 major \nfacilities in the United States which, over the past 45 years, produced \nthe U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. These 17 facilities are the ones we \nusually hear about when we talk about the DOE cleanup program--places \nlike Fernald, Hanford, Savannah River, Rocky Flats, Los Alamos. \nHowever, many of my colleagues will be interested to find out that \nthere are literally scores of sites around the country that fall under \nDOE's cleanup program. Most of these are associated in some way with \nthe nuclear weapons program; however, some are associated with the \nnuclear navy program and others with energy research activities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the Department \nof Energy's cleanup sites--some 137 sites located in 34 states--be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  DOE EM SITES                                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            ST #                           Location                        Installation/Site                *   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAK-1........................

Mr. President, in the early 1980's I chaired hearings \nwhich revealed serious worker safety and health problems at DOE's \nuranium Enrichment facility in Portsmouth, OH, as well at the Fernald \nuranium foundry outside of Cincinnati. These hearings were among the \nfirst public examinations of the nuclear weapon complex. Due in part to \ndecades of secrecy and \n[[Page S3796]] the cold war urgency to produce nuclear weapons at any \ncost, little attention was historically given to worker safety or the \nenvironment. After becoming chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nin 1986, I significantly increased the number of oversight hearings of \nthis heretofore neglected program.\n  As problems were uncovered at Ohio's facilities, I began asking \nwhether similar problems existed at DOE's other sites around the \ncountry, including Savannah River, Hanford, Rocky Flats, and our \nnational labs. Often utilizing the auditors and investigators of the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the answer which all-too-often came back \nwas, ``Yes, in spades.'' One example shows how massive the nuclear \nweapons cleanup has become. In 1985, I asked GAO to estimate the cost \nof cleaning up DOE's facilities. Their answer was $8-12 billion, a \nsignificant sum. By 1988, that figure had risen to $100 billion. Now, \nin 1995 GAO's best guess is over $300 billion, with the caveat that \nmuch of the technology does not yet exist to do the job. Over the past \nseveral years, the fastest growing program within DOE has been the \ncleanup program. We are currently spending over $6 billion every year \nto address the very real environmental problems at these sites.\n  However like any other government program which grows exponentially \nin a short time, the growth of DOE's cleanup program has resulted in \nwaste and inefficiency. My investigations into the DOE weapon complex \nhave focused on exposing the serious environment safety and health \nproblems which exist there, but also on the Department's ability to \naddress and manage these problems efficiently. One particular problem \nhas been DOE's contract management practices, which were all-too-often \ninadequate and failed to properly account for or track literally \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer funds. Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigations into DOE's contracting practices have resulted in \ntaxpayer savings in a variety of ways, from reducing the cost of \ndrilling wells at\n Hanford, to controlling affiliate contracting relationships at \nSavannah River to implementing improved planning and management tools \nfor estimating and tracking program costs at all sites.\n\n  I am pleased to say that the Department, under Secretary O'Leary's \nleadership has made a number of very real efforts to get waste and \nmismanagement problems under control. First and foremost Secretary \nO'Leary has agreed to reduce the DOE budget by $10.6 billion over the \nnext 5 years. Within this reduction, the cleanup program has agreed to \nreduce its spending by $4.4 billion over the same timeframe. The DOE \ncontract reform initiative and reorganization efforts also will \nstrengthen the Department's ability to do more with less.\n  As the magnitude of the nuclear weapon cleanup becomes clearer, many \npeople are beginning to suggest that we back away from our obligation \nto remediate these sites, saying that it is simply too expensive. \n``After all,'' these critics say, ``these sites are remote and few \npeople live there. Aren't there more cost-effective ways we can spend \ntaxpayer dollars?'' I simply do not agree with the premise that we can \nback off of this cleanup effort. While it is true that many of the most \ncontaminated sites--like Hanford and Savannah River--are remote, they \nare unfortunately situated near major drinking water supplies. If \nlittle is done now, it is likely that our children or grandchildren--\neven those living far from these sites--will have to contend with \nseverely contaminated water. And for every site that is remotely \nlocated, the Department has sites like Rocky Flats, outside of Denver, \nor Fernald, outside of Cincinnati, which are located near major \npopulation centers.\n  I am convinced that the answer to cleaning up these facilities will \nnot be found by putting off to future generations the responsibility of \ndealing with these problems. I intend to continue to exercise broad and \nvigorous oversight in this area during the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this program as we \nproceed through this year's budgeting process. I would close by \nencouraging my colleagues to review information which describes the \nDepartment's fiscal year 1996 cleanup budget in greater detail. I ask \nunanimous consent that this material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWhat Have We Done?--Environmental Management Accomplishments, 1989-1994\n\n       Cleanup of 16 former nuclear weapons and industrial sites \n     (FUSRAP).\n       Cleanup of 14 Uranium Mills Tailings Remedial Action \n     (UMTRA) sites.\n       Remediation of 5,000 public and private properties \n     contaminated with uranium tailings.\n       Completed 119 Remedial Actions.\n       100 Facilities have been decommissioned.\n       9 Site-Specific Advisory Boards have been established.\n       30.4 million square meters of soil and uranium tailings \n     removed.\n       16 million pounds of scrap metal recycled.\n       2.4 billion gallons of ground water and 1.8 billion gallons \n     of surface water treated.\n       500 tanks removed or replaced.\n       55,000 pounds of shrapnel and ordnance removed.\n       2,200 acres of land stabilized.\n       488,000 drum equivalent of stored waste shipped offsite.\n       Disposed of 50,000 m\\3\\ of low-level waste.\n\n                    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM                    \n             [Fiscal year 1996 Congressional Budget Request]            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Fiscal year--                \n                                     ------------------------   Change  \n                                         1995        1996               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWaste Management....................    2,916.1     2,707.7      -208.4 \nEnvironmental Restorations..........    1,768.5     1,993.7      +225.2 \nNuclear Mat. & Facilities                                               \n Stabilization......................      838.9     1,679.7      +840.8 \nTechnology Development..............      417.4       390.5       -26.9 \nUranium Enrichment D      301.3       288.8       -12.5 \nAnalysis, Education & Risk Mgt......       84.9       157.0       +72.1 \nCorrective Activities...............       27.2         8.8       -18.4 \nTransportation Management...........       20.7        16.2        -4.5 \nCompliance & Program Coord..........        0.0        81.3       +81.3 \n                                     -----------------------------------\n    Subtotls........................    6,374.0     7,323.7      +948.7 \nUse of Prior Year Balances..........

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith and Mr. Chafee pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 534 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we had a good debate and discussion on \nthe Kassebaum amendment earlier with a number of our colleagues. I \nwould just like to make some concluding comments about where I think we \nare in this debate and discussion.\n  Earlier in the course of the afternoon, I talked in some detail about \nthe legitimacy of the Executive order. I included in the Record the \nlegal justification for the order and then summarized the policy \nconsiderations for the Executive order and responded to some of the \nquestions that have been raised over the period of the last couple of \ndays about whether the President exceeded his authority and \nresponsibility in terms of issuing it.\n  Hopefully, for those Members who are interested, they will at least \nhave an opportunity to read through the Attorney General's memorandum \nand some of the other material which I think spell out very clearly the \nresponsibility that the President had for undertaking the Executive \norder, the legal justification for that order.\n  Just a few moments ago, I tried to put this proposal in the context \nof the discussions that we are having in the Senate of the United \nStates and in the House of Representatives under the general rubric of \nthe Contract With America. I think, quite frankly, Mr. President, it is \nappropriate to make these comments at this time because the amendment \nof the Senator from Kansas, in trying to undermine the President's \nauthority and power, particularly the policy reasons for it, I think \nreally helps put into sharper relief exactly what some of the public \npolicy matters are that have been raised during the period of these \npast weeks and what I think the American people, particularly working \nfamilies, should be very much aware of and I should think very much \nconcerned about. I would like to take a few moments of the Senate's \ntime this afternoon to address that broader issue.\n  The pending Republican amendment on permanent striker replacements is \na skirmish in a much larger battle that is now unfolding in Congress in \nfull view of the American people. Each day's developments under the new \nRepublican majority in the Senate and House of Representatives raises \nincreasing concern. The Republican's so-called Contract With America is \nbeing unmasked for what it is. It is not a Contract With America at all \nbut a declaration of war on working families throughout America.\n  There is a fundamental hypocrisy behind many Republican positions in \nthe current national debate. They do not mind Government stepping in \nwith a generous helping hand for business; they think tax cuts for the \nrich and corporate welfare in the form of lavish Government subsidies \nfor businesses are fine, but our Republican friends get upset when \nGovernment steps in to offer a helping hand to working families, to the \nelderly, to children and to those in need.\n  Democrats are proud to be the defenders of Social Security and \nMedicare for senior citizens, a fair minimum wage for workers, aid for \ncollege education, hot lunches for children in their schools. Democrats \nare proud to be on the side of all these individuals and families \nacross America struggling to make ends meet, and we are proud to oppose \nany Contract With America that endangers all of these worthwhile \nprograms.\n  President Clinton had it right when he said the Nation wants \nGovernment to be lean not mean. But wherever we turn in Congress today, \nwe see mean-spirited assaults on programs that help people, and I would \nlike to discuss a few of these basic priorities today issue by issue.\n  We know that education is a key building block of the American dream. \nWhile college costs rise to over $8,000 a year at many State \nuniversities and over $20,000 a year at many private colleges, a \ncollege education is too often an impossible dream for working \nfamilies. We know that students and their families are struggling hard \nto find the finances needed to pursue the education and the training \nthey need.\n  Yet, Republicans are proposing the largest cuts in student aid in the \nNation's history. The proposals in the Contract With America would \nslash $20 billion from student aid over the next 5 years; an additional \n$20 billion that students and working families would have to come up \nwith from their own pockets.\n  The contract proposes to eliminate the interest on student loans the \nGovernment now pays while students are in school. Under current law, \ninterest does not build up on student loans until students graduate and \ncan start paying back their loans. Slashing this interest subsidy will \nsave the Federal Government $12 billion over 5 years, but at what \nprice? By deeper indebtedness for students, as much as 20 to 50 percent \ndeeper.\n  For a student who borrows the maximum amount to pay for 4 years in \ncollege, the Republicans' cut would add $3,000 in extra interest \npayments. Instead of $17,000 in loans to pay off college, the student \nwould owe $20,000. And that is not all. Republicans are also calling \nfor the elimination of the campus-based grant and loan programs that \nhelp students pay their way through college. That is another $7 billion \nin cuts that will hurt the Nation's students.\n  Republicans extol the virtue of work, yet they propose to eliminate \nthe highly successful work-study program that enables students to work \nat jobs on campus and in their communities to earn part of their \nfinancial aid. And the only ones that are eligible for those are, \nagain, working families, the sons and daughters of working families. \nThere is a sliding scale and it gets up to maybe $62,000, $64,000 for \nthree members of a family in school.\n  You are talking about a program that is targeted, again, to provide \nworking families' students to be able to gain additional resources as a \nresult of working at jobs on campuses and in the communities as part of \na financial aid package.\n  It is not as if the States will pick up the slack. In Massachusetts, \nState financial aid for students has been cut by almost a third since \n1988. Tuitions and fees charged to students at the State university \nhave doubled. If the Republican cuts go through, Massachusetts students \nwill lose $70 million in Federal student aid a year, more than the \ntotal amount the State spends on student aid.\n  Republicans claim they want to balance the budget so as not to bury \nthe next generation in debt, but they are more than willing to bury the \nNation's students in debt. In fact, Republicans are proposing at the \nsame time to add to the deficit in order to protect the banks at the \nexpense of students. And I want the attention of the Members on this \nparticular issue affecting students in their own States.\n  Last Friday, Senator Kassebaum introduced a bill to cap the new \nFederal direct lending program for college students. That program began \nin 1993 under the leadership of President Clinton and Democrats in \nCongress but also with the support of Senator Durenberger, Senator \nJeffords, and other Republicans. That particular program has cut \ncollege student loan fees in half and lowered interest rates on their \nloans. It has eliminated the huge and confusing bureaucracy that makes \nit difficult for students to receive their loans on time and even \nharder for them to pay back their loans.\n  Under the direct lending and current law, students will save $2.2 \nbillion over 5 years and taxpayers will save $4.3 billion. But banks do \nnot like the new program because it reduces the profits they were \nmaking at students' expense. The Republicans want to stop the direct \nlending in its tracks, even though stopping it will add to the deficit \nin the long run.\n  The Republican priorities are clear. The Democrats put students and \neducation first; Republicans put the banks first, even ahead of \nreducing the deficit.\n  The economy, the Treasury and the families across America will suffer \nif the next generation of students have to start their working lives \nunder a \n[[Page S3798]] mountain of debt and cannot afford the education and \ntraining they need to be productive workers. Slamming the door of \ncollege in the face of the Nation's students is not a Contract With \nAmerica, it is an insult to America.\n  The next issue is health care. Few things are more important to the \nsecurity of working families than affordable quality health care. Few \nthings are more important to senior citizens than Medicare. But for the \nnew Republican majority, the tax cuts for the wealthy and the \nprotection of corporate profits are more important than the health care \nof American workers and their families and Medicare for our senior \ncitizens.\n  Today, no working family is guaranteed affordable health care. Thirty \nmillion members of working families have no health insurance at all. \nThe breadwinners in these families work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks \na year. But all their hard work does not free them from concern about \ntheir health security. They cannot afford to buy health insurance on \ntheir own and their employers will not contribute to the cost.\n  Even families that have health insurance are not secure. No family \ncan be sure that the insurance that protects them today will be there \nfor them tomorrow when serious illness strikes. Lose your job and you \ncan lose your coverage. Change jobs and you can lose your coverage. \nYour employer can decide your coverage is too expensive and drop it \naltogether. And your insurance company can decide you are a bad risk \nand cancel your current policy. More than 2 million Americans lose \ntheir health insurance every month.\n  The skyrocketing cost of health care is depriving workers of the wage \nincreases they deserve. It is keeping real income stagnant, even as the \neconomy grows and strengthens.\n  Last year, the Republicans drew a line in the sand against the simple \nand sensible idea that every employer should be expected to contribute \nto the costs of health insurance for their employees, even though most \nemployers do so voluntarily today.\n  Last year, as their alternative the Republicans proposed reforms in \nthe insurance market, to try to make health insurance more available. \nThey offered subsidies to workers whose employers did not provide \nhealth insurance. But this year, this year the Republicans have backed \naway from even this minimalist approach. Health care is not even in the \nRepublican contract. It is not in the agenda for the first 100 days. \nAnd the two Republican bills introduced to date provide not a single \ndollar to help working families afford health insurance.\n  The problem has not gone away. Despite the economic recovery, the \nnumber of uninsured rose by more than a million last year. Workers who \nstill have their insurance are less secure than they were a year ago. \nHealth care costs continue to rise at twice the rate of general \ninflation. But for the Republicans, now that there is no threat of new \nresponsibilities on business, they feel no responsibility to address \nthe needs of workers.\n  Families need a reliable system of health security for their \nretirement years as well. Older Americans are the most vulnerable to \ncostly illnesses. The cost of health care in retirement threatens not \nonly the security of retired workers but the security of their children \nand grandchildren as well, who will contribute everything they have to \nkeep their parents from destitution.\n  For three decades, Medicare has provided health security for senior \ncitizens. But today, the security of Medicare is in danger, and the \nRepublican program threatens to destroy it. The Republican Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives has said that Medicare should be rethought \nfrom top to bottom and that every decision on it must be made in the \nlight of a balanced budget. The Republican chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has projected $300 billion in Medicare cuts over the next 7 \nyears. Independent estimates of the cost of the Republican contract \nproject cuts in Medicare of an almost unthinkable 31 percent of \nprojected program costs.\n  Because of current program gaps and out-of-control health care costs, \nthe protection that Medicare provides is already inadequate. Last year, \nsenior citizens spent an average of $2,800 out of their pockets for \nhealth care--four times what nonelderly Americans spent.\n  Just 8 years ago, in 1987, senior citizens spent 15 percent of their \nincome for medical care--and that was too much. Today, that number has \nsoared to 23 percent--almost $1 in every $4 taken from limited incomes \nthat are already stretched to pay for food, housing, heat, clothing, \nand other essential expenses of daily living. If the medical costs of \nsenior citizens in nursing homes and other institutions are included, \nthe percentages would be even higher. I say senior citizens should be \npaying less for medical care, not more.\n  The damage done by reductions of scale contemplated in the Republican \ncontract go beyond the increase of out-of-pocket costs. They would turn \nsenior citizens into second-class citizens in health care. They would \nsignificantly boost the already excessive insurance premiums paid by \nworking families. They would damage key health care institutions. They \nwould be achieved by forcing senior citizens into managed care programs \nand denying them the opportunity to go to the doctor and the hospital \nthey choose.\n  President Clinton has taken a strong stance on this issue--no \nMedicare cuts unless they are part of overall health care reform that \nprotects senior citizens, working families, and health care \ninstitutions.\n  Democrats support these principles, but our Republican friends take a \ndifferent view. Billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, paid \nfor by billions of dollars in Medicare cuts for senior citizens.\n  Other important aspects of health security are protection from unsafe \nand ineffective prescription drugs, reasonable access to the physicians \nand other health professionals, especially for those who live in rural \nand underserved urban areas, and safe workplaces and a safe \nenvironment.\n  What is the Republican program? Hamstring the FDA so that drug \ncompanies can have higher profits, even though the American people will \nhave worse protection. Cut the National Health Service Corps, so that \npeople who live in rural communities and inner cities will have to go \nwithout care when they need to see a doctor. Roll back the rules that \nrequire businesses to provide a safe workplace for employees. Undermine \nthe environmental protections that bring clean air and clean water.\n  In each of these areas, the Republican prescription for health care \nis a healthier bottom line for special interests and the wealthy, and \ngreater risk of illness for American families. That is the kind of \ncost-benefit analysis we are getting these days. It is the wrong \nanalysis, because it looks at the wrong costs and the wrong benefits.\n  Yesterday, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee outlined a 5-year tax cut proposal as part of the Republican \ncontract. It is a lavish tax break for the rich, that will inevitably \nbe paid for out of the pockets of working families. It is an \nantifamily, antiwork, antichildren tax cut, and it does not deserve to \npass.\n  It will cost the Treasury $700 billion over the next decade. It will \ndrive up the deficit to levels unheard of even during the Reagan and \nBush administrations.\n  Is it just coincidence that the total amount of the nutrition cuts \nrecently proposed by the House Republicans--in WIC, school breakfasts, \nschool lunches--will provide just enough to pay for the capital gains \ntax cut for families earning over $100,000? This is an affront to \nworking American families, because it takes the most from those who \nhave the least.\n  The current capital gains tax cut will be cut in half; 75 percent of \nthe tax benefit from this cut will go to those making more than \n$100,000 a year--the top 9 percent of income; 50 percent of the benefit \nwill go to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.\n  The tax cut proposal also calls for accelerated depreciation \ndeductions for business. A similar tax break was included in the Reagan \ntax cut in 1981. It was rightfully curtailed in the 1986 Tax Reform Act \nand it should not be expanded now.\n  The poor and the middle class have no resources for these types of \ninvestments. They would get no benefit from this provision. But it \nwould provide $90 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations \nin America.\n  [[Page S3799]] The Republican tax cut would also repeal the \nalternative minimum tax which now keeps major corporations from \navoiding taxes altogether. If it is repealed, it will put $60 billion \ninto the pockets of wealthy corporations and let many of them go \nentirely tax free.\n  In the unkindest cut of all, the Republican proposal would deny any \ntax relief to the lowest income families.\n  The original Contract With America made the $500 tax credit for \nchildren refundable, which means the tax relief would have been \navailable to all families including those at the lowest income levels \nwho need help the most. By deleting the refundable features of this tax \ncut the Republican plan will deny $13 billion in tax relief for these \nfamilies.\n  Millionaires will get their tax cut in full, but to save money our \nRepublican friends now offer no relief at all to the millions of \nfamilies at the other end of the income scale. The plan makes a mockery \nof any sense of tax fairness and tax justice, and it must not be \npermitted to stand.\n  I can cite many other ways in which the so-called Contract With \nAmerica declares war on working families and average citizens across \nthe country. In the weeks to come we will have an opportunity in the \nSenate to debate all of these issues in full and I am confident that \nwhen we do, a fairer contract will be written. The real casualties of \nthis war will be the worst provisions of the contract, not the people \nof America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Mr. President, I do not intend to be long but I would like \nto say a few words about the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, the international financial markets and the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board have passed judgment on America's future \neconomic power in the wake of the Senate's failure to adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment. Their reaction paints a bleak picture of the future \nof our country, and does not suggest we will leave a legacy to our \nchildren we can be proud of. I ask those colleagues who once supported \nthis amendment and who changed their votes this year to rethink their \nposition again in light of this judgment.\n  Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment vote suggested to the \nworld that the success of President Clinton and the Senate Democratic \nleadership in blocking the amendment signaled the triumph of business-\nas-usual and a continuation of the big-spending practices of the past. \nThe markets reacted swiftly and strongly, and, I think, justly. The \ndollar dropped precipitously to record low exchange rate levels against \nthe Japanese yen and the German mark.\n  Fed Chairman Greenspan, in testimony before the House Budget \nCommittee on Wednesday, attributed the precipitous fall of the dollar \nin large part to the failure of this body to adopt the balanced budget \namendment. The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the \nWashington Times all reported that Chairman Greenspan agreed with those \nwho pointed to the Senate's rejection of the balanced budget \namendment--and its implication of continued fiscal irresponsibility--as \nthe cause of the dollar's drop.\n  Chairman Greenspan reportedly opined that ``in futures markets--an \nimportant indicator that doesn't reflect current ups and downs in the \neconomy--the dollar didn't begin to fall significantly until the Senate \nrejected the balanced budget amendment. * * *'' (Wall Street Journal, \nMar. 9, 1995) He was quoted as saying, ``[t]here was apparent concern \nin the international financial markets that something significant was \nhappening to our resolve with respect to coming to grips with the \nbalanced-budget issue.'' (Id.)\n  He further noted that to continue on the path of $200 billion \ndeficits--and I would add that that is precisely the path President \nClinton has laid out for this country in his proposed budget--``would \nbe unwise and probably impossible. * * * Indeed, given the weakness in \nthe foreign exchange value of the dollar, world capital markets may be \nsending us just that message.'' (Washington Times, Mar. 9, 1995, p. 1)\n  In his testimony, Chairman Greenspan also pointed out the benefits of \na balanced budget, which would be obtained through passage of a \nbalanced budget amendment: a stronger dollar, lower interest rates, and \na stronger economy.\n  Mr. President, I think the message is clear. The victory of President \nClinton and a few of the Democrats who want to keep this country on a \npath of increasing debt and the business-as-usual spend and borrow \npolicies was a defeat for the American economy and for the American \npeople.\n  As we have said throughout the balanced budget amendment debate, the \nbenefits of passing the amendment begin immediately and keep improving \nas Congress returns to a more rational fiscal regime. Failure to adopt \nthe amendment means not just a continuation of the weakness of the \npast, but a worsening picture.\n  This Nation's fiscal freedom is at risk if we continue on President \nClinton's path of irresponsible spending. If we wish to remain the \npower that we have been, we need to rekindle the values of thrift and \nresponsibility in this Congress. And we should lock those values in \nplace with a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.\n  The Senate should learn from its mistake--a mistake heralded as a \nserious economic mistake by world financial markets--and adopt the \nbalanced budget amendment, and get on with balancing the budget. If we \ndo this we can have the benefits Alan Greenspan pointed to: a stronger \ndollar, lower interest rates, and a stronger economy. And I would add \nto those benefits a more responsive and more responsible Government. \nAll these things can be the legacy we leave our children. The \nalternative legacy is not one I would be proud to leave. We must pass \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  I believe that the time is this year. So I hope our colleagues will \nreconsider. I hope we can pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent a number of articles from the various \nnewspapers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 9, 1995]\n\n             Fed Chairman Blames Deficit for Dollar's Fall\n\n\n  greenspan also cites defeat of budget amendment, backing gop charges\n\n                  (By Lucinda Harper and David Wessel)\n\n       Washington.--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan blamed \n     the weak dollar on a persistent U.S. government fiscal \n     deficit and failure of Congress to pass a constitutional \n     amendment to force a balanced budget.\n       Calling the dollar's fall ``overdone . . . unwelcome and \n     troublesome,'' Mr. Greenspan told the House Budget Committee \n     that it ``adds to potential inflation pressures in our \n     economy.''\n       The dollar rebounded yesterday for the first time in days. \n     The rise, which began before Mr. Greenspan's testimony, took \n     the dollar to 91.35 yen from 90.05 yen the day before and to \n     1.3940 marks from 1.3688 marks. Several European nations \n     yesterday raised interest rates to try to boost their \n     currencies against the German mark.\n       Mr. Greenspan said nothing yesterday to suggest he \n     contemplates raising U.S. interest rates to help the dollar. \n     Indeed, he repeatedly said the best way to help it is to \n     reduce the budget deficit. But in his testimony, he avoided \n     the word ``ease''; his use of that word in earlier testimony, \n     when referring to U.S. interest rates, has been cited by some \n     analysts as one factor contributing to the weak dollar.\n       In his most detailed commentary since the dollar began \n     plunging, Mr. Greenspan said the U.S. currency began to get \n     weaker ``as the economy started to give evidence of slowing \n     down'' and interest rates on one- and two-year maturities \n     fell. Lower U.S. interest rates make the dollar less \n     attractive to global investors.\n       But in futures markets--an important indicator that doesn't \n     reflect current ups and downs of the economy--the dollar \n     didn't begin to fall significantly until the\n      Senate rejected the balanced-budget amendment, Mr. Greenspan \n     said. The Fed chairman opposed the amendment, but said \n     that with its rejection. ``There was apparent concern in \n     the international financial markets that something \n     significant was happening to our resolve with respect to \n     coming to grips with the balanced-budget issue.''\n       Mr. Greenspan's analysis lent support to Republican charges \n     that defeat of the amendment caused the dollar's collapse. \n     ``The dollar has been sliding against the yen and the mark \n     ever since the amendment went down,'' House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich said yesterday.\n       Although Clinton administration officials remained publicly \n     silent on the dollar, the \n     [[Page S3800]] German Bundesbank--normally pleased when the \n     mark is strong--said in a statement that the dollar's fall \n     was exaggerated and wasn't justified by ``economic \n     fundamental factors.''\n       The German central bank praised Treasury Secretary Robert \n     Rubin's one public utterance on the dollar so far: that a \n     stronger dollar is in the U.S. national interest. In a speech \n     scheduled for this morning, Mr. Rubin is expected to \n     elaborate on this theme, particularly on his view that U.S. \n     support for Mexico isn't any reason for the dollar to be \n     weak.\n       During some past episodes of dollar weakness in recent \n     years, other Clinton administration officials have \n     occasionally suggested the benefits of a weak dollar, but \n     they now are avoiding saying anything that suggests they \n     favor its decline.\n       Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey, who has in the past made \n     statements that hurt the dollar, wouldn't discuss it \n     yesterday. ``I don't have a yen to make a mark,'' he told \n     wire-service reporters.\n       On the state of the economy, Mr. Greenspan reiterated that \n     he sees ``some indications that the expansion may be slowing \n     from its torrid and unsustainable pace of 1994. . . . while \n     there are signs that spending is slowing, the jury remains \n     out on whether that will be sufficient to contain inflation \n     pressure.'' He noted slowing of the housing sector and \n     consumer spending, but said there are ``few indications of \n     that degree of slowing'' in orders for nondefense capital \n     goods or investment in commercial buildings.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 9, 1995]\n\n                      Fed Chief Helps Dollar Soar\n\n\n greenspan cites Senate Budget Vote as Trigger for All, Urges deficit \n                                 action\n\n                           (By Patrice Hill)\n\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan touched off a \n     powerful dollar rally yesterday by signaling the Fed's \n     concern about the beleaguered currency and calling on \n     Congress to move quickly to cut the budget deficit.\n       Mr. Greenspan agreed with observers who think the failure \n     of the balanced-budget amendment last week triggered the \n     dollar's fall to record lows against the German mark and \n     Japanese yen because it raised questions about Washington's \n     willingness to control spending. He stressed that it is \n     within Congress' power to reverse the currency's decline.\n       ``A key element in dealing with the dollar's weakness is to \n     address our underlying fiscal imbalance convincingly,'' he \n     told the House Budget Committee, which is preparing a plan to \n     balance the budget by 2002, as the constitutional amendment \n     would have required.\n       To forever rely on foreign money to finance a $200 billion \n     budget deficit and a $150 billion trade deficit ``would \n     certainly be unwise and probably impossible,'' he said. \n     ``Indeed, given the recent weakness in the foreign exchange \n     value of the dollar, world capital markets may be sending us \n     just that message.''\n       Mr. Greenspan said an all-out effort by Congress to \n     eliminate the deficit not only would bolster the dollar, but \n     also substantially lower interest rates and stimulate the \n     economy.\n       ``The productive potential of the U.S. economy will be \n     shaped significantly by the actions of this\n      Congress,'' he said, predicting a ``startling'' pickup in \n     growth, more stability on financial markets and an \n     increasing standard of living if Congress acts decisively \n     to cut the deficit.\n       Mr. Greenspan's statement, combined with his assurances \n     that the Fed is prepared to do what is necessary to deal with \n     the ``troublesome'' fall of the dollar, dramatically lifted \n     the U.S. currency against the mark and yen.\n       In New York trading, the dollar leaped to 1.3935 marks \n     after hitting an all-time low of 1.3440 marks earlier \n     yesterday in European trading. It had closed at 1.3702 marks \n     Tuesday in New York.\n       The dollar sprang to 91.33 yen from the record low of 88.70 \n     reached in European trading overnight. Its Tuesday close in \n     New York was 90.05 yen. Stocks and bonds rallied modestly \n     with the dollar.\n       While Mr. Greenspan's talk was a salve for the dollar, some \n     traders questioned whether the gains will last unless \n     Congress acts or the Fed boosts interest rates. Raising \n     interest rates would bolster the dollar by making U.S. bonds \n     more attractive to investors. Mr. Greenspan appeared to leave \n     that possibility open yesterday.\n       ``Greenspan is telling all these congressmen that what's \n     happening to the dollar now is a symptom of the problem,'' \n     said Dan Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities in New York. \n     He said the Senate's balanced-budget vote was a negative for \n     investors who thought the amendment would keep the federal \n     government from living beyond its means.\n       ``It's loud and clear,'' he said of Mr. Greenspan's \n     message, ``but, unfortunately, a lot of congressmen have \n     their own Walkmans on, and they're hearing other music.''\n       Several congressmen at the Budget Committee hearing accused \n     the Fed and the Treasury of causing the currency crisis by \n     getting involved in Mexico's financial problems and depleting \n     the central bank's foreign exchange reserves by committing \n     $20 billion to prop up the Mexican peso.\n       Sen. Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, one of six Democratic \n     senators who switched votes to block the balanced-budget \n     amendment, brought up the peso when told about the Fed \n     chairman's comments.\n       ``The dollar was dropping rapidly before the Senate vote, \n     and Greenspan knows that. He linked the dollar to the ailing \n     peso,'' said Mr. Dorgan, a persistent Fed\n      critic. ``The marriage of the dollar and the peso has caused \n     the trouble for the dollar.''\n       Despite falling against other major currencies, the dollar \n     has been hitting new highs against the peso. Yesterday it \n     took 7.02 pesos to buy a dollar, near 50 percent more than it \n     did Dec. 20, when Mexico devalued its currency.\n       ``The dollar's problems began to mount when Mexico devalued \n     the peso,'' Mr. Seto said, primarily because people wonder if \n     the Mexican bailout leaves the Fed with enough reserves to \n     influence movements in the dollar market, where $1 trillion \n     changes hands each day.\n       Comparing the meager reserves of most central banks to a \n     ``bowling trophy on the mantle,'' he said such reserves can't \n     prop up a currency experiencing a fall like the dollar's.\n       Mr. Greenspan insisted yesterday that the Fed's reserves \n     are sufficient to defend the dollar.\n       Another Democrat who opposed the balanced-budget measure, \n     Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, said, ``The slide of the \n     dollar obviously shows the financial markets are deeply \n     concerned about the deficit.''\n       But he and other Democrats said a constitutional amendment \n     is not the solution.\n       They said they are willing to work with Republicans right \n     away on a plan to balance the budget with the usual budget-\n     writing procedures.\n       ``We're dead serious,'' said Sen. Wendell H. Ford, Kentucky \n     Democrat and another of the vote-switchers on the amendment.\n       ``There's a difference between posing and lifting,'' Mr. \n     Dorgan said. Pointing to his vote for President Clinton's \n     $500 billion deficit-reduction plan in 1993, he said, ``I'm \n     perfectly willing to cast that kind of vote again.''\n       Sen. Paul Simon, Illinois Democrat and author of the \n     proposed constitutional amendment, called on other Democrats \n     to reconsider their votes and halt the slide of the dollar.\n       ``When the balanced-budget amendment went down,'' House \n     Speaker Newt Gingrich said, ``that was a signal to the world \n     money markets that the United States is not going to be \n     serious about balancing its budget.''\n       While ``the decay of the dollar as a reserve currency for \n     the world is not a new thing,'' the Georgia Republican said, \n     borrowing at the rate of $200 billion a year ``implies a \n     level of inflation and a level of decay of the currency that \n     is almost Mexican in proportions.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \namendment proposed by my colleague from Kansas.\n  I am most concerned with those that question the administration's \nauthority to issue this Executive order. As the Federal Government's \nchief executive officer, the President has the responsibility by law to \nassure that taxpayers receive the goods and services they require from \nFederal contractors. These contractors must maintain stable and \nproductive labor-management relationships if they are going to produce \nthe products our Nation must depend upon.\n  The Executive order advances cooperative and stable labor-management \nrelations, a central component of this administration's workplace \nagenda. The use of--or the threat to use--permanent replacement workers \ndestroys the cooperative environment that this relationship must \nmaintain.\n  The Executive order represents a lawful exercise of Presidential \nauthority. The Federal Procurement Act, enacted by Congress in 1949, \nexpressly authorizes the President to prescribe such policies and \ndirectives, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as he \nshall deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said act.\n  Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have issued Executive orders \naddressing the conduct of firms with which the Federal Government does \nbusiness. Those orders to be challenged have been upheld.\n  In 1941, President Roosevelt issued an Executive order requiring \ndefense contractors to refrain from racial discrimination. In 1951, \nafter enactment of the Procurement Act, President Truman issued an \nExecutive order extending the requirement to all Federal contractors. \nWhen both orders were issued, such discrimination was not unlawful \n[[Page S3801]] and, indeed, Congress had declined to enact an \nantidiscrimination law proposed by President Truman.\n  In 1964, President Johnson issued an Executive order prohibiting \nFederal contractors from discriminating on the basis of age. At the \ntime, Federal law permitted such age discrimination. The Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 merely directed the President to study the issue.\n  In 1969, the Nixon administration expanded the antidiscrimination \nExecutive order to encompass a requirement that all Federal contractors\n adopt affirmative action programs. This Executive order was upheld by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n\n  In 1978, President Carter issued an Executive order requiring all \nfederal contractors to comply with certain guidelines limiting the \namount of wage increases. The D.C. Circuit Court upheld President \nCarter's Executive order.\n  Finally, in 1992 President Bush issued an Executive order requiring \nunionized Federal contractors to notify their unionized employees of \ntheir right to refuse to pay union dues. The National Labor Relations \nAct contains no such requirement and legislation proposing this in the \n101st Congress was not passed.\n  The economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal \nGovernment contracts requires a stable and productive labor-management \nenvironment. Strikes involving permanent replacements last seven times \nlonger than strikes that do not involve permanent replacements.\n  Mr. President, my personal interest in this amendment is its impact \non the most vulnerable and fastest growing segment of our work force--\nAmerican women.\n  Over the last decade, women have assumed ever greater economic and \nfamily caretaking responsibilities. Everyone in this country should be \nunsettled by the fact that women and children are most likely to fall \ndeeper into poverty and homelessness. One of three families headed by a \nwomen lives to or below the poverty line: Nearly 70 percent of all \nworking women earned less than $20,000 a year, and 40 percent earned \nless than $10,000 annually. These workers need the ability to raise \ntheir standard of living in order to break the cycle of poverty and \nwelfare dependence which many of them endure.\n  These women understand that they cannot bargain effectively unless \nthey are assured that they do not risk losing their jobs permanently. \nThey understand the serious implications of a strike. They understand, \nas I do, the fear of being one paycheck away from economic disaster.\n  Most of us have home mortgages, car payments, educational and medical \nneeds for ourselves and our families. America's workers know striking \nis the option of last resort. This action is never taken lightly.\n  I urge my colleagues to maintain the delicate balance of collective \nbargaining. This Executive order shows that this great society values \nthe individual, that it cares about women, and it recognizes those that \nbuilt this Nation. Let us defeat this amendment and prove to America \nthat Government does respect the needs of ordinary working people.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3800-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the past several weeks I have been \ncontacted on the subject of the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget by nearly 10,000 Americans--most, but not all of them, North \nDakotans. I know people felt strongly on all sides of this issue. I \nrespect these different viewpoints, and I appreciate the opportunity to \ngive my colleagues some information and background about why I voted as \nI did.\n  And I want to start by saying simply this: I have an unwavering \ncommitment to balancing this Nation's budget, and that commitment is a \nlongstanding one--dating back to the first vote I cast in favor of a \nconstitutional amendment a dozen years ago, in 1982.\n  That was during my first term in Congress. Since that time I have \nvoted for balanced budget amendments again and again. I voted ``yes'' \nin 1990 and in 1992, after the huge deficits created during the 1980's \nand early 1990's caused the Federal debt to explode to $4 trillion.\n  Last year I voted for it yet again. But I cast that vote with the \nfirm assurance from the leading proponents of the amendment that Social \nSecurity trust funds would not be used to balance the budget.\n  This year in the Senate we cast two votes on constitutional \namendments. I voted for the earlier of the two, Senator Feinstein's \nsubstitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It was \nidentical in every respect to the main constitutional amendment \nproposal offered by Senators Hatch and Simon except for one important \ndifference. It included a provision prohibiting use of the Social \nSecurity trust fund to balance the Federal budget. That proposal \nfailed.\n  During the 2 days following that vote, I was involved in negotiations \nto try to get the sponsors of the Hatch-Simon amendment to modify their \nproposal so it would not result in raiding Social Security trust funds \nto balance the budget. Our negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful, \nand I therefore cast a ``no'' vote on that amendment.\n  The issue for me is one of principle--not politics. I felt it was \nimportant to stand up and fight for that principle, and that is what I \ndid. I know the popular thing to do would have been to vote for this \nconstitutional amendment. But if we are going to change the \nConstitution then we need to do that the right way. And in my mind, \nprotecting the Social Security trust fund is the right way.\n  We collect Social Security taxes to fund the Social Security system \nwith a dedicated tax out of the paychecks of workers. It is supposed to \ngo into a trust fund. Those who would use that trust fund to balance \nthe Federal budget, in my judgment, are involved in dishonest \nbudgeting. And yet, that's exactly what the constitutional amendment \nwould have done.\n  I know proponents protested publicly they had no intention of doing \nthat, but in our private negotiations they admitted they could not \nbalance the budget without Social Security trust funds. In fact, in \nprivate they said they wanted to use those funds for the next \n[[Page S3802]] 13 years and would stop after that point. That is not \nhonest budgeting.\n  I know the Federal deficit is a crippling problem for this country. \nSo I still hope we will be able to reach an agreement on the Social \nSecurity issue, and if we do I will vote for a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget at some point in the coming months.\n  But we should understand that changing the Constitution does not \nchange the budget deficit. That has to be done and it can be done \nduring the regular budget and appropriations process. And I pledge to \nwork as hard as I can--to fight in every way I can--to reduce this \ndeficit.\n  This week I proposed a budget process that would require a balanced \nbudget by the year 2000 without raiding the Social Security trust fund. \nI intend to work hard to cut spending to accomplish that.\n  I want this country to have a balanced budget and I will work hard \ntoward that goal.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3801-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3802-S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         BILLY'S RESTAURANT CELE- BRATES ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 125 years ago this March 13, the \nincomparable Billy's restaurant in New York City opened its doors for \nthe first time. Billy's is known as ``New York's oldest family-owned \nrestaurant,'' but it is much more than that. It is an institution in \nNew York, a regal old establishment that has catered to coal-yard \nworkers, lawyers, politicians, actors and actresses, even a princess on \noccasion.\n  Billy's is a special place to my wife Elizabeth and me; we dined \nthere often during our courtship, back when Billy's occupied a corner \nnear 56th Street and First Avenue. Billy's has moved a few blocks south \nsince then, but still has its original mahogany bar, gaslight fixtures, \nand those red-check tablecloths.\n  A fine article in the March 9, 1995, edition of ``Our Town'' details \nthe history of Billy's restaurant, Mr. President, a history that \nmirrors a great deal of the history of New York. Billy's 125th \nanniversary celebration begins on Monday, and I simply wish to \ncongratulate Joan Condron Borkowski, the third generation proprietor of \nthis venerable old establishment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nMarch 9, 1995 edition of ``Our Town'' be printed in the Record, and I \ncommend it to the attention of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Our Town, Mar. 9, 1995]\n\n                             Family Recipe\n\n                        (By Nelson Williams Jr.)\n\n       It's seven o'clock on a Monday night and Billy's is \n     bustling. The bartenders are mixing martinis for businessmen \n     flanked by briefcases at the bar, and waiters in red jackets \n     and bow ties maneuver through tables toting plates of thick \n     steaks and chops. There's no music, just the convivial rumble \n     of conversation coming from patrons in the dining rooms \n     dotted with red checked tablecloths.\n       It could be 1895 or 1995--it just so happens it's the \n     latter. Yet if restaurant founder Michael ``Mickey'' Condron \n     walked through the swinging double doors up front this \n     evening, he'd immediately recognize the place.\n       Believe it or not, Billy's hasn't changed much in more than \n     a century. The gaslight saloon has moved twice--once, in \n     1880, from its initial location at First Avenue near 56th \n     Street to the southeast corner of the same block; and 29 \n     years ago, when its Sutton Place building came down. Now at \n     948 First Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd streets, Billy's is \n     less than five blocks from its first location and still \n     boasts its original, hand carved mahogany bar, gaslight \n     fixtures, six-handled ale pump, and walk-in cooler.\n       This week, New York's oldest family owned restaurant turns \n     125 years old. Stop by from March 12-18, or anytime for that \n     matter, and third-generation owner Joan Condron Borkowski \n     will give you a hug and lead you past old photos of New York \n     dating to 1860 on the way to a table. While seating you, \n     she'll likely tell a tale or two about Billy's the East Side \n     watering hole her great-grandfather founded in 1870.\n       Mickey and Bridget Condron were just over from Cork, \n     Ireland, then and catered to the thirsts of coal-yard workers \n     and drivers from the local breweries. They wouldn't serve \n     women or mix drinks, but all the food you could put away was \n     free as long as you kept emptying your glass. As was the \n     custom at such Old World pubs, the floor was covered in \n     sawdust to soak up the spilled suds, and buggies rolled right \n     to the front door of the Upper East Side saloon.\n       ``Fifty-sixth Street was the end of civilization'' in those \n     days, says Borkowski, 50, who recalls ``dancing on the bar'' \n     when she was three years old.\n       In the beginning, before the turn of the century, the \n     saloon had no name, but everyone called it ``Mickey's,'' \n     after the round-faced man behind the bar. After they'd been \n     open a decade,\n      Mickey got it in his head that a restaurant should be on a \n     corner and talked the grocer at the end of the block into \n     swapping shops. He brought his son, William, aboard in \n     1902.\n       With William came his wife, Clara, a squat mountain of a \n     woman who stood just four-foot two yet strained the scales at \n     450 pounds. Routinely stationed at a tale in the center of \n     the main dining room she was referred to simply as ``Mrs. \n     Billy.''\n       During the First World War, the story goes, a general was \n     waiting at the bar for a seat when Mrs. Billy sidled up to \n     him and barked, ``Hey, sergeant, your table's ready!'' \n     Perhaps because of her considerable girth--or because the \n     military man knew he was outranked--the general didn't say a \n     word while being relocated, ``She didn't know what all the \n     stripes meant,'' chuckles Borkowski.\n       William Jr. and his wife, Mildred, had joined the business \n     by this time and when Prohibition was repealed in 1933, State \n     liquor laws required that each drinking establishment be \n     registered under a formal name.\n       Thus Billy's was born--and began to thrive, building upon \n     its neighborhood, working-man core to include among its \n     clientele some of New York's most notable businessmen, \n     politicians, writers and celebrities. Even today, regulars \n     include Henry Kissinger, Bill Blass and William F. Buckley \n     Jr. Regardless of clout, Billy Jr. served everyone \n     conversation and drinks from behind the bar while ``playing \n     the piano''--a euphemism he used for running the register.\n       After discouraging his college educated daughter from \n     working at the restaurant--saying it was ``no place for a \n     woman''--he hired her as a waitress. ``He didn't like \n     juggling the tables and say I could do it,'' Borkowski says.\n       She learned grace under fire the day in the late '60s when \n     a First Avenue ticker-tape parade for astronaut John Glenn \n     resulted in an overflowing house--she was the sole waitress \n     on duty. Glenn himself didn't dine in Billy's that day, but \n     Borkowski remembers when Grace Kelly did after returning to \n     the States for her father's funeral. ``Everybody felt you \n     should bow to her,'' recalls Borkowski, who took over full \n     time for her late father in 1988.\n       When Princess Grace asked for a hamburger with grilled \n     onions, her brother's jaw dropped in amazement. The former \n     film star shrugged off his objection, insisting that ``the \n     Prince won't let me have one at Monaco, so I'll have it \n     here!''\n       During regular visits to Billy's, Marilyn Monroe had a \n     special table in the back. Once, when her mink stole fell to \n     the floor, busboys and waiters jockeyed to replace it around \n     her shoulders. ``Don't worry about it,'' Borkowski recalls \n     the actress giggling, ``I've got seven more like this one at \n     home.''\n       Billy's itself made a cameo appearance in the blockbuster \n     Robert Redford-Barbra Streisand movie. ``The Way We Were,'' \n     providing the setting for a lengthy scene that appeared in \n     Alan Laurents' novel of the same name. ``Most of it ended up \n     on the editing-room floor,'' says Borkowski sadly, ``All you \n     see is a red checked tablecloth.\n       In a ``Philadelphia Inquirer'' article, actress Helen Hayes \n     once called Billy's her favorite restaurant in the world, \n     according to the owner. Still, it's the everyday folks who \n     have made Billy's an East Side Institution.\n       ``It's a time capsule,'' says regular Leo Yockin, who dines \n     out six nights a week--at least one of those evenings at \n     Billy's. ``The only thing I've seen change in the last 10 \n     years is that [the maitre d'] doesn't wear a red jacket \n     anymore.''\n       If the attire's slightly altered, the faces are the same. \n     ``The staff hasn't changed since I've been coming here,'' \n     says one customer, ``and I first ate here 20 years ago.''\n       Hostess Hermy O'Sullivan has been greeting and seating \n     people at Billy's for 39 years. Waiters Joe Donadie and Gus \n     Smolich have been scribbling orders for 32 and 27 years, \n     respectively. ``The customers have kept me here,'' says \n     Donadie,\n      ``It's almost like a private club.''\n       The head broiler man, Ramon ``R.C.'' Diaz, started as a \n     dishwasher two decades ago before graduating to the kitchen's \n     top spot. Night bartender Sal D'Ambrosio has been pouring \n     drinks for 15 years.\n       ``They're still calling me the new guy,'' says waiter Ivan \n     Sladen, ``and I've been here eight years.''\n       The king of all Billy's career employees, though, has been \n     Alex Dombrowski, who the current Mrs. Billy says was ``like a \n     brother to my father.'' After the war, during which \n     Dombrowski was shot in the head and leg, Billy Jr. made good \n     on a promise of providing his buddy with a job. Before his \n     death in the 1980s, Dombrowski put in 44 years at the eatery, \n     working his way up from hoisting the basement dumbwaiter to \n     serving as manager.\n       ``If I hire anybody as a waiter or waitress, they're not \n     just technicians,'' says Borkowski, who lives with her \n     mother, Mildred, and orders meals for them nightly from \n     Billy's. ``I look for heart along with technique. They have \n     to really care about whether diners are having a good time.''\n       That, by all accounts, is the key to Billy's longevity. \n     ``There are cheaper places in towns,'' explains longtime \n     customer Alvin \n     [[Page S3803]] Levine, ``but no one pays attention to quality \n     and service like Billy's.''\n       Borkowski, who say she learned about taking care of \n     customers from her parents, reveals the family's secret \n     recipe for success: ``Good quality food, good atmosphere, \n     good service, and a reasonable price--if you don't have those \n     four ingredients,'' says Borkowski, ``you won't succeed. You \n     could serve the best meal in town, but if you throw it at the \n     customer, they won't be back.''\n       Customers--and their children and grandchildren--have been \n     coming to Billy's for steaks and seafood for more years than \n     any other family-owned restaurant in the city (Barbetta was \n     founded in 1906, and Grotta Azzurra Inn came two years \n     later.) Bridging generations, Billy's has endured four wars, \n     two stockmarket crashes, Prohibition (during which they \n     continued to sell beer), 26 presidents and 15,625 days, as \n     one customer recently calculated between courses.\n       ``It's not an easy life--you have to want it,'' says \n     Borkowski. ``You're married to it. But the customers keep you \n     going. We share in their celebrations and their sorrows.''\n       From Sunday to next Saturday, Billy's invited old and new \n     customers alike to share in its 125th anniversary \n     celebration. Borkowski and her 24-year old daughter, Susan, \n     who recently received a communications degree yet often puts \n     in an appearance as the restaurant's fourth-generation heir, \n     encourage diners to dress in late 19th Century costumes and \n     eat to the sounds of Victorian music.\n       ``We can't do what we originally did--give away all the \n     food you could eat with drinks,'' says Borkowski. ``But with \n     any entree, you get a free cocktail.''\n       Also, at the bar, your first beverage will be regular price \n     and the second will go for its long ago rate--five cents for \n     beer and 95 cents for liquor.\n       Maybe they'll even throw sawdust on the floor.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3802-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3803-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3803-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At noon, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1058.

A bill to provide, temporarily, tariff and quota treatment \nequivalent to that accorded to members of the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement [NAFTA] to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the caribbean basin trade security act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today with my colleagues Senators Mack, \nLott, Bradley, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, and Grassley, I am introducing the \nCaribbean Basin Trade Security Act, a bill which will improve the \neconomic and political security of the nations of the Caribbean Basin \nand the United States of America.\n  In the last decade, the United States has supported and encouraged \nthe extension of democracy in the Caribbean and Central America through \nenhanced trade and investment. Today, democracy rules in all of the \nnations of the Caribbean Basin, with the notable exception of Cuba. \nThis year alone, eight nations in the region are holding free \nelections.\n  For many nations political stability is by no means guaranteed. As we \nsaw in the painful lesson of Haiti, economic and political instability \nin the Caribbean region can have tragic consequences for the people and \nenormous costs to the United States.\n  It is of vital interest to America to see the Caribbean Basin grow \neconomically. Continued economic expansion will help maintain political \nstability in the region. By improving economic conditions, we can deter \nillegal immigration, which taxes our resources and hurts those nations \nwhich lose some of their youngest and brightest citizens. Economic \nstability in the Caribbean Basin strengthens our defense against the \ntrafficking of illegal drugs. An economically stable Caribbean Basin is \na rich expanding market for United States goods.\n  Yet at a time when economic growth is increasingly critical to the \nregion, members of the Caribbean Basin Initiative [CBI] have faced a \nchallenging climatic change in the area of trade. Since the \nimplementation of the North American Free-Trade Agreement [NAFTA], \nlowered tariffs on Mexican imports have left the Caribbean Basin at a \ncompetitive disadvantage to Mexico. As an example, apparel assembly has \nbeen the most rapidly expanding job generator in the CBI region. Over \n77 percent of Central American and Caribbean textile and apparel \nexports to the United States are assembled, in whole or in part, from \nU.S. components. For an apparel item produced in a CBI country with \nmaterials from the United States, a 20-percent duty is charged on the \nvalue added by the off-shore assembly. Under NAFTA, this same item can \nbe imported from Mexico duty-free.\n  As a result of this disparity, the growth in apparel imports from \nCaribbean Basin nations has slowed markedly. There has been a virtual \nhalt in new investment in the apparel sector in the CBI countries and \nthe closing of over 100 plants during the last year alone, at an \nestimated loss of 15,000 jobs. Before NAFTA, the growth rates for \napparel imports from Mexico and CBI nations were roughly equivalent at \n25 percent. But by 1994, the CBI growth rate dropped to 14.6 percent, \nwhile Mexico's surged to 48.8 percent.\n  All signs indicate that this inequality will continue to expand if \nparity is not granted to the CBI nations. With the recent devaluation \nof the Mexican peso, labor and production costs in Mexico have \ndecreased, and as a result, apparel companies have an added incentive \nto close shop in CBI nations and relocate to Mexico.\n  As past Caribbean trade agreements have shown, the United States \nstands to be a the chief beneficiary of lowering trade barriers between \nthe Caribbean Basin and the United States. The United States' trade \nbalance with Caribbean Basin countries shifted dramatically following \nthe implementation of the 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative, from a \ndeficit of $700 million in 1985. This has grown to a surplus of $2 \nbillion in 1993. From a $700 million deficit to a $2 billion surplus on \na per capita basis, our surplus with the Caribbean has consistently \noutpaced our surplus with any other region of the world.\n  This bill covers those manufactured products for which Mexico was \ngranted preferential tariff levels, such as textiles and apparel. \nCurrently, a large portion of U.S. textile and apparel imports are \nproduced in the Far East, where few U.S. materials are used in the \nproduction process. U.S. manufacturers and workers stand to benefit \nfrom increased production of these items in the Caribbean Basin; new \nfacilities will be more likely to utilize American materials, \ncomponents, and machinery than does production in the Pacific rim. The \nAmerican Apparel Manufacturers Association estimates that 15 jobs are \ncreated in the United States for every 100 apparel jobs created in CBI \nproduction facilities which use U.S. materials.\n  Mr. President, at the Summit of the Americas in Miami this past \nDecember, Vice President Gore reiterated the administration's \ncommitment to the realization of hemisphericwide free trade. The \nadministration supports the goal of bringing CBI nations into NAFTA-\ntype free-trade agreements. The Caribbean Trade Security Act which we \nintroduce today paves the way for the gradual association of the CBI \nnations into a closer bilateral or multilateral trade agreement with \nthe United States. This legislation calls for a 6-year program after \nwhich the CBI nations will be allowed the opportunity to negotiate \naccession to NAFTA or to enter into independent free-trade agreements \nwith the United States. The U.S. Trade Representative's office would \nmake an assessment of the reforms made in each of the beneficiary \ncountries and of the ability of each country to fulfill the obligations \nof the NAFTA. This checklist would include, among many criteria, the \nextent to which a country's markets are accessible, progress on \nmacroeconomic reforms, and the protection of intellectual property \nrights.\n  Mr. President, there is no region in the world with which the United \nStates has a stronger and more mutually beneficial relationship than \nwith our Caribbean and Central American neighbors. This bill will \nenhance our trading relationship with our neighbors and will strongly \nbenefit the United States. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nconsider and support this legislation as a demonstration of our \ncommitment to encouraging economic stability and the principles of free \nmarkets and free enterprise. From those, the principles of democratic \ngovernment and personal freedom will continue to strengthen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Caribbean Basin Trade \n     Security Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act represents a \n     permanent commitment by the United States to encourage the \n     development of strong democratic governments and revitalized \n     economies in neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin;\n       (2) the economic security of the countries in the Caribbean \n     Basin is potentially threatened by the diversion of \n     investment to Mexico as a result of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement;\n       (3) to preserve the United States commitment to Caribbean \n     Basin beneficiary countries and to help further their \n     economic development, it is necessary to offer temporary \n     benefits equivalent to the trade treatment accorded to \n     products of NAFTA members;\n       (4) offering NAFTA equivalent benefits to Caribbean Basin \n     beneficiary countries, pending their eventual accession to \n     the NAFTA, will promote the growth of free enterprise and \n     economic opportunity in the region, and thereby enhance the \n     national security interests of the United States; and\n       (5) increased trade and economic activity between the \n     United States and Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries will \n     create expanding export opportunities for United States \n     businesses and workers.\n       (b) Policy.--It is therefore the policy of the United \n     States to offer to the products of Caribbean Basin \n     beneficiary countries tariff and quota treatment equivalent \n     to that accorded to products of NAFTA countries, and to seek \n     the accession of these beneficiary countries to the NAFTA at \n     the earliest possible date, with the goal of achieving full \n     [[Page S3805]] participation in the NAFTA by all beneficiary \n     countries by not later than January 1, 2005.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit State and local government workers to perform volunteer services \nfor their employer without requiring the employer to pay overtime \ncompensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n         THE STATE AND LOCAL VOLUNTEER PRESERVATION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my belief that the U.S. \nGovernment needs to foster voluntarism and philanthropy whenever it \ncan. This is not how the system is currently working. On the contrary, \noverzealous regulation and oppressive Government agencies, such as the \nDepartment of Labor , stifle the efforts of citizens who want to \nvolunteer some of their spare time to their community.\n   For example: In a small town in New Hampshire a police officer was \nusing his free time at night to train women in self-defense. He \nvolunteered to teach this course and did so gladly. The Labor \nDepartment came onto the scene, however, and told the police department \nthat they must either pay the officer for overtime or cancel the \nprogram. The program was canceled for lack of funds. The women in this \nsmall town no longer have the option of free classes in order to learn \nto protect themselves.\n   This is a familiar story, not only to police departments across the \ncountry, but also to many other types of State and local agencies whose \nemployees want to serve their community but are forbidden to by the \nDepartment of Labor. These incidents occurred because of the manner in \nwhich the Labor Department has decided to apply the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to those who willingly and gladly volunteer some of their \nspare time to public service. Such regulatory overreaching typifies \nwhat has gone wrong with the Federal Government, when public spirit and \ncommon sense lose out to narrow and misguided bureaucratic objectives.\n   It is for these reasons that I am introducing the State and Local \nVolunteer Preservation Act of 1995, which amends the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to allow State and local public servants to volunteer \ntheir time to their employers if they choose to do so. This bill will \nextend to town clerks who want to help count ballots on election night; \nfirefighters who want to help put out fires in their districts even if \nthey are not on duty; police officers who want to work with police dogs \nor train women in self-defense; and many other public employees who \nwant to volunteer their free time to their communities. We must act now \nto stop this encroachment on local voluntarism and allow our civic-\nminded citizens to volunteer their time to their community, no matter \nwhat their occupation.\n  I am pleased to announce that the International Association of Chiefs \nof Police [IACP] have endorsed this legislation. It is from police \nofficers in New Hampshire that I first heard of this \n[[Page S3807]] problem, and it is from IACP that I learned that these \nregulations were causing difficulties not only in New Hampshire, but \naround the country.\n   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nmeasure. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill and additional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

WAIVER OF OVERTIME COMPENSATION.\n\n       Section 7(o) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 207(o)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesigning paragraph (6) as paragraph (7); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (5), the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(5) A public agency which is a State, political \n     subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental \n     organization shall not be required to pay an employee \n     overtime compensation or provide compensatory time under this \n     section for any period during which the employee--\n       ``(A) volunteered to perform services for the public \n     agency; and\n       ``(B) signed a legally binding waiver of such compensation \n     or compensatory time.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                             Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, March 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: The International Association of Chiefs \n     of Police (IACP) has long been in support of amendments to \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act. Applying laws and regulations \n     initially designed for the private sector, to public sector \n     employers and employees has created difficulties that can \n     only be curbed by federal legislation. While IACP believes \n     that other additional amendments would be helpful, we \n     certainly support and endorse your proposed bill that would \n     clarify the compensation status of reserve officers who wish \n     to volunteer for public safety activities.\n       If we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John T. Whetsel,\n\n                                               President. \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 531. A bill to authorize a circuit judge who has taken part in an \nin banc hearing of a case to continue to participate in that case after \ntaking senior status, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  S. 532. A bill to clarify the rules governing venue, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  S. 533. A bill to clarify the rules governing removal of cases to \nFederal court, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                    TITLE 28 CORRECTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am today introducing three bills, each of \nwhich would correct an inadvertent glitch in title 28 of the United \nStates Code. I believe that all my colleagues will find these bills to \nbe uncontroversial and nonpartisan. But they are nonetheless important, \nfor they clean up problems that have surfaced in existing provisions.\n  Let me briefly describe the three bills.\n  My first bill would modify section 46(c) of title 28 to authorize a \ncircuit judge who has taken part in an en banc hearing of a case to \ncontinue to participate in that case after taking senior status. \nSection 46(c) currently sets forth a general rule with one exception: \nit provides that only circuit judges in regular active service may sit \non the en banc court, except that a senior circuit judge who was a \nmember of the panel whose decision is being reviewed en banc may also \nbe eligible to sit on the en banc court. This general rule makes good \nsense, for it ensures that it is the judges in regular active service \nwho determine the law of the circuit. The exception also makes good \nsense, since it enables the court to avoid wasting the already-expended \nefforts of a judge.\n  The current language of section 46(c), however, inadvertently creates \na problem, for it appears to require a circuit judge in regular active \nservice who has heard argument in an en banc case to cease \nparticipating in that case when that judge takes senior status. Courts \nof appeals have regarded themselves as bound to so construe the \nstatute. See, e.g., United States v. Hudspeth, No. 93-1352--7th Cir. \nOct. 28, 1994. This result is problematic, for it means that at the \ntime of argument in an en banc case, it may be unclear who will be \neligible to vote on the final disposition. Worse, there is the \npossibility that a judge might delay--or might be perceived as \ndelaying--the release of an opinion until a member of the court takes \nsenior status, in order to affect the outcome. As the seventh circuit's \ndiscussion in Hudspeth makes clear, there is every reason to believe \nthat this consequence was inadvertently produced by Congress. The \nJudicial Council of the seventh circuit has written to me recommending \nthat this provision be reconsidered. Other courts have also faced \ndifficulties with this provision. My bill would correct this problem.\n  My second bill adopts a proposal by the Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States to correct a flaw in a venue provision, section 1391(a) \nof title 28. Section 1391(a) governs venue in diversity cases. Like \nsection 1391(b), which governs venue in Federal question cases, section \n1391(a) has a fallback provision--subsection (3)--that comes into play \nif neither of the other subsections confers venue in a particular case. \nSee C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 262--5th ed. 1994--Specifically, \nsubsection (3) provides that venue lies in ``a judicial district in \nwhich the defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction at the time \nthe action is commenced, if there is no district in which the action \nmay otherwise be brought.''\n  The defect in this fallback provision is that it may be read to mean \nthat all defendants must be subject to personal jurisdiction in a \ndistrict in order for venue to be lie. Under this reading, there would \nbe cases in which there would be no proper venue. In short, the \nfallback provision would not always work. Such a result is undesirable \nand appears to be the inadvertent product of a rather tortuous drafting \nhistory. See C. Wright, supra, at 262 n. 35.\n  My bill would eliminate the ambiguity in subsection (3) by specifying \nthat venue would be proper under this fallback provision in a district \nin which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction. This \nlanguage would track the language in the parallel fallback provision in \nsection 1391(b). Again, I note that the Judicial Conference has \nendorsed this change.\n  My third bill would remedy a problem that has arisen in the \nprocedures governing remand to State court of cases that have been \nremoved to Federal court. Section 1447(c) of title 28 provides that a \nmotion to remand a case on the basis of any defect in removal procedure \nmust be made within 30 days of the filing of the notice of removal. It \nappears clearly to have been the intent of Congress that the phrase \n``any defect in removal procedure'' would encompass any defect other \nthan lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Section 1447(c) specifies \nthat no time limit applies to motions to remand based on lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. But a few courts have taken a more narrow \nreading, and a circuit split exists. See C. Wright, supra, at 249-250 \nand nn. 3-6. My bill would make clear that a 30-day limit applies to \nall motions to remand except those based on lack of subject matter \njurisdiction.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 534. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide \nauthority for States to limit the interstate transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n             interstate waste and flow control legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that I \nbelieve will solve the longstanding problem of the interstate disposal \nof solid waste, as well as address the more recent issue involving the \nuse of flow control measures to control the disposal of these \nmaterials.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with the issue, the \ncontroversy surrounding the interstate transportation of solid waste is \none that the Senate has been considering since before 1990. Today, 47 \nStates export approximately 14 to 15 million tons of solid waste per \nyear for disposal in other States. While short distance waste exports \nhave been occurring for \n[[Page S3808]] some time, the development of a longhaul waste transport \nmarket has been a more recent development. With tipping fees of $140 \nper ton in some large cities, compared with a national average of \nbetween $30 and $50, there is an incentive for municipalities to \ntransport these wastes by truck and rail to distant States for \npermanent disposal.\n  Those States that have recently been the recipients of large amounts \nof long-haul wastes have raised a concern that their limited capacity \nfor solid waste disposal is being filled, and that they have become the \ndumping ground for someone else's waste problems. Over the last few \nyears, 37 States have passed laws to prohibit, limit, or severely tax \nwaste that enters their jurisdiction. However, almost all of these laws \nhave been stuck down for violating the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. While there has been some recent easing of disposal \ncapacity nationwide, there are still significant concerns about the \nfuture consequences of the long-haul system.\n  To address these concerns Congress, as well as the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, in particular, have been attempting to strike a \nbalance between importing and exporting States. Last year, the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, of which I am a member, \nunanimously reported S. 2345 to address this problem. A number of \nMembers, both on and off the committee, including Senators Coats, \nSpecter, Lautenberg, Moynihan, and others, took a very active role in \nattempting to develop a compromise that importing and exporting States \ncould live with. While the Senate easily passed this compromise by \nvoice vote on September 30, 1994, time ran out before this issue could \nbe finally resolved.\n  Today I am offering legislation that is cosponsored by Senator \nChafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthat will address both interstate waste and flow control. Title I of \nour bill, which pertains to interstate waste, is essentially the same \npackage that the Senate overwhelmingly supported last year. There was \nno opposition that I was aware of. It is our hope that we will have \nsimilar support for this legislation so that we can quickly lay this \nissue to rest.\n  The issue of flow control is another trashrelated concern that has \nbeen brought before Congress as a result of Supreme Court action. In \nessence, flow control is a mechanism that has been utilized by a \nvariety of towns and cities to mandate that solid waste be disposed of \nat facilities designated by that entity. In May 1994, the Supreme \nCourt, in the decision of Carbone versus Clarkstown, struck down a New \nYork flow control ordinance as a violation of the commerce clause. For \nbetter or worse--depending on your point of view--the Carbone decision \nessentially halted efforts nationwide to enact flow control measures. \nCities and towns that utilized flow control authority prior to Carbone \nassert that it allowed them to create integrated waste control systems, \nincluding activities such as recycling, composting, and hazardous waste \ncollection--that would not have been possible without this authority.\n  Since 1980, over $20 billion in municipal bonds have been issued to \npay for the construction of solid waste facilities utilizing flow \ncontrol. In the wake of Carbone, there has been a strong concern raised \nthat without prompt action by the Congress to authorize some flow \ncontrol, many cities and towns that let these bonds are in danger of \nhaving these investments downgraded--some say even turned into junk \nbonds. This concern was underscored by a recent decision of Moody's \nInvestors Service to downgrade the waste bond rating of five New Jersey \ncounties to below investment grade status. In addition to bond-related \nconcerns, the proponents also assert that the failure of Congress to \nprovide flow control authority will leave State and local governments \ndefenseless in their efforts to control the export of interstate waste.\n  It must be noted, however, that flow control does not have universal \nsupport. It does not really have this Senator's support. A number of \nmayors and local officials, such as Bret Schundler, the mayor of Jersey \nCity, NJ, have gone on record in strong opposition to the use of flow \ncontrol. They argue essentially that flow control limits the ability of \nlocal government to find low-cost, environmentally sound disposal \nalternatives, and results in exorbitant and unnecessarily high tipping \nfees.\n  In addition to these arguments, a recently released EPA report \nentitled ``Flow Controls and Municipal Solid Waste,'' concludes that \nnot only is there ``no empirical data showing that flow control \nprovides more or less protection'' to human health and environment. The \nreport then goes on to say that there is no evidence that ``flow \ncontrols are essential either for the development of new solid waste \ncapacity or for the long-term achievement of State and local goals for \nsource reduction, reuse, and recycling.''\n  So, last week, the Environmental and Public Works Subcommittee on \nSuperfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment, which I chair, of course, \nheld an extensive hearing that focused on two issues: Both flow control \nand interstate waste. During that hearing, we heard testimony from New \nJersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman and others, including \nCongressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, who called for the enactment of \nvery broad flow control authority for municipalities in States well \ninto the future. Others, including the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil and Competitive Enterprise Institute requested that the Senate \nenact no flow control whatever.\n  My subcommittee also heard from the Public Securities Association \nwhich outlined the domino effect that might occur if Congress were to \nfail to authorize any flow control for those municipalities that have \nalready let bonds under the presumption that they had the authority to \nflow control. They assert that not only would a failure to enact this \nauthority affect the value of the existing flow control bonds, but it \nwould also have a detrimental effect on the ability of the \nmunicipalities to let any bonds in the future.\n  So, the language that Senator Chafee and I are today introducing will \nprotect those municipalities that impose flow control pursuant to a \nlaw, ordinance, regulation, or any other legally binding provision \nprior to May 15, 1994, prior to the Carbone decision, and which \nimplemented flow control by designating a flow control facility prior \nto that date. In addition, this bill will protect those municipalities \nthat imposed flow control prior to May 15, 1994, but which were in the \nmidst of constructing such a flow control facility. Thus, in other \nwords, if the municipality had its permits to construct and had signed \ncontracts to build the facilities, had let revenue bonds, or had \nreceived its operating permit prior to May 15, 1994, it would also be \nable to take advantage of the grandfather provision and the protection \nthat we are providing in our bill.\n  Our bill also provides sufficient flexibility so that the facilities \nthat need to retrofit or modify their equipment to meet environmental \nor safety requirements, or if the facility needs to expand on the land \nthat they own and that it is covered by their permit, they will be \nallowed to do so.\n  But it does not stop there Mr. President. Our bill is intended to \nprovide a sense of finality to this issue. Precisely 30 years after \nthis legislation is adopted, no further flow control measures will be \nallowed. Zero, none.\n  I want to be clear: I am opposed to flow control. I think the \ninterstate commerce clause is exactly correct and the court's ruling \nwas correct. I am not convinced that communities need to have broad \nflow control authority in order to ensure the proper disposal of their \nsolid wastes. Nonetheless, I am aware of and I am sympathetic to and \nunderstand the position of those cities and towns that need this \ngrandfathering so they can pay off the bonds that were let, based on \nthe presumption that they had this authority. They thought they had the \nauthority, they let the bonds, and they are kind of in the middle in a \nwhipsaw, what to do. And nothing has been done since May 15, 1994, \nexcept the bonds have been going down in value.\n  So, under our bill, those municipalities that took action on this \npresumption will be protected. It is a grandfather protection. It ends \nin 30 years. Why 30 years? Because that is as long as any bonds that we \nknow of are out there. It is a compromise.\n  [[Page S3809]] Frankly, it is not my philosophical view. I do not \nbelieve that there ought to be flow control, but I do understand that \nthings happen. Sometimes people believe they are doing the right thing, \nthink they have the authority to do the right thing, and they get \ncaught in the middle.\n  I believe this legislation strikes a fair balance in accommodating \nthose who are strong proponents of States' rights and those who are \nstrong proponents of the free market system.\n  Now, there are some who will probably try to amend this legislation, \nperhaps here on the floor or in committee, who will take the position \nthat the States should have the total right to enact flow control any \nway they want to do that. But that is not the free market system. I am \nsurprised, somewhat, by some of my colleagues who take that position \nwho claim to be free marketeers.\n  So, in essence, what I tried to do in order to help those people who \nimmediately need the help, is to craft this compromise, to grandfather \nthe situations where there is an urgency here, where there has been \nsome money expended, through the processes that I indicated, letting \nthe bonds, or permitting, or construction work, or contracts, allow \nthat to be grandfathered, and then at the end of that period of time, \nwe go back to no flow control, we go back to interstate commerce.\n  Now, I am not convinced that the free market could not fully address \nthis issue of disposing of our Nation's solid waste, but I am willing \nto make this accommodation.\n  Now, again, let me repeat, so that there is no misunderstanding, I do \nnot support systemwide flow control, and I am strongly opposed to any \nprospective flow control. I feel that our bill has struck the balance, \nand I do not feel we need to go any further. Grandfathering is there. \nIt ends in 30 years from the date of the enactment of the legislation.\n  Those municipalities that are in danger of having their bonds \ndowngraded have requested that we move quickly to resolve this issue. \nThat is exactly what I have been doing. It is the first piece of \nlegislation that we worked on and marked up. There are many other \npieces of legislation out there that are very critical, that are very \nhigh priority to me and to the Senate, including Superfund. We put this \nfirst in order to accommodate these communities, these municipalities, \nwho have this problem.\n  I would hope that those people who might have a stronger view that we \nought to have total flow control would understand that I have done this \nin an effort to help those communities and not get this thing into an \nextended debate, an extended controversy, to try to go all the way over \nto systemwide flow control and allow what I believe to be a reasonable \ncompromise to pass.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation. It is very \ncarefully thought out. Senator Chafee was immensely helpful and \nsupportive. Senator Coats did a lot of work on interstate transfer of \nwaste. He was very helpful, of course, and others. I hope that we will \nget support for this legislation, that it will pass quickly, as we do \nhave kind of an emergency situation out there with these \nmunicipalities.\n  But I would just say to my colleagues, if we wind up in a huge floor \nfight, either out here on the floor or perhaps a fight in committee \nwhich delays this, then I think we are making a serious mistake in not \nhelping those communities who really need the help.\n  Again, this is a big step for me because I believe that there should \nnot be flow control, as I indicated. And had this situation not \ndeveloped where we had these municipalities who had let these bonds, we \nwould be out here with legislation that basically says there would be \nno flow control.\n  So I am doing this as a compromise to help those communities and \nmunicipalities in need. Hopefully, people will understand that and this \nlegislation will be promptly passed by the Senate, sent to the House \nand signed by the President and become law.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I join the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] in introducing legislation dealing with \ninterstate waste and flow control authority. I want to acknowledge the \nSenator's effort. As the chairman of the Environment Committee's \nSuperfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has taken the lead in drafting this legislation, \ntargeting issues that went unresolved last year.\n  As you may recall, at the close of the last session of Congress, a \nso-called compromise on interstate waste and flow control was approved \nby the House and sent to the Senate on the last day of the session. I \nhad real concerns with the bill. We could have approved that bill if \nthere had been time for debate and an opportunity to consider \namendments. But that was not the case. It was a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition, and for a number of reasons, I could not take it.\n  The legislation was broad in scope, both on interstate and flow \ncontrol. In my view, unlike the Senate-passed bill on interstate \nwaste--which was a fair accommodation of importing and exporting \nStates' interests--the House-passed bill tilted the scales out of \nbalance in favor of importing States. Rhode Island, I might add, is a \nwaste exporter. On flow control--which was not addressed in the Senate \nbill--the House bill favored local governments to the detriment of \nconsumers and small business.\n  My major concerns with the House-passed bill revolved around three \nkey issues, one on interstate and two on flow control.\n  On interstate, the primary problem was the inclusion of language \ncreating a statutory presumption against the lawful shipment of waste \nacross the State lines. On flow control, the House-passed bill granted \nauthority not only to existing facilities with outstanding bond debt--\nthe Public Securities Association's primary concern--but also to \nfacilities with little or no financial exposure. In addition, the \nlanguage would have resurrected Rhode Island's flow control authority--\neven though a Federal district court blocked that law in 1992, and the \nState has no need for the authority.\n  Now, to the legislation. For the record, Senator Smith chaired a \nWaste Control Subcommittee hearing on March 1, 1995, to solicit \ntestimony on interstate waste and flow control from the various \ninterest groups, including the National Association of Counties, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the Natural Resources \nDefense Council, and waste haulers. In addition, Senators Coats and \nCohen as well as Representative Chris Smith and Gov. Christine Todd \nWhitman testified before the committee. There is great interest in \nmoving this legislation early in the session, and we intend to do so.\n  The legislation is straightforward. Title I deals exclusively with \nthe interstate transport of waste. Title II focuses on the issue of \nflow control.\n  Let me turn to title I. On interstate shipments, this bill we are \nintroducing is similar to S. 2345, legislation that was approved \nunanimously by the Senate last year. I want to make it clear that the \nbill before us deals exclusively with the transport, across State \nborders, of municipal solid waste--commonly known as garbage or trash. \nIt purposely avoids imposing restrictions on the interstate transport \nof hazardous waste, industrial waste, or even construction and \ndemolition debris, which create a different set of problems, and would \nrequire markedly different approaches.\n  The interstate conflict is a symptom of a larger solid waste problem. \nOur society is generating more and more waste. We are a throw-away \nsociety. As a result, our landfills have become precious resources. \nWhat's more, communities all across the country are finding it \nexceedingly difficult to site new capacity, even for waste generated \nwithin their borders.\n  Listen to these statistics. In the United States, we generate about \n180 million tons of municipal waste each year. Forty-three States ship \nsome 15 million tons out of State each year. Forty-two States also \nimport some waste. Nearly every State relies on at least one other \nState to handle some portion of their waste. The vast majority of these \nshipments are noncontroversial, so-called border waste which has been \ntraveling short distances over State lines for years. We do not want to \nupset these arrangements unnecessarily.\n  The real problem arises when some States, such as Pennsylvania, \nIndiana, and Ohio are forced to accept far more \n[[Page S3810]] waste than they want. We need a three-part strategy to \nsolve this problem. First, we must reduce the amount of waste we \nproduce. Second, we need to recycle more of the waste that is produced. \nAnd third, States and localities must be given some additional \nauthority to control the disposal of waste in a safe and \nenvironmentally sound manner.\n  Toward this end, the bill we are considering would give States \nlimited authority to impose restrictions on municipal wastes that are \nimported from other States. Subject to certain exceptions, this \nlegislation allows a Governor to prohibit shipments of out-of-State \nwaste if the affected local government submits a request to the \nGovernor. In addition, a Governor could unilaterally freeze out-of-\nState waste at 1993 levels at certain landfills and incinerators.\n  The legislation, I must admit, is complicated because it attempts to \naccommodate the interests of many Members and because it recognizes \nthat interstate waste is not an issue in just one or two States. In \ndeveloping this bill, the chairman has struggled to provide States some \ncontrol over imported garbage without unduly limiting interstate \ncommerce.\n  In addressing the problem, the chairman has tried to find a solution \nthat will reduce unwanted imports, and yet give exporting States some \ntime to reduce the amount of waste generated, to increase recycling, \nand to site new, in-State capacity. I believe the legislation we are \nconsidering, while far from perfect, is equitable, and will provide a \nresponsible solution to the problem.\n  To be sure, our work on this issue, as well as on flow control, has \njust begun. Senator Smith and I are ready to work with the committee \nand other interested Members of the Senate to craft a bill that can be \napproved by both Senate and House.\n  Now to title II on flow control. Flow control is the method used to \nroute a community's solid waste to designated, often publicly financed, \ndisposal facilities, with little or no competition from the private \nsector. Flow control laws, because of their potential interference in \ninterstate\n commerce, have been overturned in several Federal courts, most \nrecently last May at the Supreme Court in Carbone versus Clarkstown. \nThe issue is controversial both for the private waste market and the \nmany communities that have financed waste facilities in reliance upon \nflow control.\n\n  The implications of congressional action on flow control have the \npotential to resonate throughout the economy. Flow control laws have \nbeen widely used in recent years, often as a tool to guarantee that \nprojected amounts of waste and revenues will be received at waste \nmanagement facilities funded by revenue bonds. In fact, since 1980, \nover $24 billion in municipal bonds have been issued to pay for the \nconstruction of solid waste facilities.\n  In the overwhelming majority of cases, investors were assured that \nthe projected amounts of waste would be delivered to the facility \nbecause flow control laws were in place. In some cases, the local \ngovernment agreed to bear the risk that flow control laws would be \nfound to be unconstitutional. They have enforceable put-or-pay \ncontracts. Now, unless a solution is developed, affected governments' \nbond ratings may be at risk, and local residents will have to pay for \nservices they are not receiving.\n  In developing a solution, however, we must take into consideration \nnot only the interests of local taxpayers and bondholders but also \nconsumers and small business who may get a better deal in the absence \nof flow control laws. Furthermore, I have great concern generally with \nthe anticompetitive nature of flow control.\n  The bill we are introducing today strikes a balance, protecting past \ncommunity investments based on flow control without perpetuating an \nanticompetitive market going forward. Under our bill, each State and \neach political subdivision may exercise flow control authority if that \nauthority is imposed pursuant to law or other legally binding provision \nand has been implemented by designating facilities that were \nconstructed after the effective date of the provision and prior to May \n15, 1994. In addition, the bill provides a grandfather provision, for \ncommunities that have made a substantial commitment toward the \ndesignation of a waste management facility, although not yet \nconstructed, prior to May 15, 1994. Finally, the bill includes a flow \ncontrol authority sunset provision effective 30 years after date of \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation represents a good faith \neffort to bring the various parties together on the issues of \ninterstate waste and flow control. It provides additional authority to \nwaste importers without overriding the needs of waste exporting \nStates--it protects past community financial investments and yet \nprovides opportunities for the private sector. So, I commend the \nSenator from New Hampshire and look forward to working with him and the \nother members of the committee to report this legislation in an \nexpeditious fashion.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 537. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     the alaska native claims settlement act amendments act of 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. This \nlegislation is noncontroversial and fully supported by the Alaska \nFederation of Natives. The bill was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last Congress. The Senate Energy Committee held \nhearings and approved a similar bill. Unfortunately, it did not pass \nthe full Senate last year because of an issue unrelated to this \nlegislation.\n  The enactment of the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act [ANCSA] was a \nlandmark event in Alaska's history. The land grants and compensation \nprovided to Alaska Natives under ANCSA was unprecedented and has proven \nto be a successful alternative to the reservation system in the lower \n48 States. ANCSA created business corporations based on existing Alaska \nNative communities and the corporations are responsible for investing \nand managing assets provided under ANCSA for the benefit of the all-\nNative shareholders. ANCSA created a system that allows Alaska Natives \nto become self-sufficient.\n  While I am happy to say that the system created under ANCSA is \nworking, there are some changes that are sometimes necessary to make \nsure the intent of ANCSA is carried out. This bill corrects existing \ntechnical problems with ANCSA and the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act [ANILCA]. An identical bill was introduced in the \nHouse by my colleague from Alaska.\n  The legislation is designed to resolve specific problems, for example \none section of the bill will make it possible for the Caswell and \nMontana Creek Native groups to receive lands approved by a February \n1976 agreement and finally fulfill their land entitlement under ANCSA. \nAnother provision would allow Chugach Native Corp. to select a specific \ntract of land at the edge of their own current boundaries. Included in \nthis bill there are eight technical amendments to resolve specific \nissues. Another section would make certain veterans from the Vietnam \nera eligible for land allotments under ANCSA.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the committee which last year \nagreed that all of these items were noncontroversial will retain their \nspirit of cooperation so that this legislation will be able to move \nearly in this session.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 538. A bill to reinstate the permit for, and extend the deadline \nunder the Federal Power Act applicable to the construction of, a \nhydroelectric project in Oregon, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              talent irrigation district license extension\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation which allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \ngrant Talent Irrigation District, in Jackson County, OR, an extension \nof its hydro project construction commencement deadline.\n  The project is a 2.4-megawatt powerhouse, planned as an attachment to \nthe existing Emigrant Dam, on the Emigrant River in southern Oregon. \nLow water conditions in the Emigrant \n[[Page S3811]] River, resulting from 8 years of continuous drought in \nOregon, have caused the irrigation district to reevaluate the operating \nplan of the project. I believe granting an extension in this case will \nenable local officials to better configure this project to maximize \npower production and fish enhancement in light of the reduced water \nflows in the Emigrant River.\n  Construction of the existing Emigrant Dam was completed in 1959. It \nhas a structural height of 176 feet and impounds 39,000 acre feet of \nwater, which is delivered to about 8,000 users, irrigating \napproximately 30,000 acres.\n  On May 24, 1989, FERC issued a construction license to the Talent \nIrrigation District for the hydro project extension at Emigrant Dam. \nThe license required construction to commence within 2 years--by May \n24, 1991. In January 1991, the district requested and received a 2-year \nextension of the construction commencement deadline, until May 24, \n1993, citing the need to consult further with the Bureau of Reclamation \nand continue negotiating a power sales agreement.\n  All negotiations were completed by April 1992, but the low flow \nconditions in the Emigrant River caused the Talent Irrigation District \nto postpone the commencement of construction and reevaluate the hydro \nproject's proposed operating plan. When the 2-year extension expired on \nMay 24, 1993, FERC canceled the license.\n  In order to commence with this project, the district needs its \nlicense reinstated and additional time to carefully evaluate the \noperating plan for the Emigrant hydro project and adjust it to perform \nbetter under low water conditions, both for power production and fish \nenhancement. The Federal Power Act, however,\n only allows FERC to grant one 2-year extension to the district, which \nit granted in 1991. Therefore, legislation is required to authorize \nFERC to extend the deadline further.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today reinstates the Talent \nIrrigation District license and grants the district up to 4 years to \nbegin construction.\n  I look forward to working with members of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to ensure that this proposal receives \nprompt and thorough attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT OF PERMIT EXTENSION DEADLINE.\n\n       Notwithstanding the expiration of the permit and \n     notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of \n     the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise \n     apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project \n     numbered 7829, the Commission shall, at the request of the \n     licensee for the project, reinstate the permit effective May \n     23, 1993, and extend the time period during which the \n     licensee is required to commence the construction of the \n     project to the date that is 4 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 539. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax exemption for health risk pools; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE HEALTH RISK POOLS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto grant Federal tax exemption to State health risk pools. The purpose \nof a health risk pool is to provide health and accident insurance \ncoverage to individuals who, because of health conditions, would \notherwise not be able to secure health insurance coverage.\n  Since 1976, 28 States have enacted legislation establishing a health \ninsurance pool aimed at protecting uninsurable and high-risk \nindividuals. Most of the pools were established in the last 4 years.\n  For example, the Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool Association \nAct was enacted by the Mississippi State Legislature during the 1991 \nlegislative session and became effective April 15, 1991. At that time \nMississippi became the 25th State to enact such legislation.\n  The Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool Association was created \nto implement such a health insurance program. Members of the \nassociation include insurance companies and nonprofit health care \norganizations which are authorized to write direct health insurance \npolicies and contracts supplemental to health insurance policies in \nMississippi. The association also includes third party administrators \nwho are paying and processing health insurance claims for Mississippi \nresidents.\n  Over the past 3 years, the association has issued medical insurance \npolicies to approximately 900 Mississippians. The association is funded \nby premiums paid by policyholders and quarterly assessments against \nmembers of the association. There is no public funding--State or \nFederal--involved.\n  Currently, about 120,000 individuals nationwide are a member of a \nState pool. Nationally, there are an additional 1 to 3 million people \nwho are uninsured and uninsurable, and who could be eligible for \ninclusion in a State pool.\n  Unfortunately, several State health risk pools have applied for, and \nhave been denied, exemption from Federal taxation under International \nRevenue Code sections 501(c)(4) and/or 501(c)(6). Generally, the \nInternal Revenue Service's [IRS] rationale for such denial has been \nthat the sole activity of the health risk pools is the provision of \nhealth insurance for individual policyholders. The IRS perceives, \nincorrectly in my view, health risk pools as a regular business \nordinarily carried on for profit, which primarily provide commercial \ntype insurance. Moreover, the IRS takes the position that health risk \npools are primarily serving the private interests of its members and \nnot the common interest of the community as a whole.\n  In its decision to deny the State of Mississippi's Comprehensive \nHealth Insurance Risk Pool Association exemption from Federal income \ntax, the Internal Revenue Service in a letter dated August 16, 1993, \nstates:\n\n       For purposes of section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code, an organization providing insurance for its members or \n     other individuals, except in very limited instances, either \n     is considered to be engaged in an activity that is an economy \n     or convenience in the conduct of members' businesses because \n     it relieves the members of obtaining insurance on an \n     individual basis, or is a regular business of a kind \n     ordinarily carried on for profit. In either case, the \n     activity of providing insurance is not considered to be an \n     exempt activity under section 501(c)(6) and, if it is the \n     primary activity of the organizations, exemption under \n     section 501(c)(6) is precluded pursuant to section \n     1.501(c)(6)-1 of the regulations.\n\n  However, health risk pools have been created by statute in several \nStates to serve a public function of relieving the hardship of those \nwho, for health reasons, are unable to obtain health insurance \ncoverage. These pools do not carry on an activity ordinarily carried on \nby insurance companies and are not designed to make a profit. Further, \nthey are established by State statute and none of the net earnings \nbenefits any private shareholder, member, or individual.\n  The Federal Government should serve as an impetus for, not an \nimpediment to, State health care reform. We should do all we can to \nincrease the ability of States to help the uninsured. The Senate \nFinance Committee recognized the value of health risk pools and \nincluded a version of this bill in their health care reform legislation \nlast year.\n  In order to allow States real flexibility in designing effective \nhealth care plans, State health risk pools should be exempt from \ntaxation. By passing this legislation, we will promote State-based \nhealth care reform by expressly granting Federal tax exemption to State \nhealth risk pools, notwithstanding the IRS's current position. While \nfuture national health care reform may eliminate the need for State \nhealth risk pools, until such reform is implemented, these entities \nwill remain the only source of medical insurance for many of our \ncitizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That (a) subsection (c) of section 501 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code \n     [[Page S3812]] of 1986 (relating to list of exempt \n     organizations) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(26) Any corporation, association, or similar legal \n     entity which is created by any State or political subdivision \n     thereof to establish a risk pool to provide health insurance \n     coverage to any person unable to obtain health insurance \n     coverage in the private insurance market because of health \n     conditions and no part of the net earnings of which inures to \n     the benefit of any private shareholder, member, or \n     individual.''\n       (b) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 540. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nrequire the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \nconduct at least three demonstration projects involving promising \ntechnologies and practices to remedy contaminated sediments in the \nGreat Lakes system and to authorize the Administrator to provide \ntechnical information and assistance on technologies and practices for \nremediation of contaminated sediments, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 541. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \ncoordinate and promote Great Lakes activities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   great lakes resources legislation\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today on behalf \nof myself and my distinguished colleagues, Senator DeWine and Senator \nLevin to introduce the Assessment and Remediation of Contaminated \nSediments [ARCS] Reauthorization Act and on behalf of Senator DeWine, \nSenator Levin, and Senator Feingold to introduce the Great Lakes \nFederal Effectiveness Act.\n  I am honored to be joined by a new Great Lakes Senator, Senator \nDeWine. I am pleased that the Senator from my home State, Ohio, has \nshown such significant leadership on Great Lakes issues so early on in \nthe 104th Congress. Both Senator Levin and Senator Feingold's \nconsistent leadership on issues of critical importance to the Great \nLakes is exemplary. Furthermore, I am honored that another Ohio \ncolleague, Congressman LaTourette, and Congressman Quinn are \nintroducing a House companion bill for the Great Lakes Federal \nEffectiveness Act with Congressman Oberstar joining them on the ARCS \nReauthorization Act.\n  These two bills address the unique water resources in the Great Lakes \nregion, the impact of contaminated sediments on our freshwater \nresources and the need for coordinated research efforts to efficiently \napply science to our efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. I \nam proud to join my colleagues from the Great Lakes region in the \nintroduction of the ARCS Reauthorization Act and the Great Lakes \nFederal Effectiveness Act.\n  Sedimentation has created a need to dredge Great Lakes harbors for \ndecades. Industrialization of our region and the nation increased the \namount of erosion and storm water runoff which in turn escalates the \namount of sediment being deposited on our lake and river bottoms and \ncoastal shores. Unfortunately, recent times have seen dredging become \nincreasingly costly largely due to the contaminants which accompany the \nsilt. Contaminated dredge spoils require special handling for proper \ndisposal which adds to the cost of the dredging.\n  Contrary to what one might think, the bottom of a water body is not a \nsafe depository for toxics. Resuspension of these toxics may result \nfrom both human and natural activity in the water thus acting as a \ncontinual discharge of contamination into the water. The contaminants \nbecome available to enter the food chain or come in contact with \nrecreational users. Contaminated sediments can result in shellfish \ncontamination, fish advisories and threats to human health by those who \nconsume tainted fish.\n  The ARCS Program is a demonstration program for innovative technology \nto address the problem of contaminated sediments. The 5-year ARCS \nprogram was originally authorized in the 1987 Clean Water Act. The ARCS \nProgram authorized the implementation of pilot-scale tests of promising \nsediment remediation technologies to address the water pollution \nproblems in the Great Lakes. Reauthorization of the ARCS Program takes \nus to the next level: full-scale demonstrations of contaminated \nsediment remediation. The ARCS Program, coordinated by the \nAdministrator of the EPA, acting through the Great Lakes National \nProgram Office, would implement three sediment remediation \ndemonstration projects and at least one full-scale demonstration of a \nremediation technology.\n  The second bill, the Great Lakes Federal Effectiveness Act [GLFEA] is \nconsistent with the current efforts to streamline Government and reduce \nredundant or outdated programs. The GLFEA will prevent unnecessary \nduplication of efforts among Federal agencies which undertake Great \nLakes research. The act establishes a Great Lakes Council, composed of \noffices from the Environmental Protection Research Agency, Fish and \nWildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nand other Federal agencies conducting research in the Great Lakes \nbasin. The Council will assess the current status of scientific \nresearch capabilities, identify research priorities for the region, \nmake recommendations for integrated data collection and management of \nGreat Lakes resources, and finally develop and disseminate its findings \nthrough a biennial report.\n  The Great Lakes Federal Effectiveness Act does not require any new \nfunding, rather it actually aims to help agencies better manage their \nresearch budgets and potentially cut costs through cooperative efforts \nto set research priorities and avoid unnecessary or duplicative \nprojects. The Great Lakes Council will essentially serve as a \nclearinghouse for Great Lakes information and research findings and \ndevelop a uniform, multimedia, data collection protocol for use across \nthe Great Lakes basin.\n  The multimedia approach of this legislation allows our experts to \nshare scientific knowledge and address air, water, soil, and wildlife \nfactors in our efforts toward responsible stewardship of the Great \nLakes ecosystem. This ecosystem perspective on the natural environment, \nif incorporated into our Federal environmental policy, promises to \nfundamentally improve the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental \nmanagement.\n  The Great Lakes Federal Effectiveness Act will provide Federal, \nState, academic and private sector officials with a vehicle through \nwhich information can be compiled and ultimately shared among the \nregion's research community. The act will stretch our research dollars \nand help us to better tap scientific resources within the private \nsector, the academic community, and Federal agencies. I urge my \ncolleagues of the Senate to endorse this legislation and move toward \nits timely enactment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I \nwrote a newspaper column intended to end much of the confusion \nsurrounding Social Security and its role in the recent debate on the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I ask that the text be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n  A Reality Check on Social Security and the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       There is some confusion about the role of Social Security \n     and the Balanced Budget Amendment. Let me answer a few of the \n     questions that people are asking:\n       Would the Balanced Budget Amendment treat Social Security \n     any differently than it is being treated now?\n       No. And if you are confused on this point, don't feel \n     badly. One of the senators who participated in the debate \n     didn't understand this either.\n       Does the Balanced Budget Amendment voted on recently treat \n     Social Security differently than the amendment voted on in \n     1994?\n       The wording is identical on anything related to Social \n     Security.\n       Would the Social Security system be better off with or \n     without a Balanced Budget Amendment?\n       Much better off with a Balanced Budget Amendment. The great \n     threat to Social Security is the growing federal debt. If it \n     continues as projected, the United States government will \n     eventually ``solve'' its problem like all nations with huge \n     debts have historically done, by printing more and more \n     money, making the dollar worth less and less. When you debase \n     the value of the dollar, you also debase the value of the \n     United States bonds that are the security for Social \n     Security. If the dollar becomes worth ten cents, the bonds \n     held by Social Security also drop 90 percent in value. That \n     devastates Social Security. Those of us fighting for a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment are trying to prevent this economic \n     catastrophe from happening, but that is where we are now \n     headed.\n       As a strong defender of Social Security, why didn't you \n     vote to exempt Social Security in the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment?\n       For two reasons.\n       First, I believe everything should be in the budget. As \n     soon as you start making exceptions, where do you stop? I \n     also believe it is important to include Social Security \n     because in less than 30 years, Social Security will spend \n     more than it takes in. We should have an obligation to \n     protect Social Security well into the future, and not use the \n     excuse that it isn't our responsibility.\n       Second, to make an exception of Social Security would \n     permit a huge loophole in the amendment. Future Congresses \n     could put welfare under Social Security, senior citizen \n     housing, and virtually anything else. Since the word \n     ``security'' is used, a creative Congress could even put the \n     defense budget under Social Security.\n       Will there be changes in Social Security programs?\n       Apart from balancing the budget, there will have to be, for \n     the long-term future of Social Security. My guess is that \n     those on Social Security retirement now will experience no \n     change in their retirement, but to prepare for a less rosy \n     future, for example, \n     [[Page S3814]] there may have to be a one-half of one percent \n     increase in the tax for Social Security on employers and \n     employees, and some type of gradual increase in retirement \n     age, worked out with the senior groups. If we were to raise \n     the retirement age by one month a year for twelve years, over \n     that period the retirement age would be raised by one year, \n     and save billions of dollars for the retirement fund.\n       Also, Medicare will face serious shortfalls in only a few \n     years. Here I favor changes now. For example, why shouldn't \n     everyone with an income of over $100,000 a year pay for his \n     or her own physician's fees? Hospital coverage and other \n     features could remain the same. That one change would save \n     billions of dollars.\n       Do Senators like Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan of North \n     Dakota have no valid point of concern?\n       They do. Since 1969 the federal government has included \n     Social Security surpluses in our budgets so that the deficits \n     would not look so bad. I have joined Sen. Fritz Hollings of \n     South Carolina in trying to stop that practice, but \n     administrations of both parties like to make their budgets \n     look better.\n       During the evening negotiations on the Balanced Budget \n     Amendment on the night the vote was first scheduled, Sen. \n     Conrad was able to get an agreement to gradually move away \n     from this practice, but he finally rejected the offer. One of \n     my colleagues in the Senate told me, ``Sen. Conrad was on the \n     verge of a great victory for the Social Security cause and \n     for sensible budgeting, but he blew it.'' I believe that \n     judgment is premature. It is still possible that something \n     can be worked out.\n       For the sake of Social Security recipients, and for the \n     sake of the future of our country, I hope something will \n     be.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3813-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE UNITED STATES-NORTH KOREA AGREED FRAMEWORK\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs I come to the floor of \nthe Senate this afternoon to briefly respond to certain statements made \nyesterday by representatives of the Government of the Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea regarding the agreed framework between our \ntwo countries governing the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's \nnuclear program.\n  North Korea has, for the second time in a month, again threatened to \nscuttle the agreement by making ludicrous take-it-or-leave-it demands. \nThis time, it refuses to accept delivery from the Republic of Korea of \ntwo light-water reactors called for under the framework. The Democratic \nPeople's Republic of Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement in \nSwitzerland stating that if the United States does not agree to another \ncountry furnishing the reactors, ``because of the United States' \nattitude in insisting on supplying the South Korea type, we will be \nforced to take an appropriate position.'' The statement continued, \n``Even if that brings about the breakdown of the framework agreement * \n* * we will have nothing to lose but fear.''\n  Mr. President, I--and, I am sure, my colleagues--grow weary of the \ncontinual 11th hour posturing and brinkmanship which seems to be the \nmainstay of the North's negotiating strategy. In a speech in the Senate \non February 13, 1995, I made clear my position:\n\n       I will not support the provision by the United States of \n     one scintilla more than is called for in the Agreed Framework \n     without substantial concessions from the DPRK; nor will I \n     accept any diminution of the central role that has been set \n     out for the ROK. South Korea is making a huge contribution to \n     implementing the agreement, and it is their national interest \n     that is most at stake. To accede to any demands by the DPRK \n     in this regard is to assist it in its ongoing attempts to \n     undermine US-ROK relationship.\n\n  This apparently bears repeating to drive it home to the North. If the \nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea thinks that we will capitulate on \nthe reactor issue, it is seriously mistaken. To put it into words that \nthe Government in Pyongyang cannot mistake, its wish for reactors \nmanufactured elsewhere is like a hungry man looking at ``keurim eui \nteok i da,'' rice cakes in a picture. The North Koreans need to know, \nclearly and unequivocally, that on this point the Congress and \nadministration are in complete and unwavering agreement; there is no \nacceptable alternative. We will stand by our position, stand by our \nprinciples, and most importantly stand by our important ally South \nKorea. If Pyongyang chooses to abandon the agreement, then so be it, we \nwill quickly find ourselves back at the U.N. Security Council where the \nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea will find itself the subject of \ntough economic sanctions.\n  Mr. President, next week at my behest the members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee will meet with Ambassador Galucci. I look forward \nto that meeting both as an opportunity to hear first hand about these \nlatest developments, and as a chance to reiterate my position for the \nadministration.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3814-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3814-S3818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   STUDENT LOAN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my colleagues from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, yesterday recited a long list of items where the new \nCongress has declared war on working Americans.\n  One item that he mentioned is the attack on student financial aid: 75 \npercent of all college student aid comes from the Federal Government, \nmuch of that in the form of loans. The only significant Federal student \naid subsidy that reaches middle-class families is the Federal payment \nof interest while students are in school. Now, it seems that this \nbenefit is in danger in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I have argued that as far as student aid is concerned, \nwe should not be balancing the budget on the backs of students while \nbanks and middlemen continue to receive excessive subsidies in the \nStudent Loan Program.\n  Two weeks ago, a letter I wrote to the Washington Post made the point \nthat the Guaranteed Student Loan Program is not the private sector \nsystem that its proponents would have us believe it is, and that it is \nriddled with dangerous conflicts of interest.\n  In a response that appeared in yesterday's Washington Post, Roy \nNicholson, the chairman of USA Group, charges me with vilifying and \n``attempt[ing] to silence'' him, while ignoring ``the substance of the \ndebate'' on student loans.\n  Ironically, Nicholson does not respond to the substance of the \ninspector general's concern, raised in my letter, that ``billions of \ndollars of the Nation's [student loan] portfolio are at risk because \nmany guaranty agencies * * * have a clear conflict of interest.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the two letters and the inspector general \nreport be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Guaranty agencies like USA Group are supposed to act as bank \nregulators on behalf of the U.S. Government. Since banks have little \nfinancial incentive to put serious effort into collecting payments on \nGovernment-backed student loans, it is the guarantors' responsibility \nto ensure that--before taxpayers reimburse banks for a default--the \nbank actually did try to collect.\n  But what if, as in the case of USA Group, the guarantor works not \njust for the Government, but for the banks, too? Clearly, this is a \ncase of the shepherd moonlighting for the wolf. The inspector general \nprovides a number of examples of how these arrangements put taxpayer \ndollars at great risk.\n  Last year, a specific incident involving USA Group made this conflict \npainfully clear. In an effort to address the default problem, Congress \n2 years ago directed the Education Department to oversee the loan \ncollectors. But last June, when the Department tried to implement the \nnew rules--something that guarantors, as protectors of the taxpayers, \nshould support--USA Group sued to stop the rules, arguing that it was \nnot fair to them as contractors for the banks.\n  The student loan industry has decided that the only way to keep their \nentitlements in the face of President Clinton's money-saving reforms to \nthe Student Loan Program is to portray the reforms as big Government, \nin contrast to the current private sector system.\n  Don't be fooled. It is not a private sector system when the \nGovernment takes virtually all the risk of default through entities it \nbacks with the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  Mr. President, taking a closer look at what is really going on in the \nGuaranteed Student Loan Program is not ``the politics of vilification'' \nor an ``attempt to silence.'' It is what the substance of the debate \nshould be. It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that people \ndo try to take advantage of Federal programs. I do not consider it out-\nof-bounds to describe the structures and perverse incentives that lead \nto abuse.\n  [[Page S3815]] President Clinton has proposed that the costly and \nrisky Guarantee Program be phased out and replaced by the Direct \nStudent Loan Program, which is working remarkably well at the first 104 \ncolleges involved this year. He is also proposing that guaranty \nagencies return $1.1 billion in excess Federal reserves over the next 5 \nyears.\n  These money-saving proposals should be seriously considered by \nCongress. Yet committee chairmen in both Houses are talking only about \nways to put brakes on the Direct Loan Program.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford to ignore the enormous abuses in the \nGuarantee Program. I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at both \nthe Guaranteed and Direct Student Loan Programs, and to focus our \nefforts on providing assistance to students and taxpayers.\n  The material follows:\n               [From the Washington Post, March 2, 1995]\n\n            Conflict of Interest in the Student Loan Program\n\n       In opposing President Clinton's money-saving reforms of the \n     student loan program [``Clinton, GOP Split Over Student \n     Loans,'' front page, Feb. 14], USA Group argues that it \n     supports the ``competition'' in the current ``private-public \n     partnership.''\n       Ironically, the only things ``private sector'' about USA \n     Group are its salaries.\n       As a guarantor responsible for helping to oversee banks' \n     roles in the student loan program, USAG has no private \n     investors or contributors. Every penny of the $141,087,845 \n     that USAG had in the bank in 1993 came from federal \n     entitlements set by lobbying Congress, not through private-\n     sector competition.\n       Furthermore, USAG has taken those taxpayer funds and used \n     them to start other businesses, including becoming lenders--\n     putting USAG in the position of regulating its own banking \n     activity. The Education Department's inspector general has \n     called this a ``clear conflict of interest,'' putting \n     ``billions of dollars of the nation's [student loan] \n     portfolio as risk.''\n       USAG paid its chairman $527,833 plus benefits in 1992, even \n     though it is a ``charitable'' organization and its employees \n     are essentially public servants.\n       Taxpayers and students can do without ``partners'' like \n     these.\n     Paul Simon\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 9, 1995]\n\n                     The Debate About Student Loans\n\n       Sen. Paul Simon's March 2 letter--which responds to The \n     Post's Feb. 14 front-page story about the issue of direct \n     government loans for college students--ignores the substance \n     of the debate and instead levels an attack on USA Group Inc., \n     the nation's leading guarantor-administrator of student \n     loans.\n       Sen. Simon's letter continues an unfortunate pattern in \n     which the proponents of government lending try to discredit \n     those who disagree with them, and he recklessly disregards \n     the facts about USA Group.\n       USA Group is proud of its public service to millions of \n     American students, but that work doesn't make us public \n     employees. The company was established as a nonprofit \n     corporation in 1960, five years before enactment of the \n     Higher Education Act, which created the guaranteed student \n     loan program. From its inception, a major portion of revenues \n     has derived from non-guarantor activities serving higher \n     education.\n       USA Group affiliates annually open their books for numerous \n     independent audits, including those undertaken by federal \n     agencies. Contrary to Sen. Simon's unsubstantiated assertion, \n     USA Group has never taken taxpayer funds to start other \n     businesses, and these audits clearly demonstrate our \n     compliance with the highest fiduciary standards.\n       USA Group's voice of experience, which Sen. Simon attempts \n     to silence, is warning the nation's thoughtful policymakers--\n     and there are many on both sides of the aisle--about the \n     pitfalls they risk by accelerating government lending before \n     we know whether the government can effectively operate a $25 \n     billion to $30 billion a year consumer loan program.\n       The politics of vilification has no place in the debate. \n     Let's hope that reason and fact prevail in determining \n     whether government lending is in the best long-term interests \n     of students, schools and taxpayers.\n     Roy A.

Currently, billions of dollars of \n     the nation's FFELP portfolio are at risk because many \n     guaranty agencies are affiliated with FFELP loan servicers, \n     secondary markets, and other FFELP service providers, and \n     thus have a clear conflict of interest.\n\n\n         billions of dollars of the ffelp portfolio are at risk\n\n       We obtained data from 12 guaranty agencies that represent \n     about $59 billion in total loan guarantees (approximately $42 \n     billion in loans in repayment, and $17 billion in loans in \n     deferment). In fiscal year 1991, the 12 guarantors we \n     contacted accounted for approximately 68 percent of the new \n     FFELP loan volume. Nine of the 12 guaranty agencies, with \n     approximately $40 billion in loan guarantees, are affiliated \n     with organizations that they are required to monitor. Of the \n     $40 billion in loan guarantees, we have identified \n     approximately $11 billion that are at risk due to the \n     potential conflicts of interest. The schedule in Attachment A \n     of this report illustrates the potential dollars at risk. The \n     matrix in Attachment B of this\n      report illustrates the various affiliations that may result \n     in a conflict of interest. The notes to Attachment B \n     explain the criteria we used to determine whether an \n     affiliation exists. Where specific guaranty agencies are \n     named in the body of this report, their designations \n     correspond to those listed in the attachments to this \n     report.\n\n\n              the affiliations cause a number of problems\n\n       The affiliations take many forms. For example, Guaranty \n     Agency B was so closely affiliated with a profit-making FFELP \n     service provider that its CPA firm issued consolidated \n     financial statements. Often, the guaranty agency acts as a \n     parent corporation, with nonprofit and profit subsidiaries \n     providing it with various services. In fact, Guaranty Agency \n     G and a FFELP loan servicer functioned as divisions within a \n     larger corporation. In other cases, the firms are legally \n     separate, but are controlled by common management. In almost \n     every affiliation, the firms share board members, corporate \n     officers, management and employees. The firms also share \n     assets, such as buildings, office space, computer equipment, \n     and furniture.\n       The affiliations between guaranty agencies, FFELP loan \n     servicers, secondary markets, and other FFELP service \n     provides create many conflicts of interest. We interviewed ED \n     and General Accounting Office (GAO) officials and reviewed ED \n     OIG audit reports and guaranty agency program reviews \n     performed by both Regional and Headquarters staff of the \n     Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA). Each official \n     we interviewed expressed concern that the conflicts could \n     seriously impair the effectiveness of the FFELP. Similar \n     concerns were expressed in the audit reports and program \n     reviews. The concerns relate primarily to the guaranty \n     agencies' loss of independence, the integrity of FFELP \n     electronic data, the preferential treatment of affiliates, \n     and the weakened financial condition of guaranty agencies. \n     These concerns are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n               affiliations cause a loss of independence\n\n       Guaranty agencies play a critical oversight role in the \n     FFELP. When a guaranty agency is affiliated with an \n     organization that it is required to monitor, it may lack the \n     independence necessary to objectively administer the program. \n     Conflicting internal priorities may place undue pressure on \n     the guaranty agency to make decisions that are not in the \n     best interest of the taxpayer.\n       In one state, for example, the secondary market was \n     instrumental in founding Guaranty Agency I. Later, the \n     guarantor and the secondary market joined forces to create a \n     new management company. As a result of this reorganization, \n     the guaranty agency and the secondary market came under \n     common management. Additionally, the secondary market has \n     provided the guaranty agency with $3.5 million in loans and \n     is committed to provide an additional $10 million line of \n     credit.\n       In such cases, the guaranty agency may be unable to deal \n     impartially with a corporation that is actively involved in \n     its management and is a major source of its funding. If the \n     guaranty agency disallows claims submitted by the secondary \n     market, it hurts the finances of one of the guaranty agency's \n     major funding sources.\n       The area of lender due diligence further demonstrates how \n     important it is for the guaranty agency to remain independent \n     of an organization it is required to monitor. Basically, \n     lender due diligence regulations stipulate that the guaranty \n     agency must ensure that the lender has taken all the required \n     steps to collect the loan before it pays a default claim. In \n     this case the lender can be the original lender, a secondary \n     market, or a loan service acting on behalf of a lender. \n     Therefore, the guaranty agency must review the collection \n     activity of the lender or its agent to determine compliance \n     with Federal due diligence requirements.\n       [[Page S3816]] There is an obvious conflict of interest \n     when a guaranty agency reviews the due diligence practices of \n     its affiliated secondary market or loan servicer. In such \n     cases, the guaranty agency's findings affect its own \n     financial position. The close relationships between the FFELP \n     service providers pose a significant risk that due diligence \n     irregularities. could occur and go unreported.\n       A Guaranty Agency Failed To Remain Independent. In one \n     state, a guaranty agency that was not one of the twelve \n     included in our review, contractually delegated all of its \n     duties and functions to its affiliated secondary market. In \n     February 1989, OSFA conducted a review of the guaranty agency \n     and requested the refund of over $1 million because the \n     agency failed to follow due diligence requirements. The \n     guaranty agency appealed OSFA's findings and requested that \n     the Secretary waive the right to repayment because the \n     financial cost would ruin its affiliated secondary market. ED \n     denied the appeal and stated that the guarantor's regulatory \n     violations were a matter between the guaranty agency and ED, \n     regardless of the relationship between the guarantor and the \n     secondary market.\n       The guaranty agency's appeal was clearly designed to \n     protect the financial condition of its affiliated secondary \n     market. It also demonstrates how the financial health of an \n     affiliate may influence the decision-making of the guaranty \n     agency.\n       The conflict was even more apparent in June 1990, when the \n     same guaranty agency completed a lender review of its \n     affiliated secondary market and reported numerous areas of \n     noncompliance, including due diligence violations. However, \n     the guaranty agency neither required the appropriate \n     repayments resulting from the violations nor took action to \n     ensure future corrective action. The guaranty agency's \n     actions were even more egregious because it had contracted \n     with the secondary market to review the secondary market's \n     own claims and determine whether the guaranty agency should \n     pay them.\n       About eight months later, in February 1991, OSFA conducted \n     a review of the same secondary market. OFSA found that the \n     guaranty agency's prior review had not been appropriately \n     resolved, and compelled the secondary market to formally \n     address the\n      findings. Only after OSFA's intervention did the guaranty \n     agency assess a liability of over $1.1 million against its \n     affiliate. In our opinion, the guaranty agency's \n     reluctance to enforce the Federal regulations clearly \n     demonstrates that the interests of the taxpayers and those \n     of its affiliate where in direct conflict.\n\n\n   Affiliations Compromise the Integrity of the FFELP Electronic Data\n\n       The administration of the FFELP requires a great amount of \n     electronic data to pass between the lenders, the FFELP \n     service providers, the guaranty agencies, and ED. This \n     electronic data provides the basis for computing virtually \n     all of the costs associated with the FFELP. It also provides \n     ED with its primary means of monitoring the effectiveness of \n     the program as a whole. Therefore, the integrity of the \n     electronic data is essential to achieving the program's \n     overall goals.\n       An important mission of the guaranty agency is to conduct \n     lender and servicer reviews to ensure that there are adequate \n     internal controls over computer generated data, and that the \n     data is accurately transferred between entities. The guaranty \n     agencies also review the accuracy and reasonableness of the \n     fees and expenses computed by the automated systems.\n       ED and GAO have reported numerous problems with the \n     accuracy and the completeness of the FFELP database. We \n     believe that the conflicts of interest have contributed to \n     the lack of integrity of the database because the guaranty \n     agencies often have disincentives to identify and resolve \n     systemic problems with the automated systems.\n       First, identifying the causes of the problems can be costly \n     and often involves reviewing a system that the agency itself \n     designed for its affiliate. Second, implementing the changes \n     needed to improve the integrity of the data may place a \n     financial burden on its affiliate. Consequently, the guaranty \n     agency may conduct only cursory reviews of its affiliates in \n     order to satisfy the Federal requirements, and ignore the \n     underlying causes of the problems. In such cases, the \n     guaranty agency may continue to accept and forward data of \n     questionable accuracy in order to avoid the costly \n     expenditures needed to ensure accurate and complete \n     electronic data.\n       For example, ED OIG auditors conducted an assist audit of \n     Guaranty Agency B for GAO. ED OIG auditors concluded that the \n     guaranty agency's computer system was less accurate than the \n     agency claimed it to be. When the auditors requested the \n     guaranty agency to provide the dollar amount of loans in \n     repayment, it initially computed the amount to be $2.4 \n     billion. Later, it revised the amount to $2.2 billion, and \n     finally to $2.3 billion. The auditors concluded that the \n     guaranty agency's revisions will impact future trigger \n     figures. At the time, approximately 40 percent of the loans \n     in question were serviced by the guaranty agency's affiliated \n     loan servicer.\n           affiliations may result in preferential treatment\n\n       FFELP service providers contract with guaranty agencies and \n     lenders to provide a myriad of services such as loan \n     origination, loan servicing, collections, litigation, and \n     other administrative functions. Often the service providers \n     are for-profit corporations that are subsidiaries or \n     affiliates of the guaranty agencies. The potential for abuse \n     exists in such arrangements.\n       Guaranty Agencies May Give Their Affiliates Unfair \n     Advantages. The guaranty agency is in the position to spin-\n     off specialized companies and then provide the new company \n     with a level of sales that increases its odds for success. \n     For instance, a guaranty agency could exert undue pressure on \n     its affiliated secondary market to use the services of its \n     new for-profit loan servicer.\n       Approximately 42 percent of Guaranty Agency C's $7.9 \n     billion portfolio is handled by its servicing arm. Similarly, \n     about 32 percent of Guaranty Agency A's $9.1 billion \n     portfolio is serviced by one of its affiliates. About 45 \n     percent of Guaranty Agency G's $4.1 billion portfolio is \n     serviced by its affiliated loan servicer.\n       In another example, the Treasurer of Guaranty Agency B \n     informed ED OIG auditors that it was successful in starting a \n     new for-profit subsidiary without the infusion of capital. \n     The guaranty agency was able to provide its new subsidiary \n     with immediate cash flows from rent resulting from a building \n     management agreement and from loan origination fees. \n     According to the treasurer, the guaranty agency also \n     permanently transferred some of its employees to the \n     subsidiary.\n       Later, the same guaranty agency's CPA firm asserted in its \n     working papers that the volume of transactions between the \n     agency and its newly formed subsidiary was ``excessive.'' The \n     working papers also noted that the IRS may view the condition \n     as undue favoritism towards a for-profit subsidiary. Such a \n     relationship makes it more difficult for unaffiliated FFELP \n     service providers to enter the market and compete.\n       Officers and Employees May Use Their Positions For Personal \n     Gain. The guaranty agency's officers and senior management \n     have direct control over how the guaranty agency delegates \n     certain functions to outside companies. They also must \n     determine the reasonableness of the fees charged by outside \n     contractors for their services. In the same way a guaranty \n     agency may exert pressure on an affiliate to use the services \n     of another affiliate, officers may use their positions to \n     exert pressure on the guaranty agency to use the services of \n     certain companies that benefit the officers' financial \n     positions.\n       For example, Guaranty Agency I joined forces with a \n     secondary market to establish a management company. The \n     guaranty agency and secondary market transferred all of their \n     employees to the management company, and entered into a \n     management services agreement with the new company. The \n     Chairman of the Board for the management company that \n     oversees the guaranty agency is also the President of the \n     secondary market. This same officer is also 100% owner of a \n     for-profit company that provided services to the guaranty \n     agency and the secondary market. The President's personal \n     corporation was paid over $150,000 by the guaranty agency and \n     over $750,000 by the secondary market during the fiscal year \n     ended September 30, 1991.\n       Although the President's corporation claims that it \n     provides its services to the guaranty agency and secondary \n     market at cost, it receives free rent in the building owned \n     by the guaranty agency's management company and is allowed to \n     bill unproductive time to the management company. With these \n     benefits, the President's company has been able to \n     successfully market its services in three other states.\n       Guaranty Agencies May Misuse Federal Funds. As long as \n     guaranty agencies are allowed to start and operate FFELP \n     service companies, there is a risk that Federal funds may be \n     used for purposes for which they were not intended. For \n     example, a guaranty agency that was not one of the twelve \n     included in our review improperly used $3.1 million of its \n     reserve fund to start and operate an affiliated, for-profit \n     loan servicing operation. An ED OIG audit report concluded \n     that the guaranty agency had misused the reserve fund and \n     recommended that it refund the $3.1 million to the reserve \n     fund.\n       Guaranty Agencies May Absorb the Costs of For-Profit \n     Affiliates. Guaranty agencies can also support affiliates by \n     paying some of their expenses. As previously noted, guaranty \n     agencies and their affiliates often share buildings, office \n     space, computer equipment, furniture, and even employees. \n     This allows the affiliates to incur owner expenses and to \n     increase profits.\n       For example, from 1989 to 1991, Guaranty Agency B paid \n     approximately $768,000 in software development cost incurred \n     by an affiliate that provided a specific service for the \n     guaranty agency. Its agreement with that affiliate states the \n     guaranty agency will continue to absorb the cost for the \n     computer hardware, software, maintenance and enhancements \n     incurred by its affiliate while performing this service. The \n     affiliate is a for-profit corporation which earned \n     approximately $1.4 million by providing this and other \n     services to the guaranty agency.\n         affiliations may weaken guaranty agencies financially\n\n       As guaranty agencies subcontract more activities to \n     affiliates, they could become shell corporations with fewer \n     financial assets. \n     [[Page S3817]] Such an occurrence has many negative \n     implications for guaranty agency reserves. Furthermore, ED \n     may find it more difficult to recover misspent funds from the \n     guaranty agencies if their revenue flows have been diverted \n     to affiliates. Fees and income designated for the guaranty \n     agencies assist them in continuing to carry out their mission \n     and increasing their reserves. When these income streams are \n     diverted to affiliates through subcontracting, the guaranty \n     agencies' reserves may be reduced and the agencies' overall \n     financial condition may be weakened.\n       For example, Guaranty Agency B delegated escrow account \n     services to an affiliate. Federal regulations (34 CFR \n     682.408) allow the guaranty agency to act as an escrow agent \n     for receiving FFELP proceeds and transmitting them to the \n     borrower. In return, the guaranty agency may invest the \n     proceeds of the loans and retain the interest that it earns \n     on the float. This interest assists the guaranty agency to \n     build up its reserves. The guaranty agency delegated the \n     escrow function to a for-profit affiliate and allowed the \n     affiliate to retain the interest on the float. The guaranty \n     agency paid over $400,000 of the costs incurred by its \n     affiliate for operating the escrow system, but allowed its \n     affiliate to retain over $1 million in interest earned on the \n     float.\n\n\n                 conflict of interest rules are common\n\n       Every organization needs to be confident that its employees \n     are acting in the organization's best interest. To achieve \n     this, many entities restrict their employees' activities in \n     order to prevent those employees from having a conflict of \n     interest.\n       In the Federal government, for example, Executive Order \n     11222 requires agencies to issue regulations governing \n     standards of conduct for their employees. ED has issued its \n     regulations under 34 CFR Part 73. Section 73.11(a)(1) states \n     that an employee may not:\n       ``Have a direct or indirect financial interest that \n     conflicts, or appears to conflict, substantially with the \n     employee's official duties and responsibilities * * *.''\n       Further, Section 73.20 prohibits an employee from accepting \n     gifts or favors from any person who conducts business or \n     financial operations that are regulated by the Department or \n     whose business or financial interests may be substantially \n     affected by the employee's official duties.\n       State and local governments have similar prohibitions. For \n     example, under California law:\n       ``No public official at any level of state or local \n     government shall make, participate in making or in any way \n     attempt to use his official position to influence a \n     governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know \n     he has a financial interest.''\n       Professional organizations such as the American Bar \n     Association, and the American Institute of Certified Public \n     Accountants (AICPA) have adopted rules prohibiting their \n     members from becoming entangled in business relationships \n     that result in, or give the appearance of, a conflict of \n     interest. Such rules are needed because much of their work \n     involves issues of public trust.\n       An example of these conflict of interest rules is found in \n     the AICPA's Code of Professional Conduct. That code requires \n     accountants to maintain personal and professional business \n     relationships that do not compromise their integrity and \n     objectivity (Rule of Conduct 102). The AICPA has concluded \n     that any member that holds a material financial interest in \n     the client that is being reviewed has violated the principle \n     of independence (Rule of Conduct 101).\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which relies \n     on the accountant's independence when reviewing certain \n     financial statements, has adopted related regulations that \n     state:\n       ``* * * an accountant will be considered not independent \n     with respect to any person or any of its parents, its \n     subsidiaries, or other affiliates (1) in which, during the \n     period of his professional engagement to examine the \n     financial statements, * * * his firm, or a member of his firm \n     had, or was committed to acquire, any direct financial \n     interest or any material indirect financial interest * * *.'' \n     (17 CFR 210.2-01(b))\n       The AICPA and the SEC have concluded that both the \n     accountant and the accounting firm lose the independence \n     necessary to render an objective opinion when the accountant \n     has a material financial interest, or actively participates \n     in the management of the client being reviewed.\n       Organizations that prohibit conflicts of interest do not \n     assume that their employees or members are dishonest. Rather, \n     they recognize that persons who are responsible for interests \n     of more than one party are often placed in untenable \n     situations. First, they have no clear guideline as to which \n     of the conflicting interests should have priority. Second, \n     even the appearance of a conflict of interest reduces public \n     confidence in their actions. In the case of governmental \n     employees or representatives, public confidence is essential.\n       ED relies on guaranty agencies to review the compliance \n     practices of other organizations that do business with ED. \n     The results of the guaranty agency reviews may significantly \n     impact taxpayer funds. If ED prohibits its employees from \n     having financial interests that create conflicts of interest, \n     or even the appearance of a conflict of interest, it should \n     place similar prohibitions on agencies that have \n     responsibility for ensuring appropriate actions in regard to \n     billions of dollars of Federally insured student loans.\n\n\n 1992 amendments allow ed to require reporting of individual conflicts \n                              of interest\n\n       ED is aware of the problems caused by the conflicts of \n     interest between guaranty agencies and their affiliates. In \n     fact, ED's recommendations for the Higher Education \n     Amendments of 1992 (HEA) included language that would \n     prohibit the officers and employees of guaranty agencies\n      from having a financial interest in organizations that the \n     agency is required to monitor. However, ED's \n     recommendations did not prevail. Instead, the final \n     version of the HEA only included a new reporting \n     requirement. The provision requires certain paid officials \n     of guaranty agencies, eligible lenders, and loan servicing \n     agencies to report to the Secretary, if the Secretary \n     should so require, any financial interest held in other \n     institutions that participate in the FFELP.\n       The new provision indicates Congress's interest in \n     identifying conflicts of interest, but it needs to be \n     strengthened.\n       First, the new reporting requirement significantly \n     increases the oversight responsibilities of the Department by \n     requiring it to monitor the financial holdings of hundreds of \n     officers and employees. ED officials informed us that the \n     Office of Postsecondary Education is not in a position to \n     handle the increased workload that the new provision requires \n     without increasing staffing levels. Consequently, the new \n     reporting requirement may not be implemented in the near \n     future.\n       Second, the new provision stops short of prohibiting \n     financial holdings that cause conflicts of interest.\n       Third, the new reporting requirement deals with only the \n     financial holdings of individual officers and employees. The \n     provision does not address the conflicts that arise when \n     guaranty agencies have a financial interest in the \n     institutions that they are required to monitor.\n       We believe that conflicts of interest could adversely \n     impact the administration of the FFELP, regardless of whether \n     the conflicts occur with individual officers and employees, \n     or with affiliated agencies. In our opinion, prohibiting all \n     affiliations, as described in the Recommendations section of \n     this report, provides the best method of eliminating the \n     potential conflicts of interest in the FFELP. It would also \n     reduce the oversight burden of the new reporting requirement.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The nation's guaranty agencies provide a critical oversight \n     function on behalf of the Federal government. They must \n     administer the FFELP objectively and efficiently. By \n     affiliating with FFELP loan servicers, secondary markets, and \n     other FFELP service providers, guaranty agencies often place \n     themselves in the position of choosing between the interests \n     of the taxpayers or their affiliates. The resulting conflicts \n     of interest place billions of dollars of the FFELP portfolio \n     at risk of mismanagement, waste, and abuse.\n       For many years professional organizations, Federal, state, \n     and local governments have utilized conflict of interest \n     rules to guard the public trust. ED prohibits its employees \n     from having financial interests that create conflicts of \n     interest, or even the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n      We believe that ED should place similar prohibitions on \n     guaranty agencies that are responsible for ensuring \n     appropriate actions in regard to billions of dollars of \n     Federally insured student loans.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       We recommend that the Department amend its regulations, or, \n     if necessary, seek legislative change to:\n       1. Prohibit guaranty agencies or their officers and \n     employees from having any affiliation with an entity that is \n     a participant or a service provider in the FFELP. \n     Participants in the FFELP include the guaranty agencies, \n     lenders, secondary markets, and eligible postsecondary \n     institutions. FFELP service providers include entities that \n     provide services that support the originating, servicing, and \n     collecting of Federally insured loans.\n       2. Develop timetables for the guaranty agencies and their \n     officers and employees to divest themselves of their current \n     holdings or to legally separate the guaranty agency from its \n     affiliates.\n\n\n                             Other Matters\n\n       This memorandum was prepared in accordance with those GAO \n     standards which the Inspector General has determined to be \n     applicable to Management Improvement Reports. The work \n     conducted on this issue does not constitute an audit.\n       We would appreciate your views and comments concerning our \n     recommendations within 30 days of the date of this report. If \n     you have any questions, or would like to discuss the report, \n     please call me.\n                                                    Sefton Boyars.\n                              Attachment B\n\n\n                      criteria for an affiliation\n\n       We contacted twelve guaranty agencies and requested that \n     they provide us with information about their relationships \n     with loan servicers, secondary markets, and other FFELP \n     service providers. Additionally, we contacted officials from \n     ED and GAO, and reviewed numerous reports prepared by ED and \n     independent CPA firms. Of the 12 agencies that we selected \n     for review, 9 were affiliated with FFELP firms that they are \n     required to \n     [[Page S3818]] monitor, and thus, have a potential conflict \n     of interest. For the purposes of this review, we defined an \n     affiliation as:\n       An organizational setting where, regardless of each firm's \n     legal structure, a loan servicer, secondary market, other \n     FFELP service provider, or any combination thereof, reported \n     to the same senior management staff or board of directors (or \n     its equivalent) as the guaranty agency.\n       An organizational setting where, regardless of each firm's \n     legal structure, a loan servicer, secondary market, other \n     FFELP service provider, or any combination thereof, shared at \n     least one of its senior management staff or board of \n     directors (or its equivalent) with the guaranty agency.\n       An instance where the guaranty agency, its parent, or \n     management company held an ownership interest in, or was a \n     member of (in the case of a nonprofit corporation), a loan \n     servicer, secondary market, or any other organization that \n     provided services to the FFELP.\n       An instance where an official of the guaranty agency, its \n     parent, or management company held an ownership interest in \n     any organization that provided services to the FFELP.\n       We recognize that some organizations that have a potential \n     conflict of interest manage to prevent the conflict from \n     harming the FFELP. However, our discussions with program \n     officials revealed that those organizations that successfully \n     manage the potential conflicts generally do so because of the \n     efforts of key managers and employees. Consequently, \n     replacing these key individuals with less conscientious \n     managers and employees may significantly increase the risk of \n     abuse.\n\n\n                 specific affiliations that we observed\n\n       The following paragraphs briefly discuss the organizational \n     environment that exists at each guaranty agency we reviewed. \n     Since the organizational structures are often very \n     complicated, we have limited our discussion to a general \n     overview. The guaranty agencies discussed in the following \n     paragraphs correspond to those listed in the schedule found \n     in Attachment A and the matrix shown above.\n                           guaranty agency a\n\n       This guaranty agency has a parent corporation that operates \n     the guaranty agency, a loan servicer, and a secondary market \n     as separate corporations under its umbrella. Each of the four \n     corporations has a separate board of directors. However, at \n     least one individual serves on all four boards, and several \n     individuals serve on three of the four boards. Additionally, \n     at least two individuals serve as officers in all four \n     corporations, and several individuals serve as officers in \n     three of the four corporations.\n       Until November, 1992, the secondary market activity was a \n     departmental function of the guaranty agency. In November \n     1992, the secondary market was incorporated as one of the \n     above mentioned companies. The guaranty agency plans to \n     transfer some of its employees to its newly formed secondary \n     market.\n       Approximately 84 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio, and 79 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     are guaranteed by their affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency b\n\n       This guaranty agency underwent sweeping organizational \n     changes in 1992. At the time of our review the changes were \n     not completely finalized. Generally, the end result will be a \n     management company which operates 1) a guaranty agency, 2) a \n     nonprofit FFELP service provider that provides supporting \n     services such as account management, litigation services, and \n     loan disbursement services to the guarantor, and 3) a for-\n     profit FFELP service provider that provides some of the same \n     supporting services to the guarantor as its nonprofit \n     counterpart. The new management company owns all of the stock \n     of the for-profit FFELP service provider, and the two \n     corporations share at least one board member.\n       The above corporations work very closely with three other \n     organizations that were previously founded by the guaranty \n     agency. These three firms are 1) a loan servicer, 2) a \n     secondary market, and 3) an educational resource firm. \n     Although the secondary market and the educational resource \n     firm were legally separated from the guaranty agency, they \n     continue to share common board members with the new \n     management company mentioned above. The management company \n     holds 25 percent of the stock of the loan servicer, and the \n     two corporations share board members.\n       Approximately 55 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio, and 69 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     are guaranteed by their affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency c\n\n       This guarantor, along with a loan servicer and secondary \n     market, is operated as a division of a larger agency. There \n     is no separate legal structure for the guarantor, loan \n     servicer, or secondary market. All three divisions report to \n     the same senior management and board of directors.\n      Approximately 71 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio, and 60 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     are guaranteed by their affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency d\n\n       This guaranty agency is operated by a state commission that \n     is appointed by the Governor. The State Commission, along \n     with its Executive Director, is responsible for operating the \n     guaranty agency and the secondary market. The State \n     Commission has only one board of commissioners to oversee the \n     guaranty agency and the secondary market.\n       Approximately 99 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency e\n\n       This guaranty agency is a component of a state authority \n     that manages all the Federal and state student loan programs. \n     A separate state authority operates the secondary market. \n     However, the management and board of the two authorities are \n     the same.\n       Approximately 100 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency f\n\n       This guaranty agency is housed together with a loan \n     servicer at the same state agency. There is only one board of \n     commissioners for the guaranty agency and the loan servicer, \n     and both are served by the same senior management staff.\n       Approximately 100 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           guaranty agency g\n\n       This guaranty agency is a division of a larger corporation. \n     The corporation has a guaranty agency division and a FFELP \n     servicing division. The guarantor and servicer are managed by \n     separate corporate vice presidents. The president of the \n     corporation also holds the offices of Chairman of the Board \n     of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, and Treasurer.\n       Approximately 100 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n                           Guaranty Agency H\n\n       This guaranty agency provides FFELP servicing to \n     participating lenders and secondary markets. The loan \n     servicer is part of a division of the guaranty agency that \n     reported to the Senior Vice President of Operations. The \n     guaranty agency claims that it began phasing-out its loan \n     servicing activities in the spring of 1989. However, it still \n     retains a significant servicing portfolio.\n       Approximately 95 percent of the loan servicer's portfolio \n     is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                           Guaranty Agency I\n\n       This guaranty agency has a parent company that is the sole \n     member (or shareholder) of both the guaranty agency and the \n     secondary market. In this case, all three organizations are \n     separate nonprofit corporations. The parent company is the \n     employer with respect to virtually all of the staff of the \n     guaranty agency and the secondary market, and provides the \n     staff to its subsidiaries under a management contract.\n       The three companies have separate boards. However, the two \n     presidents of the guaranty agency and the secondary market \n     also serve on the board of the parent company. In fact, the \n     Chairman of the Board of the parent company is also the \n     president of the secondary market. This same person is the \n     100% owner of a for-profit company that was paid \n     approximately $900,000 in 1991 to provide services to the \n     guaranty agency and the secondary market.\n       Approximately 52 percent of the secondary market's \n     portfolio is guaranteed by its affiliated guarantor.\n\n\n                      Guaranty Agencies J, K, & L\n\n       Our inquiries did not lead us to conclude that the above \n     guarantors were affiliated with a loan servicer, secondary \n     market, or other FFELP service provider.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3814-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE CHAMBER OF THE U.S. \n                                 SENATE\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, next week I will be introducing a bill with \nregard to striker replacement. This is the same bill that I have \nintroduced previously in this body.\n  I discussed this possible compromise that would maybe put an end, \nhopefully, to the ongoing battle we have had now for many years in the \nU.S. Senate. I discussed this with the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction, Senator Kassebaum, earlier today. I understand we will be \nhaving a cloture vote on this matter on Monday.\n  I would simply say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on \nboth sides of this issue that I think it is not good form, it is not \ngood business, and it upsets the routine schedule of the Senate when \nmatters of this nature, however important they are, and however timely \nthey might be, should never, ever have been placed on the supplemental \nappropriations bill with regard to national defense that is before the \nbody.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why the managers of the bill \nor those in opposition did not simply make a point of order that it was \nlegislation on an appropriations bill, which it clearly is. Had that \npoint of order been made, I would hope that the matter would have \nfallen.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that I have voted for and will continue to \nvote for some type of a striker replacement bill. What we have, of \ncourse, is the traditional battle: The old bulls of business on one \nside of the pasture, and the old bulls of organized labor on the other, \nglaring and pawing at the turf and snarling at each other across the \npasture.\n  All too often we do not take into consideration, I think, what is in \nthe interest of the United States of America as we go into the \ninternational arena, the international pasture today, and certainly \ninto the new century that is almost here. We see the quarrelsome \ngestures and the rhetoric about how fair or unfair this is to different \ngroups of Americans, depending how they are postured on this particular \nmatter.\n  Senator Domenici was on the floor earlier this week, and I spoke \nafter he spoke with regard to the fall of the dollar and what caused \nthat and how serious it is. I agreed with all of that.\n  I simply state once again that I think the matter of the fair \ntreatment of laboring people who are organized in the United States of \nAmerica is something that we should continue to address and not just \nsimply continue with actions on the floor of the U.S. Senate that I \nbelieve, for all meaningful purposes, are designed to end the rights of \norganized labor and the rights of collective bargaining.\n  Some will say that is an overly harsh statement, but I think that is \nthe reality of the situation. And I suppose that businesses today feel \nthat with the advent of the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate and \nthe House of Representatives that they could sit back, take a sigh of \nrelief and say it shall not pass with the revolution that took place \nlast November.\n  That might well be. They may have their facts straight. Is not what I \nthink should be a different and reasoned approach. Likewise, the \norganized labor should realize and recognize that the United States of \nAmerica is now very much tied up, more so than they have ever been \nbefore, with the economies of the whole world. The new century that is \nabout to come upon us, I suggest should best be recognized that we \nshould be looking over the horizon, if we will, aside from the facts \nthat we always have on measures of this nature.\n  The economy of the United States of America is tied more tightly to \nthe international community--the whole globe--than it ever has been \nbefore. Many people, including this Senator, had thought that would \nprobably be good for the United States of America. Maybe in the end it \nstill might be.\n  Suffice it to say that when we are tied to the international \ncommunity with trade agreements, trade treaties, NAFTAs, and GATT's, \nand all of these things, it is a small wonder that the dollar is not \nreacting well.\n  It is no small wonder, Mr. President, that there is nervousness in \nthe international economic and fiscal community today, with the \nproblems of the border with our neighbor to the south, just across the \nborder in Mexico, and certainly the Mexico bailout proposition--call it \nwhat you will. Whether it is necessary or whether it is not, whether it \nis good or whether it is bad simply proves the point that I am making, \nthat the United States of America is tied into the economic structure \nof the world more so than it ever has been before.\n  When we are doing these kinds of things, we should not be, therefore, \nparticularly surprised when we see different things happening in \ndifferent parts of the world and investors in different countries of \nthe world moving \n[[Page S3820]] money about, the super moneychangers of the world today \nfor safety reasons and to get the best return on their investment.\n  So I think we are going to be involved in a rather uncertain period \nand it might all work out well.\n  That is why I think it was not wise for the President of the United \nStates to take the action that he took by Executive order the other day \nwith regard to penalizing certain companies or corporations that do \nbusiness with the Federal Government with regard to replacement of \nworkers. I thought that was an untimely move by the President. I am not \na lawyer, but I suspect, in the end, the courts might decide he did not \nhave that authority.\n  But whether the President did or did not certainly has brought up the \nfirestorm that has taken over the Senate for the last few hours. The \nPresident did not consult with me before he took that action, nor is he \nrequired to do so, except to say I think we have enough to quarrel and \nworry about on the floor of the U.S. Senate today without getting a \nlabor matter involved in a supplemental appropriations bill. It should \nnever have come up on this measure. I wish that I had an opportunity to \nmake a point of order against this, and probably that, hopefully, would \nresolve it. In any event, it has brought the matter of striker \nreplacement up to this Senator once again, and I hope that is not going \nto be dealt with on an appropriations bill, especially the one before \nus now which needs to be moved.\n  Therefore, in the effort and sounding for compromise, once again, I \nam going to briefly talk about a bill that I will be introducing next \nweek that I have introduced before, which I think if big management and \nbig labor would take a look at and if both sides--both quarreling \nsides--in the U.S. Senate would take a look at it, they would see that \nthe compromise offered by the Senator from Nebraska, if enacted, might \nput to rest this contentious matter that keeps bubbling to the surface \nof the floor of the Senate and the floor of the House with regard to \nstriker replacements.\n  I would like to say, Mr. President, that it is very clear to me after \nlooking at the situation in my great State of Nebraska today, we have \nan extremely low unemployment rate, one of the lowest in the Nation. I \nthink the last unemployment rate in Nebraska was 2.3 percent. That does \nnot mean that the people of Nebraska are being overpaid.\n  The facts of the matter are, we have a great number of college \ngraduates today who are not able to find work in their desired type of \nemployment, not able to find work that complements the degrees and \nstudies that they receive from our various high-quality institutions of \nhigher learning. That is another way to say that I think probably the \nmain problem in Nebraska today, with our economy that otherwise is \nreasonably healthy, is that we have a great number of underemployed \npeople in the State of Nebraska, many of them doing things that they \nare not trained for or ever sought to do in their early lives and \nduring their educational experience.\n  Part of this has to do with the fact that there is great instability \ntoday of employment. The record is replete with big businesses, for \nwhatever reason and probably some of them are justified, laying people \noff when they get to be 50 or 55 years of age, just about the time that \nthey were set for life.\n  And at 50 and 55 years of age, they are not particularly attractive \nto many businesses for the jobs that at least pay something akin to the \nsalary that they have been used to in their adult lives up to this \nperiod of time.\n  So I happen to feel that if we are going to be competitive in the \nworld internationally in the next century, we had best set about some \nprocedures that can solve the problems that we have in America today, \nthe problems that labor sees, the problems that management sees and try \nto get these two sides together.\n  The bill that I am introducing is a compromise that I have alluded \nto. It is not a complicated piece of legislation at all. It simply says \nthat under the Federal law, if it were adopted--and it would have to be \na compromise; and this compromise is not accepted by big labor, they do \nnot like it; it certainly is not accepted by big business, they do not \nlike it--but it simply says as a compromise in trying to put an end to \nthis, that for the first 60 days of a strike in an organized plant, the \nmanagement of that company would not be allowed to hire permanent \nreplacements. They could hire temporary people, but for the first 60 \ndays of any legal strike that was called by an organized client under \nour collective bargaining laws today, management could not rush in and \nsend the clear signal that if the people who had the right to strike do \nnot show up, their job is going to be taken on a permanent basis by the \nfirst person that walks in the door or makes an application.\n  For the life of me, I have never been able to understand those who \nsay they believe in collective bargaining and then turn right around \nand say, ``but if the unionized plant goes on strike, management has \nthe option at their discretion to say, `OK, we'll hire somebody else to \ntake your place.'''\n  Any reasonable person that believes in collective bargaining would \nhave to agree that if organized labor does not have the right to \nstrike, and organized labor does not use that promiscuously, but if \nthey do not have the ultimate right to strike, the collective \nbargaining that they go through from time to time is heavily stacked \nagainst them because all of the chips for bargaining are on \nmanagement's side of the table.\n  Now, on the other hand, let me take the devil's advocate position, if \nI might, for a moment with regard to unions and union membership and \nunion leadership. I also feel that union labor and union leaders must \nalso recognize that we are in a new era. I do not believe that we \nshould simply pass legislation that permanently prevents management \nfrom ever hiring a replacement worker under any circumstances.\n  If you accept that point of view fully that organized labor pushes, \nwhich I do not agree with, that will simply mean that if organized \nlabor never will agree to a contract, somewhat along the lines we are \nseeing in the baseball impasse today, then organized labor would be \nable to close down and eliminate a factory forever.\n I do not think they should have that power either.\n\n  Mr. President, the compromise that I am offering, that I emphasize is \ndetested by management and it is detested by the leadership of \norganized labor, would simply reach a compromise by saying for the \nfirst 60 days of an organized strike management would be prevented from \nhiring permanent replacement workers. Again, I emphasize they could \nhire temporary workers but not permanent replacement workers. The first \n60 days they could not do that. At the end of 60 days, the compromise \nwould kick in, and for the first 30-days after 60 days management would \nbe allowed to hire 10 percent of their work force as permanent \nreplacements.\n  It goes up from there to 20 percent in 90 days, 30 percent in 120 \ndays, and it goes on up to the end of 1 year, 360 days. If no \nsettlement has been reached, then in that event and that event only \nwould management be permitted to have total replacement of all the \nworkers that went on strike.\n  Putting it another way, this is simply a phased program to try to \nsatisfy what supposedly is the beliefs of both big labor and big \nmanagement without taking a look at what is good for the overall \neconomy of the United States of America and the competition that I \nsuggest we are likely to have from around the globe with the turn of \nthe century, as exhibited by the difficulties that we are having right \nnow with regard to fiscal and monetary policy and the fall of the \ndollar and all the problems that could and probably will cause in the \nUnited States by further increasing interest rates. And some have \nalluded to the fact that, indeed, that could push us into a recession \nthat no one had previously contemplated.\n  So I am saying, Mr. President, the votes I will be casting on this \nwhole matter of striker replacement are in an effort to get myself into \na position to hopefully bring along the Senate to stop shouting at each \nother, to quit listening to the dictates of big labor only and big \nmanagement only and do what I think is right for America. And I have to \nthink the Exon proposal should satisfy well meaning and well-\nintentioned individuals on both sides of this very contentious problem \nand maybe get on to lay this matter to rest and have \n[[Page S3821]] labor peace and management peace in the years \nimmediately ahead when I think the United States of America is very \nlikely to set its course as to whether or not we are going to be as \nsuccessful in the new century as we were in the last.\n  Mr. President, I am simply appealing for reason. I am only making \nthese comments so I can explain to my colleagues the position that this \nSenator has on this matter, and I will be introducing the bill that I \nhave briefly described next week so that all can look at it. I was very \npleased to hear Senator Kassebaum, the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction, since she did not know about this piece of legislation. I \ndo not think anybody else does either, because nobody will pay any \nattention to a compromise, although I have introduced this piece of \nlegislation before and talked to some Senators about it--maybe, just \nmaybe, Mr. President, something like this might be the bounds to stop \nthe inflammatory rhetoric that is going on now, that is holding up the \npassage of the defense supplemental, which needs to be enacted into \nlaw. And we all agree on that. Yet we get off on what I think are these \nnonsensical maneuvers and rules to force some people's will on what \nshould be done at a very inappropriate time.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/10/senate-section/article/S3819-5", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL 12:30 P.M.
