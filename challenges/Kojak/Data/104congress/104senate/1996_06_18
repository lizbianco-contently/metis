Free us to \nlaugh at ourselves when we do the wrong thing at the right time or the \nright thing at an inappropriate time. Sometimes we say things that make \nus cringe when we review the day. When we take ourselves too seriously \nwe tighten up and become tense. Little issues become so crucial we miss \nthe big issues confronting us. We worry about what others think of us.\n  Relieve us of our assumed importance and help us realize they seldom \ndo think of us. Forgive us for all the good energy we waste on checking \nour own popularity pulse. Make us so secure in Your love that we can \nlighten up, and then, listen up to what You want us to be and do about \nwhat really matters. Make us carefree, but never careless. In the name \nof Jesus who taught us that by worrying we could not add one cubit to \nour stature, but by seeking first Your kingdom all things that are \ntruly important would be ours as well. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6313-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We are very close to a \nbipartisan resolution on this matter.

Mr. President, I want to say, before I yield the floor, \nthat I am very pleased that we are ready to go now with the Department \nof Defense authorization bill. The committee has been ready to go for \nabout 3 weeks. There have been some problems that are being ironed out \nwith other committees. I know that in the years I have been on the \nArmed Services Committee this has been the most cooperative atmosphere \nwe have had in the committee.\n  I think we have a good bill. I know there are going to be some very \nserious amendments offered and debated. We will have plenty of \nopportunity to express our concerns and to change the bill in ways that \nMembers feel strongly about.\n  I commend, again, the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond \nfrom South Carolina, for the leadership he has shown on this bill. He \nsaid that we were not going to wait way into the summer and get tangled \nup into the appropriations process. We are going to have the \nauthorization bill ready. He did that. The bill was ready by the \nMemorial Day recess. I appreciate him and have enjoyed so much working \nwith him. I know he is raring to go, so, Mr. Chairman, it is yours.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6313-6", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6313-S6383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

and\n       (B) the commencement of an early deferred annuity in \n     accordance with this section before the attainment of 62 \n     years of age by the transferred employee.\n       (2) The estimated increase in the unfunded liability for \n     each department referred to in paragraph (1), shall be \n     determined by the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING RELIABILITY AND SAFETY \n                   OF REMAINING NUCLEAR FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust science-based stockpile stewardship program with \n     respect to production of nuclear weapons, and to maintaining \n     nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities, that \n     are adequate--\n       (A) to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of \n     the United States nuclear arsenal; and\n       (B) to meet such changing national security requirements as \n     may result from international developments or technical \n     problems with nuclear warheads.\n       (2) The United States is committed to reestablishing and \n     maintaining production of nuclear weapons at levels that are \n     sufficient--\n       (A) to satisfy requirements for the safety, reliability, \n     and performance of United States nuclear weapons; and\n       (B) to demonstrate and sustain production capabilities and \n     capacities.\n       (3) The United States is committed to maintaining the \n     nuclear weapons laboratories and protecting core nuclear \n     weapons competencies.\n       (4) The United States is committed to ensuring the rapid \n     access to a new production source of tritium within the next \n     decade, as it currently has no meaningful capability to \n     produce tritium, a component that is essential to the \n     performance of modern nuclear weapons.\n       (5) The United States reserves the right, consistent with \n     United States law, to resume underground nuclear testing to \n     maintain confidence in the United States' stockpile of \n     nuclear weapons if warhead design flaws or aging of nuclear \n     weapons result in problems that a robust stockpile \n     stewardship program cannot solve.\n       (6) The United States is committed to funding the Nevada \n     Test Site at a level that maintains the ability of the United \n     States to resume underground nuclear testing within one year \n     after a national decision to do so is made.\n       (7) The United States reserves the right to invoke the \n     supreme national interest of the United States and withdraw \n     from any future arms control agreement to limit underground \n     nuclear testing.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate Regarding Presidential Consultation \n     With Congress.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should consult closely with Congress regarding \n     United States policy and practices to ensure confidence in \n     the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile of the \n     United States.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate Regarding Notification and \n     Consultation.--It is the sense of the Senate that, upon a \n     determination by the President that a problem with the safety \n     or reliability of the nuclear stockpile has occurred and that \n     the problem cannot be corrected within the stockpile \n     stewardship program, the President shall--\n       (1) immediately notify Congress of the problem; and\n       (2) submit to Congress in a timely manner a plan for \n     corrective action with respect to the problem, including--\n       (A) a technical description of the activities required \n     under the plan; and\n       (B) if underground testing of nuclear weapons would assist \n     in such corrective action, an assessment of advisability of \n     withdrawing from any treaty that prohibits underground \n     testing of nuclear weapons.\n          TITLE XXXII--DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD\n\n     SEC. 3201.

The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration \nof S. 1745, the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year \n1997. In crafting this important legislation, the Committee on Armed \nServices placed the national security interests of the United States \nand the strength of our Armed Forces above other considerations. The \nnational defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1997 reflects the \ncommittee's bipartisan approach to these overarching priorities, and \nprovides a clear basis and direction for U.S. national security \npolicies and programs into the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished ranking member \nof the Committee on Armed Services, Senator Nunn, for his outstanding \nleadership and cooperation in the formulation of this bill. It has been \na singular privilege and honor for me to work with Senator Nunn over \nmany years on the Armed Services Committee. I very much regret that \nthis will be his last defense authorization bill, and hope that this \nbill will serve as a clear legacy to Senator Nunn's enduring \ncontributions to the U.S. Armed Forces and this Nation's security.\n  I would also like to recognize the distinguished contributions to \nnational security of Senator Cohen and Senator Exon. This bill is also \nthe last defense authorization bill for these two outstanding Senators, \nand I would like to thank them for their dedication to and support of \nour Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, the following priorities were our roadmap in \nformulating this authorization bill:\n  Ensuring national security and the status of the United States as the \nworld's preeminent military power; protecting the readiness of our \nArmed Forces; enhancing the quality of life of military personnel and \ntheir families; ensuring U.S. military superiority by continuing to \nfund a more robust, progressive modernization program to provide \nrequired capabilities for the future; accelerating the development and \ndeployment of missile defense systems; and preserving the shipbuilding \nand submarine industrial base.\n  I am satisfied that this bill does a good job in fulfilling these \npriorities. Let me mention some of its highlights:\n  The bill gives our service personnel a well-deserved 3-percent pay \nraise and 4-percent raise in quarters allowance, effective January 1, \n1997.\n  It authorizes the award of the Congressional Medal of Honor to seven \nAfrican-Americans who served during World War II.\n  The bill contains provisions to enhance our ability to protect our \nmilitary forces from ballistic missile attacks.\n  It adds essential funding for the modernization of our Armed Forces, \nincluding: $40 million for the Marine Corps to develop revolutionary \noperational concepts and technologies through a warfighting laboratory \nknown as Sea Dragon; a funding program for the Army's Force 21 \ninitiatives to expedite the acquisition and evaluation of new equipment \nand associated technology for the future force; and $997 million for \nadvance procurement and construction of the next two nuclear attack \nsubmarines.\n\n  The bill also adds $1.2 billion to increase the readiness funding for \notherwise unfunded priorities of the service chiefs, and it adds $150 \nmillion in funding for the Department of Defense's activities to combat \nthe flow of illegal drugs into the United States.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say that the national defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1997 is a major step in the road to \nrecovery for our Armed Forces. It is not. However, this bill does a \nmuch better job than the President's budget request in funding our \nArmed Forces. By offsetting the President's requested decreases in \ncertain key programs, this bill enhances our national security, while \nstill authorizing $7.4 billion less in real defense spending than last \nyear's bill.\n  The main shortcoming in the President's budget request is its wholly \ninadequate funding for procurement. Our service chiefs, whose primary \nresponsibility is to ensure that our forces are prepared and equipped \nto defeat any adversary, have repeatedly warned about increasing risks \ndue to the low level of procurement. Our combatant commanders, who rely \non adequately prepared and equipped forces to conduct military \noperations, have said the same. Further, General Shalikashvili, who as \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs is specifically directed to serve ``as the \nspokesman for the combatant commanders, especially on the operational \nrequirements of their commands,'' has this to say about procurement: \n``We must commit ourselves to a sufficient procurement goal, a goal I \njudge to be approximately $60 billion annually.'' Yet, despite the \nadvice of his principal military adviser, the President requested only \n$39 billion for procurement. The Committee on Armed Services added $7.7 \nbillion to this requested amount for procurement. To do any less would \nbe to ignore the very advice we have charged our military leaders to \nprovide.\n  As for the administration's repeated promises to compensate by \nincreasing procurement in future years, the testimony of Admiral Owens, \nthen-Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, is \nrevealing:\n\n       [The administration said that in 1994] procurement would be \n     at 64 billion. Of course, what really happened was that it \n     went to 48 billion . . . and in 1995, [the administration] \n     said [procurement] was going to 55 billion. But, in fact, \n     what really happened was 46 billion. [The administration] \n     promised [again] it would go up. [But] in 1996, we're . . . \n     down to 39 billion and [the administration is] promising . . \n     . it will go up.\n\n  As the saying goes, You don't learn much from the second kick of a \nmule. Or maybe I should say ``donkey.'' This administration's record is \nso bad, the Congress simply has no reason to believe that if we lower \ndefense spending, the President will make up for it in future years.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues may feel that this is a time \nwhen we can afford to cut defense spending. In fact, history teaches us \nthe opposite. We have always enjoyed a period of relative calm before \nthe winds of war. With the lethal technologies, emergence of fanatical \nmovements, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that exist \ntoday, we do not have the luxury of investing in our military after the \nfact. We must remain ready and fully capable, both to deter and defeat. \nAlthough we cannot--and should not--commit to every conflict where we \nmight have an interest, we must be able to dominate those where we \nclearly do have vital national security interests. Imagine what this \nworld would be like without United States involvement and leadership in \nWorld Wars I and II, the Korean war, and the Persian Gulf war. Without \na strong military, our identity as Americans would be a shadow of what \nit is today.\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\n  Then, there are those who think that our military capabilities should \ndepend solely on the threat. Their familiar refrain is: Where is the \nthreat? What threat? That is exactly the point. What they see now is \nthe result of a commitment to a strong defense in the past. When they \ndo see a threat, it will be because of a lack of commitment to \nadequately fund our military today. As General Reimer, Army Chief of \nStaff, aptly says, ``History shows that those who wish to threaten us \nwill do so at our weakest point * * *. They will seek to exploit a \nperceived lack of U.S. commitment.''\n  Mr. President, our Armed Forces continue to suffer from a decline in \nsize and spending levels. Fiscal year 1997 will witness the 12th \nstraight decrease in defense funding, which has declined 41 percent \nsince 1985. Some of my colleagues may not know what happened the last \ntime our defense budget was this low. Let me tell them. Repeated budget \ncuts in the late 1940's, and their deleterious effects on our Armed \nForces, served as a virtual invitation for aggression in Korea. By the \ntime we saw this threat, it was too late. As described by former Army \nChief of Staff, Gen. Creighton Abrams:\n\n       We paid dearly for unpreparedness during those early days \n     in Korea with our most precious currency--the lives of our \n     young men. The monuments we raise to their heroism and \n     sacrifice are really monuments we owe to ourselves for our \n     blindness to reality, for our indifference to real threats to \n     our security, and . . . for our wishful thinking about how \n     war would not come.\n\n  In Korea, we suffered nearly 50,000 American dead and had to settle \nfor an embarrassing stalemate. Indeed, that war has yet to officially \nend, and we are still living with its consequences.\n  Some saw Korea as a military embarrassment. But it was, in fact, a \npolitical embarrassment. Our lack of military readiness was a result of \nour lack of political commitment. I fear we may be laying the seeds for \nanother Korea. Are we willing to suffer another such war?\n  Mr. President, this bill is a sound bill. It provides a foundation to \nbuild on to prepare our Nation's Armed Forces to meet the challenges of \nthe 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join the members of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, who voted this bill out of committee 20 to \n0, and pass this bill with a strong bipartisan vote. Of special note, \nthe committee vote reflects a consensus that the issue of national \nmissile defense policy should be dealt with only in connection with S. \n1635, the Defend America Act. Accordingly, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to refrain from offering amendments relating to national \nmissile defense policy to the defense authorization bill. If Members on \neither side of the aisle wish to debate national missile defense \npolicy, I suggest we proceed to consideration of S. 1635 as soon as \npossible following passage of the defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that any \namendments to the defense authorization bill that would increase \nauthorizations for defense spending should be accompanied by offsetting \nreductions. Finally, Mr. President, because the Armed Services \nCommittee marked up this bill before the approval of this year's budget \nresolution, we marked to the defense allocation for fiscal year 1997 \ncontained in last year's budget resolution. I want to assure the Senate \nthat the amount authorized for defense will conform to the funding \nlevel designated in this year's budget resolution when we complete the \nconference on this bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jerry Reed, a \ncongressional fellow in my office, have the privilege of the floor \nduring the consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Senator Nunn is expected to be here \nmomentarily to make his opening statement. I expect that other Members \nwill follow thereafter. We want to get as many statements completed \nduring these initial hours as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nsenior Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas if in morning business for the purpose of introducing a bill and \nmaking a statement thereon that will not exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I thank the managers of the pending \nmeasure.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the introduction of S. 1881 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia has the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as we begin debate on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1997, I first express my deep \nappreciation to Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, for \nthe bipartisan process under his leadership that was followed in \nmarking up this legislation.\n  I also thank Senator Thurmond for the very gracious remarks he made \nabout me. This is my last Defense authorization bill that I will be \nhelping to manage on the floor, and I deeply appreciate his remarks \nbut, most of all, his friendship and his leadership and his stalwart \nsupport of national security for the entire time I have been in the \nU.S. Senate and really for many years before.\n  I express my appreciation to Les Brownlee, the majority staff \ndirector, and the other members of the majority staff, for their hard \nwork and cooperation during markup.\n  Of course, I add my deep appreciation, on a continuing basis, to \nArnold Punaro, minority staff director, as well as all members of the \nminority staff working with Mr. Punaro.\n  The Armed Services Committee has a long tradition of members working \nacross the aisle in the interest of national defense, and that was \nfully reflected in the process that was used to develop the bill now \nbefore us. So, Mr. President, I say to Senator Thurmond, I am very \ngrateful to him and to his staff.\n  We have had and will continue to have issues on which there are sharp \ndifferences of opinion between Senators on that side of the aisle and \nthis side of the aisle, and between Senators on both sides of the aisle \namong themselves. It is not simply a breakdown of Democrats versus \nRepublicans. There are a lot of individual views on defense, and that \nis how it should be on a defense bill, as important as it is, as much \nmoney is involved and as much is at stake, which is, indeed, the stake \nof our national security and our freedom.\n  Those differences, however, should not obscure the fact there is a \nbroad consensus in favor of the key features of this bill. Mr. \nPresident, there is strong support for provisions in the bill that \nenhance the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies, including a 3-percent pay raise, a 4-percent increase in \nbasic allowance quarters, revised allowances for single personnel and \nfor couples in which both spouses are members of the Armed Forces, and \nincreased funding for military construction pertaining to family \nhousing, unaccompanied personnel housing, dining facilities and, most \nimportant, child development centers.\n  The bill also continues many of the committee's key initiatives over \nthe last decade, including modernization of weapons systems and support \nfor programs essential to the readiness of our military forces.\n  Mr. President, there will certainly be a lot of controversy about the \nfunding level in this bill, and I am sure we will have amendments to \ntry to reduce the funding level of the bill. Let me state, I believe \nthe overall funding level of\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\n$267.4 billion represents a prudent increase by the committee to the \nadministration's budget request. It is slightly higher than the $265.6 \nbillion that is contained in the conference report on the budget \nresolution because that budget resolution contains later information \nrelated to inflation. These differences will not require any major \nreadjustment of the committee's priority, but we will need to reduce \neither on the floor or in conference this bill from $267.4 to $265.6 \nbillion, which is our guideline given to us by the budget resolution \npassed by both the House and the Senate.\n\n  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the funding question will \nrecognize that even with this plus-up of the Clinton administration's \nbudget, this bill still represents a real decrease in spending from \nlast year. So I am sure, as usual, all the reports and headlines will \nread that this is a vast increase in defense. That is not accurate. \nThis is not an increase in defense. This $265.6 billion in the budget \nresolution, compared to last year, is a reduction in real dollar terms \nfrom last year's funding level, but it is an increase over the \nPresident's recommended level by about $11 billion.\n  Mr. President, some of the provisions of the bill are likely to be \nthe subject of vigorous debate. Although we have avoided, thus far, \nmany of the provisions that make the House-passed bill unacceptable to \nthe administration, there are a number of issues that remain \ntroublesome.\n  I think it is important for everyone to bear in mind it is clear the \nHouse bill and a number of its provisions are unacceptable to the \nadministration, and I hope we can avoid that here. It is clear that we \ndo have some issues that already are unacceptable in this bill to the \nadministration. For example, the language relating to the demarcation \nline between theater and national missile defense, which is in our \nbill, is not at this time acceptable to the administration, and the \nlanguage concerning multilateralization, or adding new parties to the \nABM Treaty. Both of these provisions, it is my hope, can be worked in a \nway that will avoid a veto by the President of this bill, but that \nremains a very serious challenge.\n  We will also consider a number of amendments that are likely to draw \nbroad bipartisan support, in terms of enhancing our national security. \nAs I noted in my remarks on the floor on May 30, I have been working \nvery diligently with Senator Lugar and Senator Domenici, and others, to \naddress our Nation's lack of preparedness to cope with threats from the \nfull range of weapons of mass destruction, including biological and \nchemical weapons.\n  We will have an amendment on this bill by Senator Lugar, Senator \nDomenici, and myself that will strengthen the ability of the Department \nof Defense and the Department of Energy to assist local fire \ndepartments and police departments, local law enforcement, in terms of \nhelping prepare them and equip them to deal with a possible chemical or \nbiological attack by terrorists.\n  Mr. President, the nuclear component of that, the so-called NEST \ncapability, already exists in the Department of Energy. We do not have \nanything comparable on the chemical or biological side. It is my \njudgment, after having numerous hearings on this subject, after having \nconsiderable indepth hearings and a long preliminary investigation of \nthe Aum Shinrikyo and the religious cult attack in Tokyo over a year \nago that killed 12 people but injured 5,000. If that attack had been \nbetter prepared in terms of delivery system for the sarin gas, there \nwould literally have been tens of thousands of people killed. That was \na religious cult that existed and had over $1 billion in assets, \nalthough more members are in Russia than Japan. They had tested sarin \ngas in Australia and even embarked on preliminary stages of trying to \ndevelop biological weapons. They had a very serious chemical stockpile \nand had already, previous to the Tokyo attack, carried out other \nsmaller chemical attacks in Tokyo.\n\n  Not many of us would have predicted Japan would have been the first \nplace that would have happened, but it is predictable that effort is \ngoing to be made in the United States, by either foreign or domestic \nterrorists.\n  We had the World Trade Center attack. We have seen the devastation of \nthat explosion. What many people do not realize, and what the judge \nnoted in his findings, is that attack on the World Trade Center also \nincluded a chemical weapon that was consumed by the flames and, \ntherefore, did not activate and did not cause damage. The damage was \ndone by the conventional-type weapons.\n  So we have already, according to the judge, had a chemical attempt in \nthis country. So it is almost predictable, with very little doubt, that \nwe are going to have chemical and biological efforts made against soft \ntargets in this country, including our cities, including our population \ncenters, over the next 5 to 10 years.\n  We can either begin to get in front of it and deal with it in \nadvance, try to prevent it from happening, or we can wait until it \nhappens and then have everybody say, ``Why didn't we do something about \nit?''\n  Mr. President, we are going to try to do something about it on this \nbill. We are going to have an amendment that would have the Department \nof Defense and the Department of Energy, in a very carefully prescribed \nway--we are not getting DOD and DOE involved in enforcing the law at a \ndomestic level. We are not talking about that. We are talking about \nhaving them help prepare, in terms of training, in terms of equipment, \nour local police, and fire officials around this country to deal with \nwhat almost all experts on terrorism believe is an inevitable kind of \nthreat we face to our own country.\n  We have seen the work of domestic terrorists in Oklahoma City and the \nterrible, terrible destruction that was caused in terms of human \nsuffering in Oklahoma City and to the Murrah Building there. We have \nseen the attack in Tokyo. We have seen the World Trade Center attack. \nFortunately, the chemical part of that attack did not activate. There \nwas enough destruction without it, but it would have been truly of a \nworse magnitude had the chemical component really done its job.\n  Mr. President, we have also seen in Russia the Chechen or some group \nrepresenting the Chechen rebels put a radiological weapon in a very \nprominent place near Moscow, a radiological weapon being using the \nradiation from nuclear materials without causing an explosion but \ncausing huge destruction. That was not an effort to actually use the \nweapon but a warning that it could be done.\n  So we are in a different kind of world now. We have moved from an era \nof very high risk of nuclear war to an era of much lower risk of \nnuclear war. But we have moved from an era of high stability because of \nthat very risk of nuclear war and because the two superpowers knew \nthat, if their clients got into a war or if there was some event that \ncame that got out of control, the whole escalation could take place and \nwe could have a nuclear war.\n  Because of that, we had high stability, high risk but high stability, \nduring the cold war. We moved to much lower risk in terms of a nuclear \nwar. We can all be very thankful for that because of the change in \nclimate, because of the arms control agreements, because of the \nsubstantial number of nuclear weapons in the Soviet Union. All of that \ngreatly reduces the risk of nuclear war.\n  But the decline of the Soviet Empire has also ushered in a new era of \nlower stability, meaning that there are countries all over the world \nthat are having ethnic, religious conflict. We no longer have the two \nsuperpowers who are basically policing the world so that we do not have \nconflict between two superpowers.\n  We are in another era. We are in an era of organized crime not only \nin Russia but in many other places. We are in an era where we have had \nthe first empire in history disintegrate but still containing 30,000 or \nso nuclear weapons, over 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, and no one \neven knows how much in the way of biological weapons, and also \nscientists all over the former Soviet Union, not just in Russia, who \nknow how to make these weapons of mass destruction, who know how to \nmake ballistic missiles, but in many cases do not know how they are \ngoing to feed their families, and rogue nations all over the world \ntrying to develop these kinds of capabilities, as we have seen in the \npast in Iraq and other places.\n\n  The combination of organized crime, terrorism, empire disintegration, \ntons\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nof material and know-how in terms of weapons of mass destruction, all \nof that combined means that we are in a different era. What we have to \nmake sure of, in terms of our overall debate in both the ballistic \nmissile defense area, as well as this Nunn-Lugar-Domenici No. 2 effort, \nas we can call it, we have to make sure that we are not so obsessed \nwith the past that we cannot think of the future.\n  The future kind of threats we are going to face are going to be \ndifferent. We are going to have to be more agile, as David Abshire, \npresident of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said \nin a recent article he wrote. We are going to have to be more agile, \nmore flexible. We are going to have to understand the threats that face \nus in the future. And we are going to have to understand that the \nDepartment of Defense mission is still to protect the national security \nof this country. Included in that mission, I think at this stage, is a \nvery critical need to help our police officials and our fire officials \nbe able to deal with the kind of threat that they may face in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on this subject. I know that \nSenator Lugar and Senator Domenici will have more to say. But I did \nwant to let people on both sides of the aisle know that sometime in the \nnext few days while we are considering this bill there will be that \nkind of an amendment.\n  Mr. President, it will be aimed primarily on the domestic side. It \nwill be very carefully framed so that there will be no doubt that we \nare not getting DOD and DOE involved in the actual enforcement of the \nlaw. That is not the effort here. It is to equip and train and prepare \nour law enforcement officials to deal with these kinds of threats. \nThere will be a part 2 of this that will deal with a growing need to \nbeef up our Customs Service to make sure that they can do their part \nand do it well in preventing those kinds of materials from ever getting \ninto this country, and also to help them be more effective in preparing \nthe customs services of other nations, particularly the former Soviet \nUnion, in preventing materials from getting out of those countries--a \ngrowing threat.\n  So, Mr. President, there really are three parts of this overall Nunn-\nLugar effort. Part one is already underway and has been for about 4 or \n5 years. That is, in my mind, still the most crucial need because the \nwindow is open for cooperation with these former Soviet states, \nincluding but not limited to Russia. We are helping to do that. The \nlast missile was just taken out of the Ukraine. The last nuclear \nwarhead was taken out of the Ukraine the other day. So this is a \nremarkable success.\n  Two years ago it appeared we were going to have four new nuclear \nstates coming out of the one old one, the Soviet Union. It appeared we \nwere going to have a nuclear component, very strong nuclear component, \nnot only in Russia, but in the Ukraine, also in Kazakhstan and also in \nBelarus. I know all nuclear warheads have been taken out of Kazakhstan, \nall nuclear warheads have been taken out of Ukraine, and the last \nweapons, I am told, will be taken out of Belarus this year. The \nmissiles will be destroyed. The Nunn-Lugar program has helped \nfacilitate that. Secretary of Defense Perry told us this morning at the \narmed services breakfast, without that program we could not have done \nwhat has been done. There is a long way to go. There is a lot left to \ndo.\n\n  The most prominent feature of this program has been stopping these \nweapons at the source, preventing them from leaking all over the world. \nIt is going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars--if we have \nnuclear materials and chemical and biological materials and missile \ntechnology know-how disbursed all over the world, it is going to cost \nus hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars to defend against it. \nEven then it will be extremely difficult to defend against.\n  The first priority is to stop it at the source, to help these \ncountries--not only Russia, but Ukraine and Kazakhstan and Belarus and \nothers--get control of their own borders, to help them understand the \npriority of controlling nuclear materials and chemical materials and \nbiological materials and know-how; second, to make sure that they have \nstrong and effective border control and, where they want our help, to \nhelp them in that regard; third, to beef up our borders here in this \ncountry, to beef up our border protection; and, fourth, to be able to \ndeal with this kind of catastrophe if it ever occurs. First to deter \nit, prevent it domestically, but to be able to deal with it, not only \nwith police departments and fire departments, but also with health \ndepartments.\n  In the Aum Shinrikyo attack in Tokyo, the Japanese police were \ncertainly not prepared. There is no doubt about that. But the health \nofficials, under the circumstances, did a pretty good job. There is \nstrong indication that the Japanese were better prepared to deal with \nthe health aspects of this kind of chemical attack than we are in this \ncountry. In fact, one of the key agencies in HHS to deal with this, one \nof the few agencies, very, very thinly staffed, has had almost all of \nits funding cut in the House. I hope that can be corrected because I am \nsure that the people who made those cuts did not realize the context in \nwhich that agency would have to work. So we are going to be talking \nabout all those issues.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following named 14 \nminority staff members on the Committee on Armed Services and two \ncongressional fellows be granted the privilege of the floor during the \nconsideration of and votes relating to S. 1745, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  Minority staff members: Christine E. Cowart, Richard D. DeBobes, \nAndrew S. Effron, Andrew B. Fulford, Daniel B. Ginsberg, Mickie Jan \nGordon, Creighton Greene, Patrick T. Henry, William E. Hoehn, Jr., \nJennifer A. Lambert, Michael J. McCord, Frank Norton, Jr., Arnold L. \nPunaro, Julie K. Rief, James R. Thompson III. Congressional fellows: \nMaurice B. Hutchison and DeNeige V. Watson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, summing up my remarks, I pledge to Senator \nThurmond my cooperation on this bill. The chairman has an awesome \nresponsibility to be here on the floor, to help manage the bill and to \nmake judgment on amendments. My role will be to help him and assist him \nwhere he calls on me and where I can be of help.\n  I hope that people who have important amendments will come to the \nfloor and begin that process in the next few hours. I know that the \nmajority leader is under a great deal of pressure with a lot of other \nbills. I have never known us to be able to pass this bill in less than \n3 or 4 days. It is my hope that we can do that in this context. That \nwill depend on the cooperation of all of the Members.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn, for his kind remarks. It will be a pleasure \nworking with him on this bill. He is a former chairman of this \ncommittee. He is now the ranking member and does a very fine job for \ndefense, and we are very proud of him.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Craig \nWilliams, a fellow on the staff of Senator McCain, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the discussion of S. 1745.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield Senator Inhofe 15 minutes. Is \nthat sufficient?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nSenator, the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, for all of \nhis hard work. I really believe that our committee has spent a lot of \ntime, has had a lot of bipartisan cooperation in coming up with a \nproduct, which I think is still inadequate but is still the very best \nthat we could come up with at this time.\n  I think it is very unfortunate that most American people do not \nrealize what a crisis our country is in in terms of our defense. I was \nvery proud the other day before Senator Thurmond's committee when the \nfour Chiefs of the four services came in and made the statement that we \nare $20 billion underfunded in our procurement accounts. I think this \nis something that\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\nwe have to listen to because this is unprecedented. At least I do not \nrecall any time in history when the Chiefs themselves have come in and \nsaid that the President's budget is underfunding procurement by $20 \nbillion. They said that we need to get it up there in order to have the \nvery minimum requirements the American people expect to defend our \ncountry.\n\n  The administration's request is almost $20 billion less, in real \nterms, than we are spending this year, and there are several of us who \nare trying to do something about this by adding back an amount of \nmoney.\n  So I guess what I am trying to say is that the authorization that we \nare dealing with in this bill is still, in my opinion, inadequate. Yet, \nI think it is the best that we can do at this time. Our budget has \nactually decreased for 12 consecutive years.\n  There is a lot of talk about what to do about the deficit. All of the \nliberals will point toward defense and say, ``We need to cut defense \nspending,'' when we have done nothing but cut defense spending for the \nlast 12 consecutive years. Back during the Kennedy administration, 60 \npercent of our budget went to defending America and 17 percent to human \nservices. Now, 17 percent of our budget goes to defending America and \n60 percent goes to human services. It just shows the change that has \ntaken place in the attitude of the function of Government.\n  We talked about the balanced budget amendment not long ago, and the \nfact that we need to do something to bring it into balance. So they \nalways point toward national defense, when we have already taken cuts \nthere.\n  It is kind of interesting that there is a study documented --and it \nhas not been refuted on the floor of the Senate, and I brought this up \nseveral times--that shows that if we were to put growth caps on \nGovernment--one was a 2-percent cap, and one was a 2.5-percent cap--we \ncould actually balance the budget without cutting one Federal program. \nI can assure you that I would be delighted to have that kind of \ntreatment in our defense budget because it has deteriorated and \nconsistently gone down over the years. Since World War II, there have \nonly been 4 years that have been lower than we are right now--1947, \n1948, 1949, and 1950. This is the lowest budget since 1950.\n  So it gets down to the question, is there a reason for this? Is it \nbecause the threat is not as great out there as it was in previous \nyears? I suggest that that is a matter of interpretation. You will get \na lot of difference of opinion on this floor. To me, it is \nincontrovertible.\n  I have some articles I will submit for the Record. I am going to \nparaphrase these. The first one--this is just in the last few days--was \nin the Washington Times. The last paragraph of this is:\n\n       In a report released ahead of publication today, Stern--\n\n  That is the German magazine.\n\n     Said the plant was similar to one in Tarhunah, Libya. The \n     United States says that complex is a chemical weapons \n     factory. Libya says it is an irrigation plant.\n\n  Then we have what appears to be a new relationship between Syria and \nIraq. This was an article in the Washington Times on June 5.\n  The third article I will submit is ``U.S. Investigates Ukraine-Libya \nAlliance.'' This is kind of a scary thing that is going on right now. \nAll of these are recent.\n  The fourth article is, ``Report Cites China-Pakistan Missile Links.''\n\n       A new, draft U.S. Government report states that all \n     intelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that \n     Pakistan has obtained medium-range ballistic missiles made by \n     China, and says for the first time that Pakistan probably has \n     finished developing nuclear warheads for these missiles, U.S. \n     officials said yesterday.\n\n  Of course, we have been talking, time and time again, about the \nthreat that is out there that is different than it has been before. I \nunderstand that we are not going to be really addressing the national \nmissile defense problem that we have. We tried to do that with the \nDefend America Act.\n  We have a President in the White House who vetoed last year's \nauthorization bill because his veto message was that he did not want to \nspend more money on national missile defense.\n  Time and time again, we have Members of this body stand up and talk \nabout, well, we cannot spend another $50, $60, $70, or $80 billion more \non star wars. Star wars is just a term to try to make it appear as if \nthere is not any real threat out there. I suggested that back in 1983. \nWe recognized that, in the medium term, we were going to have to defend \nAmerica against ICBM's, a missile attack with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Now, everything has gone in accordance with the schedule that was \narticulated at that time by President Reagan. So that here we are today \nwith a system that was to be in place by the year 2000, and we have an \ninvestment of approximately $50 billion in a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  Yet, we stopped it dead in its tracks in spite of the fact that the \nRussians have missiles, that China has missiles, and the Taepo Dong II \nmissile from North Korea is one that will be able to reach the United \nStates by somewhere around between the year of 1999 and 2002.\n  So the threat is very real. It is out there. And we have people that \nare of the caliber of Saddam Hussein who made the statement back at the \ntime of the Persian Gulf war. He said, ``If we had waited to invade \nKuwait for 5 more years we would be able to have the missile capability \nof reaching the United States.'' Would he do it? Sure he would. Anyone \nwho would kill his own grandchildren would do something like that. Look \nat what is happening in Libya. Qadhafi is developing weapons of mass \ndestruction, and they have a new alliance with the Ukraine. We have \nvery real problems that are out there.\n  The Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, mentioned the crisis, the \ndisaster, the bombing of the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma \nCity and all the tragedy that was linked to that. It is something--that \nunless you are there to see not just the loss of lives of 168 innocent \npeople but the brutality that was with it; the fact that all that \nhappened with one bomb that is the equivalent of 1 ton of TNT. The \nsmallest nuclear warhead known is 1 kiloton--1,000 times that power; \nthat explosive power. So just imagine. No one is immune from that type \nof threat.\n  We saw just recently China and how overt they are getting right now \nin the Taiwan Straits with their missile testing that is taking place. \nThen the statement that was made by a high ranking Chinese official--it \nhas been verified that he did say it. He said, ``We are not concerned \nwith the United States coming in and defending Taipei because they \nwould rather defend Los Angeles.'' At a very minimum it is an indirect \nthreat. Are we being held hostage? I think we are.\n  We see the new developments in Syrian-controlled Lebanon and \nthroughout the Middle East; that when Jim Woolsey 2 years ago--it has \nbeen 2 years now since. He certainly would not be considered a \nRepublican. He was a CIA Director under two Democratic Presidents \nincluding President Clinton--said 2 years ago that we know of between \n20 and 25 nations that have or are developing in the final stages \nweapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear, \nand working on the missile means of delivering it. That was 2 years \nago. He has come out since then and expanded that up to 30 nations.\n  So we are not talking about the days when we had two superpowers. Of \ncourse, we are looking at elections taking place right now in Russia. \nWe do not know how they are going to come out. But we see a change in \nattitude in the former Soviet Union. We saw what happened in the newest \nelections last December when the Communists took over 153 seats to \nYeltsin's 54 and Zhirinovsky roughly 53 or 54 seats. So we are seeing a \nchange there.\n  But let us assume that there was tranquillity and there was no \nproblem between the United States and the former Soviet Union, as we \ntalked about, during the cold war. The threat was there. I have always \ncontended that the threat during the cold war was not as great as the \nthreat is now because at least we could identify who enemy was at that \ntime. We had the Soviet Union and we had the United States. We had at \nthat time a treaty, an ABM Treaty, and said that we were going to agree \nto downgrade our nuclear capability. That was called mutually \nassured destruction. ``You shoot at us. We shoot back at you. Everyone \ndies, and everybody is happy.'' That is no longer the case. I did not \nagree with the policy. That was not a Democratic policy. It came under \nNixon and Kissinger. That did not make any sense. But\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\nthere were those who did believe it was worthwhile. I talked to \nKissinger about it. He said, ``It's nuts to make a virtue out of our \nvulnerability.'' That is what we have done. So here we are out there \nadhering to a policy through START II, which in my interpretation puts \nus back with the ABM Treaty where we are downgrading our nuclear \ncapability with one other nation while the rest of the 25 or so rogue \nnations are increasing their nuclear capability.\n\n  So I think that we do not address that in this. We should be \naddressing that in this authorization bill. But I know what would \nhappen if we did. We would not get it passed and the President would \nveto it because he said that he would.\n  So I say, Mr. President, that this bill does not go far enough. We \nhave real serious problems today. During the Persian Gulf war we had 26 \ndivisions. We are going to be down to 15 divisions with this. I think \nthat it is a very serious threat. We are right now No. 9, as I \nunderstand it, in ground forces, having been passed by Pakistan.\n  So America is not at the strength level that America should be. While \nI say that, I am supporting this bill because it is the only dog in the \nfight. We need to have an authorization bill. I support this.\n  Since the beginning of our country's history, national security has \nbeen the most solemn obligation our Government holds with its citizens. \nIn order to honor this obligation, top priority must be given to the \nforces that guarantee our national security. These forces do not ask \nmuch of us for their service. But they do need a certain amount of \nsupport from their Government in order to carry out their duties and \nprotect the security of the United States as well as maintain our \nstatus as the world's preeminent military power.\n  However, in order to allow our military to honor their sworn duty, we \nhave to provide them with the means to do many things. We must give \nthem the authority to retain ample manpower in the form of adequate end \nstrengths. Our military must have the means to recruit high-quality \npersonnel to carry us into the 21st century. In addition, in order to \nkeep our high-quality personnel, and protect their quality of life \nwhich is so important in maintaining morale, we must provide them with \nequitable pay and benefits--including a 3-percent pay raise to protect \nagainst inflation--and appropriate levels of funding for the \nconstruction and maintenance of troop billets and military family \nhousing.\n  We must keep the battle sword sharp by providing enough resources to \nmaintain readiness and continue modernization efforts to provide the \ncapabilities needed for future wars. Our military must also be given \nthe means to field the type and quantity of weapons systems and \nequipment needed to fight and win battles decisively, with minimal risk \nto our troops, just as they did in the gulf war.\n  Another important lesson learned in the gulf war was that we need to \nbe able to protect our troops from ballistic missiles, missiles that \nare capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Whether it is \nnuclear, chemical, or biological, we must protect our forces while they \nare in the field and we must protect their families at home. The way we \ndo this is through the development and deployment of missile defense \nsystems: land and sea-based theater missile defense systems, which can \nprotect United States and allied forces against cruise and ballistic \nmissiles while deployed in the field; and a national missile defense \nsystem to defend American families at home. We will have a ballistic \nmissile defense, it will either be before--or after--we first need it.\n  I have spoken about what we must provide for our military, now I \nwould like to point out what we can take away. To begin with, we can \neliminate defense spending that does not contribute directly to the \nnational security of the United States; such as policing of the Olympic \nGames. More importantly, we should stand back and evaluate U.S. \ninvolvement in nontraditional military operations, and its impact on \ncombat readiness, budgeting, and our national interests. Bosnia, \nSomalia, and Haiti; these and other police actions continue to drain \ndefense funds and put a strain on personnel who are already being \nstretched beyond their breaking point--the breaking point that our \nmilitary as a whole is rapidly approaching. Bosnia alone is going to \ncost American taxpayers $3 billion in defense dollars.\n  Some people never seem to see a breaking point, however. They say we \nare spending enough on defense. Some say that we are spending far more \nmoney on defense than other countries.\n  Well--of course we spend more money on defense than other countries. \nIn fact, in 1996 the United States will spend three times as much on \ndefense as any other country on Earth, and more than all its \nprospective enemies and neutral nations combined.\n  There are two problems with this comparison, however: it assumes that \nall countries are equal, and it suggests that the comparison between \nhow much the United States spends versus other nations is a legitimate \nmeasure of which side will prevail in a conflict. But because of \ngeography, all things aren't equal. We are separated from our potential \nenemies by two great oceans. And rather than fighting wars in our own \nbackyard, Americans prefer to fight ``over there.'' Because we prefer \nto fight abroad, it will naturally cost us much more than it costs our \nenemies to field the same force, since we have to transport, sustain \nand operate our fighting force in a place where his already is. Each of \nthese activities--moving, sustaining and fighting far away--increases \nthe cost of our military without significantly changing the friendly-\nto-enemy force ratio. This cost is raised further if we want to field a \nforce that is not just equivalent to our enemy's, but one that can \ndefeat his force, again, with minimal casualties as in the gulf war. \nThe question, therefore, is not whether we will be paying more for our \narmed forces than our enemy does, but rather how much more we must pay. \nIs the right number three times as much, as with Russia, or more?\n  More than 2,000 years ago, Sun Tzu said you should have five times \nthe strength of an enemy to assure success. Well, there have been some \nchanges in warfare since Sun Tzu's time. We now have tanks, and planes, \nand submarines, so the ratio has changed a little. And we can stand \nhere and argue till we are blue in the face over what the proper force \nlevel is; two times, three times, five times as much as the other guy. \nBut the cost of our unique geography makes any comparison between what \nwe pay and what our enemies pay irrelevant. The point is: if you want \nto fight, ``over there,'' and win, decisively, with minimal losses, \nthen you can expect to pay many times what the enemy pays for his \nmilitary.\n  Now, the people who complain that we spend three times as much on \ndefense as any other country on Earth are smart people. They know that \nwe must cross our oceans to fight. They know that what we consider \ndefense spending may not be what our enemies consider defense spending: \nFirst, there is the high cost of our high-quality volunteer military: \nrecruiting, paying, providing medical care and retirement. Many people \ndo not realize it, but two-thirds of our defense budget is spent on \npaying people. Then there is the cost of supporting our worldwide \nsurveillance network, our nuclear deterrent and so on. They know these \ncosts are unique to the United States but they choose to ignore it in \ntheir arguments. Why? Because it supports their view of proper levels \nof defense spending.\n  We can disagree on what it takes to field a given capability, but let \nus drop these invalid comparisons and let us deal with the facts. And \nwith the facts in hand, let us spend no more than necessary to get the \njob done, and let us spend enough to fight, ``over there,'' and win, \ndecisively, with minimal losses.\n  In this regard, I have to say I was disappointed by the \nadministration's budget request for 1997 defense spending. The \nadministration's fiscal year 1997 budget request was $18.6 billion less \nin real terms than the level enacted for fiscal year 1996. Now, let me \nput that another way; in real terms, since the end of WWII, there have \nonly been 5 years that the United States has spent less than the \nClinton administration is recommending for fiscal year 1997. Only in \nfiscal year 1947, fiscal year 1948, fiscal year 1949, fiscal year 1950, \nthose years immediately following WWII, and fiscal year 1955 \nimmediately after the Korean War, has defense spending been so low that \nit is less\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\nthan the President's recommendation for this year. Not even during the \nhollow force years of the 70's have we spent so little on defense. \nClearly, it is time that we address these shortcomings.\n\n  As we prepare to vote on the fiscal year 1997 defense bill, it should \ncome as no surprise, that I am truly concerned about the effects that \ndecreasing levels of defense spending have had upon our Armed Forces. \nIf the general public fully understood the severity of defense cuts \nunder the Clinton administration, I believe that they would also be \nvery concerned. In my State of Oklahoma, I have heard this message \nalready. We can see the cuts all around us and it is time to put these \nreckless defense cuts to an end. History has demonstrated that \nsuperpower status cannot be sustained cheaply, nor can it be sustained \nby budget requests which do not provide for adequate funding of our \nforces. I am committed to maintaining America's superpower status. \nHowever, I am skeptical about the administration's commitment to this \ngoal.\n  Right now our military--the finest fighting force on this Earth--is \nbeing torn in two directions. Our spending on defense is decreasing, \nwhile at the same time, the demands on our personnel are increasing. We \nare stretching the rubber band tighter and tighter, and if defense \nfunding levels do not increase, I fear the rubber band will break and \nthis dangerous combination may result in an exodus of high quality, \ntrained-personnel and, ultimately, a military crises.\n  It is our duty, as Senators of the United States, to do our part in \nproviding for our national security. In doing our part, we must vote \nfor a defense bill which gives our military the means to do their part. \nOur forces do not ask much of us for their service, but they do need a \ncertain amount of support from their Government in order to carry out \ntheir duties and protect the security of the United States of America.\n  I feel it is time we take a more responsible approach to defending \nthis Nation, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support the fiscal \nyear 1997 DOD authorization and its modest increase over the \nadministration request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 5, 1996]\n\n               U.S. Informs Bonn of Syrian Toxic-Gas Unit\n\n       Bonn.--Syria is building a poison gas factory in the \n     western city of Aleppo that could constitute a major threat \n     to Israel's national security, a German magazine reported \n     yesterday.\n       The weekly Stern said U.S. intelligence officials had \n     passed on satellite photographs of the plant to their German \n     counter-parts, who were checking if any Germans were \n     involved.\n       In a report released ahead of publication today, Stern said \n     the plant was similar to one in Tarhunah, Libya.

Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       A new, draft U.S. government report states that all \n     intelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that \n     Pakistan has obtained medium-range ballistic missiles made by \n     China, and says for the first time that Pakistan probably has \n     finished developing nuclear warheads for these missiles, U.S. \n     officials said yesterday.\n       The classified report's unanimous reaffirmation of a long-\n     standing intelligence conclusion that complete Chinese M-11 \n     missiles are in Pakistan puts additional pressure on the \n     Clinton administration to consider imposing tough economic \n     sanctions against both nations, as required under a U.S. law \n     aimed at punishing the global spread of such missiles, the \n     officials said.\n       In the past, U.S. policymakers have repeatedly said that \n     while components of the M-11 missiles may be in Pakistan, \n     Washington lacks concrete evidence that the complete missiles \n     are there. As a result, these policymakers have said, \n     Washington need not invoke the law and cut off U.S. \n     government contracts with China, halt licenses for U.S. \n     exports to China or ban Chinese imports worth up to several \n     billion dollars.\n       But with the imminent completion of the new report, which \n     updates a U.S. intelligence assessment on the issue that was \n     prepared in 1994, policymakers may have a tougher time \n     fending off calls by many proliferation experts, intelligence \n     analysts and certain lawmakers to acknowledge publicly that \n     the M-11 missiles are in Pakistan.\n       Details of the draft report are emerging at a sensitive \n     moment in U.S.-Chinese relations, as administration officials \n     are conducting final negotiations with Beijing regarding \n     possible sanctions against China for copying U.S. commercial \n     goods. The administration is also defending a decision by \n     President Clinton to renew the most-favored-nation trading \n     status that allows Chinese goods to be imported with low U.S. \n     tariffs.\n       The refusal of top policymakers to accept the intelligence \n     community's judgment regarding the presence of the M-11 \n     missiles, as well as its recent decision not to impose \n     sanctions against China for selling nuclear weapons-related \n     equipment to Pakistan, has rankled certain U.S. officials who \n     favor a much tougher policy toward China. This \n     dissatisfaction has helped fuel a series of leaks about \n     Chinese wrongdoing over the years.\n       The first U.S. intelligence report regarding the M-11s was \n     leaked in 1992. Last July, the Washington Post quoted \n     Intelligence officials as saying that more than 30 of the \n     missiles were stored in crates at Pakistan's Sargodha Air \n     Force Base west of Lahore.\n       Several U.S. officials said yesterday that is where the \n     entire intelligence community believes the missiles remain. \n     But they added that a sharp dispute has broken out within the \n     community over whether the missiles should nonetheless be \n     described in the new report as ``operational,'' a term that \n     would raise policy alarms in Washington and upset the Indian \n     government.\n       Yesterday's Washington Times reported the existence of the \n     new draft report and first described the dispute about its \n     contents.\n       Representatives of the CIA and the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency, in particular, have argued that because a unit of the \n     Pakistani army has been assigned to operate the missiles and \n     has been trained by Chinese experts, the missiles can \n     probably be withdrawn from their crates and deployed in the \n     field within a matter of days.\n       The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research \n     (INR), alone among U.S. intelligence agencies, has argued to \n     the contrary that not enough information is known about \n     Pakistani training practices to reach this judgment. The \n     missiles cannot be considered operational until they have \n     actually been withdrawn from the crates and been used in such \n     training--and act that has not yet occurred, the bureaus has \n     argued.\n       ``There is nothing new on this issue [of missile \n     operations],'' said one policymaker. That means ``it is kind \n     of a semantic question,'' rather than an act reflecting a \n     shift in Pakistani military strategy or security policy.\n       A similar dispute has broken out over the draft report's \n     new conclusion that ``it is probable'' Pakistani weapons \n     engineers have completed the arduous task of creating nuclear \n     warheads compact enough to fit atop the missiles.\n       Several officials said this conclusion is derived from an \n     estimate of how long Pakistan has been trying to complete \n     this task and certain information about the sophistication of \n     its weapons designs. But INR analysts have argued to the \n     contrary that the effort cannot be considered successful \n     until the warhead has been flight-tested--an act that again \n     has not yet occurred.\n       Officials said the final wording of the report is to be \n     decided by CIA Director John M. Deutch, after further \n     drafting by the Weapons and Space Systems Intelligence\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\n     Committee, a little-known panel that includes representatives \n     of all U.S. intelligence agencies as well as officials from \n     Australia, Canada and Britain, Australia and Canada have \n     sided with INR in concluding the M-11s are not yet \n     ``operational'' and that Pakistan might not yet have \n     completed the requisite nuclear warheads.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nOklahoma for his fine statement. He is a valuable member of the Armed \nServices Committee. We appreciate his coming here and making a good \nstatement.\n  I now yield to the able Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, another \nvaluable member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank our chairman and my friend, the \nSenator from South Carolina, for his kind statements and for allowing \nme this time.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  First of all, Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent \nthat a member of my staff, Maj. Sharon Dunbar, be allowed permission to \nbe on the floor during the debate on the defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have a somewhat lengthy statement which I \nwill try to abbreviate. There are essential points which I would like \nto make as we are debating the 1997 national defense bill.\n  The President's proposed defense budget of $254 billion is, in my \nopinion, the epitome of a mindset that has been prevalent throughout \nthe Congress and this administration that the military can do more with \nless. Not only does this budget figure as has been proposed to us \nconstitute the 12th consecutive year of decline for defense spending \nbut it flies squarely in the face of his many pledges and commitments \nto ensure a strong national defense, and at the same time in the face \nof this declining figure of 12 straight years our military is being \nasked to do more and more, to be prepared to do more, and actually is \ncommitted to more conflicts and more deployments around the world than \nit has in a long, long time.\n  In his 1994 State of the Union Address the President said:\n\n       From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our \n     Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and \n     best prepared military on Earth.\n\n  This year's defense budget is a disavowal of that pledge--that falls \nfar short of meeting many of the needs of our Armed Forces. But the \nPresident's rhetoric in this instance, as in many other instances and \nmany other issues, simply does not match the record. The President has \npraised our men and women in uniform for their courage and skill, and \nyet each budget that he sends up refuses to back up that praise and \nthat commitment with adequate resources to allow them to do their job.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples. In the area of procurement, in \norder to ensure future military readiness and superiority against \nthreats from outside by tyrants, terrorists, rogue nations, and others, \nour military needs to, on a regular basis, recapitalize existing \nequipment and buy new systems.\n  There is amazing change taking place today in technology and what is \navailable to us. We saw vivid pictures of that during Desert Storm--a \nrevolution in terms of the way warfare is fought to engage in that size \nconflict with that number of troops, and to come away with as few \ncasualties as we have. It was extraordinary. Never in the history of \nwarfare has this happened. It is due to those changes in technology \nwhich allow us to have a significant advantage over our adversaries. It \nis due to the extensive training of troops to utilize that new \ntechnology, to outstanding leadership, and the availability of a \nsynergy of training, quality personnel, quality leadership, and modern \ntechnology in new weapons.\n  Yet, in spite of warnings by senior military officials that \nprocurement is in a crisis, in the defense budget the President seeks \nto fund procurement at its lowest level since the Korean war--$21 \nbillion less than what senior military leaders have testified as \nrequired by the year 1998. We are significantly under the procurement \nbudget that is necessary to maintain pace with recapitalization of \nexisting equipment.\n  The war-fighting commanders, military service chiefs, and Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff have all testified to their deep concerns \nabout the President's budget. These senior military leaders universally \nhave identified readiness, quality of life, and modernization as \ndesperately requiring attention and increased funding. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee has weighed their testimony carefully. It authorized \nan additional $12.9 billion over the President's budget based upon the \nmilitary's own needs and requirements. Even with this addition, the \n1997 committee bill will still be $5.6 billion below the inflation-\nadjusted spending levels of last year's defense bill.\n  So Members and colleagues need to understand that even though we are \nadding this to the President's request, we are still below what is \nnecessary to maintain a level of funding over last year's bill.\n  So we are now entering the 12th consecutive year of defense declines. \nThe defense bill before us does not provide our troops with what is \nrequired for the defense of our Nation, what is required to sustain \nmilitary superiority in a rapidly changing global environment. Rhetoric \nmatters little if our troops lack the resources they need to execute \nthe mission or enjoy an acceptable quality of life during military \nservice. The bill that we are bringing forward authorizes our Armed \nForces to modernize their equipment, to replace aging trucks, ships, \nand aircraft, and encourages our military to develop new operational \ncapabilities based on emerging technologies and to better prepare \nthemselves for a military technological revolution that may well be \nushered in in the next century, a revolution that may profoundly change \nthe character of future conflicts.\n  Finally, the bill that the Armed Services Committee is bringing \nforward will improve the quality of life of our military personnel by \naddressing compensation, work and living conditions. Addressing these \nissues will enable the troops to focus on their mission rather than \nworry about the welfare of themselves or of their families.\n  So, Mr. President, what I am stating here is that had we followed the \nPresident's requested budget, we would not have begun to address the \nconcerns that were laid out before us as members of the committee and \nmembers of the armed services leadership came and testified.\n  With this $12.9 billion plus up, in addition, even though we fall \nshort of maintaining parity with spending last year inflation adjusted, \nwe do address some of the critical areas that need to be addressed, \nprimarily improving our readiness, improving quality of life for our \ntroops and their families and beginning the process of modernizing to \nkeep pace with the technological changes that are before us.\n  As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity \nto visit our troops, listen to them testify before our committee and \nmeet with them at many military installations around the country and \nthe world. With a 30 percent less force structure, I found that our \nmilitary is overextended in meeting many of the new demands of the \npost-cold-war world. By demanding more of those who remain in the \nmilitary after a nearly 40 percent decrease in personnel levels and \nspending levels but by not training or equipping them to conduct these \nadditional missions, we are eroding the state of military readiness and \nthe quality of life of our military members.\n  Let me give some examples. What is called personnel tempo, that is, \nthe amount of time our military members spend away from their home \nbase, has increased considerably since the end of the cold war. Today, \nfour times as many Air Force personnel are deployed as there were in \n1989. People think we are in this peace period, post-cold-war period, \nwhere most of our troops are staying home and not having commitments \nfor deployment or heavy training. That is simply not the case. Air \nForce personnel are deployed at four times the rate they were in 1989. \nGeneral Reimer, the Army Chief of Staff, indicated that requirements \nfor the\n\n[[Page S6378]]\n\nArmy forces have risen 300 percent during that time. Today, more than \n41,000 U.S. soldiers are currently deployed on nearly 170 missions in \n60 countries. General Sheehan, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. \nAtlantic Command, has testified that he has forces deployed in 18 \nseparate operations worldwide, 70 ships, 400 aircraft, and 37,000 \npersonnel. At this pace, maintenance, morale, and readiness rapidly \nerode if they do not have the resources capable of meeting these \ndemands.\n\n  General Reimer has testified:\n\n       Excessive time away from home is often cited by quality \n     professionals as the reason for their decision to leave the \n     military. It is common to find soldiers that have been away \n     from home for 140, 160 or 190 days in the past year. The \n     Army's future depends upon our ability to retain the best \n     soldiers to be tomorrow's leaders.\n\n  The quality of our Armed Forces, their training, their \nprofessionalism, and their commitment, is what distinguishes the \nAmerican military from all the others. Today we have an excellent, \ndedicated force, but in order to attract and retain the quality of \npersonnel for which our military is known, we must pay attention to \ntheir needs and concerns.\n  Quality of life is a factor of readiness that we cannot ignore. It \ninvolves not just where our military families live but how they live. \nWe must not forget that training programs and the quality-of-life \ninitiatives are major investments in the future of our Armed Forces. If \nwe fail to address these issues today, our Armed Forces will suffer the \nconsequences tomorrow.\n  The defense bill before us addresses the quality-of-life issues that \nmatter the most to our military personnel and their families. Included \nin this legislation are provisions to provide equitable pay and \nbenefits and to restore funding for troops, barracks, and military \nfamily housing. The committee added $122 million to the fund for family \nhousing requirements. This need was pointed out clearly by General \nKrulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, who expressed his concern about \nconditions of housing. General Krulak testified:\n\n       We are not where we ought to be. I went with my godchild to \n     his barracks and was appalled at what he was living in. \n     Appalled is probably a mild word for it. We are building some \n     barracks, we are building some homes, but it is not to the \n     level that I as Commandant or you as a public servant would \n     be very pleased about. It is simply a matter of available \n     money.\n\n  Mr. President, I have visited barracks and family housing units at \nbases across this country and in different parts of the world. I wish I \ncould take every Member of the Senate to these bases and show them \npersonally what we are providing for our troops in terms of living \narrangements. They would be appalled to see the conditions that we are \nasking our service members and their families to live in. Today, over \n60 percent of all military housing is deemed substandard by military \nstandards, and those military standards are far lower than the \nstandards we find in civilian occupations outside of the military--\nsoldiers with rotting shower stalls and running toilets, half of which \ndo not work, with drywall with holes punched through, with leaky, \nrusted pipes and units with asbestos in the ceilings and in the walls. \nIt is just extraordinary to see the disrepair that our troops are \nrequired to live with and raise their families in.\n  I commend the Secretary of Defense for understanding this problem and \ntaking initiatives to address this problem. He has established both an \ninternal task force and an external task force to address this housing \nproblem, but housing year after year after year has been deferred and \ndelayed in terms of rebuilding new housing and maintaining existing \nhousing because we have had scarce resources and have had to divert \nthose resources into the essential needs of readiness and training and \npay for our personnel, and yet we have ignored the very facilities in \nwhich they live. Members would feel it a disgrace if they visited these \nfacilities. Members here would not think of raising their families \nunder the conditions that our soldiers and sailors and marines and \nairmen are required to raise their families in. Soldiers today are \npooling their own funds and going down to Home Depot to buy materials \nto bring back to their barracks to fix their shower stalls, to fix \nleaky windows, to fix rotting ceilings, to repair the facilities that \nthey live in, with their own money on their own time.\n  Our units are being organized by their commanders to do self-work \nprojects in order just to obtain minimal living standards. It is a \ndisgrace. So, for those who come to this floor and say the military has \nmoney flowing out of its pockets and is wasting taxpayers' dollars on \ndefense needs, I would like them to join me on a short trip to a number \nof facilities so they can see what kind of quality of life our troops \nhave, what conditions they are asked to live in.\n  We take great pride in providing our troops with the best training, \nthe best leadership, and the best weapons. Yet, when it comes to \nquality of life, whether it comes to the time they spend with their \nfamily or take the weekend off, they return to a substandard quality of \nlife that this Nation ought to be ashamed of.\n  One of the ways in which the committee is attempting to close this \ngap between military housing costs and housing allowances, to span that \ngap, is we have recommended a 4-percent increase in the basic housing \nallowance. We also have authorized single E-5's to receive basic \nallowance for quarters, one of the Navy's highest quality-of-life \npriorities.\n  In addition, we provided a 3-percent pay raise for our troops, both \nneeded and well deserved, which is, again, less than the Congressional \nBudget Office's 3.2 inflation estimate, but it is close. So it is \nhardly unreasonable to ask for a 3-percent increase in pay.\n  Additionally, General Shelton, who is commander in chief of Special \nOperations Command, testified before our committee about his inability \nto pay Army special operation forces special duty assignment pay. He \nsimply did not have the funds. So we authorized the funding to give \nthem that pay that other special operations forces receive. These are \njust a few of the personnel initiatives that we have taken to attempt \nto address some serious personnel problems.\n  With regard to modernization issues--procurement, research, \ndevelopment, test and evaluation, military construction, housing--the \nadministration concedes that the budget is ``* * * contingent on the \nrealization of savings expected to accrue from infrastructure \nreductions, especially base closings, and the successful implementation \nof acquisition reform initiatives.''\n  Let me just comment briefly on that. I have some very fundamental \nconcerns about the administration's approach to funding future needs \nbased on assumptions that may not pan out. Many of these funding \nmodernizations are critical to the future of our forces, yet we are \ndepending on freeing up funds based on assumptions about inflation \nwhich will defy all past records of what inflation levels will be in \nthe future. Any miscalculation is going to impact greatly the resources \nnecessary for updating many of our programs.\n  Second, planning for weapons modernization is not the same as funding \nweapons modernization. Mortgaging of modernization to fund near-term \nreadiness over recent years has already created massive bow waves in \nweapons requirements. The tactical air fleet is reaching its half-life. \nArmy and Marine utility helicopters have already exceeded their half-\nlife, and combat vehicles and trucks will reach their full life cycle \nby the end of the future year's defense plan. We have military \npersonnel today who are flying aircraft and driving trucks that are \nolder than they are.\n  So linking future modernization funding to illusory savings from \nacquisition reform, base cloture and inflation is unacceptable. Even if \nthese savings materialize, modernization at best will be funded at $60 \nbillion 4 years later than what is required. If these savings do not \nmaterialize, and I suspect they will not, modernization of our Armed \nForces will be pushed further into the 21st century.\n\n  Finally, let me just state that the assumptions behind the \nadministration's defense budget are based upon its Bottom-Up Review \nstrategy calling on our military to fight and win two nearly \nsimultaneous major regional contingencies. It is not realistic to \nexpect our military to fight two major regional conflicts with a $10 \nbillion nominal decline in the defense budget. Until the Department of \nDefense conducts another strategic review, our military\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nmust continue to organize, train, and equip to execute this strategy.\n  Many of us share concerns that the outdated Bottom-Up Review may be \ndetracting from prudent defense investments. Misinvestments will \nadversely impact our war fighters, but it will also affect taxpayers. \nBecause of these concerns, I am supporting, along with Senator \nLieberman, an amendment calling for the Defense Department to undertake \na comprehensive innovative study of alternative force structures in \n1997, and urge Members to participate in this debate and listen to the \nreasons why we need to do this.\n  Last year, during the debate on the defense authorization bill, we \nheard from a number of Members who were offering amendments to cut \nfunding for the Defense Department who were questioning the increases \nthat we were seeking in the funding for the defense of our Nation. We \nheard them say over and over and over, ``Well, the Pentagon did not ask \nfor this money, the Pentagon did not seek these funds. So, therefore, \neverything that is being requested on this floor that exceeds what the \nPentagon sent over in its budget request has to be pork-barrel \nspending, it has to be unnecessary spending, wasteful spending, \nspending that is not needed.''\n  I want to make sure my colleagues know that when this excuse is \nbrought up this year in the context of discussion about this bill, or \nspending priorities, that this statement that ``the Pentagon did not \nask for it, and therefore it is not needed,'' is an excuse that just \nsimply will not wash. It does not square with the testimony received by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. It only squares with what the \nPresident's budget department decided they would spend for defense. It \ndoes not come anywhere close to what the military has testified on the \nrecord that they need in order to accomplish the tasks and the missions \nthat have been required of them by this administration.\n  So that excuse, that this is above the Defense Department's own \nrequest, is a phony excuse. It does not reflect in any way the \ntestimony we received from senior military leaders. It reflects what \nthose senior leaders were told to say and the constraints that were \nplaced on them by the administration. So let us make sure we understand \nwhat the difference is between defense needs and their stated needs, \nand what the administration has told them their needs are and their \ntop-line spending is.\n  In a December 1994 Rose Garden speech, President Clinton affirmed \nthat ``We ask much of our military and owe much to them in return.'' \nWhat is a fair return to our troops for dedicating themselves to \nservice for our Nation--for risking their lives to defend America's \ninterests around the world? Our troops do not ask for much. In fact, \ntheir requests are actually quite reasonable--modernized weapon systems \nto defend America's interests, to give them a superior edge over those \nthey fight against, training programs to improve their warfighting \ncapabilities, a decent standard of living, and decent quarters in which \nto live. Attending to these basic needs is indeed a small investment \nfor the services our Armed Forces provide to the Nation each day. \nAttending to these needs is a small return on the price we may \nultimately ask our Armed Forces to pay in defense of our Nation.\n  We must not squander the opportunity to plan our military's future \nduring a time of peace. Nor should we be lulled into a false sense of \nsecurity that in the 21st century--indeed in the years preceding it--\nour Armed Forces will not again be called upon to defend America. I \nrespect the argument that our Nation must grapple with many, often \nconflicting, priorities. Clearly, the Government has an obligation to \nget its financial house in order and balance the budget. However, we \nmust avoid the temptation to act as if cutting defense spending has no \nconsequences. History is replete with examples of the consequences of \nignoring military preparedness.\n  In speaking of our Nation's failure to address these very same issues \nafter World War II, Gen. Creighton Abrams said:\n\n       We paid dearly for unpreparedness during those early days \n     in Korea with our most precious currency--the lives of our \n     young men. The monuments we raise to their heroism and \n     sacrifices are really surrogates for the monuments we owe \n     ourselves for our blindness to reality, for our indifference \n     to real threats to our security, and our determination to \n     deal in intentions and perceptions, for our unsubstantiated \n     wishful thinking about how war would not come.\n\n  In his annual report to the President and Congress, Defense Secretary \nPerry wrote:\n\n       The world has changed dramatically over the past few years, \n     but one thing remains constant: a strong military force, made \n     up of the finest American men and women, is the Nation's best \n     insurance policy.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to ponder the haunting words of General Abrams, \nand the deliberate words of Secretary Perry. As tempting as it may be \nin an era of scarce resources and competing priorities, we must not \nallow indifference to serve as the basis for today's defense spending. \nA strong, well-prepared military has been, and will continue to be, our \nNation's only insurance. A strong national defense does not come \ncheaply. We should not delude ourselves into thinking otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I will say to those who think defense needs to do more \nof its share in helping to reduce our spending, had every other item of \nGovernment done half the share that defense has provided of reduced \nspending over the past 12 years, we would more than have a balanced \nbudget. If other agencies of Government had taken the same steps, or \nhalf the steps, taken by the Department of Defense, we would not be \narguing over the need for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget or how we get to a balanced budget.\n  The truth of the matter is that over the past 12 years, defense \nspending has declined nearly 40 percent, and it continues to go down, \nnow the 12th consecutive year. Name me one other program of Government \nthat has begun to match the record of reduced spending as the \nDepartment of Defense--40 percent less troops, 40 percent less spending \nfor equipment, troops deployed all over the world, stretched to the \nlimit, in many cases, in terms of their operations tempo and their \npersonnel tempo, troops living in substandard housing.\n  What Member of this Congress can take any sense of satisfaction in \nknowing that 60 percent or more of the men and women and families who \nhave committed to defend this Nation live in absolutely substandard \nhousing arrangements? It is a disgrace, and it is simply something that \nwe absolutely have to correct.\n  So, as we go forward in the debate on the defense bill, I hope my \ncolleagues will remember defense has contributed more than its share in \nreducing our spending and trying to get in line with a balanced budget. \nNo other agencies of Government can begin to compare with that. And in \nthe end, one of the most essential, if not the most essential, \nfunctions for Federal Government is to provide for the common defense \nand the national security of this country. I can think of no higher \nspending priority. We need to understand that. We need to understand \nthat this administration is not committed to that priority, despite \ntheir rhetoric.\n  Let's hope that the debate will lead us to a satisfactory result, so \nwe can at least tell our troops that we have done the best we can--we \nhave not provided them everything they need, but we have at least taken \nsteps in the right direction to recognize that they provide security \nand defense for more than 250 million people of this country and \ndeserve adequate support in doing that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from Indiana \nfor the valuable contributions he has made to this debate.\n  I now yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I \nwill start today by expressing my respect for the Senator from South \nCarolina. I think he has brought a bill to the floor that includes many \nfeatures that are very important. He and Senator Nunn are two Senators \nfor whom I have the highest regard. I appreciate very much the work he \ndoes on behalf of this country in the area of defense.\n  I regret I am going to offer an amendment he likely will not support,\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nbut that does not diminish in any way my respect for his work and \neffort, nor does it diminish in any way the respect I have for the \nothers on the defense authorization committee.\n  I intend to offer an amendment later today to reduce by $300 million \nthe amount of money that was added to the National Missile Defense \nProgram or, I call it, star wars, because it has a space-based, \nmultisite component. But I intend to offer that, hopefully today, and \ngive the Senate an opportunity to reduce by $300 million this Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to show my \ncolleagues the following piece of metal. It is an item that comes from \na hinge to a door on a missile silo. The silo was silo No. 110 in \nPervomaysk, Ukraine. It held an SS-19 missile that was targeted against \nthe United States of America. That missile likely would have held, I \nbelieve, five or six warheads buried in the ground in the Ukraine. \nMissile No. 110 and SS-19. This piece of metal was taken from that \ndestroyed missile silo.\n  That missile does not exist anymore. Where this was part of a \ncomponent to hold an SS-19 targeted against the United States, there \nnow exists not a silo, not a missile, not a warhead, but a piece of \nlevel ground planted not with a missile but with sunflowers. Sunflowers \nhave replaced an SS-19 that was targeted against the United States of \nAmerica.\n  How did that happen? How does it happen that I hold a piece of metal \nfrom a silo that housed a nuclear weapon targeted against our country? \nThis has come from halfway around the world and from more than that \ndistance, philosophically, in terms of what we have understood how we \ncan make progress in arms reductions if we do the right thing.\n  Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar proposed legislation that is now law \nthat provides funding for the destruction of missiles under the arms \nreduction treaties we have with Russia and the old Soviet Union. Today, \nas I speak, there are missiles armed with nuclear warheads that used to \nbe pointed at this country that are being chopped up and crushed and \ntaken out of silos and destroyed.\n  Surely, everyone would agree the best way to destroy a missile that \nis aimed at the United States is to destroy it before it leaves its \nsilo. Hundreds of these missiles have been destroyed before they have \nleft the silo under the Nunn-Lugar provisions, which have substantially \nreduced the nuclear threat and which, under the arms reduction \ntreaties, have resulted in fewer missiles and fewer nuclear weapons \nthreatening our country.\n  In this Defense authorization bill, we are going to have a debate \nabout whether to build a new National Missile Defense Program. Some \ncall it Defend America. Some call it star wars. Some call it NMD. \nWhatever it is, the Congressional Research Service says it is from \nbetween a $30 billion to $60 billion new program to build a new set of \nmissiles in our country to create some kind of an astrodome across \nAmerica so that other potential enemy missiles are unable to penetrate.\n  This defense authorization bill adds $300 million to the $508 million \nthat was requested by the administration and the Pentagon on research \nand development on a national missile defense system. Let me be clear, \nI do not oppose research on a National Missile Defense Program. I do \nnot oppose research. I do oppose going beyond research, adding hundreds \nof millions of dollars, demanding we deploy, as quickly as is possible, \nalmost immediately, a national missile defense system.\n  To do that will destroy the arms control agreements we now have. To \ndestroy the arms control agreements makes no sense at all. Those are \nthe agreements by which we are seeing the missiles in the Ukraine--the \nUkraine, incidentally, is nuclear free. There are no more missiles, no \nmore nuclear warheads in the Ukraine. There used to be thousands.\n  To do what is being proposed, to undercut and destroy the foundation \nof the arms control agreements, means that we may no longer have the \nNunn-Lugar program with the opportunity to have our former adversaries \ndestroying missiles and destroying warheads that previously were once \naimed at this country.\n  Should we have a national missile defense program? I do not know. \nShould we decide immediately that we want to add extra money--$300 \nmillion in this case, but a down payment at least on a program that is \ngoing to cost $60 billion--to demand early deployment of a multisite, \nspaced-based component of a national missile defense system? Should we \ndo that now? Of course not. We should not spend money we do not have on \nsomething we do not need.\n  We will have a longer debate on this. I am happy to engage in a \ndebate with my colleagues. I will do so respectfully. I very much \nrespect their views. We, however, have spent a lot of time wringing our \nhands, gnashing our teeth, mopping our brow about the Federal budget \ndeficit. We should do that because it is a serious problem.\n  But I find it fascinating that those who have bleated the loudest or \nbrayed the loudest about the Federal deficit are at the first \nopportunity coming to the floor of the Senate saying, ``By the way, I \nam concerned about the Federal deficit, but I very much want to see us \nembark on a new $60 billion national missile defense program.''\n  My amendment will be very simple. My amendment will be to say, let us \npreserve the $508 million the administration in the Defense Department \nasked for in research and development funds for a missile defense \nprogram. We may need one sometime. We may need to deploy it sometime \nafter the turn of the century. I do not know. But I do not subscribe to \nthose who believe we ought to deploy it on an expedited basis, who \ndemand we need to build it now, we need to buy before we fly, we need \nto overstate a threat in order to justify a new program.\n  So, again, with the greatest respect for those who disagree, I will \noffer an amendment to cut the $300 million from the defense \nauthorization bill so that we are back at the $508 million on the \nnational missile defense program that the Defense Department had \nrequested in its budget. In the scheme of the Federal budget, $300 \nmillion may not be the largest amount of money, but it is a significant \namount of money. I hope my colleagues, when we have the larger debate \nabout this subject, will agree.\n  Let me finish where I began. This piece of metal is symbolic of what \nwe do if we do the right things together. Arms control agreements work. \nThis used to be housed in the silo that held a missile with nuclear \nwarheads aimed at America. The missile and silo do not now exist. There \nare sunflowers planted on that ground in the Ukraine. Where missile 110 \nused to exist, an SS-19 with a nuclear warhead, we now have a patch of \nsunflowers.\n  That is the way to destroy an adversary's missile, in the ground \nbefore it is fired. Arms control agreements have worked. I cannot \ncompliment Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn enough for the leadership \nthey have shown in these areas. I say, let us be very, very, very \ncareful, as we move forward on any missile defense program, that we do \nnot undercut arms control agreements that have achieved significant and \nreal results in reducing the nuclear threat.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nhis comments. I look forward to a spirited debate on this subject.\n  Mr. President, Senator Warner is a valuable member of the Armed \nServices Committee. He has been on the committee a long time and done a \nfine job. I now yield such time as he may require.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Comdr. \nMike Matthes, U.S. Navy, a fellow assigned to my office, be granted \nfloor privileges during the consideration of S. 1745.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will begin by again recognizing the fine \nleadership provided by Chairman Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and \nSenator Sam Nunn of Georgia, our ranking member. This year, as in many \nyears past, the defense authorization bill is truly a bipartisan \nproduct. I\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nhave often thought that in areas of defense and foreign policy \npartisanship stops at the water's edge, a concept envisioned by one of \nour former colleagues many years ago. I think it is a concept that is \nas true today as it was then.\n  Despite some differences, we were able to work together to \nunanimously report out the bill which is before the Senate at this \ntime. Less than 3 months after receiving the administration's budget \nrequest, the Armed Services Committee had conducted a thorough set of \nhearings and completed its markup of the defense authorization bill. \nThis record-setting pace is a tribute to the committee chairman, \nSenator Thurmond, and the ranking member, and the fine professional \nstaff under the direction of Col. Les Brownlee, U.S. Army, and Gen. \nArnold Punaro, U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate goes a long way towards \nensuring that our Armed Forces will remain capable of meeting the many \nchallenges that lie ahead. To achieve this goal, the committee added \n$12.9 billion to the Clinton administration's budget request and \nconcentrated the additional funding in the vital modernization \naccounts.\n  President Clinton's request of $254.4 billion represented an $18.6 \nbillion real decline in defense spending from the fiscal year 1996 \nappropriated level. Over the past decade, Mr. President--I want to \nrepeat that--over the past 10 years, the amount the United States has \nspent on defense has declined by 36 percent in real terms. Of course, \nthat reflects adjustments for inflation. Even with the funding added by \nthe Armed Services Committee, this year will mark the 12th straight \nyear of declining defense budgets. To all of the critics, I simply say \nwhat we have done is not increase defense spending; we have merely \nslowed the rate of decline. That was the purpose of adding back these \nfunds to the President's budget.\n\n  I was particularly concerned with the inadequate funding of the \nprocurement accounts contained in the President's budget. Despite last \nyear's promises that a modernization ramp up would begin in 1997, \nprocurement funding continued a dramatic decline. We are already at a \n40-year low, Mr. President. Not since the start of the Korean war have \nwe spent so little on purchasing new weapons for the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces today and, also, Mr. President, future generations.\n  May I give a few examples.\n  Ten years ago, fiscal year 1986, the United States of America \npurchased 840 new tanks. This year no new tanks are requested.\n  Ten years ago, in 1986, the United States purchased almost 400 new \ntactical aircraft. This year only 34 new tactical aircraft were \nrequested.\n  Ten years ago, Mr. President, we purchased 40 new ships for the U.S. \nNavy. This year only 6 new ships were requested.\n  Enough, I think, is enough, Mr. President.\n  U.S. troops are currently deployed in 10 separate military operations \noverseas. Despite the end of the cold war, we are calling on men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces at an ever increasing rate. It is our \nresponsibility to provide our troops with adequate resources so they \ncan effectively and safely perform their missions. We must not ever \nsend them into harm's way with equipment that is less than the best, \nparticularly if it is outdated.\n  As Army Chief of Staff Reimer told the Armed Services Committee in \nMarch of this year, and I quote that distinguished soldier:\n\n       In the event of a conflict, a lack of modern equipment will \n     cost the lives of brave soldiers.\n\n  I was impressed with the candor shown by the military leaders, \nparticularly those of the Joint Chiefs, who testified before the Armed \nServices Committee this year during the course of the budget hearings. \nI told all of the service chiefs--I said I did--all members of the \ncommittee joined in advising these chiefs that their challenge is to \nensure that their successors 10 years hence will have the forces and \nthe equipment they will need to protect our Nation's interests.\n  It was clear from their testimony that the budget submitted by \nPresident Clinton was not adequate to meet this challenge. In fact, \nprior to the administration's budget submission, the Joint Chiefs, to \nthe man, unanimously recommended a procurement budget of $60 billion as \nsoon as possible. Unfortunately, that advice was not followed, and the \nadministration proposed a procurement budget of only $38.9 billion.\n  During the committee's markup, the Armed Services Committee made \nprogress in addressing this shortfall by adding almost $8 billion to \nthe procurement accounts. The AirLand Forces Subcommittee, which I am \nprivileged to chair, added over $4 billion for additional tactical \naircraft, upgrades to existing aircraft, precision guided munitions, \ntank upgrades, new attack and scout helicopters, new radios, jeeps, \nnight vision devices, and other critical equipment. These addition will \nnot correct all of the modernization shortfalls, but they are a step in \nthe right direction.\n  I want to highlight one item contained in this bill that is very \nimportant to me, and has been for many, many years, beginning with my \nservice as Under Secretary of the Navy in the year 1969, through my \nservice as secretary in 1972 on into 1974, which is the U.S. Navy \nsubmarine program. Today, Russia, in my judgment, is putting a \ndisproportionately large amount of their defense spending toward their \nmilitary assets beneath the seas of the world. It is incumbent upon the \nUnited States of America, in every respect, to not only maintain the \nforce we have today, but to modernize that force in the face of a \ndetermined effort by Russia to try and take command of the submarine \ntactical ability that they have and to meet us head on. That concerns \nme.\n  That brings me to the subject of the New Attack Submarine Program. \nLast year, our committee fought long and hard to reach an agreement \nwith the administration to provide for competition in the procurement \nof this new class of submarines. The administration had originally \nproposed a sole source award of this work to Electric Boat in \nConnecticut--effectively prohibiting competition and cutting Newport \nNews Shipping & Dry Dock, which is located in my State, out of future \nsubmarine construction. Newport News has been in the new construction \nsubmarine programs since World War II. There is no question about its \ncompetence and its cost effectiveness to compete for the new class of \nsubmarines.\n  We struck, in our committee--with the cooperation of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, a valued member of our \ncommittee, and my colleague, Senator Robb, joining me in this effort--a \ncompromise as part of the 1996 defense authorization bill, which \nprovided for construction of the first 4 new attack submarines at two--\nnot one--shipyards--namely, that in Groton, CT and that in Newport \nNews, VA--with a competition for the fifth and remaining boats in the \nclass.\n  Unfortunately, the administration failed to request adequate funding \nto execute the 1996 submarine program, largely initiated in the Senate. \nBut then once in conference, very valuable contributions were made by \nmy colleague, Congressman Bateman, and others, on the House committee. \nThe final bill, of course, was shaped for 1996, which laid out a clear \ncourse for competition between these two yards. Competition, Mr. \nPresident, has proven, through the decades of procurement, to provide \nfor the American taxpayer the greatest degree of savings. It was \nimperative that this competition be put in this very large program, \nenvisioned to exceed perhaps over $50 billion in the next 20 years or \nso.\n  The bill before the Senate today corrects this problem by providing \nboth funding and directive language to ensure that the shipbuilding \ncompromise and the competitive process mandated in the 1996 defense \nauthorization bill is adhered to by the administration.\n  Mr. President, before the Senate is a fine bill. I am proud to join \nmy colleagues on the committee--and I think everyone in the U.S. \nSenate--in acknowledging that our military is second to none worldwide. \nWe need no less than to carry out the very heavy responsibilities of \nthis Nation in terms of its world role of leadership--not world role of \npoliceman, but world role of leadership--if we are to remain the \nworld's most powerful Nation in terms of leadership on security \nmatters. We must be willing to provide adequate funding today for our \ntroops and tomorrow in the form of procurement for\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\nmodern weapons. This bill accomplishes that goal.\n  Mr. President, I salute, once again, the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Mr. Thurmond of South Carolina, and the distinguished \nranking member, Mr. Nunn of Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to commend the able Senator from Virginia for \nthe fine contribution he has made to this debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield to the able Senator from Texas, \na valuable member of the Armed Services Committee, such time as she may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I, too, want to thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor the leadership he has given to the committee and his strong and \nenduring, never-flagging support for the military of our country.\n  Mr. President, the post-cold-war era has brought about tremendous \nchanges in our security environment. The absence of great power \nconfrontation is the peace dividend we have received as a result of our \nmilitary investments in the 1980's. While the end of the cold war \nchanged the strategic environment, serious threats remain. For just as \nsoon as we paused in our celebration over the fall of the Berlin Wall, \nSaddam Hussein dashed all illusions that this new era meant an end to \nthe requirement for a strong military capability.\n  Shaping our military forces to meet existing and future challenges \nrequires strong leadership, strong leadership by the Congress and the \nPresident together, to make sure that we have a military that will keep \nthe freedom that we so enjoy.\n  As we reduce our military forces to the lowest level since just prior \nto the outbreak of World War II, we must remain mindful that the \nthreats we face are global in nature and that the training requirements \nof a smaller military must be even more rigorous to retain readiness.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that continuing cuts in defense \nspending will leave us with a military force structure that lacks the \nmanpower and materiel to defend the United States and our vital \ninterests. This would be disastrous, not only for the United States, \nbut certainly for our allies and for peace and stability in the world. \nWe need to keep in mind that our national security assumptions are \nbased on the capability of our drastically downsized military forces to \nfight and win two major regional conflicts. We do not know from where \nthe threats will come in the future. But the magnitude of the challenge \nwe have set forth for our military force is discernible from recent \nhistory.\n  In addition to forces currently deployed in Haiti, northern Iraq, the \nSinai, and now in Bosnia, we could also conceivably find ourselves \nfacing the threat of all-out North Korean aggression, or renewed \naggression by Saddam Hussein. Both represent very real threats to our \nnational security interests, and both demonstrate the increased risk we \nface when we dissipate our military strength through involvement in \noperations such as Bosnia and Haiti, which do not represent clear \nnational security interests.\n  Mr. President, none of us wants to think of this scenario, but it is \nnot inconceivable. In depending on our slimmed-down forces to meet \nthese very real and terrible threats, we must have an expectation that \nour men and women in uniform can meet that threat if we provide the \nsupport that they need.\n  The success in Operation Desert Storm demonstrated the unequaled \ncapabilities of our military. Even after the post-cold-war drawdown our \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marines remained the best trained, the best \nled and the most formidable fighting forces in the world. But that \nsuperb quality could be at risk. If we do not make the correct \nstrategic decisions today we will reap the sad rewards 5 to 10 years \nfrom now. Our responsibility in this Congress is to minimize the risk. \nI am personally committed to that goal. Before we send soldiers into \nharm's way, whether it be a Desert Storm, or a Somalia, or a Haiti, or \na Bosnia, it is our responsibility here in Congress to ensure that our \nmilitary personnel are provided the equipment and training they \ndeserve.\n  While the President is the Commander in Chief, under our Constitution \nour Founding Fathers established a primary role for Congress. Our \nFounding Fathers decided that the Congress would have the sole ability \nto declare war, the power to make regulations of the land and naval \nforces, the power to call forth the militia, to raise and support the \nArmy and the Navy, the power to provide for organizing, arming and \ndisciplining the military. When Congress deliberates and considers \nexecutive branch judgments on military policy, we are fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  I continue to have strong reservations about whether or not we are \nproviding enough to enhance our military capability. While the major \nprovisions of this bill go a long way toward addressing some of the \nserious defense shortfalls, I believe serious weaknesses remain which \nhave not been adequately addressed.\n  As we try to achieve an elusive peace dividend we do so at the \nexpense of our military capability. We have cut too far too fast and \ntoo deep. Based on the threats we face today we still need a strong \nmilitary capability.\n  How do you define sufficient capability, and what does having this \ncapability mean for our men and women in battle? To soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, or marines in harm's way sufficient military capability means \nthey have what it takes to win decisively. It means they take fewer \ncasualties. It means they survive the battles and come home to their \nloved ones.\n  General Eisenhower once noted that, ``If asked to capture a village \ndefended by a battalion, I would send a division and I would take the \nvillage without casualties.'' That is what having sufficient military \ncapability means--accomplishing the mission with as few casualties as \npossible. This has always been the hallmark of U.S. military \noperations. We have as Americans preferred to expend firepower and \nresources--not personnel.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee I have often gone on \nrecord with my concerns over the speed of the current drawdown and the \nimplications for our national security. The current force structure \nsimply does not meet our national security requirements.\n  By further stretching our resources to participate in Bosnia \noperations I am afraid that we could soon be faced with the painful \nreality of just how much this drawdown has affected our military. \nPresident Bush, Secretary Cheney and General Powell proposed what they \ntermed the ``base force.'' President Clinton's current force is \nreferred to as the ``Bottom-Up Review force.'' It is significantly \nsmaller than the Bush plan. The stated goal of both forces is to be \nable to prevail in two major regional conflicts, and it is referred to \nas the ``two MRC requirement.'' The main difference between the two is \nthat under the base force we would be capable of winning under the base \nforce. We would be capable of winning two simultaneous major regional \nconflicts. But under the Bottom-Up Review force we could prevail in \nwinning two near simultaneous major regional conflicts. The difference \nbetween those two terms, Mr. President, is as vast as an ocean.\n  First, what does ``near simultaneous'' mean? Is it a week? Is it 6 \nmonths? Will we have 9 months to build up from a nonmilitary or \nsecurity deployment of our troops? Under the base force it was assumed \nthat some forces would be engaged in operations other than war, or \npeacekeeping such as we have in Bosnia. These forces would not be in \nthe calculation for winning two major regional conflicts because the \ncombat skills of any military unit degrade when they are not training \nfor their primary mission. Rather than send troops into a combat \nsituation for which they might be woefully unprepared they were \nexcluded from the two MRC calculations.\n\n  So what we are saying is under the base force that was put forward by \nPresident Bush these operations other than war would not count toward \nour goal of winning two major regional conflicts simultaneously. But \nthe Bottom-Up Review force under President Clinton removes that \ncushion. General Shalikashvili said in testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that if one major regional conflict\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\narises, forces performing operations other than war will have to be \nwithdrawn in order to go to a second major regional conflict.\n  Mr. President, that is a vast difference from what the base force \nthat President Bush envisioned would be capable of doing. That takes \naway the ability to have simultaneous conflicts that we would win, and \nsays nearly simultaneous because we would have to rush out and retrain \ntroops that were in an operation other than war because they are not \ntrained and ready for combat when they are performing humanitarian or \npeacekeeping missions.\n  We have a large force in Bosnia today. We have sent an entire Army \ndivision plus support troops to Bosnia totaling 20,000 personnel with \n5,000 at least in Croatia and Macedonia and with thousands more \nsupporting this operation from Hungary, Italy, Germany, the \nMediterranean and the United States. This deployment is said to last \nfor a year, and during that time we are not able to have our troops in \ntraining for their combat missions. The Bosnian deployment will cost us \nbillions of dollars in unprogrammed contingency defense expenditures in \naddition to the billions that we know it will cost up front. The \nmilitary services could have to deplete vital training accounts to pay \nfor these unplanned operations.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee I am alarmed by the cuts \nthat I see being contemplated in our Armed Forces. In my view, many of \nthe reductions which have occurred in the past 5 years have seriously \nundermined the capability to support a national defense strategy in \nwhich we must be prepared to fight and prevail in two major regional \nconflicts simultaneously. In fact, I feel very strongly, Mr. President, \nthat in rapidly reducing our Armed Forces from 2.1 to 1.4 million we \nhave already reduced their size to a level that is inadequate to meet \nour needs, and we can reduce no further.\n  When General Sullivan, the former Chief of Staff of the Army, assumed \nhis position his watchword as the drawdown began was no more Task Force \nSmiths. He was referring, of course, to the task force commanded by Lt. \nCol. Bradley Smith which was rushed into battle in Korea in July 1950 \nto counter the North Korean attack. This courageous American force was \nsent into battle outgunned, ill-equipped, and ill-prepared, and was \nquickly and easily overrun by the Soviet-equipped North Korean force. \nAt the time Americans were shocked to learn that the same military \nwhich defeated the Japanese and the German armies 5 years before had so \nquickly become a hollow force.\n  Last summer, our Nation dedicated a memorial to those who fought in \nthe Korean war. That honor was long overdue. My husband served in the \nNavy during this time. He and I went to see the Korean monument. And I \nam going to tell you that visiting the monument to our veterans of the \nKorean war is one of the most poignant and beautiful experiences that I \nbelieve I have ever had.\n  It is a real tribute to those valiant warriors. Now as we consider \nthe 1997 defense authorization bill, we should reflect not only on \nthose who died in Korea but on the lesson that we should have learned \nfrom that war. One of the finest books written about that Korean war is \n``This Kind of War: a Study in Unpreparedness,'' by T.R. Fehrenbach, a \nfellow Texan and close friend of mine. As an infantry commander, he \nexperienced the conflict from a unique vantage point, and his book, \nfirst published in 1962, remains in print today. I commend this book to \nmy colleagues because what Mr. Fehrenbach is saying is we must always \nhave a trained and ready field force, that whatever we try to do from \nthe air is not going to win a war and we are not going to protect our \nfreedom throughout civilization if we do not have the ability to go \ninto the field, and place soldiers on the ground, well equipped and \nwell trained.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about today is making sure we have \nit all--that we have the technology, that we have the airlift and the \nsealift that will allow us to take that very last step, which is \nplacing our troops on the ground. We are talking about having the \ntraining and arming our troops who must capture hold that ground while \nat the same time that we are making sure we have all of the strategic \nand technological advances which would keep them from having to go in \nthe first place. But if we must send our forces, we want them to have \nall of the protections we can give them. So we need the technology; we \nneed the equipment; we need the personnel; and we need the training. \nThat is what we are talking about in this bill today.\n  We are having a major conflict with the President and the Congress on \njust what we need in terms of military capability. Congress is trying \nto get the military spending up so that we will not have a hollow \nforce, so that we will be able to win two major regional conflicts \nsimultaneously, because that is what a ready force is, and so that we \nwill be able to prevail in two major regional conflicts quickly and \nwith the fewest possible casualties.\n  That is our goal, and that is why Congress wants to spend $10 billion \nmore than the President wants to spend to make sure that when the \ntroops are in the field they are trained and equipped, to make sure \nthey have the air cover they need, to make sure they have the equipment \nthey need to protect them if they are in the field, and to make sure \nour shores are protected from any kind of incoming ballistic missile, \nwhich we now know 32 countries in the world have the capability to \nproduce and someday soon send to our shores. We even have groups that \nare not countries with that capability. And with open borders, we could \nbe vulnerable if we do not do what is right and make the strategic \ndecisions that will protect the people who live in our country and will \nprotect those who are protecting our freedom anywhere in the world in \nany theater from coming into harm's way if we can prevent it.\n  Mr. President, those are the decisions we are making with this bill. \nI hope we can sit down with the President to make sure we are doing \nwhat is right for our troops in the field today, for the protection of \nfreedom today, and to make sure we will not wake up 5 or 10 years from \nnow and realize that we have allowed another task force Smith; that we \ndid not do what we needed to do in terms of the strategic thinking \nnecessary to make sure we were not vulnerable to any kind of attack \nfrom any source in the world.\n  I commend the Senator from South Carolina for his leadership.

Mr. President, we are working with the Democratic leader \nand trying to get agreements on how we can proceed on this bill and \nother\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\nissues. For the information of all Senators, the Democratic leader and \nI have been negotiating on the minimum wage issue since Friday of last \nweek. This Senator believes that we are making good progress and may \nyet today be able to reach an agreement that would satisfy all \nSenators.\n  With that in mind, I will now outline the agreement that we have been \ndiscussing. The agreement is as follows: On Monday, July 8, at a time \nto be determined later, the Senate would begin consideration of H.R. \n3448, the House-passed minimum wage bill, which also contains the small \nbusiness taxes, and at that time Senator Kennedy would offer his \namendment with a 1-hour time limit. The amendment would then be laid \naside, and I would offer an amendment on behalf of Senator Bond, with \nan hour time limit. The Senate would then vote, first on the Bond \namendment, to be followed by a vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n\n  Following the two minimum wage votes, the bill would then be opened \nto two tax-related amendments, one to be offered by each leader and \ndebated separately and limited to 2 hours of debate each. I want to \nemphasize again that this has not been agreed to, but this is an \noutline of what we are talking about.\n  It seems to me this is a fair agreement; that it also offers a date \nspecific that we would take these issues up and act on them. If the \nDemocratic leader is optimistic some agreement along these lines can be \nreached, then it would be my intention to ask unanimous consent that no \nminimum wage amendments be in order during today's session in order to \nmake progress on the DOD bill while negotiations are ongoing with \nrespect to this minimum wage issue.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand the Democratic leader has no objection to \nthis, and therefore I ask unanimous consent that no minimum wage \namendments be in order during the remainder of the session of the \nSenate today, Tuesday, June 18, 1996.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be set aside until the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. There was no objection heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Grassley has one on infrastructure; Senator \nBingaman has one on ASAT; Senators Simpson and Thomas have one with \nregard to a Wyoming project; Senator Ford, DOD/DOE chemical munitions. \nWe are not asking at this time for any time agreement on these \namendments, but these Members and amendments are ready to go. We need \nto get started on the amendment process.\n  It would be the intention of the leadership that we go ahead and take \nthese amendments up and try to get agreement on a time where votes \nwould be agreed to. Perhaps, even, we would stack some of them at a \ntime certain. We will notify the Members as soon as we can get that \nagreed to.\n  At this time, we would like the committee members to go ahead and \nproceed with the DOD bill and amendments that are ready to go.\n  With that, Mr. President, I turn the floor back over to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this Senate resolution condemns the arson \nand other acts of desecration against churches and other houses of \nworship.\n  Senator Daschle and I are joined in the cosponsorship of this \nresolution by Senator Hutchison, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Gramm, \nSenator Helms, Senator Faircloth, and Senator D'Amato. I hope Senators \nduring today, if they have an opportunity, or later on this afternoon, \nand would like to speak on this issue, that they will feel free to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, my State of Mississippi was gravely wounded last \nnight.\n  Two churches burned in Kossuth, a small town in the northeast corner \nof our State. The Mount Pleasant and the Central Grove Missionary \nBaptist Churches were lost to flames.\n  The fires, like several others that have hit churches elsewhere in \nthe country in recent months, were, as the official reports say, of \nsuspicious origin.\n  In time, the truth will be uncovered. And if these fires were not \naccidents, if they were set by the hand of evil, then justice must be \ndone.\n  The good people of Kossuth will rebuild their churches.\n  Bill Dillworth, a deputy sheriff and a deacon at Mount Pleasant \nChurch, affirmed, ``We will always survive. You look to the Lord at \ntimes like this. He will be your guide.''\n  I hope that same spirit prevails in the meeting President Clinton has \nscheduled for tomorrow with several of the Nation's Governors, to \ndiscuss ways to combat church arsons.\n  It will not help the situation to turn these tragedies into a racial \nor regional issue. Attacks on churches and synagogues are attacks on \nreligion itself.\n  James Glassman's column in today's Washington Post lays out the sad \nstatistics. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has \ninvestigated 123 church burnings over the last 5 years. Of those, 38 \nhave been at black churches.\n  Attacks of any kind against any of our places of worship should unite \nAmericans in outrage and in resolve. That is why, early this year, a \ncoalition of pro-family organizations--the Christian Coalition, Eagle \nForum, Family Research Council, and others--publicly appealed for \naction to protect churches--all churches.\n  In response to their petition, the House Judiciary Committee held \nhearings in May. And the Christian Coalition offered a $25,000 reward \nfor information leading to the arrest and conviction of a church-\nburner.\n  Those were constructive steps in the right direction.\n  Perhaps additional legislation is needed to make it easier for \nFederal prosecutors to intervene in cases of church burnings.\n  On the other hand, perhaps the administration should take a closer \nlook at the extraordinary powers to protect churches which congress \ngave the Justice Department 2 years ago in the clinic access bill.\n  That legislation, designed to protect only abortion clinics, was \nexpanded, at\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\nthe insistence of Senator Hatch and other Republican Members of the \nHouse and Senate, to apply to religious institutions as well.\n  To date, however, the administration has failed to use its powers \nunder that legislation to deal with attacks on churches. I urge the \nAttorney General to rethink her Department's approach.\n  I urge the President, as well, to rethink the approach he and some \nothers associated with him have taken toward religious institutions, \nand in particular, toward their role in public affairs.\n  Every time Americans are denounced as extremists for standing up for \ntheir religious beliefs, every time persons of faith are stigmatized \nfor intruding their values into politics, it becomes easier for those \nwho wish evil to actually do evil.\n  That evil is all of one piece, whether it is a wooden church aflame \nin rural Mississippi or a synagogue defaced in California or a \ncathedral disrupted in New York City.\n  For persons of faith, those buildings are more than places we visit \nregularly. They are extensions of our own homes.\n  Whoever raised a hateful hand against our homes in Mississippi last \nnight is going to learn an important lesson.\n  Along with the entire Nation, they will learn that the faithful \npeople there are like the three young men of Israel who were cast into \nthe fiery furnace. The raging flames could not harm them, and they were \nbrought forth radiant with the protection of their God.\n  I am glad we are able to get this unanimous-consent agreement on this \nresolution. It is very important that the Senate express its outrage at \nthese churches being burned.\n  Unfortunately, in my own State of Mississippi last night, we had two \nincidents in the northeastern part of the State that are of suspicious \norigin. There is no way that we can tolerate this type of activity.\n  We want to express our outrage and also assure our colleagues that \nour intent is to take a quick, serious look at House-passed legislation \nand hope we will be able to pass their bill, which provides some \nadditional authority for law enforcement investigations and activity \nwith regard to these church and other religious buildings burnings.\n  I am very pleased we have this resolution, and I am glad it was done \nin a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my State colleague \nand other Senators in cosponsoring this resolution condemning recent \nchurch burnings and urging that all appropriate Federal authority be \nused to investigate these incidents and bring to justice those who are \nresponsible for them.\n  I suggest, in addition to passing this bipartisan leadership \nresolution, that we hold at the desk the bill that will be passed by \nthe House and call it up for passage as soon as possible, without \namendment, and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Taking this action should serve notice on all concerned that this \nkind of conduct will not be tolerated in our society, and those who \nengage in this terrorism will be caught and they will be punished.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this \nresolution by Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Lott which places the \nSenate firmly on record against the recent incidents of church burnings \nin our Southern States.\n  Church burning is religious persecution at its worst. It denies \nAmericans their right to worship their God as they see fit.\n  Our Southern States are witnessing the worst number of black church \nbombings and fires since the 1960's civil rights era. Mount Zion AME \nChurch in Greeleyville, SC, was burned to the ground last year by an \narsonist. Church bombings are occurring in Virginia, Tennessee, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nTexas. For well over 18 months, communities in these States have been \nheld hostage by cowardly and intolerant individuals threatening their \ninalienable right to pray and praise. This is simply unacceptable. \nAmerica is a land of toleration and acceptance; not of prejudice and \nfear.\n  What do these criminals hate that makes them act so miserably? If \ntheir goal is racial prejudice, they should think again. Burning a \nchurch is not just a crime against people of different ethnic origins. \nIt is an attack on the House of God. Surely God knows and will remember \nthose who commit these crimes. Church arsonists are playing with fire, \nthe fire of judgment day.\n  Regrettably, religious persecution is not limited to the South. \nIllinois citizens are waking up to crosses burning in their yards. \nIdahoans, especially Idaho Mormons, have suffered as well. Three years \nago, on the campus of Idaho State University in Pocatello, the LDS \nInstitute was burned to the ground. Arson was the cause. And that's not \nthe only incident. Random acts of vandalism to the Boise and Idaho \nFalls Temples, as well as to churches and seminaries unfortunately \ncontinue today.\n  Religious persecution has no place in Birmingham, AL, or Boise, ID.\n  Our Founding Fathers enshrined religious freedom in the first \namendment. They knew worship strengthens our daily lives. They knew \nthat Americans held, and would continue to hold, differing religious \nconvictions. They also knew America stands for freedom and that \nthousands of immigrants had come to these shores seeking refuge from \nreligious persecution.\n  My prayers go out to those parishioners whose churches have been \nbombed, burned, or threatened. The faith that helped their forefathers \nthrough the worst days of slavery and suffering will carry them through \nnow. Already God is at work opening the hearts of Americans all across \nthe Nation who are helping rebuild these houses of worship.\n  These random acts of kindness show America will not move back to a \ntime of fear, ignorance, and prejudice. We will move forward to a world \nof racial and religious tolerance, acceptance, and respect.\n  All Americans are entitled to the right to worship their God. Let us \nrenew our faith and remember what a privilege it is to freely be able \nto practice our religion according to the dictates of our own \nconscience. This resolution recognizes and reenforces that right. I \nfully support it and want it to pass.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, my heart goes out to the victims of the \nrecent rash of church burnings. Like so many Americans, I have watched \nwith great dismay and real sadness as one after another African-\nAmerican house of worship has gone up in flames. There have been at \nleast 35 fires of suspicious origin at these churches in the last 18 \nmonths. As a nation, we will not tolerate this attack on African-\nAmericans and their right to exercise their religion freely and in \npeace. I know that the vast majority of Americans joins with us today \nin condemning these acts of destruction and recognizing that we cannot \nallow a small number of hate-filled people to derail the progress we \nhave made toward ending racial discrimination and intolerance.\n  We have seen in recent years the destruction of well over 100 houses \nof worship serving people of different faiths and different races. This \nresolution rightfully condems all those acts of destruction and \ndesecration.\n  The burning of these churches--which constitute the heart and soul of \nthe communities they serve--is a national tragedy that requires a \nstrong and swift response. I commend President Clinton both for his \nmoral leadership on this issue and his commitment of all possible \nFederal resources to the investigation and prosecution of the \nperpetrators of these vicious crimes. I hope we will be able to help \nthese Federal law enforcement efforts by passing legislation introduced \nby Senators Kennedy and Faircloth that gives Federal officials more \ntools to fight these terrible acts. Bringing these arsonists to justice \nmust be one of our highest national priorities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the continued spate of burnings of \nAfrican-American churches in the South is a national tragedy. I commend \nAttorney General Reno for redoubling the efforts of the Department of \nJustice to catch the perpetrators of these most heinous crimes. I have \nalso joined with Senator Faircloth in cosponsoring legislation which \nreiterates that burning of a church is a Federal crime and lowers the \ndamages threshold to bring Federal enforcement.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  One of out most precious freedoms is to practice our religious \nbeliefs. To have that freedom abridged because of racist acts is doubly \ntroubling.\n  I know that substantial efforts have been made to investigate these \nfires. But it is clear that more must be done because the fires, some \n30 in all over the past year and a half, keep happening. The leadership \nof my Commonwealth is responding. The attorney general of Virginia, Jim \nGilmore, was recently elected as chairman of the southern region of the \nNational Association of Attorneys General. One of his first acts was to \norganize a coordinated effort among southern attorneys general to \ncombat hate crimes such as church burnings. His leadership on this \nissue will bring results, and I commend him and the organization for \ntaking this action.\n  Everybody concerned with the rash of church burnings wants to know \nwhether these crimes are the work of an organized group or isolated \ninstances of violence. I hope that the efforts of the State attorneys \ngeneral and of the Department of Justice will answer this question. \nJust as importantly, I hope that whomever is committing these horrible \ncrimes will see that law enforcement across the country is committed to \nsolving and preventing these despicable acts. Even one instance of \nchurch arson is too many--to have dozens of church burnings is a crisis \nthat must be solved.\n  Unfortunately, as disturbing as these cases of arson are, they are \nnot the only instances of racist violence intruding on the right to \nworship. Yesterday, a church in Charles County, VA, was defaced with \nracist words and symbols. The Mount Zion Baptist Church has served the \nCharles City community since 1812 and is celebrating its 100th year at \nits present location.\n  Now the Federal Government cannot protect every church in America. I \nhope, however, that by finding and prosecuting arsonists and by \nencouraging law enforcement efforts such as those led by Attorney \nGeneral Gilmore, the Federal authorities can make a difference in \nprotecting America's houses of worship.\n  The wife of the pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church was quoted that \nthe church will survive this racist incident. She said that the \n``membership is just going to bind closer together.'' I wish them well, \nand my thoughts go out to all who have suffered at the hands of \ncowardly attacks on our churches.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand the preamble be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 265) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 265\n\n       Whereas there have been at least 156 fires in houses of \n     worship across the Nation since October 1991;\n       Whereas there have been at least 35 fires of suspicious \n     origin at churches serving African-American communities in \n     the last 18 months;\n       Whereas these churches and houses of worship are a vital \n     part of the life of these communities;\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches or other houses of \n     worship is a very heinous crime;\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches, when done to \n     intimidate any American from the free exercise of his or her \n     rights as an American, is inconsistent with the first \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees \n     every American the right to the free exercise of his or her \n     religion, and which ensures that Americans can freely and \n     peaceably assemble together; and,\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches, when done to \n     intimidate any American from the free exercise of his or her \n     rights, is a serious national problem that must be \n     expeditiously and vigorously addressed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate condemns arson and other acts of desecration \n     against churches and other houses of worship as being totally \n     inconsistent with fundamental American values; and\n       (2) The Senate believes investigation and prosecution of \n     those who are responsible for fires at churches or other \n     houses of worship, and especially any incidents of arson \n     whose purpose is to divide communities or to intimidate any \n     Americans, should be a high national priority.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

After that, I will have an opportunity to sit down and \nprobably work something out with the leadership on the time.\n  Mr. President, we are at a point in the defense authorization bill \nwhere I want to bring up the point that we ought to be saving some \nmoney in infrastructure costs, but we are not. We ought to be saving \nsome money in infrastructure costs because it is just natural that \ninfrastructure ought to be somewhat less as we downsize the military, \nboth from the standpoint of personnel and from the standpoint of the \nnumber of bases we have, and a lot of other factors. The fact that we \nreally are not, the point of my amendment is to drive that point home, \nbut also to offer a plan that will allow us to guarantee that when we \nare told that money should be saved, that it is in fact saved.\n  We are in a situation here, Mr. President, where from a political \nstandpoint we ought to have the votes to accomplish what I want to \naccomplish. I do not anticipate that we do. I anticipate that we are in \na long process of educating the people of this country and the Members \nof this body to the fact of what I have already stated, that if we are \ngoing to close bases to save money, somewhere we ought to be able to \nshow the American people that here is X numbers of dollars we saved. \nBecause that is what we were told would happen; if we closed bases, we \nwould save money. But we have had even experts like the General \nAccounting Office audit to identify the savings, and they have issued \nreports that it is not saved.\n  But we are also in a political environment here where--in past years, \nit has been very easy for us to make some points on saving money from \nthe standpoint of my being a conservative Republican. Leading the \nefforts to cut the defense budget or to save money, I would almost have \nthe full support of Members on the Democratic side of the aisle because \nthey were generally of the opinion that Republican Presidents were \nspending too much on defense, even wasting money on defense, so \nfiscally minded Republicans, joining together with Democrats, would \nhave enough votes to actually win the battle and to save the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  But now we have a political situation in the last 3 years where we \nhave a Democrat President and a Republican Congress, and we find people \non the Democratic side of the aisle, even though that President may be \nspending money above and beyond the level he should be doing it as \nCommander in Chief, they seem to be in a position where they want to \nget behind their President even if they might disagree with him on the \namount of money he is spending. So we have a divided Democratic Party \nmore so than usual on the issue of saving defense money.\n  As is typical on this side of the aisle, my Republican side of the \naisle, it seems that there is a willingness just to give more money to \ndefense because somehow by giving more money you get more defense.\n  The point that I try to drive home so often to my colleagues and I \nthink it is legitimate; and I am speaking now just about people in this \nbody who consider\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\nthemselves conservative; and for the most part those are people who are \nalso registered as Republicans and elected to this body as \nRepublicans--is that we are constantly admonishing the other side of \nthe aisle, for decades, that you cannot solve in the typical way \nliberals like to solve problems, throwing money at those problems, and \nsomehow just by spending more money on a lot of social problems, you \nactually solve those problems; and we would always say, ``Well, you \nknow, it's not how much money you spend, but it's how you spend it, and \nhow you invest it, whether or not you're going to get your money's \nworth.''\n\n  We do not seem to have the same caution on this side of the aisle \nwhen it comes to money for defense. We seem to take the attitude that \nif you just put more money in the defense budget, give more money to \nthe Pentagon, somehow you are just automatically going to have more \ndefense.\n  I raise this argument more so at the level of adopting the budget as \nopposed to the defense authorization bill. I suppose that is really a \nbetter place to make that generic argument about more money for defense \nor less money for defense. But I think it is legitimate, when we are \ndealing with a very specific item like infrastructure costs, and \nparticularly when we were told over the last several years that if we \nclose bases we ought to save money, and if we cut down on the number of \npersonnel in the Defense Department we ought to save money, that after \na few years of that argument, you ought to be able to look and say, \n``Yes. We have saved X number of dollars. Here it is.'' I would have \nbelieved it. The General Accounting Office expected to find it. But the \nreports of the General Accounting Office do not confirm those savings.\n  The point is, savings are real things. You ought to be able to see \nthem. My amendment is geared toward the proposition that if there is \ngoing to be savings, we ought to know where those savings are and what \nthey ought to be used for and that, if they are going to still be spent \nin the defense budget and not reduce the deficit, at least we ought to \nknow what they buy. So that is the basis for my amendment.\n  But I will to get into more detail about my amendment, more specifics \nin just a moment. I want to remind my colleagues of the debate we had \non April 15 in this body. It was a very excellent debate on what the \nsize of the defense budget should be. At that point, the budget \nresolution we had before us had already added in an extra $12 billion \nto the budget for defense. That is $12 billion over and above what the \nPresident had recommended that we spend on defense. I opposed that \nmove. I opposed it by offering an amendment to cut back most of that \nmoney. The vote was 57 to 42 against what I was trying to accomplish.\n  The majority rules in this body, and I am willing to accept it. But \nall that extra money then is in the bill before us as a result of the \ndecision that we made on the budget resolution and also the decision of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee to go to the maximum allowed under \nthe budget resolution.\n  Most of this money is for modernization of our military capabilities. \nBut, sadly, an analysis of the bill shows that $12 billion does not buy \nmuch at the Pentagon. That should come as no surprise to people who \nhave been watching the defense budget and how the Defense Department \nhas operated over a long, long period of time. It does not come as any \nsurprise to me.\n  The money has been spread around in so many different areas that all \nwe end up with is a few bits and pieces. If you would take the key area \nof combat aircraft as an example, this is what we get. We get six extra \nF-18's, two extra AV-8B's, four extra F-16's. That is it, 12 more \nfighters. The military needs to buy hundreds of fighters each year to \nmodernize the force. The other areas are not much better. We do get a \nfew extra missiles, a few extra transports, a few extra helicopters. \nBut I might say that we do not get one extra ship for the Navy, as an \nexample.\n\n  Now, all of this added together, I suppose somebody is going to make \na case that it is absolutely needed and it is going to improve and \nmodernize our military considerably. But it seems to me that when you \nsee exactly what we get, then it is not even a reasonable downpayment \non modernization. And $12 billion--of course, when you look at what \nthis bill has for a total expenditure for a year--happens to be peanuts \nat the Pentagon, kind of a drop in the bucket.\n  So this brings me to a point that I have hammered on for years, as I \nindicated, admonishing my colleagues, particularly on the Republican \nside of the aisle, that throwing more money at the Department of \nDefense is not going to solve the problem. We will never succeed in \nmodernizing the force structure at these prices without fundamental \nreform.\n  Now, it happens that there are even outstanding members of the Armed \nServices Committee that have been fighting a long time for fundamental \nreform. I want to commend my colleagues for fighting for fundamental \nreform. I think that fundamental reform is very, very important to make \nsure that whatever extra money we spend--including the $250-some-\nbillion we are going to spend--is invested wisely and we get the most \nbang for the buck. But it seems to me that the reform ought to go ahead \nof the additional $12 billion.\n  We have had some types of reform over the last 15 years. But, again, \nwe think we make some dramatic changes--what we feel are dramatic \nchanges--in the way the Defense Department does business. After you \nlook back at it, you really do not see the changes come about that we \nhad hoped for when we passed the reforms or the reforms that go on \nwithin the Defense Department that can be done without actually passing \nthe legislation.\n  We have had a host of defense reforms, one after the other. But there \ntends to be a big gap between promises and reality. None of these \nreforms have worked completely as advertised. We do not get all of the \ndesired impact that we want to have.\n  Some could even been classified as bureaucratic tricks to cover for \nbusiness as usual. It all leads up to the fact that what the Department \nof Defense needs to do is to find a new way of doing business--a \ncompletely new way of doing business, a new attitude, a new culture \nthere. But, in fact, we really never really get the complete changes \nthat ought to be made so that we get our money's worth when we put \nadditional money in for modernization, or anything else.\n  If we do not get this fundamental reform, I think we still have to \nsay, as good as our Armed Forces are, how much better they could be, \nhow much more we would get for our investment of money if these reforms \nwould really happen. We are talking about changing a basic culture. To \ndo that, you need new ideas and new strategies. Most importantly, you \nneed a disciplined management. You have to find ways to make reforms \nwork--and work now, not later--not in the year 2001.\n  So I am suggesting in the amendment, which I will deposit at the desk \nshortly, a way of making sure that we get real modernization with the \nsavings that we are supposed to get from infrastructure savings. We \nhave already had four rounds of base closures. We have had a shrinking \nforce. This should mean savings in infrastructure accounts. The \nDepartment of Defense has promised these savings, but the savings, as I \nhave indicated, are not there. So promises do not match the reality.\n  My amendment would, hopefully, make the savings real. So this is what \nI propose to do would accomplish that goal. I will give you seven \nspecific objectives of my amendment.\n  The first is to seek to establish a better balance between force \nstructure and infrastructure costs. I will show you, eventually, how \nthere is an imbalance there--an imbalance that does not make sense to \nme, but it is still an imbalance.\n\n  Second, this balance would be brought about and achieved by freezing \nthe infrastructure budget at the fiscal year 1998 level of $145 \nbillion. The freeze would save $10 billion in fiscal year 1998 to the \nyear 2001.\n  Fourth, the Secretary of Defense would transfer the savings to the \nprocurement accounts to pay for modernization. This is the key, then, \nto getting money from savings that we ought to be able to account for \nand get it into modernization, not into overhead. That ought to be \ngoing down; instead, it is going up.\n  The fifth point is that key readiness accounts would be protected. \nThat\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nwould be like for spare parts, training, and a lot of other things like \nthat.\n  Sixth, the savings would be reflected in the future years' defense \nprogram submitted to Congress next year so that we would be able to \nknow what it was and to see it and to have it accounted for.\n  Seventh, we would have the Comptroller General review and verify the \nsavings, so we have somebody outside of the Defense Department, with no \nvested interest, verifying what Defense does, in the sense of just the \naccounting, or being accountable for the money, and not micromanaging \nanything that the Secretary of Defense might do.\n  Now, what is going to be strange to the managers of this bill--both \nRepublican and Democrat--is that I see my goals being 100 percent \nconsistent with the Department of Defense plans. So you take what they \nsay they want to do, which, as I have indicated, is not being done, and \nmake sure that it is done. It seems to me that if there is anyplace for \nthe Congress of the United States to be involved in some detail of the \nDefense Department's work, it is nothing more than to make sure that \nthey do what they say they are going to do, what they report to us they \nare going to do, to kind of make their performance in office \ncommensurate with their rhetoric. That's making them accountable. That \nis perfectly consistent with constitutional oversight functions of the \nCongress of the United States.\n\n  This DOD plan was presented to the Armed Services Committee as \nrecently as March 5, 1996. At that time, Secretary of Defense Perry \ntestified that $10 billion in savings from base closings would be used \nto pay for modernization. A very distinguished member of the Armed \nServices Committee who was just here--and I suppose he is going to \nspeak on my amendment. I am glad to have him engage in this debate. But \nwe know this very distinguished member as a person who is a real hero \nfor the defense of our country as well as being a very good Senator, \nJohn McCain. I am going to say he also agrees. He may stand up here \nshortly and say that he disagrees, but at least I want to give my \nversion of that.\n  He has said that there is a gross imbalance between our military \nforces and the infrastructure. He says we need to eliminate excess \ninfrastructure, we need to save money. He has a white paper on our \nnational defense. That is the way I interpret it. There is just one \nminor problem on what the Secretary of Defense said on March 5 of this \nyear when he was going to take this $10 billion in savings from the \nbase closings and use it for modernization. The savings promised by Mr. \nPerry do not exist. The General Accounting Office just audited those \naccounts. You cannot find any savings. The savings have evaporated into \nthin air.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, on April 25, I spoke about the \nGeneral Accounting Office report on this subject. What I said then I am \ngoing to repeat now. Anybody can read that. It is entitled, ``Defense \nInfrastructure: Budget Estimates for 1996-2001 Offer Little Savings for \nModernization.'' It was published on April 4, just 2 months ago. \nUnfortunately, it was based on the fiscal year 1996 future year defense \nprogram publication.\n  The fiscal year 1996 future year defense program was submitted to \nCongress over a year ago. So I suppose to some extent, as things move \nvery rapidly, it is somewhat out of date. It is at least a year old. I \nthought I should have more current data. I thought that the Pentagon \nbureaucrats might have been able to get their act together since last \nyear. Maybe they succeeded in getting infrastructure costs on the right \ntrack. I think we could legitimately surmise that they should have done \nthat.\n  So not being able to get this information, I wrote to Mr. Bowsher on \nMay 10 of this year asking him to provide me the updated information \ndrawn from the fiscal year 1997 future year defense plan. I thank Mr. \nBowsher and his expert staff, including Mr. Bill Crocker, for working \nso hard and to turn around my request in less than 2 weeks. That is \npretty fast even for a responsible organization like the General \nAccounting Office. It must be a record.\n  I have the General Accounting Office's brandnew report right here \nwith me. It is entitled, ``Defense Infrastructure: Cost Projected To \nIncrease Between 1997 and 2001.'' This is dated May 1996.\n  Before I get started, I think it is important to define \ninfrastructure cost. This is the money that DOD spends to house, train, \nand support the Armed Forces and keep them ready to go. The General \nAccounting Office has provided a brief description in this publication \nof each category of infrastructure costs. The General Accounting Office \nhas also provided a table that shows how infrastructure costs are \nspread across the various appropriations accounts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that material printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Categories of Defense Infrastructure\n\n       Installation support consists of activities that furnish \n     funding, equipment, and personnel to provide facilities from \n     which defense forces operate. Activities include construction \n     planning and design, real property maintenance, base \n     operating support, real estate management for active and \n     reserve bases, family housing and bachelor housing, supply \n     operations, base closure activities, and environmental \n     programs.\n       Acquisition infrastructure consists of all program elements \n     that support program management, program offices, and \n     production support, including acquisition headquarters, \n     science and technology, and test and evaluation resources. \n     This category includes earlier levels of research and \n     development, including basic research, exploratory \n     development, and advanced development.\n       Central logistics consists of programs that provide support \n     to centrally managed logistics organizations, including the \n     management of material, operation of supply systems, \n     maintenance activities, material transportation, base \n     operations and support, communications, and minor \n     construction. This category also includes program elements \n     that provide resources for commissaries and military exchange \n     operations.\n       Central training consists of program elements that provide \n     resources for virtually all non-unit training, including \n     training for new personnel, aviation and flight training, \n     military academies, officer training corps, other college \n     commissioning programs, and officer and enlisted training \n     schools.\n       Central medical consists of programs that furnish funding, \n     equipment, and personnel that provide medical care to active \n     military personnel, dependents, and retirees. Activities \n     provide for all patient care, except for that provided by \n     medical units that are part of direct support units. \n     Activities include medical training, management of the \n     medical system, and support of medical installations.\n       Central personnel consists of all programs that provide for \n     the recruiting of new personnel and the management and \n     support of dependent schools, community, youth, and family \n     centers, and child development activities. Other programs \n     supporting personnel include permanent change of station \n     costs, personnel in transit, civilian disability \n     compensation, veterans education assistance, and other \n     miscellaneous personnel support activities.\n       Command, control, and communications consists of programs \n     that manage all aspects of the command, control, and \n     communications infrastructure for DOD facilities, information \n     support services, mapping and charting products, and security \n     support. This category includes program elements that provide \n     nontactical telephone services, the General Defense \n     Intelligence Program and cryptological activities, the Global \n     Positioning System, and support of air traffic control \n     facilities.\n       Force management consists of all programs that provide \n     funding, equipment, and personnel for the management and \n     operation of all the major military command headquarters \n     activities. Force management also includes program elements \n     that provide resources for defense-wide departmental \n     headquarters, management of international programs, support \n     to other defense organizations and federal government \n     agencies, security investigate services, public affairs \n     activities, and criminal and judicial activities.\n\n                    TABLE 2.--DIRECT INFRASTRUCTURE BY APPROPRIATION, FISCAL YEARS 1997-2001                    \n                                              [Dollars in billions]                                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                  Fiscal year--                 \n                         Appropriation                         -------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  1997      1998      1999      2000      2001  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperation and maintenance.....................................    $56.30    $56.17    $56.41    $57.57    $59.50\n\n[[Page S6389]]\n\n                                                                                                                \nMilitary personnel............................................     33.53     33.10     33.67     34.33     35.20\nResearch, development, test, and evaluation...................     10.47     10.89     11.20     11.43     11.89\nMilitary construction.........................................      4.99      4.15      4.15      3.84      3.96\nFamily housing................................................      3.98      3.84      4.08      4.08      4.12\nProcurement...................................................      2.38      2.53      3.48      3.21      3.46\nRevolving funds and other \\1\\.................................      0.93      1.11      1.06      1.13      1.17\n                                                               -------------------------------------------------\n      Total direct infrastructure \\2\\.........................   $112.58   $111.80   $114.05   $115.61   $119.30\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ These include adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations and service and Defense Logistics Agency managed\n  stock fund cash requirements.                                                                                 \n\\2\\ Totals may not add due to rounding.                                                                         \n                                                                                                                \nSource: GAO analysis of DOS data.                                                                               \n\n\n\n\n                            agency comments\n\n       The data and analysis in this report were provided to DOD \n     for review and comment.

Our \n     analyses are based on data contained in the fiscal year 1997 \n     FYDP. In addition to the FYDP and associated annexes, we \n     reviewed DOD's Reference Manual for Defense Mission \n     Categories, Infrastructure Categories, and Program Elements, \n     prepared in conjunction with the Institute for Defense \n     Analysis. We also reviewed the President's fiscal year 1997 \n     budget submission and our prior reports.\n       Our work was conducted during the month of May 1996 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish I could say, Mr. President, that the Department \nof Defense has turned the corner. I wish I could report that \ninfrastructure costs were coming down. But the latest report of the \nGeneral Accounting Office tells me that nothing has changed since the \nlast future year defense plan, meaning 1996. The trends have to be the \nsame. The Pentagon still has infrastructure costs on the wrong track. \nThey are still on an up-ramp instead of on a down-ramp. This is what \nthe new data show. As the Department of Defense budget top line goes \nup, infrastructure costs go up. Infrastructure costs should come down \neven if the top line goes up. The infrastructure costs ought to be \ndecoupled from the top line. The infrastructure costs need to be \nrecoupled to the force structure because that is what Secretary Perry \nsays is his intent.\n  The infrastructure costs in the military force structures are not in \nsync. They are out of whack. We need to bring them back into balance. \nAs I read what Senator McCain has written in his white paper, he says \nthat is what we must do as well. But that is not what has happened. The \nDepartment of Defense seems to be creating new infrastructure faster \nthan the old stuff is made excess.\n  That is what this new data tells us. This is its new data that the \nGeneral Accounting Office has followed for 1 year that was not \navailable until the General Accounting Office updated it. It shows a \nsteady increase in the infrastructure costs for fiscal year 1997 \nthrough fiscal year 2001.\n  I want to repeat. There is a very steady increase from $146 billion \nin fiscal year 1997. It dips by $1 billion to $145 billion in 1998, but \nthen it goes right back up to $148 billion in 1999; $2 billion more in \nthe year 2000. Then it leaps by $5 billion to $155 billion in the year \n2001. That is a projected increase of $9 billion over the next 5 years. \nIf Congress keeps pumping up the defense budget, these numbers will \nincrease even more.\n  The data portrayed on table 1 of this new General Accounting Office \nreport is particularly troublesome.\n  I also ask unanimous consent at this point to have table 1 printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                TABLE 1.--PROJECTED FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CATEGORIES, FISCAL YEARS 1997-2001               \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Infrastructure categories                       FY 1997  FY 1998  FY 1999  FY 2000  FY 2001\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstallation support...............................................    25.10    23.64    22.68    22.53    23.03\nCentral training...................................................    19.35    19.40    20.08    20.71    21.46\nCentral medical....................................................    15.47    15.82    16.13    16.64    17.38\nCentral logistics..................................................    13.33    13.30    14.18    14.15    14.70\nForce management...................................................    12.91    12.38    13.05    13.12    13.35\nAcquisition infrastructure.........................................    10.25    10.64    10.97    11.19    11.76\nCentral personnel..................................................    10.33    10.24    10.41    10.60    10.83\nCentral command, control, and communications.......................     5.78     5.84     6.05     6.05     6.20\nResource adjustments \\1\\...........................................      .05      .53      .50      .62      .58\n  Total direct infrastructure \\2\\..................................   112.58   111.80   114.05   115.61   119.30\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ These include adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations and service and Defense Logistics Agency managed\n  stock fund cash requirements.                                                                                 \n\\2\\ Totals may not add due to rounding.                                                                         \n                                                                                                                \nSource: GAO analysis of DOD data.                                                                               \n\n       As shown in figure 3 and table 2, most direct \n     infrastructure activities are funded by operation and \n     maintenance and military personnel appropriations. Thus, if \n     DOD is to achieve significant infrastructure savings for \n     future force modernization, the savings must come from these \n     accounts. However, these appropriations have been closely \n     associated with the readiness and quality-of-life of the \n     force, the Secretary of Defense's priority areas for the last \n     few years.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this table breaks the infrastructure \ncosts into nine distinct categories. The new General Accounting Office \ndata shows major increases in every category, with one important \nexception, and that would be installation support. Even installation \nsupport shows increases in the outyears. The four BRAC commissions \nproposed closing 97 bases. Yet, installation support costs are \nprojected to rise. I think it is legitimate to ask why. Is it because \nfew, if any, of those bases have really been closed?\n  The downstream savings promised by base closings and a shrinking \nforce structure should be reflected in these numbers, but they are not. \nWe should be able to identify where the savings are. I do not expect to \nsee any savings. We will not ever see those savings unless we hold the \nDepartment's feet to the fire.\n  A comparison of the numbers in the fiscal year 1996 future year \ndefense plan with the numbers in the 1997 future year defense plan \nsuggests that installation support figures on table 1 are misleading. \nThat comparison reveals a shocking trend. That comparison suggests that \nbase support costs will actually increase by $1 billion per year \nbetween the years 1997 and the year 2001.\n  Take fiscal year 1997 just for example. The fiscal year 1997 column \nin the 1996 future year defense plan shows installation costs at $23.96 \nbillion.\n  Then if you go over to the fiscal year 1997 column, in the the 1997 \nfuture year defense plan, the number goes up to $25.1 billion. That is \nan increase of $1.14 billion in 1 year in projected installation \nsupport. The next year it is the same thing. The number goes from \n$22.76 billion up to $23.64 billion, and that is an increase of $900 \nmillion.\n  I need to clarify one point about the numbers. The numbers on the \ntable that I have submitted for the Record do not match up with the \ntotals for the infrastructure costs that I used a moment ago, and there \nis a reason for that discrepancy. About $35 billion in infrastructure \ncosts get lost in what we refer to as DBOF--that stands for Defense \nbusiness operation fund--each year. We know the money is in there \nsomeplace, but the General Accounting Office cannot track it because \ndollars in the Defense business operation fund are not identified in \nthe future year defense program.\n  And so I think it is very ironic because DBOF was established to \nimprove cost accounting at the Pentagon. In fact, that was the whole \nidea about DBOF. Here is $35 billion in annual DOD costs that cannot be \ntracked because of the Defense business operation fund. We cannot audit \nthem because of the fund. The fund is an obstacle to accurate cost \naccounting.\n  There is yet another problem. That problem is that the Department of \nDefense had a $4 billion plug figure in last year's numbers, and they \npulled it out of the new future year defense plan,\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\nmaking it look as if some of the funding levels were coming down. The \nDepartment of Defense said the $4 billion that was plugged in for last \nyear was miscoded. The miscoded dollars were pulled out of the \ninfrastructure costs and, in a sense, just heaved overboard. I suppose \nsomebody could say they were transferred to another part of the future \nyear defense plan, but if they cannot be tracked, no one knows.\n  That makes me think they are kind of phony numbers.\n  In a nutshell, Mr. President, that is what is in this latest report \nof the General Accounting Office on defense infrastructure. I hope my \ncolleagues will take this as I have referred to it for several minutes \nhere, taking statistics from it, to make a case for my amendment that I \nwill offer.\n  This latest report, I think, states for another year that Mr. Perry's \npromised savings are nowhere in sight. His $60 billion modernization \nplan then is, if the savings are not available, hung out to dry. It is \ndead in the water.\n  And so I come here pleading with my colleagues that Congress needs to \nhelp Mr. Perry. Without a doubt, reason is on his side.\n  On March 5, he presented to the Congress of the United States through \nthe Armed Services Committee that there is going to be x amount of \nsavings, and this is the resource for modernization. That all makes \nsense, right? But is it going to happen? With an increase in \ninfrastructure costs and overhead, it is going to be eaten up someplace \nelse. The modernization that we think we are planning on being there is \nnot going to materialize. In fact, at the beginning of my time today I \npointed out how little we actually get for modernization when you look \nat the materiel that is purchased.\n  So I cannot come here and condemn Mr. Perry for not having good \nintent and a plan that he thinks will accomplish what he wants to \naccomplish. But it just is not going to happen. So my amendment would \nmake sure that money finds its way into modernization and not into this \noverhead and infrastructure cost where it is going to inevitably end up \nbecause four rounds of base closings and a shrinking force structure \nshould be producing substantial savings. Because it should be producing \nsubstantial savings, we ought to identify those savings and reserve \nthem for the purpose that Mr. Perry suggested. He wants to recover \nthose savings to pay for modernization. And so unless we freeze these \naccounts, the savings are going to be frittered away on new \ninfrastructure projects. My amendment will help Mr. Perry do what he \nsays must be done.\n  I send my amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4047.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FORCE MODERNIZATION FUNDED BY REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING \n                   FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Funding Freeze at Programmed Level for Fiscal Year \n     1998.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the total \n     amount expended for infrastructure programs for each of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2001 does not exceed \n     $145,000,000,000.\n       (b) Use of Savings for Force Modernization.--The Secretary \n     of Defense shall take the actions necessary to program for \n     procurement for force modernization for the fiscal years \n     referred to in subsection (a) the amount of the savings in \n     expenditures for infrastructure programs that is derived from \n     actions taken to carry out that subsection.\n       (c) Protection of Program for Spare Parts and Training.--In \n     formulating the future-years defense programs to be submitted \n     to Congress in fiscal year 1997 (for fiscal year 1998 and \n     following fiscal years), fiscal year 1998 (for fiscal year \n     1999 and following fiscal years), fiscal year 1999 (for \n     fiscal year 2000 and following fiscal years), and fiscal year \n     2000 (for fiscal year 2001 and following fiscal years), the \n     Secretary shall preserve the growth in programmed funding for \n     spare parts and training for fiscal years 1998 through 2001 \n     that is provided in the future-years defense program that was \n     submitted to Congress in fiscal year 1996.\n       (d) Reductions To Be Shown in Fiscal year 1998 Future-Years \n     Defense Program.--The future-years defense program submitted \n     to Congress in fiscal year 1997 shall reflect the programming \n     for the reduction in expenditures for infrastructure programs \n     that is necessary to carry out subsection (a) and the \n     programming for force modernization that is required by \n     subsection (b).\n       (e) GAO Review of Fiscal Year 1998 Future-Years Defense \n     Program.--The Comptroller General shall review the future-\n     years defense program referred to in subsection (c) and, not \n     later than May 1, 1997, submit to Congress a report regarding \n     compliance with that subsection. The report shall include a \n     discussion of the extent, if any, to which the compliance is \n     deficient or cannot be ascertained.\n       (f) Infrastructure Programs Defined.--For the purposes of \n     this section, infrastructure programs are programs of the \n     Department of Defense that are composed of activities that \n     provide support services for mission programs of the \n     Department of Defense and operate primarily from fixed \n     locations. Infrastructure programs include program elements \n     in the following categories:\n       (1) Acquisition infrastructure.\n       (2) Installation support.\n       (3) Central command, control, and communications.\n       (4) Force management.\n       (5) Central logistics.\n       (6) Central medical.\n       (7) Central personnel.\n       (8) Central training.\n       (9) Resource adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations \n     and Defense Logistics Agency managed stock fund cash \n     requirements.\n       (g) Future--Years Defense Program Defined.--As used in this \n     section, the term ``future-years defense program'' means the \n     future-years defense program submitted to Congress pursuant \n     to section 221 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I should like to inquire of the \ndistinguished Senator if he is willing to enter into a time agreement \non this amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. You propose one, and then I will respond after it is \nproposed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would suggest maybe 20 minutes to a side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, that is agreeable.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Grassley amendment be limited to 40 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form and that no amendments be in order, and that following the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to the manager of the bill, I would like to yield \nthe floor now and listen to the opposition to my amendment before I \nspeak again.\n  Mr. THURMOND. As I understand, the Senator is willing to agree to 40 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. We have already agreed to that. So I have 20 \nminutes that I control and you have 20 minutes that you control.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator would be so kind, I would like to have \nhim use some of his 20 minutes so I can hear the opposition to my \namendment, and then I would like to respond to that.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will be glad to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. If the Senate votes to pass this provision and it is \neventually signed into law, it could have a serious negative impact on \nthe readiness of our military forces.\n  Like my good friend, the Senator from Iowa, I am concerned about the \namount of money that the Department of Defense annually expends for \ninfrastructure. In fact, the Defense authorization bill that we are \nconsidering now and is before us, reduces such programs by \napproximately $600 million and allocates these funds for higher \npriority programs including force modernization.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we should carefully examine any \nreduction that is proposed in order to ensure that we do not adversely \nimpact our military forces. I am sure that my fellow Senators will \nagree with me when\n\n[[Page S6391]]\n\nI say that we do not want to jeopardize our national security or the \nmen and women in uniform who protect that security.\n  With this in mind, I must inform my colleagues that the proposed \namendment could force severe funding reductions to important programs \nsuch as the medical care of military personnel, military housing, and \nmilitary intelligence activities. Are we sure we can reduce these \nprograms without negatively impacting upon military readiness?\n  Does the Senator from Iowa really believe that we should reduce such \nprograms? Does he want to deny health care to our men and women in \nuniform? Does he want to force the families of military personnel to \nlive in substandard housing? Mr. President, I cannot speak for every \nMember of this Chamber, but I know that I cannot support such \nreductions.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that we must look \nfor new and innovative management practices in order to find ways to \nshift funds from the infrastructure accounts to the modernization \naccounts. However, we must be sure that the shifting of such funds does \nnot significantly impair military readiness. Reducing funds for \nunnecessary infrastructure is a task which the Armed Services Committee \nperforms each year during its markup of the Defense Authorization Act \nand, as I have already noted, this year we reduced such funds by $600 \nmillion. In addition, the bill before us today includes a provision \nthat would require the Department to examine new ways of maintaining \nits forces in order to further reduce funding required for day-to-day \noperations, and make these funds available for force modernization.\n  Mr. President, I cannot advocate, nor agree to support, an arbitrary \ncut such as that advocated by this amendment. We must preserve the \nflexibility of the President and the Secretary of Defense to request \nwhat they believe is necessary to ensure our national security. If the \nCongress disagrees with this request, it can authorize and appropriate \na different mix of funding.\n  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators to vote ``no'' on the \nGrassley amendment.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to the able Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa who \ncontinues to be a persistent, constructive critic of defense issues, \nespecially in the area of spending. I think this GAO report is a good \none and should have a sobering effect on our defense planners, who \nsomehow believe and support a precept that I have long questioned, and \nthat is that base closings and other savings are going to support the \nmodernization of the force.\n  The Senator from Iowa, I think, through his efforts, and also that of \nthis GAO report, points out clearly that there are not going to be \nsavings. In fact, according to this GAO study--which I must say needs \nto be fleshed out, I am sure my colleague from Iowa would agree--it \nshows there is going to be an increase in cost.\n  Just one example of that, one of the clear reasons for that, is the \nbase closing issue. We believed for a long time there would be enormous \nsavings associated with base closures. Those bases needed to be closed. \nMore need to be closed. But the fact is we are not realizing those \nsavings. In fact, the opposite has been the case. Rather than sell the \nvaluable land on which these bases reside, we give it away to the local \ncommunity. We are finding more and more toxic waste sites and areas of \npollution that need to be cleaned up, and anyone who has ever had any \ncontact with that issue knows that the costs rapidly spiral in a \ndramatic fashion when you are talking about cleanups. In fact, as the \nSenator from Iowa points out, these costs have been much higher, much, \nmuch higher than we had originally estimated.\n  The Senator from Iowa was kind enough to make reference to the white \npaper that I did concerning tiered readiness, and this GAO report and \nhis amendment highlight the absolute criticality of making the kind of \nhard choices which we are not making today because there is no possible \nway we are going to maintain the level of readiness, operations, and \ntraining of our Armed Forces and at the same time modernize the force.\n  We have a Hobson's choice, because the money simply is not there and, \nas the Senator from Iowa correctly points out, much less money is there \nthan even we had envisioned. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nhas stated on numerous occasions that we need about $60 billion for the \npurchase of modernization. We have, the last number I saw, was about \n$30 billion.\n  Having said all those things, I still have to disagree with this \namendment. One reason is because of its scope. For example, the \namendment calls for reductions in spending for such programs as health \ncare, personnel, and training. I do not see how you can impose \narbitrary cuts on those programs. One of the aspects that we are most \nproud of in the military today is the quality of life, that is, the \nquality of young men and women that we have been able to attract and \nkeep in the military. I am not sure that we could maintain that if we \njust, across the board, forced certain cuts without designating where \nthey should be.\n  I want to emphasize that I believe we are spending money in ways that \nare really not appropriate. In this year's bill we added some $600 \nmillion in military construction that was not needed. We add two new \noceanographic ships for $99.4 million. We have added $13 million to \nfund a new bureaucracy in the case of civilian research in \noceanography. We are going to add on $15 million for the High Frequency \nActive Aural Research Program. This program has benefited from \ncongressional add-ons since 1990, costing a total of $76 million in \njust 7 years, with another $115 million required. We continue to \npurchase B-2 bombers. In this bill we included an additional $759 \nmillion in the National Guard and Reserve equipment account, plus as \nmuch as $242 million in additional unrequested equipment earmarked for \nthe Guard and Reserve in the regular service procurement accounts. \nWithin this amount is $284 million for six unrequested C-140J aircraft \nfor the Guard and Reserve, a tactical airlift aircraft that the Air \nForce has not yet been able to afford.\n\n  Mr. President, the list goes on and we are spending money that we \nshould not spend. We have lost sight of the fundamental reason why we \nspend money on defense, and that is to defend the security of the \nNation.\n  I strongly suggest to my friend from Iowa that there are different \nways of doing this. I look forward to working with him on this. I will \nhave a couple of amendments that I hope will impose some savings. I am \ntold there will be some additional military construction projects which \nwill be attempted to be added to the bill here on the floor. I hope my \ncolleague from Iowa will help me in trying to defeat those, although I \nam not totally optimistic about chances of success.\n  But, as I oppose the amendment, I thank my colleague from Iowa \nbecause the fact is that the American people are losing confidence that \ntheir tax dollars that are earmarked for defense are being spent \nwisely. If that continued erosion reaches its logical conclusion, \nsooner or later we are going to reach a point where the American people \nwill not support sufficient funding to meet our vital national security \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  First of all, I accept Senator McCain's offer to work with him on \nthis issue, because I am very impressed with the intent of his white \npaper and his first-hand knowledge of the military, being the military \nhero that he is and serving our country so well and being on the Armed \nServices Committee and his expertise in that area. So whether my \namendment is adopted or not, I accept the offer to work with Senator \nMcCain.\n  I would, first of all, like to respond to some specific points both \nSenator Thurmond and Senator McCain raised, but also to give an example \nfrom military persons themselves about what\n\n[[Page S6392]]\n\nneeds to be done about infrastructure costs and his frustration that \ninfrastructure costs have not gone down.\n  First of all, on the legitimacy of questioning whether my amendment \nis going to hurt funding for command and control and for medical \nsupport, it will not, but it seems to me, without my saying it, common \nsense ought to dictate that a shrinking force structure and fewer \nmilitary bases should reduce command and control and medical \nrequirements.\n  My amendment would, in fact, just freeze; it would not reduce. It \nwould reduce increases, yes, but there are no cuts that come as a \nresult of my amendment. Increasing infrastructure costs are \ninconsistent with the philosophy behind the base closure process. My \namendment would hold the Department of Defense infrastructure costs at \n$145 billion per year. Now, remember, this is, as we are, in a process \nof closing bases and reducing the number of personnel connected with \ndefense.\n  It seems to me that the Department of Defense needs to address the \ncritical shortfalls and allocate money to meet the highest priorities \nwithin the infrastructure accounts. At this point in the base closure \nprocess and at this point in the reduction of personnel, infrastructure \nshould not be on the rise.\n  We need to make sure that we eliminate the excess infrastructure and \nthat we save the money that Secretary Perry promised, not just for the \nsake of saving money, but Secretary Perry says that is money that we \nare going to use for modernization. If it goes to infrastructure costs, \nwhich are going up, it is not going to go for modernization.\n  It was also suggested that my amendment might harm training and \nreadiness, but very specifically I want to address that issue. \nSubsection (C) of my amendment specifically protects key readiness \naccounts, including training and spare parts.\n  I now want to refer to some remarks that were made by Marine Maj. \nGen. John Sheehan. He is the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic \nCommand. I think he made some very pertinent remarks, a person in the \nmilitary, a person in command who views how the taxpayers' dollars are \nbeing used every day. If you do not want to listen to a civilian's \npoint of view, like the Senator from Iowa has a civilian point of view, \nit seems to me that we ought to pay some attention to those who are in \nthe military, because General Sheehan offers some very real insight.\n  His insights were given at a June 6 breakfast hosted by the \nAssociation of the U.S. Army's Institute for Land Warfare. I have \nexcerpts of his comments from a trade journal called Inside the \nPentagon. It was in the June 13 issue, page 20.\n  In a nutshell, this is what General Sheehan said:\n\n       The overflow of staff organizations within the Department \n     of Defense consumes too many personnel and resources and puts \n     the force structure at risk.\n\n  That is a major general who said that.\n  Opponents of my amendment say it is going to put certain aspects, \nlike readiness and training and command and control and medical \ntreatment, in jeopardy. Here is a major general who says what we are \ndoing now, if we maintain the status quo, is putting our force \nstructure at risk. Of course, he is talking about the Department of \nDefense infrastructure. This is what General Sheehan had to say:\n\n       There is a debate that's being formed right now, where the \n     only sides in the debate are modernization versus force \n     structure. . .\n\n  He says:\n\n       My argument says we ought to take a very serious top-down \n     look at the overhead costs of doing business.\n\n  He asked:\n\n       Why do we have so many headquarters? Of what value are \n     they?\n\n  The general has identified one of the big drivers in infrastructure \ncosts, and he has identified them as excess headquarters and excess \ncommands. General Sheehan says:\n\n       We have too many excess headquarters and too many commands.\n\n  So he has put his finger on one of the root causes of the problem.\n  He pinpoints the problem, and I want to quote from his report. He \nsays:\n\n       There are 199 DOD staff organizations of two-star level or \n     above, and the number has not changed since 1989.\n\n  I say, parenthetically, that is about the time the Berlin Wall came \ndown.\n  His 1989 benchmark is important because the force has shrunk 30 to 40 \npercent since that time. So, headquarters should shrink as the force \ngets smaller, but headquarters are not shrinking.\n  As an example, he cited the U.S. Army in Europe with its 23 staff \nechelons to command only 65,000 soldiers. He also cited the U.S. \nSouthern Command as another example of a top-heavy organization.\n  General Sheehan raised this provocative question:\n\n       Why is it, for example, that you have SOUTHCOM with 770 \n     officers commanding less than 4,000 men?\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, listen to what General Sheehan \nsays:\n\n       Why is it that you have SOUTHCOM with 770 officers \n     commanding less than 4,000 people?\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       There are still 65 NATO headquarters with over 21,000 staff \n     officers sitting around doing paperwork. That's more staff \n     officers than two NATO nations have in land forces.\n\n  We have more people doing paperwork than two NATO nations have in \ntheir land forces.\n  So you have to ask yourself.\n  General Sheehan says--\n\n       . . . of $1.79 billion we invest in NATO on burdensharing, \n     why is $800 million of that just for infrastructure?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 more minutes. I know \nthat is all the time I have, but I think what General Sheehan says is \nvery important.\n  General Sheehan has hit the nail on the head, and this is his main \nargument:\n\n       Bloated staff organizations have created a demand for \n     personnel that can starve warfighting units into hollowness.\n\n  A hollow fighting unit like we had in the late 1970's, in other \nwords.\n  Bloated command staffs and headquarters are an outgrowth of top-heavy \nrank. In other words, General Sheehan is saying, we have excess \nadmirals and generals, and each one needs a home, and every senior \nofficer needs a command, a headquarters, a base, a staff, or a large \ndepartment of some kind, somewhere, someplace to look over.\n  Take the Navy, for example. At the height of World War II, the Navy \nhad 6,768 ships. Those 6,768 ships were commanded by 333 admirals. That \nis one admiral for about 20 ships. Today's 363-ship Navy is commanded \nby 218 admirals. That is almost one admiral for every ship. To be \nprecise, it is one and two-thirds ships per admiral.\n  General Sheehan is wrestling with this problem, and doing it from the \nstandpoint of a person serving his country, in uniform, on the line \nwhere the money is being spent--or should we say, on the line where the \nmoney is being wasted.\n  He told the audience that he is searching for technical solutions to \nthe problems of swollen staff organizations. This is what he had to \nsay:\n\n       What is needed are systems that can help reduce the \n     overhead costs for commanding large forces. With all this \n     technology and smarts running around, why aren't we more \n     efficient?\n\n  That is a question that every Senator ought to ask before he votes \nfor this bill.\n  In other words, General Sheehan has made an excellent case for \ncutting infrastructure costs.\n  The military today is top-heavy with rank and staff organizations and \ncommand headquarters left over from the cold war. That is the official \nword from the commander of the United States Atlantic Command. That is \na pretty good authority.\n  General Sheehan has clearly identified the culprit. He obviously \nunderstands the problem. And he is also frustrated by his inability to \nget rid of his own excess command fat.\n  We know that the Department of Defense cannot do it, so we need to \nhelp them. So if you vote for my amendment, you will help General \nSheehan do what he says he sees is necessary to get more bang for their \ndefense dollar.\n  He put it this way:\n\n       Nobody likes to cut their own staff.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I've never seen a butcher hand a pig a cleaver and say, \n     ``Go make pork chops.''\n\n\n[[Page S6393]]\n\n\n  So Congress needs to lend a helping hand to people like General \nSheehan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this report about \nGeneral Sheehan's speech printed in the Record, the article from Inside \nthe Pentagon.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From Inside the Pentagon, June 13, 1996]\n\n     Atlantic Commander Criticizes Profusion of Staff Organizations\n\n                         (By Douglas Berenson)\n\n       Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan, commander-in-chief of the \n     U.S. Atlantic Command; last week decried the profusion of \n     staff organizations within the Department of Defense, arguing \n     they consume too many personnel and resources, and therefore \n     put at risk already strained force structure. Sheehan, who \n     has previously targeted the top-heavy command structure of \n     the NATO alliance (Inside the Pentagon, Sept. 21, 1995, pl), \n     offered his remarks at a June 6 breakfast hosted by the \n     Association of the U.S. Army's Institute for Land Warfare.\n       ``There is a debate that's being formed right now, where \n     the only sides are in the debate [are] modernization versus \n     force structure. My argument says we ought to take a very \n     serious top-down look at the overhead costs of doing \n     business. Why do we have so many headquarters? Of what value \n     are they?'' Sheehan asked.\n       Sheehan noted that within the Department of Defense, there \n     are 199 staff organizations of two-star level of above, a \n     number that has not changed since 1989. As an example, he \n     cited the fact that the U.S. Army in Europe has 23 staff \n     echelons to command 65,000 soldiers. He said that U.S. \n     Southern Command offered another example of a top-heavy \n     organization. ``Why is it, for example, that you have \n     SOUTHCOM [with] 770 officers commanding less than 4,000 \n     men?'' he wondered.\n       He argued that these bloated staff organizations have \n     created a demand for personnel that can starve warfighting \n     units into hollowness. ``Why is it that the Bradley fighting \n     vehicle spends so much time in gunnery when you go into the \n     field? Why is it you don't spend more time in the integration \n     of operations of the rifle unit coming out the back [of the \n     Bradley]? It's because of this process,'' Sheehan said, \n     noting that Bradley infantry squads are often fielded at \n     lower than their optimum strength.\n       Sheehan argued that the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio has become \n     badly skewed against the warfighter, such that, ``we field in \n     the entire Army 125,000 killers.'' The rest of the force is \n     made up of support and staff personnel, he said. Sheehan \n     warned that the staff non-commissioned officer corps is being \n     decimated, and that as the services focus on freeing up money \n     to spend on force modernization, they are ``forcing great \n     people out of the system.''\n       Sheehan noted that Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer \n     has been working to streamline the Army's structure in \n     response to these problems. ``Dennis Reimer has to be allowed \n     to go after the European staff structure. He has got to be \n     allowed to go after the SOUTHCOM staff structure and take \n     some of that staff structure out to keep combat capability.''\n       Sheehan warned that ``the next organization to go is the \n     2nd ACR [Armored Cavalry Regiment]. That would be a travesty. \n     We need light, mobile attack type forces with a protected gun \n     system for the battlefield of the future.''\n       ``Nobody likes to cut their own staff,'' Sheehan observed, \n     quipping, ``I've never seen a butcher hand a pig a cleaver \n     and say, `Go make pork chops.'''\n       Sheehan appealed to the assembled audience to help find \n     technical solutions to the problem of swollen staff \n     organizations. What is needed, he said, are systems that can \n     help reduce the overhead costs for commanding large forces. \n     ``With all this technology and smarts running around, why \n     aren't we more efficient?''\n       As he has in the past, Sheehan levelled similar criticism \n     against the NATO command structure. In addition to his \n     responsibilities as U.S. Atlantic Command chief, Sheehan \n     serves simultaneously as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO's \n     Atlantic Command. ``As a major NATO commander, my main \n     complaint against my NATO allies is that many of these \n     countries took their force structure out and took a peace \n     dividend without reinvesting in the future. [But] they didn't \n     take the overhead out . . .\n       ``There are still 65 NATO headquarters, with over 21,000 \n     staff officers sitting around doing paperwork,'' Sheehan \n     continued. ``That's more staff officers than two NATO nations \n     have land forces. And so you ask yourself, of $1.79 billion \n     we invest in NATO on a burdensharing basis, why is $800 \n     million of that just in infrastructure?''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

She is employed with the Center for \nDemocracy and is working as a staff fellow in my office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on my behalf \nand on behalf of Senators Leahy, Harkin, and Bumpers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4048\n\n(Purpose: To reduce to the level requested by the President the amount \n  authorized to be appropriated for research, development, test, and \n                evaluation for national missile defense)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4048.\n       On Page 31, strike out line 2 and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``$9,362,542,000, of which--\n       ``(A) $508,437,000 is authorized for national missile \n     defense;''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that would \nreduce, by $300 million, the amount of money authorized in this piece \nof legislation for national missile defense.\n  For those who do not know much about this process and have not been \ninvolved in the lexicon of Defense issues, the national missile \ndefense, or Defend America, or antiballistic missile system, or Star \nWars, all relates to a system that some say is needed to be built in \norder to defend America against incoming attacks from missiles launched \nby a potential adversary, ICBM's that would be launched by a rogue \nnation, or ICBM's that are launched accidentally. All of these are \ndescribed as threats to our country, and it is proposed by a number of \nMembers of the Congress, and others, that we should build a defense \nsystem against them.\n  Now, if I were to provide a chart to the Senate that showed an array \nof the threats against our country, the threats would range all over \nthe board. The threats against our country would be, for example: A \nterrorist who fills a rental truck with a fertilizer bomb and drives it \nin front of a courthouse or Federal building in Oklahoma and murders \nscores and scores of American citizens. A threat against our country \nmight be not a fertilizer bomb in a rental truck, but perhaps a small \nglass vial of the deadliest biological agents\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nknown to mankind, placed in a subway strategically, killing thousands \nand thousands of people. A threat to our country perhaps would be a \nsuitcase bomb, or a nuclear device no bigger than the size of a \nsuitcase put in the trunk of a Yugo car and left at a dock in New York \nCity to hold hostage an entire city. Another threat might be a nuclear \ndevice on the tip of an incoming cruise missile launched by air, \nground, or sea, by a potential adversary. Another threat might be a \nfull-scale nuclear attack by an adversary, with dozens or scores of \nincoming missiles, ICBM's, or cruise missiles for that matter. Another \nthreat might be that some rogue nation, some international outlaw on \nthe scene, gets ahold of an ICBM and launches one intercontinental \nballistic missile at our country tipped with a nuclear warhead. Or \nanother might be simply an accidental launch of someone who possesses \nan ICBM with a nuclear warhead.\n  All of these are potential threats to our country. They are not new \nthreats. These threats have existed for some long while. In fact, a \nmuch greater threat existed some years ago than the ones I have just \ndescribed, and the greater threat was hundreds and hundreds and \nhundreds of missiles in the ground, in silos, armed with multiple \nwarheads, aimed at American cities, aimed at American military targets, \nall poised and ready to be fired by a potential adversary called the \nSoviet Union.\n  The Soviet Union does not exist any longer. The Soviet Union was \nfractured into a series of independent states--the Ukraine, Russia, and \nothers--in which there were missiles with nuclear warheads targeted at \nthe United States. But a series of arms control agreements with the old \nSoviet Union, and now with the independent states, has changed that \nmuch larger threat. It has not erased the threat, but it has changed \nthe much larger threat. Arms control agreements now mean that Soviet \nmissiles that used to be aimed at our country in many cases no longer \nexist.\n  Mr. President, I showed this piece of metal on a previous occasion. I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to show it to my colleagues \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece from a hinge on the \nmassive door that covered missile silo No. 110, in Pervomaysk, Ukraine. \nThis comes from a silo that housed an SS-19, which had half a dozen \nwarheads aimed at the United States of America. Each of those warheads \nhad a yield of 550 kilotons each, 20 times the power of the atomic bomb \ndropped on Hiroshima.\n  I want to show my colleagues a chart that describes something that I \nthink is quite remarkable. This is that missile site, which housed \nmissile No. 110. On June 5 of this year, this photo shows the Ukrainian \nDefense Minister Shmarov on the left and his U.S. counterpart, \nSecretary Perry, watering sunflowers planted in the ground where there \nuse to be a Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile. In other words, \nit is where there previously existed a missile with nuclear warheads \naimed at America, and there now are sunflowers growing. The silo is \ngone, the missile is gone, and there are sunflowers.\n  How did this happen? Was this a magic act? Was Harry Houdini \ninvolved? No. This happened through a great deal of diligent, hard \nwork. Some of it was here in the Senate, which approved the arms \ncontrol agreements that were negotiated between the United States and \nthe Soviet Union. Substantial credit, in my judgment, should go to \nSenators Lugar and Nunn, who worked to create the Cooperative Threat \nReduction program, which funds the dismantling of nuclear weapons in \nthe former Soviet states. The Soviets, the Russians and Ukrainians now, \nbegan destroying nuclear weapons.\n  That destruction of nuclear weapons means that one way to protect \nAmerica is to destroy a foreign missile before it leaves the silo; \ndestroy the missile before it leaves the silo. This chart shows what \nhappened. There used to be a missile. Now there are sunflowers. What a \nwonderful thing for humankind--that a missile that used to be aimed at \nus is now gone. This bit of hinge does not exist as a functional piece \nof some kind of nuclear threat against the United States. It is not \njust missiles that Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn have through their \ninitiative in the U.S. Senate helped to destroy. Here is a picture of \nSoviet workers sawing off the wings of Soviet long-range bombers. This \nis success. Arms control agreements have worked. They have \nsubstantially reduced the nuclear threat. We are today every day seeing \nin the old Soviet Union--now Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan--missiles \nbeing destroyed, bombers being destroyed, and the world is a safer \nplace as a result.\n  Some would come to the floor of the Senate and say, ``None of this \nmatters very much.'' The hundreds of ICBM's that are now gone do not \nmatter much. The fact that the President of Ukraine announced that his \ncountry, which had previously housed thousands of nuclear warheads, is \nnow nuclear free; no nuclear warheads in the Ukraine is quite a \nremarkable thing. Some would come to the floor of the Senate, and say, \n``That does not mean much. What we need to do is begin a new arms race. \nWe need an America to begin building on an expedited basis with \nexpedited deployment a National Missile Defense Program. And we insist \non doing it in a way that would make it a multiple-site system, in a \nway that would provide that it has a space-based component,'' both of \nwhich would jeopardize the arms control agreements we currently have. \nAnd they say, ``Well, if we jeopardize those arms control agreements, \nso be it. We will force the other parties to renegotiate.''\n  I am not coming to the floor of the Senate saying that research and \ndevelopment on missile defense programs are not relevant or unworthy. I \nhave supported them in the past. I support them today. The \nadministration requested $508 million in this bill for research and \ndevelopment on national missile defense systems and programs.\n  In fact, if taxpayers are interested we have spent $98 billion on \nstrategic and theater missile defense programs; $98 billion. The most \nrecent proposal that was brought to the Senate for its consideration, \nthe Congressional Budget Office says, will cost anywhere between $30 \nbillion and $60 billion to construct without regard to the cost of its \noperation. That is what it will cost simply to build on an expedited \nbasis the kind of national missile defense that was called the Defend \nAmerica Program that the sponsors envision.\n  I support the recommendation of the Pentagon to spend $508 million \nfor research and development of a national missile defense system. What \nI do not support is the Congress saying, ``Pentagon, you do not know \nwhat you are talking about. We insist on adding $300 million more.''\n  Let me read a comment from the Vice Chiefs of Staff in the Joint \nRequirements Oversight Council. It says:\n\n       The Joint Requirements Oversight Council believes that with \n     the current projected ballistic missile threat, which shows \n     Russia and China as the only countries able to field a threat \n     against the U.S. homeland, the funding level for national \n     missile defense should be no more than $500 million a year \n     through the Future Years Defense Plan.\n\n  That is what the Joint Requirements Oversight Council says. One might \nargue they are not experts. I do not know how one could credibly argue \nthat. They are the Vice Chiefs of Staff of our Armed Services. But one \ncould make that case and try to make that point. These are the people \nwho ought to know, in my judgment.\n  General Shalikashvili in a letter to Senator Nunn says the following:\n\n       Efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from the ABM \n     Treaty may jeopardize Russia's ratification of START II, \n     and could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I.\n\n  These are the arms control agreements that resulted in taking these \nmissiles and warheads out of the ground and reducing the threat posed \nto the United States of America.\n  General Shalikashvili says the following. He says:\n\n       I am concerned that failure of either START initiative will \n     result in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands \n     more nuclear weapons thereby increasing both the cost and the \n     risks that we face.\n\n  We will hear no doubt, especially when the Defend America Act comes \nback to the Senate, if it does--and I cast a vote on that recently. \nThis was a bill to potentially require $30 to $60 billion of \nexpenditure on the part of the taxpayers--just to build, not to \noperate. It is not the right way in my\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\njudgment to do it. But that was the vote we had. Of course, I voted \nagainst cloture because, if we are going to have a debate on this, \nthere ought to be a debate. There ought to be a thorough and lengthy \ndebate. It is of substantial importance for this country, its foreign \npolicy, its defense policy, and certainly for the taxpayers.\n  We will no doubt have comments made here--I do not intend to address \nthese at the moment, although I would be happy to come back and do so--\nthat reflect the comments we heard last year during the same debate. We \nwill have maps put up talking about the threat that North Korea could \npose to Alaska, or the threat that some other rogue nation would pose \nto Hawaii. Those statements are not justified by the facts. Those are \nnot threats that are currently justified by information given by this \ncountry's intelligence community.\n  It seems to me that we ought to worry a bit about how we are spending \nmoney, for what purpose we are spending money, and where we are going \nto get the money. This $300 million is the first incremental first step \non a long staircase. And we had a quote from Senator Dole at a press \nconference. The question was asked where the money was going to come \nfrom. ``Senator, how much do you think this is going to cost, and where \nis that money going to come from?''\n  The answer: ``Well, I'll leave that up to the experts.''\n  The experts are not going to pay the bill. The taxpayer will pay this \nbill--$300 million this year, a long step on a long staircase leading \nup to the Congressional Budget Office suggesting as much as $60 \nbillion.\n  In the main, this is a security issue. I accept that and agree to \ndebate it on that premise. But it is also an issue that combines the \nquestion of security with the question of, ``What is it going to \ncost?'' Well, it is reasonable to ask: How much did we spend, and how \nmuch are we going to spend to get a system? What kind of protection \nwill it provide us?\n  In North Dakota, we have some experience with this. We have in my \nState the only antiballistic missile system that was ever built in the \nfree world. In today's dollars, they have spent about $26 billion. It \nlooks a little like this. It is a big concrete pyramid. It was \nincidentally mothballed in the same year that it was declared \noperational. That was built in the early 1970's with billions of \ntaxpayers' money spent.\n  I mentioned that somewhere between $96 and $98 billion was spent in \nthe aggregate in pursuit of missile defense technology. I also said I \nam not opposed to spending all of the money but that I am opposed to \nthis rush to add extra money to this defense authorization bill. And I \nwill be opposed to adding the money to the appropriations bill as \nwell--to demand that we have accelerated deployment in a system that we \nare told will cost up to $60 billion, and the accelerated deployment \nmust be combined with a multisite system, and a space-based system \nthat, in my judgment, will jeopardize most of our arms control \nagreements, agreements that I think are critically important to this \ncountry.\n  I would say this to my friends who support this--and I have great \nrespect for many who will stand up and support this aggressively: \nSenator Kyl has in the past, Senator Inhofe and others. I suspect the \nSenator from Virginia will weigh in on this subject. I have great \nrespect for their views, but I do believe this. You have to make the \ncase that spending this extra money is critically necessary for our \ndefense. I do not think that case can be made, No. 1. And, No. 2, you \nalso ought to make the case, given what we have talked about--the \ndanger of the Federal deficits and who is for more spending and who is \nfor less spending--you also ought to make the case, who is going to pay \nfor this? Where is the $60 billion going to come from?\n  This bill contains the first small increment of $300 million, which \nmay not seem like a lot of money to some but I think is a whole lot of \nmoney for the American taxpayers to shell out when they do not need to \nshell it out. This is a proposal that we do not need, a proposal that \nwe cannot afford, a proposal the Pentagon says it does not want, and a \nproposal this country should not adopt. It defies common sense for this \nCongress to say to General Shalikashvili: It does not matter what you \nthink; it does not matter what you say about arms control agreements; \nit does not matter how much you want to spend. We demand you spend more \non this because we believe this ought to be built on an accelerated \nbasis.\n  I say you have to make the case that that be done first, and I do not \nthink the case can be made. And second, as you make that case, if you \nthink you can make the case, tell us, who are you going to get to pay \nfor this? Which taxes are you going to raise to get $60 billion?\n  Mr. President, I indicated previously we will no doubt have comments \nfrom those who say there is a direct threat to some States in our \ncountry from this, that, or the other approach. I began speaking about \nthe array of threats to our country and let me end with the same \nnotion. If we are concerned about the principal threats to our country, \nit seems to me somewhere back on the far side of the range of threats \nthat are likely would be that a Mu'ammar Qadhafi acquires through some \nmagic an intercontinental ballistic missile that he is able to launch \ncomplete with a nuclear warhead destined for some American city. That \nis one of the least likely threats.\n  Far more likely a threat is an international rogue, some \ninternational bandit on the scene who is more likely to acquire a dozen \nother devices, including, if you are talking missiles, a much more \neasily acquired missile such as a cruise missile, easier to acquire and \neasier perhaps to operate. It is much more likely that we will find a \nthreat other than that which they are going to build the national \nmissile defense system to protect our country against. Should our \ncountry be unprotected? No. We have always had protection with this \nunderstanding: every missile launched against our country has a return \naddress. Every missile launched against America has a return address \nbecause we know who launches it. We see all launches in this world \nthrough our satellites. Should any country, any rogue nation, any \nadversary be foolish enough to launch a missile with a warhead against \nthis country, that country will cease to exist quickly. Our defense and \nour deterrent has always been our ability to let everyone in this world \nunderstand you launch a nuclear weapon against our country, and our \nnuclear arsenal, the most capable in the world, will erase from the \nface of the Earth those with that kind of judgment.\n  That nuclear arsenal still exists, and I hope that we will support \nthe amendment to reduce the $300 million. We will still be left with \n$508 million, which is a substantial amount of money, for research and \ndevelopment, but we will have sent a signal that we do not want to \nbegin climbing the first step on a stairway to a $60 billion \nexpenditure, the justification for which has not and in my judgment \ncannot be made at this point in this Chamber.\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have followed very carefully his points here. As a \nmatter of fact, it is basically a recitation--and I say this most \nrespectfully--of the points the Senator made last year. The Senator has \nbeen consistent in his message. But I was taken by his closing remarks \nof the history of the relationship between those nations possessing \nintercontinental systems and how our planet has thus far avoided any \nconfrontation.\n  This is a subject that I have been dealing with since 1969 when I \nwent to the Department of the Navy, I do not want to calculate how many \nyears ago. But the Senator is absolutely right; it was the deterrence \nthat prevented any confrontation between the former Soviet Union and \nthe United States of America. It was the doctrine of mass destruction, \nmutual massive destruction. But we were dealing in those days, despite \nour antipathy toward communism, with governments, with military \norganizations that were able to grasp the reality of mutual assured \ndestruction and had a very tight command and control over every single \none of those sites.\n  I should say that in the many years I followed this, having served on \nthe Intelligence Committee, there were isolated incidents where there \nwas alcohol involved on a site here and there.\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\n We saw the occasional reports. But, fortunately, the command and \ncontrol was exercised so as to eliminate what I personally regard as \nthe prime reason for this expenditure, the accidental or unintentional \nfiring.\n  In the former Soviet Union, the rocket forces were the elite. Only \nthe finest men and, I suppose in some instances, women were put into \nthose units. We did not have in those days the risk that I think is \npresent today of the accidental or unintentional firing.\n  Quite apart from the dollars and cents--and we could debate on into \nthe night as to what the estimates are to build the system and the time \nin which it is to be done, but I cannot look into the faces of my \nfellow Americans and say that there is any budget or any calculation \nwhich would induce me not to support this given the horrific damage \nfrom a single accidental firing of an ICBM against a major city. Take \nwhatever you want as the budget to build this system. If you hit on \n57th and 5th Avenue in New York City, it would be billions and billions \nof dollars in property damage and incalculable lives.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator is warming up to a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sort of on a roll here, and I rather enjoy it, but \nmy point is, what is your concept of a single accidental firing, a risk \npresent today that was not present during the height of the cold war? \nThat is essentially the purpose of this system.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator asks a good question, and I understand it \nwell because he set it up quite well. I say to the Senator, you \ndescribe this in the context of a rogue nation or an international \nterrorist who gets hold of one missile and launches one missile against \nthe United States. I contend that it is far more likely that an \ninternational terrorist would get hold of a suitcase and put it in a \nrusty Yugo on the dock in New York City than be able to find an ICBM \nand launch an ICBM at the United States. The point I made at the start \nof my discussion is you have an array of threats against our country. \nThe one you describe is a threat, there is no question about that.\n\n  Let me give you another one. How about----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me give you a threat.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am ready to concede that you are correct. It may well \nbe the suitcase----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me continue before you concede. You are conceding a \nsmall part. Let us assume a captain of a Typhoon submarine goes half \nwacko somewhere out in the ocean and launches the entire supply of \nwarheads on that submarine, which is 200 warheads, ICBM's, sea-launched \nICBM's against this country. That is a rogue threat. There is nothing \nproposed by anyone, that I am aware of, nothing under any condition or \nany system or any bizarre scheme I am aware of that is going to protect \nthis country against that large a threat, is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We do not have \nanything and that is in the realm of risk. I think farther down the \nscale than the single isolated incident is either in Russia or, indeed, \nNorth Korea--they are rapidly approaching the potential, with their \nTaepo Dong missile, which could reach Hawaii or Alaska.\n  My point is the Senator is correct. There is a risk from the \nsuitcase. There is a risk from a berserk crew on a Typhoon submarine. \nAnd there is a risk associated with the accidental firing of a single, \nor perhaps two missiles against the United States.\n  But the fact that we have a number of risks does not eliminate the \nresponsibility of every Member of this Chamber to apply, diligently, \nevery resource we have in this country to stop these risks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say this to the Senator, I fully accept the \nresponsibility of doing the research and development on a missile \nprogram, a national missile defense program of some type for which \nthere is, in this bill, $508 million--plus $300 million added by the \ncommittee, saying $508 million is not enough, we want to add $300 \nmillion more. I respect the obligation to be doing the research and \ndevelopment to be available and to be ready to deploy a system if it \nbecomes certain that we need this system and conceivable we can build \nit in a cost-effective way. I am ready to do that.\n  But what I am saying to the Senator is this. If you come to us with \nproposals that the Defense Department says threaten to undermine the \narms control treaties that now exist that result in destroying the \nmissiles in the ground--all the missiles are out of the Ukraine at this \npoint.\n  The fact is today--I know the Senator knows this because we have \npeople on both sides of the aisle who have engineered this, and I would \nsay the Senator has been instrumental in a number of these areas in \nhelping this along--we are seeing adversaries' missiles now being \ndestroyed, sawed in half, cut up. It seems to me you would agree that \nthe very best way to destroy a potential adversary's missile is to \ndestroy it before it leaves the ground. If you propose a national \nmissile defense system that threatens the underpinnings of our arms \ncontrol agreements, it seems to me what you have done is add to the \narsenal of weapons that are potentially going to be weapons against us.\n  So I am willing to walk down the road, to talk about threats and how \none responds to them. I am not willing, under any circumstances, not \nany, to do anything that I think starts to take apart the arms control \nagreements. It is not just me that says that. It is the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and others who say this threatens to destroy the \nfoundation of these arms control agreements.\n\n  Once you start to do that you are not dealing with little rogue \nthreats out there. You are not dealing with some international nut case \nwho manages to find some ICBM and then manages to find a nuclear tip to \nput on the top of it. Then you are dealing with the questions of \nhundreds, perhaps thousands of additional weapons and launchers that \nwill be retained when they should in fact have been destroyed, because \nwe were trying to enter into arms control agreements that really do \naccomplish a reduction in the threat.\n  So, I hope--I have taken some time, but I hope the Senator \nunderstands. I am not opposed to research and development. I am opposed \nto adding, on top of that, money that means we will run off and buy and \nbuild and damn the consequences. I would listen to some very thoughtful \npeople who say you are going to injure the opportunities we have had in \nthe past and will have in the future, as a result of the arms control \nagreements. That is my major concern.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to reply. Let us say that the \nSenator and I have a disagreement on the arms control issue. I firmly \nbelieve that we can resolve with Russia any apprehension that they may \nhave with respect to the development of this system in a manner that \nwill pose a threat to them. As a matter of fact, I would argue it is in \ntheir interests that we have such a system because, should a missile be \nfired we could have some errors on our side, thinking a strike had been \nlaunched against us and suddenly trigger something against Russia.\n  But let us say we have a disagreement on arms control. But how does \nthe Senator from North Dakota answer the question: We have no arms \ncontrol with China, yet they have the capability of an accidental \nfiring. We have no arms control with North Korea, yet they are within 3 \nor 4 years of having a missile that could hit two of our States. What \ndoes the Senator say to those arguments?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The entire philosophy of arms control is to reduce the \nstock of nuclear arms and launchers and devices to deliver arms that \nnow exists and to try very hard to work on the issue of \nnonproliferation of nuclear arms. We must do a better job of that.\n  Do you know why? Because I think people are all too interested in \ngoing off and building things. The efforts at nonproliferation are not \nvery sexy. It is not an area that produces the same kind of thing that \na building project does. A building project, you pour concrete and get \nsomething that you can see and everybody can say, ``Look what we \nhave.'' We ought to, in our country, it seems to me, take seriously \nthis issue of who has and who is going to have nuclear weapons and pose \na threat in the future.\n  If the Senator says it matters with respect to China, yes, it does. \nSure it matters. It matters with respect to North Korea, yes. It also \nmatters with\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\nrespect to what our intelligence community tells us about the \ncapabilities of these countries, No. 1. I will be happy to put that in \nthe Record, because we are at odds on that issue.\n  But, second, it matters very much, it seems to me--it matters very \nmuch that this country behave in a way that recognizes it is in our \ninterests to have fewer nuclear weapons in the world. And our arms \ncontrol agreements, as deficient as they might be--some would want them \nmuch more aggressive--have started the process of doing what you and I \nmight have thought unthinkable not too long ago.\n  The Senator was in the Chamber when I showed this chart. I want to \nshow it again, because I suspect 8, 10 years ago, no one would have \nbelieved this. Ten years ago would anyone have believed that the \nSecretary of Defense and the Defense Minister of the Ukraine would be \nplanting sunflowers on ground where there was planted an SS-19 aimed at \nthe United States of America?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, Secretary Perry came and met \nwith members of the Armed Services Committee at a breakfast hosted by \nthe distinguished chairman, Chairman Thurmond, this morning, and \nrecounted the very incident portrayed by this picture. We concede all \nthat.\n\n  But I would like to come back to this issue. You stress arms control. \nWe have a disagreement on that. Come back to China. We have no arms \ncontrol--do you not agree they have the capability today of a missile \nsystem that could hit Alaska and could hit Hawaii, and that there could \nbe an accidental or rogue firing in that nation? Just witness what \nhappened in connection with the Straits of Taiwan here just several \nmonths ago, when we saw what in my judgment were actions by China, \npresumably under tight command and control, where those actions were in \ndefiance of what I call responsible conduct by major nations in this \nhemisphere.\n  Let us go back. Let us see if we can narrow debate. They have the \nsystem, am I not correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator, since he has raised the question \nof China, does the Senator know approximately the estimate of how many \nICBM's the Chinese possess?\n  Mr. WARNER. I do, but I am not sure it is a matter we should bring \nout in public at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does anyone know whether that is classified information?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us just concede that we know they have them. I do not \nknow the number--I do know it but I am not sure--let us just assume \nthat they have a system. I think you and I can agree on that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator also agree that, should any nation----\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will just let us \ntake a voice vote on the Grassley amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, notwithstanding the previous unanimous- \nconsent request, I ask unanimous consent that we resume consideration \nof the Grassley amendment. I understand Senator Grassley has agreed to \nhave the amendment voted on by a voice vote. I understand there is no \nfurther debate on this question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4047\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will vote on amendment No. 4047 of \nthe Senator from Iowa. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4047) was rejected.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to make certain the Record shows \nthe Senator from Virginia voted in the negative by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4048\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry, are we now returning to the \ncolloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the distinguished Senator was about to pose a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was about to ask the question, if the Senator agreed \nwith me, if a rogue nation--China, I suppose, would not be in the \ndefinition of ``rogue nation'' here; China is a trading partner of \nours.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it depends on the day of the week. They do \nhave some actions----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Normally, those who refer to rogue nations or \ninternational outlaw leaders have three or four in mind. Now, the \nSenator raises----\n  Mr. WARNER. You are correct, China should not be put in the same \ncategory as the generic term ``rogue nation.'' I am talking about the \naccidental, unintentional firing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand. The Chinese have, as you know, without \ndiscussing it, very few intercontinental ballistic missiles. The \nSenator raises the question of the potential of a country with \nintercontinental ballistic missiles launching an attack against the \nUnited States.\n  The question I want to ask is, does the Senator agree with me that \nthere cannot be an intercontinental ballistic missile launched without \na return address; we will know instantly where it is launched from?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct in that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the launching of an intercontinental ballistic missile \nmeans this country immediately knows where that launching took place, \nis it reasonable to expect, if they attack the United States, they \nwould expect a response that would annihilate the country sending the \nmissile? The point is, that has been a deterrence that has been around \nfor sometime. I thought the Senator was really talking about a real \noutlaw, nut leader someplace out there in space, and now he has raised \nthe question of China.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the purpose of this debate, there are \nreally only two nations which possess intercontinental systems that can \nstrike the United States, and that is Russia and China. China has a \nsystem which can reach not only two States, Alaska and Hawaii, but, \nindeed, we have reason to believe that it could reach the central parts \nof the mainland United States. For the record, I am not talking about \nan organized command and control attack on the United States by China. \nI am talking about the accidental firing, the unintentional--perhaps in \na training mission--firing of a live missile, either from Russia or \nChina. Should not we have the bare minimum capability in this country \nto defend against a single or perhaps two or three missiles being \nfired?\n\n  I say yes. Our difference is the schedule on which it is to be built. \nYou have reasons to believe that $500 million is enough. I feel \nstrongly, as does the committee, that $800 million is the required \namount to keep the research and development at the most expeditious \npace, such as a President can make the decision with regard to \ndeployment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator has narrowed this interestingly. So let me \nask this question. The Air Force has proposed a system that they say is \na minimal cost system to respond to exactly what you are talking about: \none isolated case of one intercontinental ballistic missile, perhaps \nwith one warhead, being launched accidentally or deliberately at \nsomeplace in this country.\n  There is a plan floating around that they say will cost $2 billion, \n$2.5 billion to defend against that, not to give us a defense that is \nnot impenetrable, but one that gives a reasonable certainty of stopping \nthat limited threat.\n  I ask the Senator, is that what the Senator would support and would \nthat be sufficient?\n  Mr. WARNER. This Senator is in favor of supporting a system that \ncould perhaps interdict up to 10, 12, 15, maybe as many as 20, \ncertainly not an exchange as was practical, that potentially could have \noccurred between the former Soviet Union and the United States. China's \ntotal arsenal we have agreed we should not discuss here, but it has \nnumbers that could approximate those amounts of exchange. That is not \nan accidental firing in reality or unintentional to send 10 or 20 \nmissiles. Nevertheless, the system should be built to cope with it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I understand your response, you are not proposing then \na\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nsystem that would in any way protect this country against a lunatic \nTyphoon submarine captain who launches 200 warheads from a Typhoon \nsubmarine against this country? You are not proposing a system that \nprotects us against that?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the system that I have in mind could limit \nthe damage. Now, whether it could deal with all 20 missiles fired----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Two hundred warheads.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not prepared to give you an answer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Two hundred warheads.\n  Mr. WARNER. If you interdict the missile, you get 10 warheads.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It depends on when you interdict the launcher. But my \npoint was, I guess most people would say you are not proposing a system \nthat could respond to that threat. So, again, on the scale of threats, \nyou have some you respond to, some you do not. Look, I would not \nsupport a penny for research and development if I did not think it is \nreasonable for us to be trying to figure out what are the threats and \nwhat is a reasonable approach to begin thinking about them and planning \nto meet them when they become sufficiently real that the intelligence \ncommunity says this country needs to do something about those threats.\n  The Senator knows, and we have said before in this debate, that the \nintelligence community in this country does not concur that this is the \ntime to do what is being proposed we do. The Defense Department tells \nus that it will undercut the arms control agreements and launch us into \nan orbit to spend an enormous amount of money against a system that the \nSenator now concedes will not respond to the more aggressive or robust \nthreats.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, all I can say is that what we \nenvision is a limited system to deal with the accidental or \nunintentional firing. I am not prepared, nor any of us are really \nprepared, to give you precise numbers, whether it could interdict the \nentire load of a Typhoon. It depends on when interdiction takes place, \nwhether there is warhead separation. There are a lot of factors that \ndeal with it.\n  I want to also put in the Record, I respect your arguments about the \nsuitcase. Fortunately, I think technology is not quite at the point \nwhere that is the highest risk now, but we have in place a number of \nsystems to deter and, indeed, interdict the suitcase. It is just my \nconcern we have nothing--nothing--in place to interdict the stray two \nor three missiles that could be accidentally fired or a terrorist \nfiring against our Nation.\n  That is the direction in which this Senator wants to move as \nexpeditiously as possible. And we have O'Neill, who was the prior \nhead--he just resigned--of the BMD office, who said $800 million is the \nfigure. I happen to agree with him. You happen to disagree. Therein, I \nthink, we framed the argument.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You say $800 million. Let me make just a couple \nadditional points. Again, I respect very much the Senator from \nVirginia. I have admired his work for a long while. We disagree from \ntime to time on things. We disagree on this. I, nonetheless, think he \ncontributes a great deal to defense policy.\n  This little pager that I use is about the size, I am told, of the \ndevice that brought down the Pan Am flight by a terrorist planting a \ndevice this size on the Pan Am 747 which crashed in Lockerbie, \nScotland. That was a terrible attack. We know what the terrorist attack \nwas with a rental truck in Oklahoma City. We know of many terrorist \naccidents. We know of the deadly chemical agent attack in Japan on the \nsubway. We know of the bombing of the World Trade Center by terrorists.\n\n  The Senator raises the question, what about the ultimate terrorist \nact of a terrorist getting ahold of, not a suitcase, not a Yugo, but an \nICBM, not a cruise, an ICBM missile, and tipping it with a nuclear \nwarhead and launching it against our country?\n  Again, I will say to the Senator, there is a prospect advanced by one \nof the services that they say would cost $2 billion that would use \nexisting technology to provide a defense against a very limited, \nisolated, single missile kind of rogue nation or accidental launch. \nThat proposal does exist.\n  The Senator and I may not have much disagreement if he said, let us \ntake the limited option at minimum dollars and provide the protection \nagainst that threat that he has just described in some detail. I am not \nsure we would have much disagreement about that.\n  That is not what is being proposed, as the Senator knows. What is \nbeing proposed is a robust system, multiple sites, space-based \ncomponents, accelerated deployment. That is a much, much different, \nmuch more expensive and much more extensive proposal than what we are \ndiscussing.\n  So again I say, if the isolated circumstances that the Senator \ndescribes were met by a $2 billion system, which one branch of the \nservice has given me a detailed briefing on, I do not know that we \nwould have a big disagreement. But what we are talking about here--and \nI believe the Senator in his heart knows we are talking about--is the \npotential of $60 billion over the years to build a much more capable \nsystem, at the end of which we will not have addressed the threat of a \nrobust attack against this country.\n  I worry that if we spend that money, we may develop the circumstance \nof saying to the American people, we now have a missile defense system \nwe have spent $60 billion for, just to build, not to operate, and then \nsomeone says, ``What if somebody launches 50 missiles against us?'' We \nsay, ``Well, we're sorry about that. We're not going to be able to deal \nwith that.''\n  If we are talking threat, let us respond to the most aggressive \nthreats first. Let us do the things that are necessary to do research \nand development on national missile defense.\n  I notice my friend from Oklahoma is now on the floor. I mentioned \nearlier he is someone who has an interest on this subject. I mentioned \nhim in a kindly way.\n  But I just believe that to rush off and commit $300 million above \nwhat General Shalikashvili recommends, Secretary Perry and others \nrecommend as is prudent and wise, given our circumstances and arms \ncontrol, and other needs, I think that is not in this country's \ninterests. So I appreciate the colloquy the Senator and I have had.\n  Mr. WARNER. I shall yield the floor momentarily. I have enjoyed the \ncolloquy. But let us make it clear, this additional $300 million by the \nArmed Services Committee was for the purpose of the ground system. And \nit is our collective judgment that that amount of money is needed to \nkeep an aggressive R going.\n  I strongly support it. And $300 million is not specifically earmarked \nfor any system. It in fact is the BMD's program that they have at the \nmoment. We have disagreements as to the total cost. That is clear. But \nI think we isolated this to be a debate between two individuals who \nfeel equally strongly from their various perspectives.\n  I think we owe it to the American public to do everything we can to \nput in place such systems to deter against a suitcase, to deter against \nthe Typhoon suddenly coming up and firing its whole load. But I see \nthis as a risk, which I think is far greater, the accidental firing of \na single or a double, by either a terrorist or someone who comes in and \nseizes an installation in China or Russia, some group, band, who goes \nin and seizes it and fires it somehow. That is what I want to stop.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield on that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I encourage the Senator to receive the briefing, if he \nhas not yet, on the planning that has been done by the Air Force for a \nminimal system at minimum cost to address exactly that circumstance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have gotten that briefing. I am just not \nsure that that is a sufficiently robust system to meet the requirements \nas I see them.\n  Mr. President, there are other Senators anxious to speak. I thank the \nSenator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will make some remarks with regard to the \nmatter at hand, and the general feeling that I have with regard to the \nbill.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Did my colleague from South Carolina wish to make some\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\nkind of a point? I have been recognized. I would be glad to yield to \nhim.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have been debating this amendment now \nfor over an hour. I just wanted the Senator from North Dakota to \nconsider entering into a time agreement on his amendment at this time.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from South Carolina had a question for the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wonder if the Senator would agree to a time agreement \non this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no intention of delaying the vote. There are a \nnumber of Senators who do want to speak briefly.\n  Mr. THURMOND. What is a time the Senator would wish to suggest?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad from North Dakota wants to speak and \nSenator Exon wishes to speak.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. All the Senator from Nebraska is attempting to do is move \nthings along. If an agreement is reached with regard to a time \nagreement, I will certainly yield to the managers of the bill and the \nSenator from North Dakota to make that statement. In the meantime, I \nwould like to proceed with the statement I have regarding the bill.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina, the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, is a very, very dear friend \nof mine. He does an excellent job and has as long as this Senator has \nbeen in the U.S. Senate. He works very well with Senator Nunn, the \nranking member of the committee. They have worked very hard on this \ndefense authorization bill that this Senator supported when it came out \nof the Armed Services Committee. But at that time I sent a first signal \nthat I would be attempting to make some changes to improve the bill in \nseveral areas that I thought needed attention.\n  I will simply say to my good friend from South Carolina, that he has \nmade noble efforts in the committee. We had thorough discussion on a \nlot of these issues that we are going to be taking up in the form of \namendments now that the bill is on the floor, which I think is entirely \nproper.\n  What this Senator has been attempting to do since this bill came out \nof the authorization committee, and as late as this morning--as \nreferenced by my distinguished friend and colleague from Virginia, we \nmet with the Secretary of Defense--what I am trying to do is, as much \nas possible, make this defense authorization bill vetoproof.\n  In other words, if we can accommodate some of the wishes of the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of Defense and others, \nthat have key roles to play in what happens to the authorization bill \nthat we will eventually pass here, it is to make it as acceptable as \npossible to reach some compromises on several things where I think \nthere should be compromises, make it somewhat more acceptable to the \nClinton administration, and then we will have accomplished something \nrather than passing a defense authorization bill that will end up dead \nin the water in the form of a veto.\n\n  So the comments that I am now about to make are designed, as best I \ncan design them, to try to reach a compromise, a compromise, if you \nwill, up front in the process of the Senate working its will on the \ndefense authorization bill, and hopefully have a bill that will mean \nsomething.\n  Mr. President, the defense authorization bill before the Senate is a \nrather rare piece of legislation, one might say. It is one of the few \nspending or authorization bills for the next year receiving a sizable \nincrease--I repeat, a sizable increase--above the administration's \nrequest.\n  To be specific, at $267 billion, the 1997 defense authorization bill \ndwarfs--dwarfs--Mr. President, any other discretionary spending program \nin the Federal budget. Like an out of shape prizefighter, it enters the \nring $13 billion overweight from the position of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Having been overfed by the majority of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--and I hope we can at least partially correct that--the \nquarter of a trillion-dollar defense bill before the Senate is not just \n$13 billion above the Pentagon's proposed budget, it is $1.7 billion in \nexcess of the originally passed budget resolution, and $4.1 billion \nmore than the 1996 defense spending bill. At a quarter of a trillion \ndollars, the 1997 defense authorization bill is flush, with $13 billion \nin unrequested spending authority, much of which adds unnecessarily to \nour national debt, while adding, in the opinion of this Senator, little \nor nothing to our national defense.\n\n  The 1997 defense authorization bill should be termed the ``wish \nlist'' bill. It is so much so that every service official and regional \nmilitary commander that appeared before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on the bill was asked by the members of the majority a \nquestion, and certainly Federal managers of domestic programs have \nfrequently heard that recently, and it is going to be driven home again \nduring this debate. This was the question that was asked of these \nvarious military officials: ``If you were given additional funds above \nthe budget request, how would you spend it?''\n  Let me repeat that. Can you imagine a military person sitting before \nthe Armed Service Committee and they are asked a question, ``If you \nwere given additional funds above the budget request, how would you \nspend it?'' What kind of a reply would you expect? To no one's \nsurprise, when blank checks were enticingly dangled before the witness, \nthe replies were as prompt as they were lengthy. No military leader \nworth his salt, under such a scenario, could not find something that he \ncould use.\n  Of the $13 billion added to the President's defense budget request, \n$11.4 billion, or nearly $9 out of every $10 added, went toward \nprocurement and research and development programs. But approximately $2 \nbillion of the add-on dollars proposed in the Pentagon's wish list is \nnot even part of the Pentagon's own budget plan for the next 5 years, \nand certainly it is not, nor has it been previously, projected.\n  What is more, a similar portion of the $13 billion committee add-on \nis neither part of the long-range budget, nor any armed services wish \nlist, including the wish lists that are included in this proposal.\n  In other words, the Armed Services Committee did not even get enough \nrequests, after dangling that enticing proposition before the \nwitnesses, to add up to the billions that we are spending. In other \nwords, nearly $4.6 billion of the $13 billion-plus-up to the Pentagon's \noutyear budget plan, or a part of the services' wish list. It is \nsomething that came through the fat-feeding program in the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  In my opinion, it is vital that the American public understand this \nimportant distinction between several options:\n  One, what the President proposed in his budget for defense spending. \nTwo, what the Pentagon says it needs to provide for our national \ndefense. Three, what the military witnesses wish they could have after \nhaving the proposition dangled in front of them. Four, what level of \nfunding the committee ultimately approved.\n  Such a wish-list approach to defense budgeting is not responsible, in \nthis Senator's opinion, and stands out as a glaring exception to the \nmanner in which painful cuts have been levied against domestic budget \naccounts. Nor is the end product of $13 million in additional defense \nspending justified and, certainly not, Mr. President, in order to do \nwhat we are trying to do in these times, when we are supposedly being \nprudently fiscal, to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  A cursory look at the defense authorization bill before the Senate \nindicates that a rising budget tide floats all boats. Among the largest \nbeneficiaries of the committee's blank check wish list in the budget \nincludes these items: An $856 million increase in the proposed \nballistic missile defense spending, which has just been debated to some \nextent on the floor of the Senate preceding my remarks; a $760 million \nincrease in the National Guard and Reserve equipment; a $750 million \nincrease in DDG-51 destroyer funding; a\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\n$701 million increase in new attack submarine funding; a $700 million \nincrease in military construction and housing funding; a $351 million \nincrease in V-22 aircraft funding; and a $341 million increase in F-16 \nand F-18 funding for 10 unrequested aircraft.\n  These increased spending levels are only a downpayment--I emphasize \nonce again, Mr. President, the funding levels I have just cited are \nonly a downpayment for future spending that will confound budget-making \nin the years to come.\n  Mr. President, at a minimum, the spending level included in the \ndefense authorization bill should be reduced by $1.7 billion to be \nbrought into conformance with the budget resolution so as to eliminate \nhollow budget authority in the bill. But the Senate should not stop \nthere. We should question the need for the remaining $11 billion \nincrease and whether this extraordinary increase is needed to properly \ndefend the national security interest of the United States.\n  Perhaps the starting point for reduction in spending authority \ncontained in this bill should begin at $4.6 billion, the sum total of \nweapon add-ons and program increases not requested in the service wish \nlists, or contained in the Pentagon's long-range budget plan.\n  At a later point during the consideration of this bill, I will \npropose an amendment along with Senators Bingaman, Kohl, Levin, and \nWellstone, to reduce the top-line defense spending figure by a modest \n$4 billion. This represents a full $600 million less, Mr. President, \nthan the $4.6 billion in unsupported, unjustified, and unwise spending \nauthority.\n  In essence, the Exon amendment would retain $9 billion in defense \nspending authority over and above the President's request. Now, let me \nrepeat that. The Exon amendment would retain $9 billion in defense \nspending authority above and added on top of what the President has \nsuggested. If the Exon amendment is agreed to by the Senate, our Nation \nwould still be spending $155 million more in 1997 than in 1996. I would \nhave more to say about this amendment when it is offered.\n  One of the most questionable of the committee add-ons, in the opinion \nof this Senator, is $856 million for missile defense programs--most \nnotably, the $300 million add-on for a national missile defense system.\n  The Senator for North Dakota has an amendment before the Senate at \nthis time, which has been debated for the last hour and a half. I also \nintend to support that, and I have included that in the numbers that I \nhave presented and will be presenting later in the form of an Exon \namendment, with several important cosponsors.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate debated the wisdom of the Dole star \nwars proposal to pursue a crash program to field a continental missile \ndefense system by the year 2003. It was pointed out then that the \nthreat does not and will not exist in the near term to justify such a \nproposition. In the longer term, all of us are continuing to look at \nvarious types of missile defenses that we may need in the long term.\n  Furthermore, the Dole star wars bill as presently drafted would cost, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, anywhere from between $31 \nand $60 billion. So the $300 million plus that we are talking about now \nwould grow to $31 billion to $60 billion just to deploy, and perhaps \nanother $10 billion on top of that to operate. The committee's $350 \nmillion increase is an initial downpayment; $350 million may not sound \nlike a whole lot of money. But that is a downpayment, if you will, on a \nmultibillion dollar program most likely, at a minimum, in the range of \n$50 billion between now and the year 2002.\n  Downpayments are easy, as the average American family knows. But in \nthis case this is a system that I urge the Senate to delete as wasteful \nexpenditures even though there may be some arguments and some people \nsincerely feel that we should move faster than the Pentagon and the \nexperts in the field tell us we should in this area. As was the case in \nlast year's authorization bill, there are language provisions in the \n1997 defense authorization bill which are unwise and may prove to be a \nproblem down the road in getting this bill signed by the White House. \nThis is something that I opened my remarks on by saying that I was \ntrying to steer this bill into something that is workable and not \nanother knockdown, dragout between the Congress and the President.\n  Mr. President, two provisions in particular stand out as being \nquestionable forays by the majority of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee into the area of foreign policy, and each could possibly \njeopardize bilateral efforts between the United States and Russia to \nlower our nuclear inventories in a balanced and accountable fashion.\n  One provision ultimately interprets the ABM Treaty demarcation \nbetween long-range and short-range missile defenses at a time when our \nnations are negotiating this very issue right now.\n  The second language provision that I have concerns about is with \nregard to changing the bilateral Antiballistic Missile Treaty to a \nmultilateral treaty that includes several of the independent states of \nthe former Soviet Union. This is a major concern of the President of \nthe United States. And, unless this language is corrected, I think we \nstand a high chance of a veto. The majority's insistence that such \nmultilateralization of the treaty would constitute a substantive change \nin requiring reratification by the Senate is equally meddlesome on the \npart of the committee.\n  As President Clinton stated in his April 8 letter to the Armed \nServices Committee chairman, Strom Thurmond, he has strong objections \nto this matter for very valid reasons, in the opinion of this Senator. \nHe said in that letter: ``Refusing to recognize Ukraine, Belarus, and \nKazakhstan as coequal successors to the Soviet Union with regard to the \nABM Treaty would undermine our own interests in seeing that these \ncountries carry out their obligations as successors to the Soviet Union \nunder other arms control treaties, such as START I--and START II \nand others--and the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty,'' which \nis very important.\n\n  Mr. President, to summarize, this year's defense authorization bill \nis a marked improvement over last year's bill. I have saluted the \ncommittee for its action on that in the opening of these remarks. Yet, \nchanges must be made, in the opinion of this Senator, to reduce \nunjustified spending increases and delete intrusive foreign policy \nlanguage before I can enthusiastically support this bill. However, I \nwould say, Mr. President, that overall I congratulate Senator Thurmond, \nmy friend, colleague, and chairman of the committee, for other than \nsome of the shortcomings that I see. I salute him for a very well-\nbalanced bill in several other areas.\n  I appreciate the consideration, the cooperation, and the \nunderstanding. For those of us who tried to make some changes in the \ncommittee, the chairman of the committee did not agree with us, but as \nusual he gave us every opportunity to make our point. We in turn \nsupported the bill as it came out of committee with the clear \nunderstanding to the chairman that we would be making some changes on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe 60 minutes equally divided for debate on the pending Dorgan \namendment with no amendment in order to the amendment; that at the \nconclusion or yielding back of time the amendment be set aside; and, \nfurther, that at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, June 19, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Dorgan amendment and there be 15 minutes equally \ndivided for debate with a vote on or in relation to the Dorgan \namendment at the expiration of that debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will \nbe no more votes this evening. The next rollcall vote will occur at \napproximately 9:15 tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4048\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, there are 60 \nminutes equally divided on the Dorgan amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield myself such time as may be \nrequired under the Dorgan amendment.\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota does not think that the American people deserve to be \ndefended against the only military threat that faces them in their \nhomes every day, a threat that is growing more severe every year. \nSimply stated, what the Dorgan amendment seeks to do is perpetuate \nAmerican vulnerability.\n  We have heard quite a bit about how there is no threat and how \ninvestment in national missile defense is a waste of money. Let's \nremember that more Americans died in the Persian Gulf war as a result \nof a single missile attack than any other cause. I don't imagine that \ntheir families would view missile defense investments as a waste.\n  It has been argued that there is no threat to justify deployment of a \nnational missile defense system to defend the United States. This view \nis strategically shortsighted and technically incorrect. Even if we get \nstarted today, by the time we develop and deploy an NMD system we will \nalmost certainly face new ballistic missile threats to the United \nStates. Unfortunately, it will take almost 10 years to develop and \ndeploy even a limited system.\n  Much has been made of the intelligence community's estimate that no \nnew threat to the United States will develop for 10 years or more. This \nestimate, however, only has to do with new indigenously developed \nmissile threats to the continental United States. It treats Alaska and \nHawaii as if they were not part of the United States. Moreover, the \nintelligence community has confirmed that there are numerous ways for \nhostile countries to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \nmuch less than 10 years by means other than indigenous development.\n  North Korea has also demonstrated to the world that an ICBM \ncapability can be developed with relatively little notice. The Taepo-\nDong II missile, which could become operational within 5 years, is an \nICBM. Each new development of this missile seems to catch the \nintelligence community by surprise. It certainly undermines the \nargument of those who downplay the threat and the intelligence \ncommunity's own 10-year estimate.\n  Even if we knew with certainty that no new threat would materialize \nfor 10 years there would still be a strong case for developing and \ndeploying a national missile defense system. Deploying an NMD system \nwould serve to deter countries that would otherwise seek to acquire an \nICBM capability. A vulnerable United States merely invites \nproliferation, blackmail, and even aggression.\n  It has also been argued that the administration's NMD program is \nadequate to hedge against an emerging threat. Unfortunately, the budget \nrequest does not adequately support the administration's own plan. \nSince the administration's NMD program is supposed to preserve the \noption of deploying an NMD system by 2003 it is appropriate for \nCongress to add sufficient funds to ensure that such an option is truly \nviable. The director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has \ntestified repeatedly to Congress that about $800 million per year is \nneeded for NMD in order to preserve such an option. This is precisely \nwhat the Armed Services Committee has recommended.\n  For those who argue that the Senate Armed Services Committee is \nthrowing money at ballistic missile defense, I would point out that the \namount in this bill for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization is \nonly slightly higher than the Clinton administration's own bottom-up \nreview recommended for fiscal year 1997.\n  The bottom line is simple. If you think that the American people \nshould not be defended against ballistic missiles, then you should \nsupport the Dorgan amendment. If you think that the United States \nshould preserve the option of deploying an NMD system by 2003, then \nvote against this amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to put \nthemselves on the side of defending the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and acknowledge the able Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator and I certainly concur in the \ncomments that he is making. It is a very frustrating thing to have \nknowledge of the threat that exists out there and merely because the \nAmerican people are not aware of it, we are ignoring the defense of our \ncountry which I have always understood when I was growing up should \nhave been the primary concern or function of Government, to protect its \ncitizens.\n  In a few of the things that have been said by a number of those who \nare on the opposite side of defending America was the discussion about \nthe threat of suitcases, of carrying around bombs, of terrorist \nactivities. Being from Oklahoma, nobody needs to tell me about \nterrorist activities. I understand. It is almost as if to say that \nbecause there are crazy people out there that burn churches and carry \naround suitcases, we need to address that and not address the potential \nof an attack on the United States of America by an ICBM, armed with a \nwarhead that can be a weapon of mass destruction, chemical, biological \nor nuclear. It is like saying you do not want to have car insurance \nbecause you want to have insurance on your home. You want to have a \ncomprehensive policy that insures you against everything. There is a \nthreat out there and I think we need to talk about that, and certainly \nnow is the appropriate time because we have heard Senator after Senator \nstand up and allege there is no threat out there; the cold war is over.\n  It was 2 years ago that James Woolsey, who was the CIA Director under \nPresident Clinton, made a statement, and his statement 2 years ago was \nwe know of between 20 and 25 nations that either have or are in the \nfinal stages of completing weapons of mass destruction, biological, \nchemical or nuclear, and are working on the missile means to deliver \nthose weapons.\n  That was 2 years ago. He updated that statement and said there are \nsomewhere closer to 30 nations now. Let us look at who those nations \nare, the type of people, the mentality of those individuals who are \npotentially armed with this type of destruction, countries like Iraq \nand Iran and Libya and Syria, North Korea, China, Russia, countries \nwhere just not too long ago, for example, Saddam Hussein, a guy who \nmurdered his own grandchildren, made the statement back during the \nPersian Gulf war that if we had waited 5 more years to invade Kuwait, \nwe would have had the capability of sending a weapon of mass \ndestruction to the United States.\n  Well, here it is. It is now 5 years later. So let us assume that some \nof these guys might be right. They come up and they say, well, we do \nnot want to do it because it might in some way affect adversely the ABM \nTreaty. The ABM Treaty was put together back in 1972, and we cannot say \nthis was done in a Democrat administration. It was not. I am a \nRepublican. Richard Nixon was a Republican. Henry Kissinger, I assume, \nwas a Republican. At least he worked for a Republican. And he put \ntogether a plan. The ABM Treaty at that time was designed to address \nthe problem of two superpowers in the world environment. Those \nsuperpowers were the U.S.S.R. and the United States, and so they put \ntogether a plan that said we will restrict our nuclear capability \nbilaterally.\n  So let us assume that they would do it. I never believed they would. \nLet us assume they would. If you bring that up to today, there is no \nlonger a U.S.S.R. It is now Russia. Let us assume that Russia would \nagree to stepping into this issue as the former U.S.S.R. And live up to \nthe expectation of the ABM Treaty. What about these other 25 or 30 \nnations out there?\n\n  Let us assume that the United States and Russia are downgrading their \nnuclear capability. At the same time what is Iraq doing? What is China \ndoing? What are the other countries doing? They are certainly not a \npart of this treaty.\n  It was brought out by one of the Senators in the Chamber a few \nminutes ago that these people are not part and parcel to the treaty so \nthey could continue to increase their nuclear capability, the weapons \nof mass destruction, and their capability to develop a missile means of \ndelivering them.\n  If we do not want to take the word of somebody who is not here as to \nhow significant and how applicable today is the policy of a mutually \nassured destruction, listen to what Henry Kissinger said just the other \nday. I had lunch\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nwith him. I asked him if I could quote him. He said yes. His statement \nwas, ``It is nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability.'' And that \nis exactly what we are doing. Let us for a minute talk about the cost. \nI have never heard anyone throw around figures like I have heard in the \nChamber of the Senate--talking about another $30 billion to $60 \nbillion. The CBO estimate of $30 to $60 billion over 14 years was \ntaking every system that is out there right now and saying we want to \ndeploy all of these systems by a date in the future.\n  No one has ever suggested that. Right now, we are talking about in \nthis bill looking at what options are there. Let us take the Aegis \nsystem. We have a $40 to $50 billion investment in 22 ships that are \nfloating out there right now. They have missile launching capability. \nThey are there. They are already bought and paid for. We need to spend \nabout $4 billion more to give that system capability of reaching up \ninto the upper tier and giving us a defense from an attack of a missile \nthat might be coming from North Korea or from someplace else. In that, \nwe already have an investment. Mr. President, 90 percent of it is \nalready paid for. We have some estimates here that were made by the \nteam B of the Heritage Foundation. That is made up of people like Hank \nCooper, the former director of the Strategic Defense Initiative, and \nseveral others. All of them are acknowledged experts. No one has ever \nquestioned their credibility. They say that a Navy-wide area defense \nsystem on Aegis cruisers would cost between $2 and $3 billion over the \nnext 6 years, plus $5 billion for a sensor satellite.\n\n  We are talking about, now, not $70 billion, we are talking about \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $7 to $8 billion over the next 6 \nyears. So let us get this in perspective. Let us assume there could be \nsome truth to the statements that these experts like James Woolsey are \nmaking, and, in fact, the threat is out there. Let us assume the \nRussians already have one.\n  This morning in a speech on the floor I used several articles, four \nor five of them. I wish I had them with me now. I did not think this \nsubject would come up again. But we talked about how China is now \nselling technology to Pakistan, how Syria and Libya have a new, cozy \narrangement with each other.\n  Here is an article right here that I did not use. The headline of \nthis article, found in the Washington Times, dated May 20, ``China's \narsenal gets a Russian boost. Deal for ICBM technology a threat to \nU.S., classified Pentagon report says.''\n  Then it says:\n\n       China, under the guise of buying space launchers, is \n     enhancing its strategic arsenal with technology and parts \n     from Russia's most lethal intercontinental ballistic missile, \n     the SS-18, [that is the MIRV'd missile with 10 warheads] says \n     a classified Pentagon intelligence report.\n\n  Further quoting,\n\n       Incorporating the SS-18-related military guidance or \n     warhead technologies into China's strategic missile forces \n     would greatly improve Beijing's ability to threaten targets \n     in the United States. . .\n\n  Now, that is in a confidential report that so far no one has refuted. \nLet us keep in mind that was about the time that a high Chinese \nofficial said--during the time they were experimenting with missiles in \nthe Strait of Taiwan, the Chinese were conducting experiments--they \nsaid, ``We don't have to worry about the United States coming to their \naid because they,'' the United States, ``would rather protect Los \nAngeles than they would Taipei.''\n  I would characterize that at the very least as an indirect threat at \nthe United States. It is like the Senator from South Carolina said, the \nhonorable chairman of this committee, he said, ``We are being held \nhostage.'' Threats like this: ``They are not going to do that, because \nif they do that we will go after them.'' Do they have the capability? \nAccording to the reports, yes, they have the capability.\n  So I just think we need to look at this in terms of the costs that \nhave been grossly, dramatically inflated into something that is totally \nunrealistic--the constant use of terms like ``star wars'' and other \nthings to put this into some kind of fiction environment so people will \nthink this thing is not real.\n  Keep in mind what was started in 1983 and was right on target all the \nway up through about last year, when the President vetoed the DOD \nauthorization bill from last year, and in his veto message said he did \nnot want to spend any more money on a national missile defense system. \nIn light of that, since that has happened, we have probably had more \nthreats that have come to the United States than we have at any other \ntime.\n\n  We have talked about the cost. I am from Oklahoma. The cost of the \ndamage that was done to the building itself in Oklahoma City was $500 \nmillion, half a billion dollars. That is just a drop in the bucket as \nto the total cost. The bomb that caused so much damage in Oklahoma had \nthe power of 1 ton of TNT. The smallest nuclear warhead known at the \npresent time is 1 kiloton, 1,000 times bigger than that bomb.\n  So I would like to have anyone, any of these Senators who seem to be \nso passive in their interest in protecting ourselves from a missile \nattack, to stop and look and remember, recall what happened in Oklahoma \nCity on April 19 of last year and multiply that by 1,000. It does not \nhave to be just in New York City. It does not have to be in Los \nAngeles. It could happen in North Dakota, it could happen in Nebraska, \nor anywhere.\n  I will conclude by saying if all these experts say the threat is out \nthere, if all of them say the Taepo Dong 2 missile will have the \ncapability of reaching the United States by the year 2000, and there \nare missiles in existence today that can already reach us, and this \nmissile technology is permeating all the way through the various \ncountries like Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Pakistan and other nations, if \nthis is out there, just ask the question--we are talking about $300 \nmillion right now. We are talking about $300 million, far less than \njust the damage to the building in Oklahoma City. Ask yourself the \nquestion: What if we are wrong?\n  I challenge any of those on the other side of the aisle who want to \ntake this money and put it into social programs, to ask themselves: \nWhat good are these social programs if we were wrong on this, on our \nestimate as to the extent of the capability of these countries to reach \nthe United States?\n  I see this as a very difficult time for us. It is difficult because \nit is very difficult for us to convey to the American people the truth, \nand the truth is, we have threats from many, many nations now. It is \nsomething that we should have as our single highest priority in this \nbody, and that is to protect the lives of Americans. That is what we \nare attempting to do.\n  I said this morning I am supporting this bill. I think we got the \nvery most we could out of a defense authorization bill. It is still not \nadequate. We should be moving forward in a more rapid pace to put \nourselves in a position to spend this other 10 percent of the \ninvestment we have already spent and give ourselves some type of \ndefense for a missile that comes over, outside the atmosphere, to the \nUnited States. The technology is there. We saw it during the Persian \nGulf war. We know you can knock down missiles with missiles. This is \nour opportunity to go forward with this program in a very minimum that \nwe must do to fulfill our obligation to the American people.\n  Last, let us look at this in terms of a nonpartisan or bipartisan \npriority. Back during the years that John Kennedy was President of the \nUnited States, regarding our budget to run the entire Government of the \nUnited States, 60 percent of that was on defense, 17 percent on human \nservices. Today, approximately 17 percent is on defense and 60 percent \non human services. I think we have this completely turned around. This \nis our opportunity to try to get back on track to making America strong \nagain, defending ourselves against a very serious threat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TESTING CONSTRAINTS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Subject to subsection (b), effective on \n     October 1, 1996, the United States may conduct tests of \n     nuclear weapons involving underground nuclear detonations in \n     a fiscal year if--\n       (1) the Senate has not provided advice and consent to the \n     ratification of a multilateral comprehensive nuclear test ban \n     treaty;\n       (2) the President has submitted under subsection (b) an \n     annual report covering that fiscal year (as the first of the \n     fiscal years covered by that report);\n       (3) 90 days have elapsed after the submittal of that \n     report; and\n       (4) Congress has not agreed to a joint resolution described \n     in subsection (d) within that 90-day period.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than March 1 of each year, the \n     President shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services \n     and on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committees on \n     National Security and on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives, in classified and unclassified forms, a \n     report containing the following matters:\n       (1) The status on achieving a multilateral comprehensive \n     nuclear test ban treaty, unless the Senate has already \n     provided its advice and consent to the ratification of such a \n     treaty.\n       (2) An assessment of the then current and projected safety \n     and reliability of each type of nuclear warhead that is to be \n     maintained in the active and inactive nuclear stockpiles of \n     the United States during the four successive fiscal years \n     following the fiscal year in which the report is submitted.\n       (3) A description of the number and types of nuclear \n     warheads that are to be removed from the active and inactive \n     stockpiles during those four fiscal years, together with a \n     discussion of the dismantlement of nuclear weapons that is \n     planned or projected to be carried out during such fiscal \n     years.\n       (4) A description of the number and type of tests involving \n     underground nuclear detonations that are planned to be \n     carried out during those four fiscal years, if any, and a \n     discussion of the justifications for such tests.\n       (c) Testing by United Kingdom.--Subject to the same \n     conditions as are set forth in paragraphs (1) through (4) of \n     subsection (a) for testing by the United States, the \n     President may authorize the United Kingdom to conduct in the \n     United States one or more tests of a nuclear weapon within a \n     period covered by an annual report if the President \n     determines that is in the national interest of the United \n     States to do so.\n       (d) Joint Resolution of Disapproval.--For the purposes of \n     subsection (a)(4), ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution introduced after the date on which the committees \n     referred to in subsection (b) receive the report required by \n     that subsection the matter after the resolving clause of \n     which is as follows: ``Congress disapproves the report of the \n     President on nuclear weapons testing, transmitted on \n     ______________ pursuant to section ______ of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.'' (the first \n     blank being filled in with the date of the report).\n       (e) Implementation of Test Ban Treaty.--If, with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate to ratification of a comprehensive \n     nuclear test ban treaty, the United States enters into such a \n     treaty, the United States may not conduct tests of nuclear \n     weapons involving underground nuclear detonations that exceed \n     yield limits imposed by the treaty unless the President, in \n     consultation with Congress, withdraws the United States from \n     the treaty in the supreme national interest.\n       (f) Report of Superseded Law.--Section 507 of Public Law \n     102-377 (106 Stat. 1343; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will describe this very briefly. It is \nactually a simple amendment. I will only discuss it here for about 3 or \n4 minutes, then we can have further discussion tomorrow when there are \nmore Members present, when they desire to do so.\n  This is an amendment dealing with nuclear testing, and the effect of \nit is to simply extend the time for the President to decide to test a \nnuclear weapon to the point that the United States ratifies a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty and it goes into effect.\n  Today, the law is, as of September 30, the President could not order \na nuclear test unless another country were to test a weapon.\n  What this amendment would do is to allow the President to order a \ntest for safety and reliability purposes; in other words, not dependent \nupon whether another country happened to engage in testing, and that \nright would exist until such time as this country ratified and a CTBT \nwent into effect. This chart describes very simply what we are doing.\n  The current law is that as of September 30 of this year, the \nPresident's ability to order a test would no longer exist, unless \nanother country engaged in a test. And then once a CTBT is entered into \nforce, there is no test except for extreme national emergency.\n  What our amendment would do is to continue the status quo until such \ntime as there is a CTBT, and the rationale is very simple. The fact \nthat another country tests does not necessarily mean that the United \nStates should test. Our ally France has conducted nuclear tests. China \nhas conducted nuclear tests and plans to conduct some more. And in \nneither of those events is it necessarily the case that as a result the \nUnited States should test.\n  We have no reason to test just because some other country does. But \nthere is always the possibility that the President would want to order \na test in order to assure stockpile safety and reliability. If we had \nsome reason to believe, for example, that one of our weapons was no \nlonger safe and we wanted to test that it was safe or to find out why \nit was not safe, in that event, today the President has such a right to \norder such a test, and he would continue to have that right until such \ntime as the CTBT is adopted.\n  That is it. That is as simple as the amendment is.\n  I further state, the Congress would have the right under this \namendment to ratify the President's decision or to reject it, based \nupon reports that the President would continue to send to us. Today, \nthe President is required to send us a report, and we would continue to \nrequire that report be sent to us on the status of the stockpile and \nwhether any testing is required.\n  Under this amendment, if the President said he wanted to conduct a \ntest, the Congress would have the ability to tell him he could not do \nso. This is not something that we are suggesting that the President do \nor suggesting that he would do it. It is simply a safety valve, if you \nwill, in the event of some untoward event with our stockpile that the \nPresident should conclude that a test is necessary that he would have \nthe ability to do that.\n  It does not affect the CTBT negotiations in any way. As I said, our \namendment simply goes up to the time that a CTBT is entered into. It is \nthat simple, Mr. President.\n  If Members wish to further discuss it tomorrow, I will be happy to \ntry to answer any questions about it or discuss it. I cannot imagine it \nwould be particularly controversial.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one seeking to speak, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the subject matter of this amendment \nwill probably be quite contentious. I hope not. I hope that other \nMembers will see that the amendment does not advocate opposition to \nconcluding a comprehensive test ban and that it does not promote \ntesting. With that in mind, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  As I understand the amendment, it would authorize the President to \nconduct underground nuclear weapons tests after October 1, 1996, if a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty has not been ratified by the United \nStates. In order to conduct an underground nuclear test, the President \nwould have to submit a report to Congress detailing justification for \nthe test. In order to stop the test from being conducted, the Congress \nwould have to pass a joint resolution within 90 days.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n  During the debate on the Exon-Hatfield legislation which prohibits \nnuclear testing, I voiced my concerns for the safety and reliability of \nthe nuclear stockpile without the ability to test. So long as our \ndefense relies on nuclear weapons, we must ensure the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile. That requires the authority to conduct \nunderground nuclear tests. I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6386-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, during the April recess, the Senator from \nUtah [Mr. Hatch], the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], and I traveled to \nBosnia and other countries of the former Yugoslavia as well as Albania \nand Hungary to monitor developments related to implementation of the \nDayton peace accord and to visit United States troops stationed in \nBosnia and the surrounding area. We have prepared a report of our trip \nand submit it for our colleagues' and the public's consideration. It \nshould be noted that the situation in Bosnia is constantly evolving and \nthat the report reflects our findings based on developments through the \nperiod of our visit, which ended on April 12, 1996. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Report of Senate Delegation Visit to Bosnia, April 3-12, 1996\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       A delegation from the United States Senate, consisting of \n     Democratic Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), Senator Orrin G. Hatch \n     (R-UT), and Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), met with leading \n     officials in Bosnia and the other countries of the former \n     Yugoslavia--Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia (FYROM), Serbia, Slovenia--as well as Albania and \n     Hungary from April 3 to April 12, 1996. The delegation was \n     authorized by the joint leadership of the Senate to explore \n     outstanding issues related to implementation of the Dayton \n     Peace Accord formally signed on December 14, 1995, by \n     President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Montenegro, and \n     President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Dayton, OH.\n       The accord is based upon the tenet that Bosnia will remain \n     a single state within its internationally recognized borders, \n     but that the state will be comprised of two entities--the \n     Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republika Srpska--\n     with substantial authority. In an effort to create the \n     conditions for peace in Bosnia, the Dayton agreement provides \n     for a peace implementation force (IFOR) under NATO command \n     and calls for civilian implementation through elections and \n     economic reconstruction.\n       In the period between the signing of the accord and the \n     delegation's departure, the ceasefire had held, elections \n     were being scheduled, and problems related to implementation \n     of the civilian aspects of the peace agreement were reported.\n       On the day the delegation left for the region, Americans \n     received the tragic news that the plane carrying Commerce \n     Secretary Ron Brown, 32 other Americans, and two Croatians \n     had crashed near Dubrovnik, Croatia. Secretary Brown had been \n     traveling in and around Bosnia with U.S. business leaders and \n     Commerce Department officials as part of the American effort \n     to help build democratic and economic institutions in the \n     region so that a lasting peace might take hold in the \n     Balkans. After making schedule adjustments, the delegation \n     chose to go forward with its planned visit to the region to \n     honor Ron Brown's vision and to send a clear signal to those \n     struggling for peace in Bosnia that the United States remains \n     committed to that mission.\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Orrin G. Hatch.\n     Harry Reid.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Senators Daschle, Hatch, and Reid met with leading \n     officials in Bosnia, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, Albania, and Hungary. In each \n     country, the delegation gathered perspectives on: (1) \n     military implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord; (2) \n     civilian implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord; (3) that \n     country's progress toward democratization; and (4) that \n     country's progress toward privatization and development of a \n     market economy. In Bosnia, the FYROM, and Hungary, the \n     delegation visited U.S. military installations and met with \n     troops stationed in the region.\n       While perspectives on progress toward peace in Bosnia and \n     the Balkans varied from country to country, the delegation \n     found there was general consensus around two basic points: \n     first, that NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR), led by the \n     United States, has been an unqualified success in terms of \n     stopping the war in Bosnia; and, second, that, while moving \n     forward, implementation of the civilian and economic aspects \n     of the Dayton accord has met with significant delay and \n     difficulty.\n       U.S. military and diplomatic leadership were credited by \n     virtually everyone in the region for progress that has been \n     made in Bosnia. Still, concerns persist about the prospects \n     for full implementation of the Dayton accord within the \n     timeframes laid out in the plan. Officials stressed that key \n     to successful implementation will be the efforts of Serbian \n     and Croatian leaders to garner the commitment of Serbs and \n     Croats within Bosnia to the borders agreed to in the Dayton \n     accord as well as human rights for all ethnic groups within \n     those borders.\n       Morale among U.S. troops appeared to be high, despite the \n     fact that they are living and working under extremely \n     difficult conditions. The servicemen and women with whom the \n     delegation spoke understood and believed in the importance of \n     their mission. They also spoke highly of the cooperative \n     spirit that has exemplified their relationship with forces \n     from Russia, Britain, France, and the other countries \n     represented in IFOR.\n       The delegation's goals were to promote, and assess progress \n     with respect to, full implementation of the Dayton Peace \n     Accord; to express support for U.S. troops participating in \n     the NATO and UN peacekeeping efforts; to promote democracy, \n     economic growth, and respect for human rights in the region; \n     and to reflect the United States' commitment to those working \n     for a lasting peace in Bosnia.\n\n\n                                Findings\n\n       The delegation returned to the United States confident that \n     U.S. military and diplomatic leadership has been the driving \n     force behind the current peace in Bosnia--that the peace \n     could not have been accomplished, and probably cannot be \n     sustained, without our efforts. The delegation returned \n     convinced of the value of that mission, for, as fragile as \n     the peace in Bosnia may be, the promise of peace, freedom and \n     democracy for all the people of the former Yugoslavia--and \n     the regional stability that would follow from that \n     achievement--justify their pursuit.\n       Several major findings--some of them confirmations of past \n     ones--resulted from this visit.\n       NATO military action, U.S. diplomacy, and military \n     implementation supporting that diplomacy stopped the war in \n     Bosnia and have been the primary deterrents to resumption of \n     the war.\n       U.S. military and foreign service personnel serve as models \n     for the rest of the world; their professionalism under \n     extraordinary circumstances should make every American proud.\n       Landmines pose a serious threat to U.S. and other \n     peacekeeing forces as well as the civilian population in \n     Bosnia. The United States should actively seek an \n     international ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines.\n       Regarding the military aspect of the Dayton Peace Accord, \n     IFOR has successfully carried out its mandate thus far.\n       Conditions for free and fair elections in Bosnia have not \n     yet been established. Numerous concerns were heard regarding \n     the willingness of the dominant parties in the three regions \n     to allow free elections.\n       People throughout the Balkan region are concerned about the \n     timing of IFOR's departure in light of problems related to \n     implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton accord \n     and economic reconstruction.\n       While these concerns should be taken seriously, the \n     ultimate success or failure of the Dayton accord--and the \n     chance for sustained peace in the region--will depend on the \n     political will of its signatories.\n       The United States must continue to pressure those \n     signatories to commit themselves fully to that effort.\n\n\n                                Hungary\n\n       The delegation began its investigations in Hungary, host to \n     7000 American troops at three U.S. military installations, \n     including Taszar Airbase, the primary logistics center and \n     staging area for U.S. troops deployed in Bosnia. In meetings \n     with the Deputy Foreign Minister, American troops at Taszar, \n     business leaders in Budapest, and U.S. Embassy officials, the \n     delegation explored issues related to implementation of the \n     Dayton Peace Accord, Hungary's role in supporting the \n     military aspects of the accord, NATO expansion, and Hungary's \n     progress toward fulfillment of the country's political and \n     economic goals.\n       Deputy Foreign Minister Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told the \n     delegation that, while implementation of the military aspects \n     of the Dayton Peace Accord was proceeding in the right \n     direction, he remained concerned about implementation of the \n     political aspects of the accord. He expressed the view that \n     the American and European military presence in Bosnia has \n     been essential to the restoration of peace in the region and \n     that continued U.S. support of the peace effort will be \n     essential to maintenance of that peace and the\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n     safe resettlement of war refugees, including ethnic \n     Hungarians. He reported that Hungary is fully cooperating \n     with the War Crimes Tribunal's efforts to identify, locate, \n     and prosecute perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia.\n       Szent-Ivanyi also stressed Hungary's desire to be included \n     in the first round of candidates for NATO expansion and \n     called for a ``normal integration process.'' He also \n     discussed with the delegation the upcoming official opening \n     of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest to \n     combat organized crime.\n       During a visit to the United States' Intermediate Staging \n     Base in Taszar, Hungary, the delegation was briefed on the \n     massive effort to deploy U.S. forces to Bosnia. Seventy-five \n     to 80 percent of the 18,000 U.S. troops stationed in Bosnia \n     have entered the country through the staging area in Taszar \n     since the deployment began last December.\n       Major General Walter H. Yates, Jr., Deputy Commanding \n     General, V Corps, United States Army, Europe, advised the \n     delegation that the size and configuration of the U.S. \n     deployment in Bosnia would be assessed again in early summer \n     and that any minor adjustments that might be needed would be \n     made at that time. He also reported that, from a military \n     perspective, all sides have been in general compliance with \n     the Dayton Peace Accord. He concluded that the greatest \n     challenge facing the multinational force in Bosnia is the \n     existence of 3 to 8 million landmines in that country. He \n     added that U.S. forces are encouraging, training, and \n     monitoring the work of various factions to deactivate the \n     mines. Finally, the group was told that the Hungarian \n     government has been especially helpful to U.S. military \n     efforts and that U.S. personnel at Taszar is seeking to \n     further its cooperation with Hungary and the local community \n     at the military, political, and civic levels.\n       Senator Daschle addressed the troops in attendance at the \n     briefing, thanking them for their role in the mission and \n     expressing the support of the Senate. He and the entire \n     delegation also had a chance to visit with individual \n     servicemembers.\n\n\n                         Serbia and Montenegro\n\n       In Belgrade, the delegation met with President Slobodan \n     Milosevic, opposition leaders, union leaders, members of the \n     independent press, and U.S. Embassy officials. Discussions \n     focused on Serbia's compliance with the Dayton agreement, \n     cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal, relations with \n     other republics of the former Yugoslavia, movement toward \n     democratization and privatization, the situation in Eastern \n     Slavonia, resettlement of the Krajina Serbs, and progress \n     toward a peaceful solution to the disputes between the \n     government and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n       In its meeting with President Slobodan Milosevic, the \n     delegation reiterated and expressed strong support for U.S. \n     policy concerning normalization of relations with Serbia--\n     that the ``outer wall'' of UN sanctions will remain in place \n     until the Dayton agreement is fully and successfully \n     implemented, Serbia has fully cooperated with the War Crimes \n     Tribunal's effort to arrest and prosecute war criminals, and \n     there is significant progress in Kosovo. The delegation also \n     pressed Milosevic on the need for progress toward the \n     development of democratic institutions, including a free and \n     independent media. The delegation stressed the importance of \n     normalization of Serbian-FYROM relations.\n       Milosevic characterized developments since the signing of \n     the Dayton accord as ``pretty positive,'' concluding that the \n     military aspects of the agreement have been ``absolutely \n     successful'' and that civilian implementation of the \n     agreement has slowed somewhat. Although he said he questions \n     the objectivity of the War Crimes Tribunal, Milosevic stated \n     that Serbia has cooperated with the Tribunal and ``will not \n     protect war criminals.'' While acknowledging that respect for \n     human rights is a ``global issue,'' he called the situation \n     in Kosovo ``an internal matter.'' Milosevic suggested that \n     the independent press in Serbia is thriving and that Serbian-\n     FYROM relations would be normalized in the near future.\n\n\n                                 Bosnia\n\n                                Sarajevo\n\n       The flight over Bosnia and into Sarajevo gave the \n     delegation its first sense of the magnitude of the \n     devastation in that country, and the drives from the Sarajevo \n     airport through the city and through the Sarajevo suburbs \n     revealed the reality of ``ethnic cleansing'' in a way that \n     news reports can only suggest. Burned and bombed buildings \n     lined the main street running through Sarajevo. The \n     delegation's visit to the ruins of the Sarajevo library, \n     which was known as one of the most magnificent buildings in \n     the country was graphic evidence of the war's devastating \n     impact on Bosnia. Some have proposed to leave the library as \n     it currently stands--if it can be stabilized structurally--\n     and turn it into a war memorial.\n       Make-shift cemeteries in what were formerly soccer fields \n     and other public spaces served as sad reminders of the \n     200,000 Bosnians, including 10,000 Sarajevans, who died in \n     the 4\\1/2\\ year war. Still, the resumption of activity all \n     over Sarajevo served as evidence that peace is both hoped for \n     and possible if all sides commit themselves to it.\n       At the U.S. Embassy, the delegation was briefed by Admiral \n     Leighton W. Smith, Jr., Commander in Chief, IFOR (Smith also \n     serves as Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe \n     and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Naval Forces), and by Embassy \n     officials accompanied by various U.S. and international \n     representatives charged with implementation of various \n     aspects of the Dayton accord. The delegation also met with \n     President Alija Izetbegovic.\n       Again, the delegation heard that the military aspects of \n     the Dayton agreement had been very successful, but that \n     civilian implementation of the agreement has proven more \n     complex. Of particular concern were efforts to ensure the \n     Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia remains viable, ensure that \n     the Bosnian elections--at the municipality, canton, entity, \n     and republic levels--are free, fair, and in full compliance \n     with the Dayton guidelines, and ensure the safe resettlement \n     of refugees from all ethnic groups as well as general freedom \n     of movement.\n       The delegation was told by international representatives at \n     the Embassy briefing that Serb, Croat, and Muslim factions \n     within Bosnia all have been accused of varying degrees of \n     authoritarianism and violations of human and civil rights and \n     that concerns about Serbian President Milosevic's and \n     Croatian President Tudjman's interests in pursuing a \n     ``Greater Serbia'' and a ``Greater Croatia'' persist. \n     Nevertheless, most analysts reported that Milosevic and \n     Tudjman appeared to be complying with the Dayton accord, \n     though limits on Serbian cooperation on the release of \n     prisoners continues to pose a serious challenge, and greater \n     cooperation in turning over war criminals remains wanting \n     from both leaders. Furthermore, many are concerned that \n     Bosnian Serb Army Commander Ratko Mladic and Bosnian Serb \n     President Radovan Karadzic are still in control of the \n     Bosnian Serbs, and that Tudjman has been reluctant to \n     disassociate himself from troubling actions by the Bosnian \n     Croats. It is clear that close monitoring of these factors \n     and continued pressure on all sides to comply with the \n     Accord, including the removal of all indicted war criminals \n     from political power and their submission to the Hague, will \n     be important to the long-term viability of the Muslim-Croat \n     Federation and peace in general.\n       The delegation was briefed on efforts to build the civilian \n     police and criminal justice systems in Bosnia. The importance \n     of having these systems in working order by the time the NATO \n     implementation force departs was stressed.\n       In its meeting with President Izetbegovic, the delegation \n     discussed the President Izetbegovic's perspective on the \n     military and civilian implementation of the Dayton Peace \n     Accord; ways to strengthen the Muslim-Croat Federation; \n     progress toward free and fair elections; the importance of \n     freedom of the press; and efforts to ensure that borders in \n     the Dayton Accord, as well as the human rights of all ethnic \n     groups within those borders, are respected. The senators \n     stressed the importance of ensuring that all Iranian and \n     other foreign forces leave Bosnia. The delegation \n     congratulated Izetbegovic for his efforts to release \n     prisoners under Muslim control and reiterated the United \n     States' commitment to a lasting peace and a multiethnic \n     Bosnia.\n\n                             Tuzla Airbase\n\n       After an aerial tour of the devastation of countless \n     Bosnian villages, the delegation was briefed by U.S. military \n     personnel, led by Major General William L. Nash, Commanding \n     General, First Armored Division, Operation Joint Endeavor, \n     and Colonel John R. S. Batiste, Commander, Second Brigade, \n     First Armored Division, Operation Joint Endeavor. They \n     described a combat team evenly distributed between the \n     Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation and stressed \n     the importance of operating within both entities in an even-\n     handed, impartial way and always reflecting the competence \n     and discipline that have given NATO the legitimacy to make \n     this operation a success. Batiste stated that IFOR operates \n     on the premise that any violation of the peace accord demands \n     an appropriate response.\n       Colonel Batiste reported that contact between the Muslim, \n     Croat, and Serb factions in Bosnia has become less \n     confrontational over time, but that civilian freedom of \n     movement has been restricted by all factions and that this is \n     a key area of concern. He stated that exemplary U.S.-Russian \n     troop cooperation has led to combined patrols and that the \n     U.S. military's relationships with both NATO and non-NATO \n     countries involved in the mission has been excellent.\n       Reiterating what the delegation had heard in Hungary, \n     Colonel Batiste reported that one of the greatest challenges \n     facing IFOR is the threat posed by remaining landmines. He \n     said there had been good cooperation in clearing the \n     minefields for which there are records but that only 30 to 40 \n     percent of the mines are included in that category. He \n     reported that, on the previous day, 68 mines in the area had \n     been cleared through the Mine Action Center in Tuzla. Only \n     minutes after the delegation was given that information, \n     Colonel Batiste's briefing was interrupted by a report that a \n     Russian soldier had just lost his foot in a mine explosion.\n       Colonel Batiste stressed the importance of the effort to \n     ensure that the political and civilian aspects of the Dayton \n     accord are fully implemented and to keep the economic \n     reconstruction effort on track. He discussed the difficulties \n     related to the election process, since many, particularly \n     Serbs, are uninformed about where they must vote (under the \n     Dayton agreement, all Bosnians' voting\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\n     eligibility is based on where they lived in the spring of \n     1990 before the war began). The economic impact of Serb, \n     Muslim, and Croat army downsizing was also discussed, as were \n     the ongoing effort at arms control within Bosnia and the \n     importance of the development of a professional, civilian \n     police force.\n       The delegation was briefed on the medical facilities \n     serving U.S. forces (every lodgement has a medic and a \n     surgeon) and advised that environmental data collection that \n     might be needed in any follow-up health investigations has \n     been vigorous.\n       Senators Daschle, Hatch, and Reid addressed the servicemen \n     and women at the briefing, acknowledging their personal \n     sacrifices and praising and thanking them for the \n     professionalism with which they are carrying out their \n     mission. Members of the delegation also had an opportunity to \n     share a lunch of soup and MREs (meals ready to eat) with \n     personnel from their respective states.\n\n\n                                Albania\n\n       The delegation's visit to Albania was marked by visual \n     impressions as much as verbal reports. As soon as the plane \n     made its descent, the American mental image of one of the \n     world's most closed societies was overshadowed by the reality \n     of a green, mountainous countryside and a capital filled with \n     activity. Reminders of Albania's past, including 600,000 to \n     750,000 seven-ton concrete-and-steel bunkers built to respond \n     to the perceived threat of simultaneous attacks from NATO and \n     the Warsaw Pact, remain, but the future is clearly Albania's \n     focus.\n       In Tirana, in addition to sessions with the President and \n     opposition leaders, the delegation met with U.S. Embassy \n     officials joined by representatives of the U.S. Information \n     Agency and the U.S. Peace Corps mission in Albania. They were \n     briefed on the repression suffered by the Albanians for 40 \n     years at the hands of dictator Enver Hoxha. It is estimated \n     that 25 to 30 percent of Albanian families experienced that \n     repression--imprisonment, exile, torture, or execution--\n     firsthand. Albania had been a bankrupted economy that for \n     decades had outlawed private ownership of cars, monitored the \n     direction of people's television antennas, and declared \n     itself atheist, turning its largest Catholic cathedral into a \n     basketball court to prove it. In April 1992, Albania elected \n     a new president and was on its way to filling its streets \n     with cars and every other form of transportation, tuning in \n     to ``CNN International,'' erecting coffeehouses on every city \n     curb, privatizing its economy, and reducing inflation from \n     400 percent to single digits.\n       Certainly Albania faces serious challenges. According to \n     the briefing team, reports of discrimination against the \n     ethnic Greek minority continue; criminal justice and judicial \n     reforms are needed; the state controls Albania's electronic \n     media; the civilian police force is ill-trained; opposition \n     parties complain the country's ``Lustration'' law, which bars \n     certain former communist officials and others from seeking \n     political office until 2002, is too broad; the military is \n     severely underfunded; and the country's economy and \n     infrastructure have a long way to go. Still, they report that \n     Albania has made significant progress toward the \n     establishment of democracy.\n       In a meeting with the delegation, Albanian President Sali \n     Berisha reported that his administration has focused on \n     efforts to promote fast growth, make possible integration \n     into NATO and the European Union, and improve educational \n     opportunities within the country. He thanked the delegation \n     for U.S. support for progress in Albania and reported that \n     U.S.-Albanian military cooperation has been especially good. \n     He also expressed thanks for U.S.A.I.D.'s reforestation \n     program in Albania, adding that the construction of the \n     ubiquitous bunkers had caused serious damage to Albania's \n     forests.\n       President Berisha added his voice to those who rate the \n     military implementation of the Dayton accord as successful \n     and the political progress slow. He also provided an Albanian \n     perspective on the situation in Kosova, saying that Albania \n     wants a peaceful solution with Serbia. He defended Albania's \n     Lustration law, arguing that Albania faced a true ``cultural \n     genocide'' at the hands of its former rulers and that \n     those barred from political candidacy may appeal that \n     ruling if they can show that documents linking them to \n     abuses have been falsified. He addressed concerns about \n     state-controlled media outlets by saying that private \n     entities are forming and that state-controlled outlets \n     will be privatized as independent outlets develop.\n       President Berisha expressed optimism about Greek-Albanian \n     relations and discussed the process in place for Albania's \n     upcoming elections. He concluded by saying that Albania's \n     greatest challenges are to maintain the country's fast \n     economic growth and continue to build its democratic \n     institutions.\n\n\n             Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)\n\n       The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the only \n     former republic to make a completely peaceful transition to \n     independence, and, in virtually every discussion the \n     delegation had with political leaders in that country, a \n     pragmatic and democratic attitude about how to approach \n     problems and resolve disputes was reflected. The delegation \n     met with Tito Petkovski, President of the Macedonian \n     Parliament, Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, and President \n     Kiro Gligorov, as well as U.S. Embassy officials. The \n     discussions focused on implementation of the Dayton accord, \n     the impact of potential instability in Bosnia and Kosovo on \n     the FYROM, the FYROM's political process, efforts to fully \n     privatize the country's economy, and the FYROM's relations \n     with its neighbors. The delegation also visited two U.N. \n     Preventative Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) observation posts \n     along the Serbian border.\n       Parliament President Tito Petkovski advised the delegation \n     that Serbia and the FYROM had agreed within the previous 24 \n     hours to establish full diplomatic relations, though the \n     details of the agreement were not fully available at the time \n     of the meeting. He said he was hopeful that the issue of his \n     country's name could be resolved with Greece in the near \n     future and noted that his country has no other open problems \n     with Greece. Petkovski stressed the importance of a lasting \n     peace in Bosnia, saying that failure to fully implement the \n     Dayton accord would threaten the FYROM's stability. He \n     thanked the delegation for the United States' military \n     cooperation and support of FYROM's efforts to develop \n     democratic institutions and a stronger economy. Petkovski \n     also briefed the delegation on the parliament's preparation \n     of a new electoral law and the current situation with respect \n     to political parties in the FYROM.\n       Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski declared the UN military \n     presence, led by a force of 550 Americans, to be an \n     overwhelming success, arguing that such preventive efforts \n     are much more cost-effective than war, and predicted that the \n     deployment would serve as a prototype for other deployments. \n     He discussed the impact on the FYROM's economy of past UN \n     sanctions against Serbia and stressed the importance of \n     turning around the negative economic trends that have been \n     suffered by the Macedonian people. Crvenkovski acknowledged \n     the difficulties the FYROM has faced in the area of the \n     schooling for ethnic Albanians and outlined the FYROM's plan \n     to increase the percentage of classes taught in the Albanian \n     language. He also noted the importance of stabilizing the \n     situation in Kosovo.\n       The delegation met with President Kiro Gligorov and was \n     pleased to learn both that he had recovered well from his \n     injuries resulting from an assassination attempt several \n     months earlier, and that, during his absence from office, the \n     FYROM government adhered strictly to its constitutional \n     precepts. President Gligorov spoke of the resiliency of the \n     Macedonian people and their willingness to accept great \n     personal sacrifices to achieve independence and democracy. He \n     expressed his commitment to a peaceful, fair resolution of \n     the Kosovo issue and, like Petkovski and Crvenkovski, noted \n     that Albanians are active participants in FYROM's government. \n     Gligorov spoke of his country's two most basic challenges and \n     obligations during the war in Bosnia were: to do nothing to \n     cause the expansion of the war to the south and to care for \n     the FYROM's internal stability. He noted that he had \n     substantial support from the United States in these efforts. \n     Gligorov expressed the hope that continued US-FYROM \n     cooperation would lead to his country's integration into NATO \n     and the European Union.\n       The delegation traveled by helicopter to two U.S.-operated \n     UNPREDEP observation posts along the Serbian border, meeting \n     with servicemembers at each post. Five hundred fifty U.S. \n     troops are stationed in the FYROM as part of this effort, \n     first proposed by President Bush and later implemented by \n     President Clinton, to monitor the FYROM-Serbia border and \n     prevent the Bosnian conflict from spreading to the south.\n\n\n                                Slovenia\n\n       In addition to a briefing from U.S. Embassy officials, the \n     delegation's visit to Slovenia, the most economically \n     advanced country of the former Yugoslavia, was marked by \n     meetings with President Milan Kucan, State Secretary Ignac \n     Golob, and Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek.\n       In the meeting with President Kucan, the delegation \n     discussed the historic roots of Slovenia, which he described \n     as a traditional identification with Austria-Hungary that has \n     manifested itself in the Slovenian people through \n     individualism, realism, a strong work ethic, and tolerance of \n     different peoples. He stated that Tito interrupted that \n     tradition but that Slovenia has maintained its Central \n     European, rather than Balkan, orientation.\n       With respect to the break-up of Yugoslavia, Kucan argued \n     that, while Islam and socialism had served as integrating \n     elements beginning in 1918, there had been no ``new idea'' to \n     keep Yugoslavia unified beyond those periods. He called that \n     explanation an oversimplification, but said he believed it \n     was a major factor in the former Yugoslav republics' \n     declarations of independence.\n       Kucan called the Dayton agreement ``a decisive point,'' \n     stating that the United States had successfully interrupted \n     the cycle of violence and ignorance. He reiterated what many \n     others had said about the roots of the conflict--that the war \n     was not a civil or religious one, but an attempt to use \n     ultranationalism to create a ``Greater Serbia'' and, later, a \n     ``Greater Croatia'' by exporting the war to Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina. Kucan stated that the U.S. presence has been \n     critical to the effort to prevent resumption of the war, he \n     believes the ultimate success of the Dayton accord will \n     depend on a commitment to that peace reflected in Belgrade \n     and Zagreb, and he called for continued U.S. and European \n     pressure on Serbia and Croatia toward that end.\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\n       Kucan also discussed Slovenia's current dispute with Italy \n     over Slovene land that was owned by Italians before 1945. The \n     Slovene parliament was to consider a law to ease restrictions \n     on foreign ownership of property later that day. (The \n     parliament did later approve a proposal by the Spanish \n     presidency of the European Union to resolve the dispute. The \n     Italians foreign ministry has responded positively, but the \n     final outcome of the issue, which rests in the Italian \n     parliament, remains uncertain.)\n       With State Secretary Golob of the Ministry of Foreign \n     Affairs, the delegation discussed the Kosovo issue. Golob \n     shared the view of many others--that war in Kosovo would \n     destabilize the entire region and that the foreign presence \n     in the area--particularly that of the United States--is \n     ``extremely important.'' He described the situation in the \n     former Yugoslavia as ``complicated, but not hopeless,'' and \n     argued that the price the international community is paying \n     for the IFOR deployment is small compared to the costs that \n     would be associated with failure in Bosnia and a spread of \n     the war.\n       Prime Minister Drnovsek also argued the legitimacy and \n     importance of the U.S. role in Bosnia. He acknowledged the \n     challenges the involvement poses for the United States in the \n     short term, but expressed its long-term value in terms of the \n     cost-effectiveness of prevention as well as the benefit of \n     helping small democracies develop in Central Europe and the \n     Balkans. He said, ``You who espouse democracy, and have \n     enjoyed it for 200 years, have the opportunity to see people \n     who have lived for generations under tyranny, dictatorship, \n     and communism now breathe freely under democracy. We, the \n     small struggling republics, could be like you.''\n\n\n                                Croatia\n\n       In addition to a briefing from the Ambassador and other \n     U.S. Embassy officials in Zagreb, the delegation met with \n     Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to discuss progress related \n     to implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord, the prospects \n     for long-term peace in the region, and the investigation of \n     the crash of Secretary Brown's plane in Dubrovnik.\n       The delegation thanked President Tudjman for Croatia's \n     assistance in the aftermath of the plane crash and expressed \n     the delegation's and the United States' interest in \n     continuing the mission that Secretary Brown started. The \n     senators pressed Tudjman on the importance to U.S.-Croatian \n     relations of continued progress toward democratization and \n     privatization. The delegation also indicated that the United \n     States would be monitoring the following issues over the next \n     6 to 18 months: continued support for the Muslim-Croat \n     Federation, including respect for Bosnia's borders and \n     protection of human rights within those borders, and for \n     peaceful resolutions of regional disputes; fair treatment and \n     resettlement of Serbs who lived in Croatia before the war; \n     continued progress in Eastern Slavonia; and cooperation with \n     the War Crimes Tribunal. The delegation stated that the \n     United States is looking to Croatia for leadership toward a \n     lasting peace in the region.\n       Tudjman reported that good progress is being made in \n     Eastern Slavonia, and supported the idea of Serb family \n     reunification, but said that it ``would not be realistic'' to \n     expect the return of all Serbs from that region. He argued \n     that Bosnian Croats have been more cooperative than Bosnian \n     Muslims with respect to implementation of the Dayton \n     agreement and pointed to recent problems in Mostar to support \n     that claim. Still, Tudjman called himself ``an optimist,'' \n     saying that optimism is based on peace being in Croatia's \n     strategic interest and the Bosnians having no other option. \n     He summarily dismissed rumors of his willingness to enter \n     into an agreement with Serbian President Milosevic to divide \n     Bosnia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6404-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GOOD SAMARITAN CENTER'S 50 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

For half a century, the center has been an \nintegral part of the Tyndall community, serving the elderly with \nrespect and compassion. Most importantly, the Good Samaritan Center \nensures that its residents can continue to live close to their friends \nand loved ones, and in the towns in which many of them have spent their \nentire lives.

Mr. President, the United States and the Republic of \nPanama enjoy a long and strong relationship between our two nations, \none that stretches back to the 1904 founding of Panama. Since that \ntime, these two great American nations have worked together to build \npartnerships for peace and prosperity that have not only greatly \nbenefited our respective countries, but all the states of the American \ncontinents. During these 92 years, Panamanian and American officials \nand citizens have built countless friendships, and I rise today to \nshare with my colleagues the unfortunate news that a man most of us \nknow and like very much, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Panama \nGabriel Lewis, is resigning his position due to illness.\n  Minister Lewis' contributions to his nation are well known and well \nrespected. He has served Panama faithfully and selflessly during his \ncareer, and through his service, he has worked to make his nation a \nbetter and stronger place for its citizens. Perhaps Minister Lewis' \ngreatest legacy and contribution to his countrymen, though, is the \nleading role he took in opposing the dictatorial and criminal regime of \nthe former Panamanian strongman, Manuel Noriega.\n  Bringing Noriega to justice and holding him accountable for his \nillegal and immoral behavior took thousands of individuals to commit \nacts of great courage. It took courage for Panamanian citizens to take \nto the streets and protest the regime of Noriega and to face his riot \npolice and organized thugs dubiously titled ``Dignity Battalions''; \nand, it took courage for the young soldiers of the 82d Airborne and the \n7th Infantry Divisions to engage in combat with the well trained and \nequipped Panamanian Defense Force. It took great courage for Minister \nLewis to openly defy and condemn the government of his nation, and to \ntake Noriega and his puppet advisers to task for attempting to quash \ndemocracy and ignore the basic civil rights of their citizens. Minister \nLewis' leadership in the international community during that time of \ncrisis was just as critical to the successful outcome of Operation Just \nCause, and the arrest and conviction of Noriega as were the \ncontributions made by the people of Panama or the military personnel of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, though I am sure that those who know Minister Lewis \nare sorry to see him leave his post as Foreign Minister of the Republic \nof Panama, I am pleased to note that our friend is not leaving public \nservice. Recognizing an individual of unusual characteristics and \nqualities, the President of Panama has appointed Gabriel Lewis to be \nhis senior counsel, with cabinet rank. I am confident that Minister \nLewis will continue to make many valuable contributions to the people \nand nation of Panama through this new position, and that he will also \ncontinue to work to maintain and further strengthen the friendship \nbetween our nations, as well as to further the march of democracy \nthroughout Latin America. I wish him success in his work as senior \ncounsel, and for a speedy and complete recovery to his full health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6407-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am sure that we all have high standards \nfor accuracy on this floor, and therefore I wish to comment on certain \nstatements which have been made in recent days.\n  On June 7, the junior Senator from Oklahoma mistakenly represented \nthat\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\nthe Senate had voted on a version of the balanced budget amendment in \nthe 103d Congress that was ``identically the same'' as the version \nvoted on in the 104th Congress. He then mistakenly inserted into the \nCongressional Record copes of two resolutions when he represented to be \n``the two resolutions that we voted on * * *.''\n  In fact, he inserted into the Record copies of the resolutions as \nintroduced, but not as amended and actually voted on by the Senate. The \ntwo resolutions which were ultimately voted on contained language \ndifferences concerning judicial review.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota and I had a colloquy with \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. As we pointed out then, the language \ndifferences were not the primary reasons for our votes in opposition to \nthe balanced budget amendment in the 104th Congress. Our opposition \nstemmed mainly from the dramatic change in the interpretation of \nsection 6 of the proposal concerning implementing language--regarding \nthe intention to count the annual surplus in the Social Security trust \nfund. However, since the Senator from Oklahoma was attempting to \nportray the issue in a simple black-and-white fashion--as two votes on \nidentical proposals--we sought to clarify for the Record that the \nrepresentations he made were flat out wrong.\n  Last Friday, the junior Senator from Oklahoma again took the floor to \ndiscuss this matter. He stated that, after all, the two resolutions \nreally were ``exactly the same thing'' since both added language \ndealing with the issue of judicial review. Therefore, even though the \nlanguage was different, certain Senators ``turned right around and \nactively opposed the same exact language in a balanced budget \namendment'' that they had earlier supported in 1994.\n  The junior Senator from Oklahoma then quoted the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, who authored a 1995 amendment on \njudicial review. What the Senator from Georgia actually said on \nFebruary 28, 1995 was that his amendment on judicial review was \n``similar to the Danforth amendment we agreed to last year and the \nJohnston amendment, which was defeated last week'' by a vote of 47 to \n52.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Danforth amendment from 1994 and the \nJohnston and Nunn amendments from 1995, each of which amends section 6 \nof the balanced budget amendment, be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Danforth Amendment\n\n       The power of any court to order relief pursuant to any case \n     or controversy arising under this Article shall not extend to \n     ordering any remedies other than a declaratory judgment or \n     such remedies as are specifically authorized in implementing \n     legislation pursuant to this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Johnston Amendment\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article except for \n     section 2 hereof, or as may be specifically authorized in \n     implementing legislation pursuant to this section.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                             Nunn Amendment\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall not extend to \n     any case or controversy arising under this article except as \n     may be specifically authorized by legislation adopted \n     pursuant to this section.\n\n  Mr. FORD. As the Senator from Georgia noted, all three amendments are \nsimilar. The Senator form Oklahoma says the Danforth and Nunn \namendments are ``exactly the same thing.'' Yet last year he voted \nagainst the Johnston amendment, which also dealt with judicial review. \nPerhaps the next time we are discussing identical proposals on the \nbalanced budget amendment, the junior Senator from Oklahoma can inform \nall of us concerning what was so different about the Johnston amendment \non judicial review to justify his different positions. I would think he \nwould consider it to be the same exact language. The junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma continues to try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6407-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6408-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following resolution was read and referred as indicated:\n\n       S.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to make \navailable for obligation such sums as are necessary to pay the Federal \nshare of completion of construction of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n       The Appalachian Development Highway System Completion Act\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System Completion Act of 1997. This bill will \nensure that adequate funds will be disbursed to complete the \nAppalachian Development Highway System by the year 2003, some 38 years \nafter the Federal Government first committed itself to the completion \nof this critical highway network.\n  We are quickly approaching the expiration of the funding \nauthorizations contained in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, or ISTEA as it is commonly referred to. Our colleagues \nin the other body have already begun hearings on the reauthorization of \nISTEA, and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin \nefforts toward that end in the next several months. As we approach the \ndrafting of a new comprehensive multiyear highway bill, I want to call \nthe attention of my Senate colleagues to the proposal to ensure that \nthe Federal Government finally fulfills its commitment to providing \nadequate highway access throughout the Appalachian region.\n  The necessity to expand highway access to spur the development of the \nAppalachian region was first cited by the President's Appalachian \nRegional Commission of 1964, 32 years ago. The commission's report \nstated:\n\n       Developmental activities in Appalachia cannot proceed until \n     the regional isolation has been overcome by a transportation \n     network which provides access to and from the rest of the \n     Nation and within the region itself. The remoteness and \n     isolation of the region lying directly adjacent to the \n     greatest concentration of people and wealth in the country \n     are the very bases of Appalachian life. Penetration by an \n     adequate transportation network is the first requisite of its \n     full participation in industrial America.\n\n  One year later, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 \nauthorized several programs for the development of the region, the \nfirst of which called for the construction of a new highway \nnetwork. According to the act, these highways ``will open up an area or \nareas with a developmental potential where commerce and communication \nhave been inhibited by lack of adequate access.''\n\n  Mr. President, subsequent amendments to the act defined the 3,025 \nmiles that comprise the Appalachian Development Highway System. \nUnfortunately, today we find that while the Interstate Highway System \nis virtually 100 percent complete, the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem is only 76 percent complete. Of the 3,025 miles that comprise \nthe Appalachian system, roughly 725 miles remain unfinished more than \n30 years after the system was promised.\n  These unfinished miles, spread throughout the 13 States that have \ncounties within the statutorily designated boundaries of Appalachia, \nawait completion. Those States include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, \nMaryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. All of West \nVirginia is within Appalachia. West Virginia is the only State that is \nwholly within Appalachia.\n  While the completion of the Interstate Highway System did play a role \nin the development of certain parts of Appalachia, the interstate \nsystem largely bypassed the Appalachian region due to the extremely \nhigh costs associated with building roads through Appalachia's rugged \ntopography. As a result, the construction of the interstates had the \ndetrimental effect of drawing passengers and freight, and their \naccompanying economic benefits, away from the Appalachian region. This \nleft the Appalachian region with a transportation infrastructure of \ndangerous, narrow, winding roads that followed the paths of river \nvalleys and streambeds between mountains. These roads are, more often \nthan not, two-lane roads that are required to be squeezed into very \nlimited rights-of-way. They are characterized by low travel speeds and \nlong travel distances due to the winding roadway pattern. They were \noften built to inadequate design standards and, therefore, present very \nhazardous driving conditions.\n  For those areas where the Appalachian Development Highway System has \nbeen completed, we have seen stunning economic successes. The \nAppalachian Regional Commission has completed surveys indicating that \nof the hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created in the \nAppalachian region over recent decades, over 80 percent of these jobs \nhave been located along either the Appalachian highway system or the \nInterstate Highway System.\n  We have seen this in West Virginia as we have seen it in each of the \nother 12 States that comprise the Appalachian region. Unfortunately, we \nhave also seen that in those areas where the Appalachian Development \nHighway System has not been completed, it is almost impossible for \ncommunities to compete for large employers due to poor access to \nnational markets.\n  Mr. President, the rationale behind the completion of the Appalachian \nhighway system is no less sound today than it was 32 years ago--in \n1964. Unfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack \ndecent transportation routes to schools. There are still pregnant \nwomen, elderly citizens, and others who lack timely road access to area \nhospitals. There are thousands of people who certainly find it very \ndifficult to obtain sustainable, well-paying jobs because of poor road \naccess to the major employment centers.\n  Mr. President, the people of Appalachia have waited long enough for \nthe Federal Government to fulfill its commitment to the Appalachian \nregion. The bill I am introducing today will ensure that sufficient \nfunds are set aside in the next major highway bill to complete the \nremaining 24 percent of the Appalachian Development Highway System.\n\n  This bill takes a different approach from that of the prior \nauthorization acts for the Appalachian highway system. The bill calls \nfor direct contract authority to be made available from the highway \ntrust fund to be distributed to the States of the Appalachian region \nsolely for the purpose of completing the 725 unfinished miles of the \nAppalachian Development Highway System.\n  One of the primary reasons why completion of the Appalachian highway \nsystem has lagged behind that of the Interstate Highway System is \nbecause the interstate system has benefited from the direct \navailability of highway trust funds, while the Appalachian Development \nHighway System has been required to be financed largely through \nincremental annual appropriations of general funds.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Appalachian Development Highway System is no \nless deserving of highway trust funds than any other major arterial \nroad system. The 725 miles of the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem that await completion represent just 1.6 percent of the size of \nour completed Interstate Highway System. They represent less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the size of the National Highway System, just \ndesignated in law in 1995. It is certainly high time that the funding \nmechanism for the Appalachian Development Highway System be put on a \npar with those of other highway systems of national significance that \nare customarily funded through direct contract authority from the trust \nfund.\n  The bill I introduce today also makes clear that funds provided to \nthe Appalachian States for the completion of the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System will be provided in addition to the funds \nthat those States will receive from the Federal aid highway program for \ntheir customary purposes. These States should not be required to choose \nbetween the maintenance of their interstate and other Federal highways \nand the completion of the Appalachian system. It would not be fair to \nthe\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nStates of the Appalachian region to give with the one hand and take \naway with the other.\n  Under this bill, States will still be required to provide the \nstandard 20 percent matching share for Federal funds for the completion \nof these highways, as is the case for all major Federal aid highway \nprograms. The bill authorizes the Secretary to distribute such sums as \nare necessary for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission, with the cooperation of the \nFederal Highway Administration, is currently updating its estimate for \nthe cost to complete the system. I anticipate that when this bill is \nincorporated into next year's highway legislation, it will identify and \nauthorize the appropriate dollar figure that results from this ongoing \nstudy.\n  I should point out, Mr. President, that the administration shares my \ngoal for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System \nin the near term. I recently wrote to the President regarding my \nconcern in this area.\n  OMB Director, Alice Rivlin, responding for the President, stated that \nit is the administration's goal to complete the construction of the \nsystem by the year 2005. In response to my questions during a recent \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Secretary Pena also \nsignaled his support and cooperation.\n  Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. \nOur entire Nation has benefited from the improvements brought about by \nthe Appalachian Development Highway System and so, too, will we all \nbenefit from its completion in the near future.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1882. A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nto include medical foods as a specific item for which coverage may be \nprovided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                       Medical Foods Legislation\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nclarify the ability of fee-for-service plans in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program [FEHBP] to provide coverage for medical foods.\n  Medical foods are a liquid formula given to a patient under the \nsupervision of a doctor in cases where patients cannot take solid foods \nto meet their nutritional needs. Medical foods are often used for \npatients with AIDS or patients undergoing chemotherapy and have \ndifficulty taking solid foods.\n  So this bill would amend title 5 of the United States Code to include \nmedical foods specifically in the list of items and services that can \nbe covered by fee-for-service plans serving FEHBP beneficiaries. This \nlegislation would not mandate coverage of medical foods. It simply \nclarifies that fee-for-service plans can provide coverage for medical \nfoods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6409-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6410-S6411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Bryan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 684, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for programs of research regarding \nParkinson's disease, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 794\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the names of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 794, a bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act to facilitate the minor use of a \npesticide, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 949, a bill to require \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the \n200th anniversary of the death of George Washington.\n\n\n                                S. 1035\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1035, a bill to permit \nan individual to be treated by a health care practitioner with any \nmethod of medical treatment such individual requests, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1095\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the names of the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Wyden] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1095, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to extend permanently the exclusion for educational assistance \nprovided by employers to employees.\n\n\n                                S. 1237\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1237, a bill to amend \ncertain provisions of law relating to child pornography, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1400\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1400, a bill to \nrequire the Secretary of Labor to issue guidance as to the application \nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to insurance \ncompany general accounts.\n\n\n                                S. 1477\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nTennessee [Mr. Frist] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1477, a bill to \namend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health \nService Act to improve the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and \nbiological products, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1506\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the names of the Senator from Alabama \n[Mr. Shelby] and the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1506, a bill to provide for a reduction in regulatory \ncosts by maintaining Federal average fuel economy standards applicable \nto automobiles in effect at current levels until changed by law, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1632\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1632, a bill \nto prohibit persons convicted of a crime involving domestic violence \nfrom owning or possessing firearms, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] and the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1669, a bill to name the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs medical center in Jackson, MS, as the ``G.V.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDaniel Healy as he celebrates the completion of 50 years as a New \nHampshire State lawmaker. Dan Healy is the longest serving State \nlegislator in the history of\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nNew Hampshire and the United States. I commend him and thank him for \nhis long career of service to the Granite State.\n  Representative Healy, a Democrat from Manchester, currently holds the \nhonorary title of Dean of the House. Mr. Healy is the longest serving \nState legislator in the history of New Hampshire and the United States. \nFirst elected in 1944, he is the only person in the state's history to \nbe elected 25 times to the New Hampshire House.\n  Dan is the son of an Irish immigrant, attended Georgetown School of \nLaw and began his career as a lawyer. He has seen the terms of 11 \nPresidents as well as 12 New Hampshire Governors. In addition, he was a \ndelegate to the 1938, 1964, and 1974 constitutional conventions. He has \nseen the beginning and the end of the cold war in office. Daniel was \nserving the city of Manchester as it celebrated its 100th anniversary, \nand he is still serving as the city celebrates its 150th anniversary \nthis year. Secretary of State Bill Gardener says of the 88-year-old \nHealy that it is his ``conservative nature and Yankee sensibility'' \nthat brought him success and longevity.\n  Daniel Healy's career bears the marks of dignity and distinction from \nits earliest days. He epitomizes the concept of public servant, \nfaithfully representing his constituents for the past 50 years. Their \nconfidence in him is apparent as he completes his 25th consecutive term \nin office. As he has been in ill health, the 50th anniversary \ncelebration marks his first visit to the State House this year. His \nrecord of public service to the State of New Hampshire is outstanding, \nhaving devoted his life to serving the Granite State. The public trust \nhas been and continues to be safe in the hands of Dan Healy.\n  I commend Dan Healy for his long career of excellence in public \noffice. He is a New Hampshire institution and I would like to take this \nopportunity to wish him well. I hope that New Hampshire may continue to \nbe blessed by his faithful leadership and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6412-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JUNETEENTH DAY\n\n   Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to join my fellow \ncitizens of the State of Wisconsin in celebrating the 25th anniversary \nof Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee, WI. Juneteenth Day commemorates the day \non which the last slaves in the United States learned of their freedom. \nWhile the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Lincoln on \nJanuary 1, 1863, represents an important step in the African-American \npopulation's quest for freedom and equality, Juneteenth Day, or June \n19, 1865, marks the final abolition of slavery in the United States and \nthus occupies a special place in our Nation's history.\n  The celebration of Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee, WI, dates back to \n1971 when the staff at Northcott Neighborhood House initiated the \ncelebration. Juneteenth Day simultaneously pays homage to the African-\nAmerican struggle for freedom and equality, commemorates the end of \nslavery, and celebrates the rich and varied contributions of African-\nAmericans to the fabric of American society.\n  This year, on the 25th anniversary of Juneteenth Day in Milwaukee, \nthe contributions of several individuals were honored. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to extend special recognition to Margaret \nHenningsen, whose extensive work in the community has touched the lives \nof many, and to the memories of Jan Kemp-Cole, Terrance Pitts, and O.C. \nWhite, all of whom made tremendous contributions to the Milwaukee \ncommunity. The lives and work of these individuals embody the spirit of \nJuneteenth Day: A celebration of African-American achievement, culture, \nand history.\n  Juneteenth celebrations throughout the Nation serve to reaffirm the \nideals, goals, and dreams of all African-Americans. While much has been \nachieved in the years since President Lincoln signed the Emancipation \nProclamation, the fight for equality continues and we must pursue the \ndream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that all children ``not be judged \nby the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'' I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in celebrating Juneteenth Day, a day of \nfreedom, pride, and dignity in the African-American community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6413-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE THEODORE ROOSEVELT DAM IN HISTORY\n\n   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on March 18, 1911, Teddy Roosevelt \nstood at the conjunction of the Salt River and Tonto Creek in the Salt \nRiver Valley, and pushed a button to release water from the dam that \nhad been named after him. The harnessing of the Salt River 85 years ago \ncreated a lake that is 30 miles long, 4 miles wide, and a tribute to \nthe dogged determination of turn-of-the-century engineers, political \nleaders, and residents of the local Indian and Anglo communities. At \nthe rededication of the dam this spring -- the ceremony marked the \ncompletion of a 9-year makeover by the Salt River project--I and some \n2,000 other Arizonans gathered to celebrate this historic \naccomplishment.\n  From this distance in time, it is easy to forget that harnessing \nwater to make the desert bloom put American political and technological \ningenuity to a severe test. In the late 1800's, east-coast investors \nhad first planned to build a masonry dam to tame the Salt River, but \nthey proved unable to raise the $3 million necessary for this vast \nproject. Only the Federal Government could do it. Just as in our own \nday, many different interests had to be reconciled before this mammoth \neffort could begin. As the historian Thomas Sheridan writes:\n\n       Debate raged between farmers and speculators, between small \n     farmers and large landowners like Dwight Heard and Alexander \n     Chandler, between those who favored federal involvement and \n     those who wanted Maricopa County or Arizona Territory to take \n     control.\n\n  The man who made it all come together was Benjamin Fowler of Chicago, \nwho had moved west for his health. Fowler was a private citizen who was \nable, Sheridan says, to ``talk his fellow farmers into hammering out a \nplan the Government would approve.'' In 1903, the Salt River Valley \nWater Users' Association--today's Salt River project--was incorporated, \nand a complex yet workable public-private partnership was born. Two \nyears later, ground was broken on the site, and the water control \nproject commenced.\n  Instead of calling for the huge masonry structure that was originally \nenvisioned, the U.S. Geological Survey plan made use of a natural rock \nbasin to create the dam. Conditions at the Tonto Basin were gruelling: \nIn the parching heat, laborers lowered themselves off steep cliffs on \nlifelines in order to hack roads out of solid rock. The setbacks were \nmany. Temporary dams and flues were swept away by the floods of 1905. \nThe transmission of electrical current to run heavy equipment caused \none fatal accident; three others were drowned during construction of \nconcrete bridges over the Grand Canal. But gradually, block by heavy \nblock, the stone and concrete structure rose 284 feet from the river \nbed. Hundreds of geologists, stonecutters, zanjeros--gate operators,--\nlaborers, and engineers had reclaimed the Great American Desert, \nturning Arizona's unnavigable waterways into irrigation for fields of \ngrain, vegetables, cotton, and livestock.\n  Today, the Salt River project continues the partnership of Arizona \ncitizens and the Federal Government by operating the dam on behalf of \nthe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The SRP's work has enabled the \nRoosevelt Dam, which, at 85, is 19 years older than Nevada's Hoover \nDam, to keep up with the times. The average family of four uses 325,851 \ngallons of water in 1 year. The recently completed renovation has \nincreased the dam's height and capacity, adding storage for flood \ncontrol as well as enabling the facility to serve another 1.2 million \nin population. As the valley's population grows, and as more and more \nrecreational users flock to the camp grounds of Roosevelt Lake, the \nRoosevelt Dam bears out the vision of those who planned, risked, and \nsweated to bring it into existence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6413-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6413-S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF CHARLES A. FUSELIER, NATIONAL SHERIFF OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise to honor Sheriff Charles Fuselier who has been named sheriff of \nthe year by the National Sheriffs' Association. The renowned national \nFerris E. Lucus Award presented annually by the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, recognizes\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\nthe accomplishments, outstanding public service and strong leadership \nqualities of its recipient. Of the forty-two sheriffs in the Nation to \nhave been nominated, Sheriff Fuselier holds the distinction of being \nthe first sheriff from Louisiana to receive this most prestigious \naward.\n  Sheriff Fuselier, who is currently serving his fifth term in office, \nis a very valuable resource both to St. Martin Parish and the State of \nLouisiana. He has demonstrated time and time again his dedication to \nthe citizens of St. Martin Parish through his many accomplishments \nwhich have touched the lives of many people and had an overwhelmingly \npositive impact on the State as a whole.\n  When Sheriff Fuselier took office in 1980, the staff consisted of 28 \ndeputies. Currently, the sheriff's office boasts a 160 deputy staff. \nThis is just one of the many instances where Sheriff Fuselier \nrecognized a critical need and took the necessary steps to better serve \nthe people of St. Martin Parish. Other examples of his leadership and \ndedication include the establishment of law enforcement centers, parish \nprisons and a special emergency reaction team. Sheriff Fuselier has not \nonly recognized the law enforcement needs of the parish but also the \nindividuals under his care with the implementation of an inmate \nrehabilitation program.\n  Due to his tireless efforts to enhance the delivery of law \nenforcement services and combat the victimization of older persons, \nSheriff Fuselier was instrumental in creating the first TRIAD program \nin the Nation in Louisiana. He heard about the TRIAD concept at a \nnational FBI forum, knew it would help the people of St. Martin Parish \nand began a TRIAD program within weeks of having heard about it. Thus \nhaving earned the title ``Father TRIAD,'' he has also instructed and \nmoderated numerous TRIAD workshops and seminars providing assistance to \ndevelop TRIAD programs throughout Louisiana and the Nation.\n  Through his work on a myriad of law enforcement task forces, study \ngroups, and commissions, Sheriff Fuselier has made many very important \ncontributions to the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association and the National \nSheriffs' Association. In fact, Sheriff Fuselier served in every \nposition of the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association and also in many \ncapacities on the National Sheriffs' Association such as the crime \nprevention committee and the national TRIAD advisory board.\n  I congratulate Sheriff Fuselier on receiving this very prestigious \naward and also on his contributions to the State and national criminal \njustice system. His achievements are truly an inspiration and the \nnational sheriff of the year award is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6413-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO DEAN KAMEN, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S BUSINESS LEADER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH.

Each year the sponsoring group receives hundreds of \nnominations. The exceptional quality of the entries gives testimony to \nthe strength of Granite State businesses and the New Hampshire \nvolunteer spirit.\n  Dean Kamen's record of achievement is certainly worthy of this \noutstanding honor. His inventions hold over 30 U.S. patents, he \ninvented a life-saving 22-pound portable kidney dialysis machine, and \nhe created a climate control system used by NASA. Dean has been \nrecognized by President Clinton for his accomplishments and received \nthe Hoover Medal, an international engineering honor.\n  Dean Kamen is a visionary who wants to change the way children view \nscience and technology. He would like to see our Nation's children \nemulate scientists as much as they do sports heroes. His award-winning \nand community-minded contribution for this year is the U.S. First \nprogram designed to inspire American children. Children from across the \nNation work with engineers and compete in a technological version of \n``American Gladiators.''\n  Dean is working on a new project and keeping it tightly under wraps, \nbut I look forward to hearing about it in the future. This is an \noutstanding record of accomplishment for this 45-year-old businessman. \nI wish to congratulate him for his recognition as New Hampshire's \nBusiness Leader of the Year, and I am proud to call Dean Kamen my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6414-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE TRIMBLES FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. The data is undeniable: individuals from strong families \ncontribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples \nmarried today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it \nis both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the \ncommitment of ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating \nsuccessfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. \nThese characteristics make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Mr. David and Mrs. \nHazel Trimble of St. Charles, MO, who on June 16, 1996, celebrated \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. David and Hazel's \ncommitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to \nbe saluted and recognized. I wish them and their family all the best as \nthey celebrate this substantial marker on their journey \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6414-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GIRL OF THE YEAR, KIM YARMO\n\n Mr. SMITH.

Kim's parents thought that the \nprogram would help her overcome the difficulties of growing up with \nthree brothers and no sister.\n  Selection for both Girl of the Month and Girl of the Year is based \nupon several qualities: cooperative attitude, enthusiasm, steady \nattendance, positive attitude, leadership skills, and outstanding \nability to interact with staff and peers. Kim was chosen by the local \nGirls, Inc. staff and all of the 4 to 500 girls in the program as Girl \nof the Year. She was chosen from a group of 12 girls who had been named \nGirl of the Month during 1 of the past 12 months. Kim will represent \nGirls, Inc. at special events throughout the next year.\n  Kim is known by her peers for her helping ways, including assisting \nher peers with homework and reading. She is a responsible and caring \nyoung lady who understands the definition of teamwork. Kim is a leader \nand I am proud to call her one of New Hampshire's own.\n  Young women like Kim are important to the future of New Hampshire and \nthe future of this Nation. I congratulate her as the recipient of \nGirls, Inc.'s Girl of the Year award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6414-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6414-S6416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SWISS BANKS AND GOLD LOOTED BY THE NAZIS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the role \nof Swiss banks and their handling of gold looted by the Nazis.\n  On May 25, 1946, the Allies and Switzerland agreed to a treaty \nliquidating German property in Switzerland. In section II, paragraph 2 \nof the treaty, Switzerland agreed to pay the Allies $250 million in \nSwiss francs payable on demand, in gold in New York. This treaty was \nthe culmination of a very difficult negotiation with the Swiss,\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\nwho long refused to deal with the problem of their banks, essentially, \nlaundering gold looted from all over Europe by the Nazis.\n  Yet, while the Swiss agreed to pay this sum, there was clearly more \ngold deposited in Switzerland by the Nazis during the war. As a \nFebruary 5, 1946 State Department document clearly states, the amount \nagreed to in this treaty was far lower than the true amount. At this \ntime, I ask that this document be printed in the Record.\n  The document follows:\n\n          Allied Claim Against Swiss for Return of Looted Gold\n\n       1. It has been determined from available ledgers of the \n     German Reichsbank that a total of at least 398 million \n     dollars worth of gold was shipped to Switzerland by the \n     German Reichsbank during the war. This figure does not \n     include the following which, when verified and amounts \n     definitely determined, should also be taken up with the \n     Swiss:\n       (a) One additional shipment known to have taken place after \n     these books were closed and evacuated from Berlin.\n       (b) Other shipments believed to have taken place early in \n     the war and to have been recorded in earlier ledgers of the \n     German Reichsbank which are not now available;\n       (c) An amount approximately 12 million dollars worth of \n     gold which the Germans seized when they looted the Italian \n     gold but delivered directly to the Swiss.\n       2. It is perfectly possible that the entire amount of 398 \n     million dollars (or more) worth of gold received by the Swiss \n     from the German Reichsbank was looted gold because of the \n     following facts:\n       (a) The large amounts of gold known to have been looted by \n     the Germans from the countries which they occupied in Europe \n     before and during the course of the war. It is known that at \n     least 579 million dollars worth of gold was looted by the \n     Germans and made available to the German Reichsbank. This \n     figure represents a conservative tabulation based upon the \n     estimates of the countries from which gold was looted and \n     upon a careful examination of the records of the Germans.\n       (b) The relatively small amounts of legitimate gold \n     available to them.\n       (c) The very small proportion of the looted gold which \n     appears to have remained in Germany at the end of the war or \n     to have been disposed of in countries other than Switzerland. \n     The amount of such looted gold now identified as being in \n     Germany at the end of the war or disposed of to foreign \n     countries other than Switzerland is only 169 million dollars. \n     These figures have been derived for a complete inventory of \n     the gold found in Germany at the end of the war and a \n     thorough examination of the records of the Reichsbank, \n     including a detailed tracing of the processing and \n     disposition of more than half of the gold originally looted.\n       Subtraction of the loot thus traced to German war-end \n     stocks and to third countries (169) from the total loot (579) \n     leaves 410 million dollars worth of loot or more than the \n     entire amount of the known shipments to Switzerland still to \n     be accounted for.\n       3. Even if one makes the assumption, which is quite \n     unrealistic but presents the most favorable possible case for \n     the Swiss, that the shipments which they received included \n     all of the non-looted gold available to the Germans during \n     the war, there still remains an absolute minimum of 185 \n     million dollars of the gold taken by the Swiss from the \n     German Reichsbank which must have been looted.\n       (a) A thorough examination of the records of the German \n     Reichsbank and intensive interrogations in Germany of high \n     Reichsbank officials in a position to know the true facts \n     have determined the amount of hidden reserves of gold held by \n     the Reichsbank before and during the war in addition to the \n     published reserves which were known to the world.\n       (b) For the purpose at hand June 30, 1940 has been chosen \n     as the base date in order to make the case as favorable as \n     possible to the Swiss and eliminate any uncertainty as to \n     legitimate acquisitions of gold by the Germans prior to their \n     attack on the low countries. The Reichsbank's total gold \n     holdings on that date were 232 million dollars.\n       (c) From the holdings shown above (232 million dollars), \n     there must be subtracted an amount of 49 million dollars \n     worth of loot accumulated by the Reichsbank in the preceding \n     year, which gives a total of 183 million dollars worth of \n     non-looted gold stocks held on June 30, 1940.\n       (d) The only significant source of legitimate gold still \n     open to the Germans after June 1940 was Russia. German \n     records show that the total amount of gold received from \n     Russia between the outbreak of war with Poland and the attack \n     on Russia was 23 million dollars. Although it is clear that \n     much of the gold was received prior to June 30, 1940 and, \n     therefore, is undoubtedly included in the German gold reserve \n     figure for that date (183 million dollars), we are making the \n     assumption most favorable to the Swiss and assuming that all \n     23 million was acquired after June 30, 1940 and is, \n     therefore, to be added to the gold reserve shown on that date \n     as additional legitimate gold. The resultant total of 206 \n     million dollars is the maximum possible amount of non-looted \n     gold available to the German Reichsbank at any time after \n     June 1940.\n       (e) Subtracting from the total known shipments to \n     Switzerland (398) the portion of those shipments which took \n     place prior to the end of June 1940 (7 million) leaves an \n     amount of at least 391 million dollars worth of gold received \n     by the Swiss thereafter, and the difference between this \n     amount and the maximum possible amount of non-loot available \n     to the Germans in the same period (206) is 185 million \n     dollars.\n       4. On the fairest assumptions the amount of loot taken by \n     the Swiss from Germany can be estimated at 289 million \n     dollars.\n       (a) It is unreal to assume, as was done above, in \n     calculating the absolute minimum figure of looted gold \n     received by the Swiss from Germany that every ounce of non-\n     looted gold available to the Germans was sent to Switzerland.\n       (b) It is more realistic to assume that the ratio of loot \n     to total gold available to the Germans was reflected in all \n     German gold shipments including those to Switzerland. The \n     total amount of gold available to the Germans after June 30, \n     1940, as shown above, was 785 million dollars of which 579 \n     million dollars or 74 percent was loot. Applying this \n     percentage to the total amounts received by the Swiss it \n     would appear likely that at least 289 million thereof was \n     loot.\n\n\n        allied policies for negotiations of looted gold question\n\n       It is definitely known that the Swiss received at least 398 \n     million dollars worth of gold from Germany during the course \n     of the war. Of this amount the absolute minimum which is to \n     be classified as loot is 185 million dollars. In arriving at \n     this calculation every doubt has been resolved in favor of \n     the Swiss. A more realistic approach indicates that the \n     amount of looted gold taken by the Swiss is closer to 289 \n     million dollars, and there is a possibility that all gold \n     received by the Swiss from Germany was looted.\n       With these facts in mind, the Allied Governments should \n     insist that the Swiss hand over immediately 185 million \n     dollars worth of gold. Any bargaining between the Allies and \n     Switzerland should only be with respect to the difference \n     between 185 million and 398 million. As to this, the Allies \n     should take the position that such difference should be \n     turned over unless the Swiss are able to prove that such gold \n     was either included in Germany's non-looted pre-war stocks or \n     legitimatedly acquired after the beginning of the war.\n       It is possible that Switzerland will ask to see the data \n     upon which the figure representing the minimum loot was \n     based. If so, the Allied negotiators should agree to this \n     concession upon the condition that the Swiss make available \n     to Allied experts books, records and other documents in their \n     possession relating to their gold stocks acquired from \n     Germany and the disposition of such gold. However to avoid \n     delays, such concessions should only be made after the Swiss \n     have agreed to turn over the initial 185 million dollars \n     worth of gold.\n       In taking the above position the Allied negotiators should \n     make it clear to the Swiss officials that the fact that \n     specific looted gold is no longer in Swiss possession does \n     not operate to defeat the Allied claim or hinder or impede \n     the handing over of an equivalent amount of gold. The Swiss \n     should be advised that in cases where the original looted \n     gold has passed from Switzerland to another country and the \n     Swiss Government has made the equivalent amount of such gold \n     available to the three named Allied powers, those powers \n     will, insofar as is feasible, lend their assistance to the \n     Swiss in obtaining the return of the specific gold or an \n     equivalent. However, such offer of assistance is not to be \n     understood or construed as a guarantee on the part of the \n     three governments named.\n       In the event that the Swiss Government should indicate its \n     preference to settle the gold question by paying over a flat \n     sum rather than assume the burden of proof as is indicated \n     herein above, any compromise figure between 185 and 398 \n     million which is agreed to by all of the Allied negotiators \n     could be accepted. It would seem that 289 million would \n     represent a reasonable settlement.\n\n\n                    German gold movements (estimate)\n\n                     [From April 1938 to May 1945]\n\n        Income                                                  Million\nGermany started the war with estimated gold reserves of (Published gold \n  reserves were only 29.)..........................................$100\nTaken over from:\n  Austria..........................................................46.0\n  Czechoslovakia...................................................16.0\n  Danzig............................................................4.0\n  Poland...........................................................12.0\n  Holland.........................................................168.0\n  Belgium.........................................................223.0\n  Yugoslavia.......................................................25.0\n  Luxembourg........................................................5.0\n  France...........................................................53.0\n  Italy............................................................64.0\n  Hungary..........................................................32.0\n                                                       ________________\n\n    Total.........................................................748.0\n                                                       ================\n\n        Outgo                                                   Million\nSold to Swiss National Bank...............................$275 to 282.0\nPossibly sold to Swiss Commercial Banks before 1942................20.0\nWashed through Swiss National Bank depot account and eventually \n  reported to Portugal and Spain (larger part by far to Portugal).100.0\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\nRumania............................................................32.5\nSweden.............................................................18.5\nFound in Germany (including 64 earmarked for Italy and 32 earmarked for \n  Hungary)........................................................293.0\nSold to or used in Balkan countries and Middle East--mainly Turkey.10.0\n                                                       ________________\n                                                                  752.0\n                                                       ================\n\n\n\n            Swiss Gold Movements (Swiss official statement)\n\n                [From January 1, 1939 to June 30, 1945]\n\nPurchased from:\n  Germany........................................................$282.9\n  Portugal.........................................................12.7\n  Sweden...........................................................17.0\nSold to:\n  Germany...........................................................4.9\n  Portugal........................................................116.6\n  Spain............................................................42.6\n  Turkey............................................................3.5\n\n       Conclusions: (1) All gold that Germany sold after a certain \n     date, probably from early 1943 on, was looted gold, since her \n     own reserves, including hidden reserves with which she \n     started the war, were exhausted by that time; (2) out of \n     $278,000,000-worth of gold that Switzerland purchased from \n     Germany, the larger part was looted gold; in addition, \n     Switzerland has taken $100,000,000 looted gold in deposit, \n     which later on was re-exported to Spain and Portugal for \n     German account; (3) among the gold that the Swiss sold during \n     the war to Portugal, Spain, and Turkey, there could have been \n     looted German gold; (4) the gold that Switzerland bought from \n     Sweden during the war could theoretically be German looted \n     gold; monetary experts all over the world (Switzerland has \n     monetary experts at her disposal) knew, or ought to have \n     known, roughly the figures and movements as contained in the \n     above estimate--certainly they knew the gold holdings and \n     gold reserves of the German Reichsbank. Switzerland therefore \n     was lacking good faith. In addition, she was warned that all \n     Germany's own pre-war gold stocks had been used up by mid-\n     1943 at the latest and therefore all the gold then in the \n     possession of Germany must be presumed to be looted gold.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. As one can see, the amount of gold, estimated by this \nreport is said to be $398 million, $148 million more than the treaty \namount. A possible reason for the difference can be laid upon the Swiss \nbecause they would not agree to give up more than $250 million.\n  I would like to know what happened to the other $148 million, or \nmore, that apparently was kept by the Swiss. I am quite sure that the \nother nations of Europe who had their gold looted from them by the \nNazis and sent to Switzerland, not to mention the individual citizens \nwho had gold taken from them, would like to know where that gold is \ntoday. Only the Swiss know and they aren't talking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6414-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO BILL MARSTON ON HIS RETIREMENT AS PRINCIPAL OF GOFFSTOWN \n                              HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding individual as he nears the end of a 40-year career as an \neducator. Bill Marston retires this month from his position as \nprincipal of Goffstown High School in Goffstown, NH.\n  Mr. Marston's 15-year tenure as principal has been marked by his \nunfailing dedication to his students. His example of excellence and \nintegrity, set for his students, his teachers, and his community, will \nendure long after his retirement. He will be remembered as a true \neducator in every sense of the word. An educator's job is about much \nmore than passing along information or keeping order in the classroom. \nAn educator provides his students with the tools they need to shape \ntheir future. Bill treated each student as an individual and was always \nwilling to go the extra step to see a student succeed.\n  Educators like Bill are one of our Nation's greatest treasures. They \nshape the future of this Nation as they shape the mind and character of \nour young people. Education and educators like Bill Marston give us \nhope for tomorrow. The young people whose lives our Nation's educators \ntouch each day will be the leaders of tomorrow. It is the educator who \nsparks interest in physics or makes civics come alive for the student. \nThey equip the future scientists and inspire the future writers of this \nNation. As a former teacher myself, I have seen the impact educators \ncan have on the lives of students. Teachers are, in many ways, the \nkeepers of our Nation's future, holding the promise of tomorrow in \ntheir hands.\n  By all accounts, Bill Marston has been an exemplary educator, both as \nteacher and as administrator. The job of an administrator is not always \nan easy one. By keeping the best interests of the students at heart, \nBill set an example he can be proud of. Bill, however, was more than an \nadministrator. He was a leader. He always acted with integrity and \nearned the respect of his community. The influence of his leadership \nwill surely be felt long after his retirement.\n  I commend Bill Marston for his career of distinction in the field of \neducation. New Hampshire is fortunate to have such a talented and \ndedicated educator shaping its future generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6416-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6416-S6417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO BULLS ON WINNING THE 1996 NATIONAL \n                  BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 266, submitted \nearlier today by Senators Moseley-Braun and Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 266) to congratulate the Chicago \n     Bulls on winning the 1996 National Basketball Association \n     Championship and proving themselves to be one of the best \n     teams in NBA history.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague, Senator \nSimon, the city of Chicago, and the State of Illinois, I rise to offer \na Senate resolution commemorating the Chicago Bulls for winning the \n1995-1996 National Basketball Association Championship.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Patty Murray, that her great State of \nWashington was well-represented in this championship series that ended \nlast Sunday. We should all applaud the Seattle Supersonics for an \nexcellent season in which they won 64 games. I am sure it will not be \nthe last we will hear of them. I am just delighted that this happens to \nbe the year of the Chicago Bulls.\n  The Bulls have put together a truly remarkable season. There should \nno longer be any doubt that this Bulls team is the best basketball team \nin the 49-year history of the NBA. Yes, the best ever. One need look no \nfarther than the numbers. The Bulls finished the regular season with an \nunprecedented record of 72-10. They roared through the playoffs, losing \nonly three games in four playoff rounds. Their final record is a truly \nunbelievable 87-13. There has never been a team that has so dominated \nprofessional basketball at both ends of the court like this year's \nBulls.\n  Coach Phil Jackson once stated that, ``Basketball is a sum of parts \nthat sometimes are greater than the whole * * * we try to get the \nconcept to the team that you are only as strong as your weakest link.'' \nCoach Jackson's philosophy of teamwork has resonated with the players \non this team. From Michael Jordan down to the last player on the bench, \neach member know his role, accepted it, and worked for the good of the \nteam. They worked hard in practice, meshed their various talents and \nselflessly played together for team, not individual, achievements.\n\n  As is the case with all great teams however, when the team is \nsuccessful, individuals stand out as well. Michael Jordan, the greatest \nbasketball player on this planet, was named the league's most valuable \nplayer for the regular season, for the playoffs, and for the all-star \ngame, something that has never been done before. Dennis Rodman won the \nrebounding title. The sixth man of the year award went to Toni Kukoc. \nCoach Jackson was honored as Coach of the Year. And three members--\nJordan, Rodman, and Scottie Pippen--were named to the All-Defensive \nTeam.\n  Basketball teams around the country have hung banners in their arenas \ncommemorating championship seasons. Undoubtedly, some of those team \npossessed more Hall of Famers or had more individual talent. But this \nyear's Chicago Bulls team has amassed a record of success that ranks as \nthe best of all-time. We are so proud that the city of Chicago is \nassociated with the mark of excellence and perfection that this Bulls \nteam has shown.\n  The values of team, hard work, and both physical and mental toughness\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\nthat the Bulls embody has brought them fans all across the country--in \nevery State in the union. It is therefore particularly fitting that the \nSenate recognize the special nature of the Bulls achievement. I, \ntherefore, strongly urge my colleagues to join with my distinguished \nsenior colleague, Senator Simon, and me, and to vote to approve this \nresolution commending the Chicago Bulls for their fourth NBA \nchampionship.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be placed in the \nRecord at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 266) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 266\n\n       Whereas the Chicago Bulls at 72-10, posted the best regular \n     season record in the history of National Basketball \n     Association;\n       Whereas the Bulls roared through the playoffs, sweeping the \n     Miami Heat and defeating the New York Knicks in five games, \n     before sweeping the Orlando Magic to return to the NBA Finals \n     for the first time in two years;\n       Whereas the Bulls displayed a potent offense, and what some \n     consider to be their best defense ever, throughout the \n     playoffs before beating the Seattle Supersonics to win their \n     fourth franchise NBA championship;\n       Whereas head coach Phil Jackson, who won his first Coach of \n     the Year award, and the entire coaching staff skillfully led \n     the Bulls through a record 72-win season and a 15-3 playoff \n     run;\n       Whereas Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman \n     all were named to the NBA's ``All-Defensive Team'', the first \n     time in 13 years that three players from the same team have \n     been so named;\n       Whereas Michael Jordan, in his first full season after \n     coming out of retirement, won his record eighth scoring \n     title, his fourth Most Valuable Player award, and was again \n     named playoff most valuable player for the fourth time);\n       Whereas Scottie Pippen again exhibited his outstanding \n     offensive and defensive versatility, proving himself to be \n     one of the best all-around players in the NBA;\n       Whereas the quickness, tireless defensive effort, and \n     athleticism of the colorful Dennis Rodman, who won his fifth \n     straight rebounding title, keyed a Bulls front line that lead \n     the league in rebounding;\n       Whereas veteran guard Ron Harper, in shutting down many of \n     the league's top point guards throughout the playoffs, \n     demonstrated the defensive skills that have made him a \n     cornerstone of the league's best defense;\n       Whereas center Luc Longley frustrated many of the all-star \n     caliber centers that he faced in this year's playoffs while \n     at times providing a much needed scoring lift;\n       Whereas Toni Kukoc, winner of the league's ``Sixth Man'' \n     award, displayed his awesome variety of offensive skills in \n     both assisting on, and hitting, several big shots when the \n     Bulls needed them most;\n       Whereas the laser-like three-point shooting of career \n     three-point field goal percentage leader Steve Kerr sparked \n     many a Bulls rally;\n       Whereas the outstanding shooing of Jud Buechler and Bill \n     Wennington, and the tenacious defense of Randy Brown, each of \n     whom came off the bench to provide valuable contributions, \n     were an important part of each Bulls victory;\n       Whereas John Salley and James Edwards provided valuable \n     contributions throughout the season and the playoffs, both on \n     and off the court, at times giving the Bulls the emotional \n     lift they needed; and\n       Whereas the regular season contributions of second year \n     forward Dickey Simpkins and rookie forward Jason Caffey, and \n     the constant emotional lift provided by the injured Jack \n     Haley, both on the court and in practice, again demonstrated \n     the total devotion of Bulls personnel to the team concept \n     that has made the Bulls into one of the most devastating \n     basketball forces of modern times: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Chicago Bulls \n     on winning the 1996 National Basketball Association \n     championship.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6416-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             E.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 3029, and, further, that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would urge the Senate to formally \nconsider and pass H.R. 3029, designating the U.S. courthouse at 3d and \nConstitution Avenue in Washington, DC, the E. Barrett Prettyman United \nStates Courthouse.\n  Following my graduation from the University of Virginia Law School in \n1953, I was privileged to serve as a law clerk under E. Barrett \nPrettyman, circuit judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia. He later became Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia.\n  Known as the ``Swing Man'' of the nine-member court, Prettyman was \nrenowned for an emphasis on thoughtfulness and fairness in the \nrendering of his decisions. In perhaps his best known opinion, \nPrettyman opted to help protect international stability and preserved \nthe State Department's right to bar travel by United States citizens to \ncertain areas, such as Red China. The Supreme Court later upheld this \ndecision.\n  I can think of no better qualified or more lasting tribute to such a \nfine, honorable public servant than to name the U.S. Courthouse in the \nNation's Capital the ``E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse.''\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3029) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/18/senate-section/article/S6417-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
