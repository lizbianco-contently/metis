Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk \nabout an issue that greatly disturbs me at a time when we are debating \nin this country how we are going to get to a balanced budget and what \nsteps we need to take and the tough decisions in setting priorities \nabout where Federal spending should go in the next 7 years.\n  We had a process that went through here in the Senate and over in the \nHouse that just came from the conference committee to cut $16 billion, \n$16 billion of funding that has been appropriated by this Congress over \nthe past year or two--a truly minor downpayment on reducing the Federal \nbudget deficit. It is about 1 percent of what we will spend this fiscal \nyear. We are talking about cutting 1 percent, not just in this fiscal \nyear but this fiscal year and the next combined. About $16 billion is \nwhat the rescission package will do.\n  I see the headline in the Washington Post, not the one I am \nparticularly proud of, which is ``Capitals Dismantled by Penguins,'' \nwhich I am happy to see that, but one which greatly disturbs me under \nthat which is, ``Clinton To Veto $16 Billion Rescissions Package.'' The \nPresident--who has presented a budget that is going to add almost $2 \ntrillion to the national debt over the next 7 years, who refuses to \ncome to the U.S. Congress and present a balanced budget, who says there \nis no problem in Medicare, who says that everything is just fine--now \ndecides he cannot support cuts in spending. He cannot support cuts in \nspending: That $16 billion is too much. We just cannot do it. We cannot \ntighten our belt to do that.\n  So he is going to go to some group. I am sure he will wrap himself--I \ndo not know, I did not read this completely--wrap himself with either a \ngroup of seniors or a group of children because that is what you do \nwhen you do not want to change things. You hide behind children or you \nhide behind seniors, and you say: ``We cannot hurt these vulnerable in \nour society.'' But the fact of the matter is this is a drop in the \nbucket. These are spending cuts, many of which he advocated, to \nprograms many of which do not work.\n  Sure there are some tough cuts in here, things I am uncomfortable \nwith. We cut, in this bill, low-income home energy assistance, not this \nyear which I am happy to see, but next year, by $300 million. I think \nthat is a painful thing. But we have to share. We cannot do everything. \nWe cannot continue to spend everything we are spending now. I think \nthat is a good compromise.\n  There are other things in there that cause me some problems. They may \nbe good programs but we have to be able to say we are going to tighten \nour belts [[Page S6768]] a little bit. And here you have a President \nwho is holding dialogs with himself about his relevancy, showing he is \nnot going to be relevant to balancing the budget, he is going to stand \nin our way every step of the way to block any kind of reducing the size \nof Government or cutting spending here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, $16 billion out of $1.6 trillion and we cannot do \nthat. It is too tough. I think the American public should see this for \nwhat it is, a President who just wants to blame the other side for \nbeing mean and being cruel and offers nothing in return, who offers no \nbalanced budget to this body, who says he is not for the balanced \nbudget amendment to force us to get there, who says there is no problem \nin Medicare when it is going to go broke in 7 years. His own trustees \nsay it is going to go broke in 7 years. Denial, denial, denial; no, no, \nno.\n  Where is the President? You know, we had the great debater from the \nState of Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, stand up and say, ``Where is \nGeorge? Where is George?''\n  Where is Bill? Where is Bill? Where is he going to be if we are going \nto balance this budget? Where is he going to be if we are going to put \nthis country back on sound footing again? Is he going to continue to \nhide behind the status quo, to be the President who goes down defending \nthis policy that has just continued to pile up debt after debt after \ndebt?\n  Where is Bill? Where is he when it comes to setting this country back \non the course of fiscal responsibility?\n  I will tell you where he is, hiding behind a group of people, vetoing \nlegislation to get us back on the right track. We deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] is \nrecognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is always entertaining to listen to the \nmorning discussions on the floor of the Senate. I should not say always \nentertaining. It is at least occasionally entertaining. As to the \nquestion of ``Where is Bill?''--which I assume really asks ``Where is \nthe President?''--he is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He was there \nyesterday. I assume he is there this morning, reachable by phone if \nsomeone really wants to visit with him about policy issues.\n  But I would say that at least yesterday, when some of us visited with \nthe President about the budget issues, we talked about a lot of things. \nThere is no disagreement, in my judgment, among those of us in the \nSenate or with the President or Members of the House of Representatives \nabout the goal. We have a budget that is out of balance and it must be \nbalanced. We must, it seems to me, develop a plan that is thoughtful, \nthat establishes the right priorities, but especially in the end \nbalances the budget.\n  It is interesting. I hear people stand up here on the floor of the \nHouse and bellow and crow about how they are the ones that have all the \nanswers, they are the ones that know how to balance the budget, they \nare the ones with the guts, and they are the ones with a plan. What a \nbunch of nonsense. Add it all up, just back up and add it up, and you \nwill find that there is not a nickel's worth of difference between \nMembers on either side of the aisle, in the House or the Senate, about \nhow much money they want to spend. Oh, there is a big difference in how \nthey want to spend it. Some want to build more jet airplanes, jet \nfighters, and bombers, and build more missiles. Some want to stay as \ndeep in debt as we are; that we ought to rebuild star wars right now. \nThat is a proposal before us.\n  So they want to spend money, all right. Others of us want to make \nsure that a poor kid gets a hot lunch in the middle of the day at \nschool, or that we have a Head Start that is fully funded, or a WIC \nProgram that works, or health care available to the elderly when they \nneed it. So there is a difference in how we want to spend money. There \nare differences in our priorities. But there is no difference in \nappetite.\n  Do not let anybody tell you different. Add up the priorities in the \n1980's, and you will see that those who call themselves conservatives \nhave an unending appetite to spend the public's money just on different \nthings. This is evident even now. As tough as times are in this \ncountry, they are over pushing to cut back on the hot lunch program, \nand they have decided that it should no longer be an entitlement for a \nhot lunch for a poor kid in the middle of the day at school. But if a \nhot lunch for a poor kid in school is not an entitlement, they sure \nwant to build star wars at a time when there is no longer a Soviet \nUnion. That is the difference. There are differences in priorities.\n  No one should believe that there is not a grim determination on both \nsides of the political aisle in the House and the Senate this year to \nbalance this Federal budget with a plan that gets there in a real and \nin an honest way. The quarrel is about priorities. It is a legitimate \nquarrel. We sometimes fight for and believe in different things. We \ncome from different parts of the country. We represent often different \nideologies. But the quarrel is not the goal. The destination is \nsomething that I think is well accepted. We must get to a balanced \nbudget.\n  I sent earlier this month recommendations to the Senate Budget \nCommittee totaling nearly $800 billion in spending cuts. I want to send \nthem some more. There are plenty of spending cuts--some of them very \naggressive, some of them controversial--that should be, could be, and I \nhope will be made in order to reach a balanced budget. I happen to \nthink it is a priority as a goal.\n  But these days when we find ourselves in a circumstance where we are \nup to our necks in debt, spending more than we take in and charging the \nbalance to our kids and grandkids, some say what we really need to do \nis to have a tax cut. They construct a middle-income tax cut. In fact, \nI was asked by a radio moderator the other day about what I think of \nthe middle-income tax cut or the middle-class tax cut passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. I said, ``Gee, which tax cut could you be \nreferring to?'' The middle-class tax cut passed by the House of \nRepresentatives provides, on average, a $124 tax cut for those families \nwith incomes under $30,000 a year, and an $11,000 tax cut for those \nfamilies with incomes over $200,000 a year. That is what they define in \nthe House as middle income? They have been reading different math books \nthan I have been reading, I guess.\n  I do not think a tax cut is advisable at the moment. I think the \nfirst job is to reduce the deficit, not to run over and curry favor \nwith popular programs like tax cuts. But if we were going to have a tax \ncut, we ought to have a tax cut that benefits working families, not \njust the upper income families, not just the affluent in our country.\n  So I would like folks to take a look at this chart. This chart shows \nthe kinds of priorities that some stand up here and bust their buttons \nabout, calling them middle-class priorities. This tax cut is a tax cut \nthat benefits disproportionately the most affluent in this country and \ngives a few pennies to the rest.\n  I do not happen to think we ought to have a tax cut at this point. I \nthink we ought to keep our nose to the grindstone, cut spending, and \nuse the revenues to reduce the Federal budget deficit. When we have \nthat done, I will join others in this Chamber to propose a tax cut that \nthen will be helpful to middle-income families. But to decide you ought \nto have a decrease first--let us go ahead and serve dessert at this \nmeal first, which is a tax cut, because that is enormously popular--\nthat has a ring to it that is only political, not substantive. That \nsays let us curry favor, and not do the hard work of dealing with the \ndeficit.\n  At the same time that some who propose a contract say let us have a \ntax cut that they call middle class but really, as you can see from the \nchart, benefits the most affluent in our country, they say we have a \nplan to cut Medicare. But they do not have a plan to protect health \ncare for the elderly. [[Page S6769]] They would just cut the dollars. \nMore and more people are growing old in this country. Some months--most \nmonths, in fact--we have 200,000 Americans in 1 month become eligible \nfor Medicare. Why? Because America is growing older.\n  So as more and more people become eligible for Medicare, to cut the \nfunding without worrying about how an elderly person gets health care \nis hardly a priority I think which stands the test of good sense. And \nif you say to a country that faces real challenges in its future that \nthe way to face them is to make it harder for a kid to go to college \nand cut back on money for student aid, then you are not in my judgment \ninvesting in our future.\n  Why do that? We do that at least in part because some want to give a \nbig tax cut to the most affluent in America. Again, I do not quarrel \nwith the goal. I think the goal of balancing the budget is a goal we \nmust march toward and meet. That is our challenge, and that is our \ntest. I think there is substantial room to quarrel about the priorities \nat this point. There is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do \nit. And the right way to do it is to understand that the economic \nengine in this country is the working family. You do not help the \nworking family in this country by doing the kinds of things that they \nare talking about in this budget. That is the wrong way.\n  I would say that maybe 50 or 60 percent of the budget recommendations \nbrought out by the Budget Committee make a lot of sense, and I would \nsign up immediately for them. I support a lot of those proposals. A lot \nof them are good. I give Senator Domenici and other members of the \nBudget Committee great credit for some of those provisions, and I will \nsupport them in a minute and vote for them. But I am just saying that \nin the Contract With America in the House and also in the Senate, there \nare some provisions that reflect in a traditional way the difference in \npriorities.\n  We believe in education. Let us invest in education and not withdraw \nthe help for those who want to learn, those who want to produce, and \nthose who want to go on to become citizens who will help build this \ncountry. Let us not withdraw health care assistance from the elderly \nand the poor who need it. Let us not increase taxes for the low-income \nworking families, which is also a part of this budget proposal. But \nthere are many other areas where we can cut, and cut significantly, and \ncut much more than is now proposed by the Senate Budget Committee \nrecommendation.\n  So I hope when we get this to the floor, I hope you will not hear one \nword from any Member of the Senate who quarrels about the goal. We must \nbalance the budget by 2002. It is doable. It is doable without the \ngreatest of effort by Members of the Senate. But it ought to be done \nright away, investing in the right things still for this country, even \nas we cut those things we no longer need, those things that waste money \nand those things that are extravagant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6767-5", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6769-S6770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE WITH JAPAN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to turn to one other very brief \nsubject, and that is the issue of trade with Japan.\n  I intend to provide a discussion tomorrow at some greater length \nabout our trade situation. But I noticed that the Trade Representative \nhas announced potential sanctions in the future against Japanese trade \nwith the United States if Japan does not open its market further to \nUnited States goods.\n  The fact is the trade situation in this country is serious. We talk a \nlot about the Federal budget deficit, but we have another deficit that \nis serious and troublesome. We have a trade deficit that is the most \nsignificant trade deficit in this country's history. The merchandise \ntrade deficit last year was $166 billion, and I have a chart that shows \nour trade picture in this country. I would like to hold it up.\n  This chart shows with whom we have trade deficits and those with whom \nwe have trade surpluses. We have almost no surpluses, and those \ncountries with whom we have a surplus, it is a very, very minuscule \nsurplus, but you will see what is happening with respect to deficits.\n  All of our major trading partners are countries with which we now \nhave a trade deficit, and that now includes Mexico, for all those who \nsaid we were going to have all these new jobs and bountiful trade with \nMexico. What a bunch of nonsense that was. We have turned a trade \nsurplus with Mexico into a very significant trade deficit. Most experts \nsuggest the deficit with Mexico will turn out to be anywhere from $12 \nto $16 billion. It was the last remaining major trading partner we had \nwith which we have had a surplus, and we have turned that into a \ndeficit, unfortunately, with NAFTA and the subsequent devaluation of \nthe peso, and so on.\n  But you will see in this line a growing, escalating trade deficit \nwith Japan even as the dollar was weakened against the yen, even when \nyou would expect the trade circumstances to move in the other \ndirection. Our trade deficit with Japan is unsustainable, and it is not \nfair. The Japanese expect their products to come into the American \nmarket unimpeded, and they do. We have a wide selection of brand names \nfrom Japan in virtually every area of consumer products. So they access \nour marketplace. And what happens when we try to access theirs? We find \nimpediment after impediment after impediment, and we cannot get \nAmerican goods in any significant quantity into the Japanese \nmarketplace.\n  I have a very small chart I would like to show on auto parts and on \ncars and trucks, and I hope that this can be picked up. But this shows \nthe percentage of auto parts by country, and I wish to show you the \nimport share. The United Kingdom has 60 percent--60 percent of the auto \nparts in the United Kingdom are imports; 32 percent in the United \nStates; 49 percent in France; 16 percent in Italy; 2.4 percent of the \nauto parts in Japan are imported--2.4 percent. All the rest are \nproduced in Japan.\n  Now, is that an accident? No, it is not, because they keep auto parts \nout of Japan. You cannot get them in. They can move them to the United \nStates, but we cannot move them to Japan.\n  How about cars and trucks? Mr. President, 4 percent of the cars and \ntrucks sold in Japan are imports. And you look at the rest of the \ncountries: 35 percent in Italy; 54 percent in the United Kingdom; 30 \npercent of the cars and trucks sold in the United States are imports; 4 \npercent of the cars and trucks sold in Japan are imports.\n  Now, is that because no one has figured out a way to sell in Japan? \nNo. It is because Japan keeps them out. Japan has a one-way trade \nstrategy that says we want Japanese producers to be able to sell in \nyour markets, but when your producers want to sell in Japan, we want to \nkeep them out.\n  This President, to his credit, has begun to stand up to other \ncountries, including Japan, saying we are sick and tired of one-way \ntrade relations. When we have these trade deficits, it means lost jobs \nin America--lost jobs, lost income, lost opportunity, and lost hope. \nThe President is saying we expect and demand reciprocal trade policies. \nJapan, we want you to open your markets.\n  We are not saying we want to shut off access to Japanese goods in the \nUnited States. That is not the point. The United States has \ndemonstrated for many, many years that we want our consumers to have \nthe widest possible choice of goods, including goods from around the \nworld. But it is long past the time when our country should accept a \ntrade relationship that is unfair to our people, unfair to our country, \nunfair to our wage earners.\n  This President is saying to Japan, we are going to hold up a mirror. \nWe treat you well. Our borders are open to you. You move your goods \nhere in increasing quantities. We expect your borders to be open to us. \nWe expect American producers and the product of American workers to \nhave access to the consumers in Japan. And he is the first President \nfor some long while to have the nerve to stand up and to have the nerve \nto confront the Japanese on these issues.\n  It is not just the Japanese. We also have to confront the Chinese, \nwhose $30 billion trade surplus with the United States is growing at an \nalarming rate. We must be able to penetrate those markets and have \nfairness in the world and world trade. [[Page S6770]] \n  Ambassador Kantor and the President, I know, are embarked on a \nnervous time, and I know it is very controversial. But I would say, \nwhether it is a Republican or a Democratic administration, this country \nneeds to stand up for its economic interests. It needs to stand up for \njobs and opportunity here. I think President Clinton, in calling the \nJapanese on these trade policies, is beginning to do that on behalf of \nthis country.\n  I do not want a trade war. A trade war will not benefit anyone. It \nwill hurt the world. But by the same token, we cannot have a post-\nSecond World War trade strategy which is essentially only a foreign \npolicy by which we pay and everyone else wins. That is a strategy that \ncontinues to weaken our country. We ought to say our borders are open \nbut yours must be, too. We believe in reciprocal trade policies. We \nbelieve in open trade and free trade, yes, but we, most importantly, \ninsist on fair trade. It is long past the time when our country needs \nto stand for that. I am pleased that President Clinton is taking some \naction to confront the Japanese and now next it will be a number of \nother countries that treat us in exactly the same way.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6769-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VETO OF THE RESCISSION BILL\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, President Clinton announced today that he \nis going to veto the rescission package. President Clinton is going to \nveto our effort to reduce Government spending by $16 billion. President \nClinton, who continues to talk about deficits, is going to veto a bill \nthat cuts more spending than any rescission bill in the history of this \ncountry.\n  Why is he going to do that? He is going to do it because he is \ncommitted politically to the special interest groups who stand to lose \nfrom our putting the Federal Government on a budget like everybody \nelse. I think Bill Clinton should start representing the public \ninterest and not the special interests that support the Democratic \nParty.\n  I think it is outrageous, when we are running a $175 billion deficit, \nwhen the deficit is heading toward $350 billion, and the President, to \ndefend things the way they are in Washington, DC, is going to veto a \nbill that cuts 16 billion dollars' worth of Government spending.\n  The President should sign the rescission bill. He should join our \neffort to put the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. \nUltimately, we have to make a decision. Are we going to change the \nGovernment in order to bring back the American dream, put the Federal \nGovernment on a budget, let families keep more of what they earn, or \nare we going to continue to support business as usual in Washington, \nDC?\n  When Bill Clinton vetoes a $16 billion cut in Government spending to \nprotect a few pet programs, he is putting the political interests of \nhis administration and his party in front of the interests of the \npeople of America. I do not think the American people are going to like \nit; I think they are going to react negatively to it; and I think they \nshould.\n  President Clinton can stop us on the rescission bill. He can get \nDemocrats to vote and sustain his veto. I think it is important that we \npass the bill, that we challenge him, and that we try to override this \noutrageous veto. But for next year, beginning in October, we are going \nto be writing the appropriations bills, and so the President is not \ngoing to have the ability to veto bills unless he wants to shut down \nFederal departments.\n  I think we are fast coming to the moment of truth. Are we serious \nabout dealing with Government spending? Are we serious about putting \nthe Government on a budget like everybody else? Or are we committed to \nthe same old special interest groups that have dominated American \nGovernment for 40 years?\n  By vetoing an effort to reduce Government spending to protect special \ninterest programs, President Clinton is saying he is willing to protect \nbusiness as usual in Washington. I think this is something that we have \nto fight because I think we are down to the basic principle on which \nthe American people cast their votes in 1994, and I think they expect \nus to stand up, speak out, and fight for putting the Federal Government \non a budget like everybody else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Texas would \nanswer a question if I were to propose a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I might. I would like to hear it first.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes.\n  I read in the Washington Post this morning about the $5 million \nRepublican fundraiser that was held last evening. I want to \ncongratulate the Senator from Texas for putting this enormous \nfundraiser together. It may have been the largest of its kind in \nhistory.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Texas would be so kind as to answer this \nquestion of the Senator from Arkansas: Were there any special interests \nrepresented at this fundraiser?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me first respond by saying, I appreciate your \ngenerosity in suggesting that I might have put on such a grand \nfundraiser. In fact, I am no longer chairman of the Republican \nSenatorial Committee. I did attend. We had a lot of people there from \nall over America.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Were there any special interests there at the fundraiser?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Clearly, many of them were there. They came to the event. \nEach individual group represents a special interest.\n  But let me tell you the difference. What we told them we were going \nto do there is put the Federal Government on a budget. We were not \npromising to give anything away last night. We were promising to stand \nup for the vital interests of this Nation and, remarkably--maybe it is \nnot true in your party, but in my party when you stand up and fight for \nAmerica, there are people that are for you.\n  I am proud of the fact, as my colleague, I am sure, knows, that in \nthe last election cycle, when I was chairman, the average contribution \nto the Democratic Senatorial Committee was 10 times as large as the \naverage contribution to the Republican Senatorial Committee because we \nhave grassroots support.\n  And, given the President's veto, given the President's veto of our \neffort to control spending, I can see why we have grassroots support \nand the Democratic Party does not.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend from Texas and \nneighbor trying to answer that question.\n  I am going to ask him another question.\n  Were there grassroots supporters there at this $5 million fundraiser \nlast evening?\n  Mr. GRAMM. They were from all over America. In fact, I saw a lot of \nthem from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is right.\n  And how much was each ticket for the fundraiser, if I might ask?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It varied, depending on whether it was individual money or \nwhether it was----\n  Mr. PRYOR. Whether it was grassroots or special interest, is that the \ncase?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. It varied on whether it came out of your checking \naccount or out of the checking account of your company or your \norganization.\n  You hold similar events every year, but, because the American people \nno longer support your agenda, your attendance is falling off. Ours is \nrising. But I do not feel sorry for you.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Oh, no, do not feel sorry for us yet. You know, we still \nhave a few kicks left in the dog here.\n  But I would just like to ask my friend from Texas, the special \ninterests you referred to that support President Clinton, would you \nplease be so kind as to enumerate those special interests?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I certainly would.\n  The Legal Services Corp., the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nthe broad-based coalition of people who are riding in the wagon as \nopposed to the people who are pulling the wagon in America.\n  Our objective is to try to put the Government on a budget, so we can \nlet working people keep more of what they earn, so that we can have \ndecisions made not by Washington but by American families. \n[[Page S6771]] \n  See, we have this idea that Democrats rejected about 40 years ago, \nand that is families can do a better job of spending their own money \nthan you do for them.\n  Now that sounds alien in Washington, DC, but in Little Rock, AR, \npeople are beginning to think maybe that is the way we ought to do \nthings.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Arkansas would yield to me?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I do not have the floor, actually.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have to go to a hearing on Legal Services, to let them \nknow the bad news.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would say, the hour of 10:30 having \narrived, morning business was to close.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators desiring \nrecognition, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from North Dakota \nbe allowed to proceed for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was curious about the question asked by \nmy colleague from Arkansas.\n  Our colleague, Senator Gramm from Texas, said that at this fundraiser \nthey were not giving anybody anything. I assume he forgot, probably, \nthat in the vote in the House of Representatives on the Contract With \nAmerica, just to name one little piece of that, they eliminated the \nalternative minimum tax for corporations.\n  You remember those stories in the old days about a big corporation \nthat earned $3 billion in earned income, net profit, and paid zero in \nFederal income tax. Well, the Federal Government said they wanted to \ncorrect that, so they set up what was called an alternative minimum \ntax, so you could never zero it out, talking about the real big \ncorporations now.\n  Well, in the House of Representatives, in the tax bill under the \ncontract, they zero it out and they say, ``No more alternative minimum \ntax. You big companies, you make $5 billion, it is all right if you pay \nzero in taxes.'' But at same time they do that, they say, ``But we can \ngive those companies''--incidentally, about 2,000 companies--``the \nequivalent of $2 million each in tax breaks. We can afford to do that, \nbut we cannot afford to provide student aid, as we used to, so we will \nhave to ask kids who are going to go to college who do not have any \nmoney to pay for it, we will make if harder for kids to go to college \nbecause we cannot afford investing in kids who go to college, as we \nused to, but we do have the money to provide the equivalent of a $2 \nmillion tax break for each of 2,000 corporations by saying to those \ncorporations, You no longer have to worry about a little thing called \nthe alternative minimum tax. You can zero it out, if you like.''\n  I am guessing the Senator from Texas just forgot about that.\n  And there are a dozen more like it, little old things that I am sure \nfolks would show up to show their appreciation for, but they are the \nkinds of things that represent priorities--the priorities that say we \nreally believe in the big interests here, we really think the big \ninterests need a lot more help because if we rain on big interests \nsomehow it will all seep down to the little folks that are trying to \nsend their kids to college. That is what I think has been forgotten in \nthis equation and this discussion between the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6770-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a resolution which I will shortly \nbe sending to the desk. May I ask, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the resolution to be \nconsidered by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I believe we have agreed that there will be no more than \n2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, from the time you bring it \nup.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the time start to run as of now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AND OTHER MATTERS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I send the resolution to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Dole--and I know others would like to \njoin--and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 120) establishing a special committee \n     administered by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs to conduct an investigation involving Whitewater \n     Development Corp., Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan \n     Association, Capital Management Services, Inc., the Arkansas \n     Development Finance authority, and other related matters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, Whitewater is a very serious matter. Some \nquestions raised by Whitewater go to the very heart of our democratic \nsystem of government. We must determine whether the public trust has \nbeen abused. We must ascertain whether purely private interests have \nbeen placed above the public trust. The American people have a right to \nknow the full facts about Whitewater and related matters.\n  After the Banking Committee's hearings last year, many important \nquestions still remain. The American people have a right and a need to \nknow the answers to these questions.\n  Congress has the responsibility to serve as the public's watchdog. We \nwould be derelict in our duties if we did not pursue these Whitewater \nquestions. The Senate must proceed in an evenhanded, impartial, and \nthorough manner. We have a constitutional responsibility to resolve \nthese issues.\n  Mr. President, we now bring before the Senate a resolution that \nauthorizes a special committee administered by the Banking Committee to \ncontinue the Whitewater inquiry that was started but not completed \nduring the last Congress.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Sarbanes, for his hard \nwork and cooperation in the preparation of this resolution. We have \njointly prepared a resolution that is balanced and fair and that will \nallow the special committee to search for the truth. I am confident \nthat Senator Sarbanes and I will continue the Banking Committee's \nbipartisan approach to the Whitewater matter.\n  Mr. President, our pursuit of these questions must be and will be \nfair, straightforward, and responsible. The American people expect and \ndeserve a thorough inquiry committed to the pursuit of truth. That is \nthe American way.\n  Last summer, the Banking Committee met these vigorous requirements. \nOur examination of the Whitewater matter was impartial, balanced, and \nthorough. That is our goal in this Congress. I am confident that we \nwill meet these goals.\n  During last summer's hearings, many facts were uncovered. We learned \nthat certain top administration officials were not fully candid and \nforthcoming with the Congress. That is an undisputed fact. The public \nhas a right to expect more from those in positions of trust. We also \nlearned that senior Treasury Department and Clinton White House \nofficials mishandled confidential law enforcement information \nconcerning Madison Guaranty. That is another undisputed fact. Madison \nis now defunct; it is a defunct S at the heart of the Whitewater \nmatter. The failure of this Arkansas S eventually cost American \ntaxpayers more than $47 million.\n  Mr. President, the American people have a right to know the answers \nto [[Page S6772]] many serious questions still remaining about \nWhitewater and related matters. We have a constitutional obligation to \nseek the answers to these questions. That is why I am offering this \nresolution today.\n  Now I will briefly outline some of the matters that this resolution \nauthorizes the special committee to investigate. We will begin with the \nhandling of the papers in deputy White House counsel Vince Foster's \noffice following his death. Who searched Mr. Foster's office on the \nnight of his death? What were they looking for? What happened to Mr. \nFoster's papers? Were any papers lost or destroyed? And who authorized \nthe transfer of Mr. Foster's Whitewater file to a closet in the First \nFamily's residence? The public has a right to the answers to these \nquestions.\n  Mr. President, this resolution encourages the special committee to \ncoordinate its activities with those of the independent counsel, \nKenneth Starr. Senator Sarbanes and I have met with the independent \ncounsel. Judge Starr has indicated to us that he has no objection to \nthe special committee's plan to inquire into the handling of Mr. \nFoster's papers. Senator Sarbanes and I are committed to coordinating \nthe committee's activities with those of the special counsel.\n  This resolution authorizes the special committee to pursue answers to \nother questions raised during the Banking Committee's hearings last \nyear.\n  We will explore the scope and impact of the improper dissemination of \nconfidential law enforcement information concerning Madison Guaranty. \nHow widely did the Clinton administration officials communicate this \nconfidential information? Did any high-ranking officials inform targets \nof criminal investigations? If so, did this impact any ongoing \ninvestigations? The public has a right to know the answers to these \nquestions.\n  The special committee will also examine whether there were any \nimproper contacts between the Clinton White House and the Justice \nDepartment regarding Madison Guaranty.\n  We know that Paula Casey, the U.S. attorney in Little Rock, declined \nto pursue criminal referrals involving Madison. That is an undisputed \nfact. We also know that Webster Hubbell, who has pleaded guilty to mail \nfraud and tax evasion, was the No. 3 official at the Justice Department \nat this critical time. This is another undisputed fact.\n  The committee will ascertain whether Mr. Hubbell contacted Paula \nCasey about Madison. And who else, if anyone, knew about these contacts \nwith the U.S. attorney. The public has the right to know.\n  Mr. President, this resolution authorizes the special committee to \nexplore whether the Resolution Trust Corporation and other officials in \nWashington tried to interfere improperly with RTC staff in Kansas City \nresponsible for investigating wrongdoing at Madison. If such \ninterference occurred, who authorized it, and why? The public deserves \nanswers to these questions.\n  During last summer's hearings, the Banking Committee learned that the \nTreasury inspector general furnished the Clinton White House, at the \nWhite House counsel's request, transcripts of the inspector general's \ndepositions. That is an undisputed fact.\n  The committee will now look into whether these deposition transcripts \nwere used to coach administration witnesses before they appeared in \nfront of the committee. That would be wrong. The public has a right to \nknow if it happened.\n  All of these matters that I have discussed so far involve events that \noccurred after January 1993 when President Clinton took office. There \nare also serious questions regarding events that occurred in Arkansas \nin the 1980's when President Clinton was Governor. This resolution also \nauthorizes the special committee to examine these matters. Some of \nthese Arkansas matters are complex and will require the committee's \nclose review of many thousands of pages of documents.\n  We will review the operations and regulations of Madison Guaranty. \nDid James McDougal, Madison's chairman and Governor Clinton's business \npartner, improperly divert Madison's funds to himself and others? Did \nany of this money find its way into the White House real estate project \nin which McDougal and Governor Clinton were partners? Did McDougal \nmisuse Madison funds to cover any losses the First Family suffered on \ntheir Whitewater investment? The public has a right to know the answers \nto these questions.\n  Mr. President, the resolution further authorizes the special \ncommittee to examine the Rose law firm's representation of both Madison \nand RTC, and senior partners at the Rose law firm, including Larry \nRodham Clinton, Webster Hubbell, and Vince Foster. The committee must \nascertain whether the Rose law firm properly handled the RTC civil \nclaims concerning Madison.\n  Did the firm have a conflict of interest, and did American taxpayers \nlose money in the process?\n  We will also examine Capital Management Services and its president, \nDavid Hale, a former Arkansas judge and Clinton appointee. Hale has \npublicly charged that the President pressured him to make Small \nBusiness Administration loans that were used to prop up Madison.\n  Did this happen? Did Hale also make improper Small Business \nAdministration loans to current Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker?\n  Then there is the matter of the financing of the 1990 Arkansas \ngubernatorial campaign. We now know that the president of the Perry \nCounty Bank, Neal Ainley, has pleaded guilty to violating Federal laws \nin connection with the handling of certain large cash transactions for \nthe Clinton campaign. Ainley claims he did so at the direction of \ncampaign officials. The public has a right to know who authorized this \nactivity and why.\n  Mr. President, this resolution will authorize the special committee \nto examine these and related matters. We will take every reasonable \nstep to complete this inquiry promptly. We hope that the administration \ncooperates with us in this regard. But we also intend to be thorough \nand comprehensive.\n  This resolution provides $950,000 to fund the special committee \nthrough February 29, 1996. If additional money is needed, the special \ncommittee will make a recommendation not later than January 15, 1996, \nand the majority and minority will meet to determine the time for any \nvote.\n  Mr. President, we expect to hold public hearings into the handling of \nthe papers of Vince Foster's office in late June or early July. We will \ncontinue our inquiry by subject matter until it is completed. In doing \nso, we will make every effort not to interfere with the independent \ncounsel's criminal investigation.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve to know the full facts \nabout Whitewater and related matters. As I said at the outset, we will \nconduct this inquiry in a fair, evenhanded, and impartial manner.\n  That is what the American people want, expect, and deserve. I urge \nthe approval of this resolution.\n  I see that my distinguished colleague and ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, is here. We have allocated up to 2 hours, equally divided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, may I ask what the time situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). There are 2 hours, of which \n15 minutes has already been used.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is an hour now remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, it is not my intention to use the entire hour. I \nhope at some point both sides might be able to yield back time and \nproceed to final consideration of the resolution.\n  Let me say at the outset that the resolution we are considering \ntoday, which authorizes a special committee to be administered by the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is really a carrying \nout of resolutions that were adopted last year by this body. I think it \nis important to consider this resolution in the context of those \nresolutions--actions taken by the Senate last year.\n  On March 17, 1994, a little over a year ago, the Senate adopted a \nresolution by a vote of 98-0 expressing the sense of the Senate that \nhearings should be held on all matters relating to Madison, to \nWhitewater, and to Capital Management.\n  Then, to carry out that resolution, at least in part, on June 21 of \nlast year, [[Page S6773]] the Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 229, \nwhich authorized hearings to be held into certain areas. Those hearings \nwere done last summer. We had 6 days of public hearings. We had \nextensive analysis of documents that were provided to the inquiry \ncommittee in order to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.\n  Now, one of the things that was authorized to be looked into by the \nJune 21 resolution was the handling of the Foster documents. That was \nlater deferred, in response to a request from the independent counsel \nwho contacted the committee and indicated that, given the nature of his \ninquiry, it would be preferable if the Committee did not go ahead with \nthat hearing. Accordingly, we held off.\n  Now the distinguished chairman has indicated that it would be the \nfirst item which will be considered in the hearings that will now take \nplace under the resolution we are considering here today.\n  So this resolution is in effect a continuation of our earlier work. \nIt authorizes the completion of work specified in last year's \nresolution, as well as matters developed during and arising out of the \nhearings that were held last summer, and also a number of matters my \ncolleague has enumerated that carry forth on the sense-of-the-Senate \ncommitment last year to investigate all matters pertaining to Madison.\n  I want to go through some other aspects of this resolution, just to \nlay them out on the record. The chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator D'Amato, has gone through a number of matters that have been \nprovided for in this resolution to be examined by the special \ncommittee. The special committee, administered by the Banking \nCommittee, shall consist of all of the members of the Banking Committee \nplus two members added from the Judiciary Committee. The chairman and \nranking members of the Committee on the Judiciary, or their designees, \nwill join with the members of the Banking Committee to constitute the \nspecial committee which will be administered by the Banking Committee. \nSo it is essentially--or primarily, let me say--a Banking Committee \nactivity, since most of the areas to be examined clearly fall under the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee. But we did add from the \nJudiciary Committee last year. A member came on in order to help carry \nout the inquiry. And there are some matters that are contained in the \nresolution, to be examined that, it could well be argued, are under the \njurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. So, to bring that together, we \nare bringing on two members from the Judiciary Committee, the chairman \nand ranking member or their designees. They will be designating someone \nelse to handle this responsibility if they choose to do so, and I do \nnot know at this point what Chairman Hatch and ranking member Biden \nintend to do in that regard. But obviously we will abide by their \ndecision.\n  We have also provided in the resolution which is now before us, and \nwhich shortly will be adopted, for rules and procedures of this \ncommittee which essentially will be the rules and procedures of the \nSenate, the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the rules of procedure of \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. That is, in \neffect, the rules framework, procedural framework within which we will \noperate. There are in the resolution sections that cover aspects of the \nprocess that the special committee will follow; these are matters it \nwas deemed important that we spell out in the resolution how they were \ngoing to be dealt with. Those involve questions of subpoena powers, \nquestions of how the hearings will be conducted--important questions \nabout immunity. I want to underscore that because that is a matter we \nhave had to address before.\n  We provide that to grant a witness immunity--I want to read this \nsection because it is an important matter. The special committee has \nthe power: ``To grant a witness immunity under section 6002 and 6005'' \nof title 18, United States Code, ``provided that the independent \ncounsel has not informed the special committee in writing that \nimmunizing the witness would interfere with the ability of the \nindependent counsel successfully to prosecute criminal violations.''\n  We also provide for staffing of the committee. There is power to \nappoint special committee staff including consultants, assistance from \nthe Senate legal counsel, assistance from the Comptroller General. \nThere is a provision whereby the committee can draw on other Government \nagencies, Government personnel, and on other congressional staff. And \nwe hope, through a combination of all of these sources, that we will \nhave an adequate staff to carry out a proper inquiry and investigation.\n  There is also, of course, special provision for the protection of \nconfidential information, since we will be interacting with the \nindependent counsel and others and we think it is important to have \nsuch provisions.\n  Finally, the money asked for in this resolution, just under $1 \nmillion, $950,000, is to cover the salaries and other expenses of the \nspecial committee carrying out this inquiry, beginning on the date of \nthe adoption of this resolution--I assume today--and ending February \n29, 1996.\n  If it is judged that additional money is needed, that the inquiry \nneeds to go forward and additional money is required in order to fund \nit, the special committee will recommend that. Of course there will \nhave to be a further vote for the providing of additional moneys to the \nspecial committee.\n  Mr. President, let me just make a couple of further, more general \nobservations. I have very quickly gone through the resolution and I \nthink most of it is straightforward. I think Members of the Senate upon \nreviewing it will conclude that is the case. Many of the provisions are \nwhat one might call boilerplate for such an inquiry, and track previous \nprovisions that have been used in various Senate resolutions \nestablishing committees to carry out inquiries or investigations of the \nsort that is being authorized here.\n  I listened to the chairman with great interest and I was particularly \nencouraged by his very strong statement of the need to conduct \nimpartial, balanced and thorough hearings, which is exactly what I \nthink needs to be done. There are a lot of allegations that are \nswirling around and there are a lot of questions that are being raised. \nWe see them from time to time raised in the press and in the media. \nAnd, of course, one could sit around all day long and conjure up one \nquestion after another. It is not difficult, it is very easy. It is not \ndifficult just simply to say, ``Well, suppose this happened or suppose \nthat happened; or if this or if that.'' Of course, one of the purposes \nof these hearings is to get a good, tough-minded examination of these \nvarious allegations to see if there is anything to them. It needs to be \nappreciated, that it is very easy to make the allegations. Whether the \nallegations are in fact substantiated by the facts is a tougher \nquestion to determine, and that does require an impartial, balanced and \nthorough hearing. In fact, the President himself has said the best way \nto address these matters is to look at the facts candidly, and that is \nwhat I very much hope and expect that this committee will be able to \ndo.\n  I do think last summer we conducted hearings that were perceived by \nall as being thorough and fair and impartial. We went at it, in effect, \nto find out what the facts were, to ascertain the truth. I think we \npressed that issue in a resolute manner, and I would expect the special \ncommittee will do so in the case that is--in the instance that is \nbefore us.\n  These hearings will make an effort to get the facts out fully and \nimpartially. We anticipate that the administration will cooperate with \nthis effort. They certainly have indicated that is what they intend to \ndo. Last year they made every document available that was requested, as \nI recall. I think I am correct in that statement. Now the time has come \nto move forward, to begin our hearings, to begin, in effect, to examine \nthese various questions and allegations and ascertain with respect to \neach of them whether there is any factual grounding behind them or \nwhether they simply raise questions that people can ask. And that, of \ncourse, is the purpose of the inquiry which we will be undertaking here \nwith this provision of $950,000 to carry out this investigation in the \nperiod between now and February 29. The resolution provides that the \nspecial committee shall make every reasonable effort to complete, \n[[Page S6774]] not later than February 1, 1996, the investigation, \nstudy, and hearings authorized by section 1.\n  This resolution does provide the basis for carrying out a full and \nproper, impartial, and balanced hearing.\n  I think our challenge now is to move ahead in carrying out our \nresponsibilities in the special committee. It is a heavy burden to add \nto the responsibilities that Members already have but is one that \nobviously we are charged with responding to.\n  As I said, we adopted resolutions last year addressing this matter. \nThis, in effect, carries forward on those resolutions. It is a \ncontinuation, in effect, of that work. But I hope that if we apply \nourselves to it over the coming months, we will be able to work through \nall of these matters and, in effect, bring this issue to closure in the \nsense that the Members of the Senate and the American people know that \nthe various questions have been raised and thoroughly examined, that it \nhas been done with a great deal of balance and fairness and \nimpartiality, and that these are what the facts are as a consequence of \nthat investigation and inquiry.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. Will time be \nequally charged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent to put in a quorum call and \nthat the time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered. The time will be charged to both sides equally.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from North \nCarolina?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina whatever time \nhe needs, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by saying \nthat I plan to enthusiastically support the Whitewater resolution.\n  I think it is a good resolution. I am concerned, however, that a few \nkey things have been left out of it. Nevertheless, I think that before \nthe hearings are over, we will wind up working them in.\n  Nothing in this resolution allows us to probe the circumstances \nsurrounding the death of Vince Foster. When we held the hearings last \nyear in the Senate, a key witness, Captain Hume, simply did not show up \nat the hearings the day he was supposed to be there. The hearings had \nbeen planned for months. Captain Hume was out of town that day. He was \nsupposed to be there. Our ranking member at the time demanded that they \nbring him back for several days. But they did not bring him back. The \nhearings adjourned and we never heard from him. I do not think this was \na thorough airing of the issues, and I think we need to do it again.\n  I understand that Mr. Starr is looking at this again. I hope that he \nwill, given the miserable job that Mr. Fiske did of investigating.\n  Madam President, the Congress also needs to probe the $100,000 profit \nin the commodities market that came to Mrs. Clinton courtesy of Red \nBond and Jim Blair, the general counsel of Tyson Foods. This is not \nmentioned in the resolution, and it should be.\n  Just recently, I discovered that a friend of the Clintons, Barbara \nHolum, was conveniently installed as acting head of the CFTC before the \nstory of Mrs. Clinton's commodity trades broke.\n  There are many confusing issues. Now we find that Red Bond, who did \nthe commodity trading, who is practically bankrupt, was able to pay off \n$7 million in back taxes just 2 months before the commodity trading \nstory became public. To me, the evidence on this is just too much to \nbelieve that all of this is a coincidence.\n  Madam President, this resolution does not allow us to probe the \nfailure of First American Savings & Loan in Illinois.\n  If you can believe this, Vince Foster and Mrs. Clinton were hired by \nthe Federal Government to sue Dan Lasater. The same Dan Lasater that \nwas a close friend of the Clintons. That is right, Mrs. Clinton was \nhired by the Federal Government to sue Dan Lasater in connection with \nthe failure of First American Savings & Loan in Illinois. Mrs. Clinton \nparticipated in the decision to lower the amount of money the \nGovernment would recover from Dan Lasater from $3.3 million to \n$200,000, and we do not know yet what percentage of that went to her as \nattorney's fee because the records were sealed.\n  The Government spent over $100 billion to resolve the savings and \nloan crisis. With crooks like Dan Lasater involved and with Mrs. \nClinton acting on behalf of the taxpayers, suing a friend, it is no \nwonder the cost was so high.\n  I want to again state my strong support--and I say this not \nnecessarily in the language as we often use in the Senate--but of my \ngood friend, fellow member of the Banking Committee and our chairman, \nAlfonse D'Amato. He truly is a good friend, and he has given us the \nleadership we need.\n  I hope, and I know that before this hearing is over, under his \nleadership, we will have probed all aspects of Whitewater in a fair \nmanner so that the American people understand what happened, when it \nhappened, and who knew it when it happened. I look forward to the \nhearings.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I know of my good friend, Senator \nFaircloth's concern that there be ample scope to look into all of the \nmatters that are relevant, and I share that concern. I think that this \nresolution very fairly embodies us with the authority--and I would \nrefer to page 4.\n  As my friend raises, we did not attempt to spell out every single \narea. Page 4, line 12, says:\n\n       Subsection 3. To conduct an investigation and public \n     hearings into and study all matters that have any tendency to \n     reveal the full facts about . . .\n\n  Then we go through all of the various areas. There are other Senators \nwho are going to speak, but I believe it is important to summarize \nthose areas. Senator Sarbanes has. The fact is that we include the \nability to look into the bond underwriting contracts between the \nArkansas Development Finance Authority and Lasater & Co., and all of \nthose activities to which my friend has referred. But there must be a \nconnection, and if there is a connection, well, then, we will look into \nthe area, and I will touch on these areas in more detail before our \ntime is up.\n  So I share my friend's concern. This will be thorough. It will be \nthoughtful. And when subpoenas are issued--and I must tell you that the \nspecific instance that he raises is troubling, that of a witness who \nfailed to respond to a subpoena, especially one who works for the \nGovernment, who was given notice, and who gave the committee, either \nthe majority or the minority or our staff, no reason to believe that he \nwould not be there. That will not be tolerated. If we run into a \nsituation like that, I can assure you, and I know that the ranking \nmember shares this same concern, we want people to respond to \nsubpoenas. We will not issue them frivolously.\n  I think in that case a subpoena might not have even been issued \nbecause we assumed that he was going to be there. So it is not a bad \ntrack record to have almost everybody respond, including even those who \nwere not subpoenaed. But, we will remain vigilant in seeking this kind \nof cooperation.\n  I see that Senator Bond is in the Chamber, and he is on the Banking \nCommittee and was an integral part of last year's hearings, and I yield \nto him 10 minutes from my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my good friend, my colleague from \nNew York.\n  Madam President, as we begin the debate on this resolution \nauthorizing a second round of Whitewater hearings, I thought it would \nbe helpful to review why the Senate and the committee need these issues \nto be aired. [[Page S6775]] \n  I wish to summarize for my colleagues some points that are \nparticularly important to me and have come from my experience with the \nfirst round of hearings and also with the hearing back in February \nwhere we asked the questions that began some of the process in finding \nout what has gone on in the administration.\n  As most of the Nation now knows, Madison Guaranty was a Little Rock \nsavings and loan which went belly-up at the cost of nearly $50 million, \nand was owned by James McDougal--the business partner of the Clintons' \nin the Whitewater real estate deal.\n  Madison Guaranty was the classic S story of insider dealing, \nreckless loan policies and ultimate failure with the U.S. taxpayers \npicking up the tab. It is a part of the $105 billion cost of the S \ndebacle, and in that way is a story repeated in many communities around \nthe country.\n  But one part of this case has made it famous--many of its borrowers, \ndirectors, and counsel were prominent figures in Arkansas politics and \ngovernment.\n  The tangled web of Madison, Jim McDougal, and the Clintons has led to \ntwo sets of criminal referrals, an ongoing civil liability \ninvestigation by the RTC, a potential conflict of interest case for the \nFirst Lady's former law firm, a conviction of a Little Rock judge who \nimproperly loaned SBA money to McDougal and Whitewater, several other \nrecent guilty plea agreements and an ongoing investigation by \nindependent counsel Starr.\n  Since these issues first came to light, I have said over and over \nthat the American people have a right to know what happened to the \nmillions of dollars lost, and we, in Congress, must fulfill our \nobligation and get the facts out into the open.\n  Last year the Senate was engaged in a lengthy struggle over what \nquestions and areas the Banking Committee would be allowed to address \nas Whitewater--Madison hearings begin. Unfortunately, the Democratic \nleadership at that time did everything in their power to limit the \nscope of the hearings, and to block our efforts to get at the truth--\nparticularly as it relates to what Clinton administration officials \nhave done to control or interfere with investigations.\n  The questions we asked last year remain as relevant today as they did \nlast May:\n  Did Whitewater Development Corp. benefit from taxpayers insuring of \nMadison Guaranty deposits?\n  Did any of Madison's federally insured funds go to benefit the \nClinton campaigns?\n  Were the bank regulatory agencies operating in an impartial and \nindependent manner as they handled Madison Guaranty?\n  How did the Resolution Trust Corporation handle the criminal \nreferrals on Madison--both under the Bush administration as well as the \nClinton administration?\n  How did the Resolution Trust Corporation and the FDIC handle \npotential civil claims against Madison--both under the Bush \nadministration as well as the Clinton administration?\n  How did the Department of Justice handle the RTC criminal referrals \nit received, again both under the Bush administration and the Clinton \nadministration?\n  What were the sources of funding and lending practices of Capital \nManagement Services, and how did the SBA regulate and supervise it, \nparticularly as it related to loans to Susan McDougal and her company, \nMaster Marketing.\n  Full hearings on the Whitewater-Madison affair are needed so that all \nthese questions can be fairly asked and answered. What happened in \nArkansas, what happened in the 1992 Clinton campaign in their efforts \nto keep the lid on about the actions in Arkansas, and what has the \nadministration done to manage the Madison-Whitewater issues since they \ntook office.\n  If we are to finally get to the bottom of the story as to what \nhappened with the criminal referrals, I believe that we need to start \nwith the first criminal referral on Madison Guaranty which was already \nin the Justice Department awaiting action when the Clinton \nadministration took office.\n  Remember, Madison Guaranty had failed in 1989 and had been first \ntaken over by the FDIC, and then in August 1989 when Congress passed \nthe S bailout bill the newly created RTC took over Madison.\n  The RTC's mission was to close down failed thrifts, sell the assets, \npay off the depositors and then seek out criminal or civil wrongdoing \nthat may have occurred. If they found criminal wrongdoing--fraud, or \nattempts to enrich, they referred their findings to the Department of \nJustice for further action.\n  If they found civil wrongdoing--for example, law firms or accounting \nfirms who helped institutions stay open by providing misleading, \nincomplete or incorrect information to regulators or the S's board \nmembers--the RTC would pursue those cases.\n  Thus from August 1989 the RTC had Madison Guaranty on its plate. No \naction was taken by the RTC on potential civil claims, but several \ncriminal referrals were developed. In one case Jim McDougal and two \nothers were accused of fraud, but were acquitted, in another case a \nboard member plead guilty to falsifying documents.\n  Then came March 1992 when the New York Times reported a series of \npotential misdealings in Madison Guaranty and spurred the RTC to take \nanother look at the institution. This second look caused the first \ncriminal referral to be sent to Justice in the fall of 1992, and it was \nthis referral which awaited final action when the Clinton \nadministration came into office in January 1993.\n  I give this brief history in order to put things into perspective. \nLast year, Senator Specter and I offered amendments to the Whitewater \nCommittee resolution which would have allowed the Banking Committee to \npick up story at this point, and follow the trail of the first referral \nas it made its way through the Government, and then to follow the trail \nof the second referral as it was developed throughout 1993, up to and \nincluding the improper contacts by Treasury officials with White House \nstaff. This of course would entail questioning the RTC officials \ninvolved, Justice Department officials involved, as well as Treasury \nand White House staff.\n  Because we must remember that on the day that the Clinton \nadministration officials walked in the door on January 21, 1993, a \ncriminal referral on Madison Guaranty was sitting in the Department of \nJustice.\n  I for one still want to know:\n  How did the Department of Justice handle this referral?\n  Was the White House informed and if so when and by whom?\n  Who in Justice was assigned to monitor the Madison case, and what \nactions did they take?\n  And then, as we know now, just months after taking office, a second \nset of referrals was being developed--and it too was sent off to the \nClinton Justice Department by RTC officials in Kansas City.\n  I want to know why the RTC decided to stay on the case. What happened \nto get a series of RTC officials reassigned and taken off the case? Is \nthere a pattern of special treatment for politically sensitive cases? \nAnd again, how did the Department of Justice handle the second \nreferral?\n  I want to know why did the Clinton appointed Little Rock U.S. \nattorney Paula Casey, along with Webb Hubbell, delay their recusals \nuntil after the decision not to prosecute Madison was made? I also want \nto know the details about Paula Casey and Webb Hubbell's phone contacts \nduring the period when Casey was deciding what to do with the \nreferrals, and did either one of them have any contact with the White \nHouse on the referrals at any time?\n  And now, just in the past weeks we have seen reported by the \nAssociated Press that:\n\n       Preparing for televised Whitewater hearings last summer, \n     White House attorneys consulted confidential depositions from \n     a Treasury investigation in an effort to reconcile differing \n     accounts of administration officials who were about to \n     testify.\n       Former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler acknowledged this \n     week that the depositions were used to identify discrepancies \n     in the recollections of presidential aides before the \n     congressional hearings.\n       White House lawyers would then ``confront'' the aides with \n     information they had obtained from the depositions without \n     revealing the sources, he told The Associated Press.\n       ``If we found inconsistencies, we would go back to White \n     House officials, and go back over testimony they gave us,'' \n     Cutler explained. ``and then we would say `we have heard \n     other reports.'''\n\n  [[Page S6776]] This of course brings into play several other issues \nwhich I have been following since the close of the hearings last \nAugust. As we know now, confidential information was again turned over \nby Treasury to the White House--this time under the guise of a Treasury \nDepartment inspector general's investigation.\n  This calls into question not only the independence of the IG, but \nalso the willingness of this administration to politicize what is \nsupposed to be an internal watchdog.\n  It also calls into question the entire testimony offered by White \nHouse officials before the Senate Banking Committee--as they were given \nanother heads up in order to best tailor their testimony to help the \nboss.\n  Last November I wrote to then Chairman Riegle and ranking member \nD'Amato about what I had discovered. In my letter I stated:\n\n       As you know, over these past several months I have \n     continued my efforts to resolve outstanding questions which \n     were raised during the Banking Committee's Whitewater \n     hearings. Initially I became concerned upon discovering \n     during our hearings that the Treasury Inspector General had \n     turned over to the White House--at Lloyd Cutler's specific \n     request--transcripts of all the testimony taken by the \n     investigators a full week before the Office of Government \n     Ethics (OGE) report was made public. At the time we learned \n     this, several former Inspectors General expressed amazement \n     at this unprecedented action. However, no further review of \n     the incident was undertaken.\n       During my investigation of this disclosure, I discovered \n     that not only were the documents released to the White House \n     at the specific request of White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, \n     but, in doing so, the Treasury turned over confidential RTC \n     information to the White House.\n       On Saturday, July 23, 1994, the Department of the Treasury \n     gave the White House all of the sworn depositions of \n     Treasury, White House, and RTC personnel. These depositions \n     were unedited.\n       According to the RTC, it was not until July 26 or 27 that \n     the RTC became aware of the fact that RTC depositions had \n     been provided to the White House.\n       July 26, after reviewing the information provided by the \n     Treasury I.G., Lloyd Cutler testified before the House \n     Banking Committee.\n       July 28 and 29, Counsel to the RTC Inspector General \n     Patricia Black redacted all the Treasury, RTC, and White \n     House depositions in order to remove confidential RTC \n     information.\n       July 31 the OGE report, with edited testimony, was provided \n     to Congress and subsequently made public.\n       Given that the focus of our hearings this past August was \n     the improper transmittal of confidential information from the \n     RTC to the White House regarding Madison Guaranty and the \n     Clintons, I must tell you I am appalled that the same \n     Treasury Department, acting under specific direction from \n     Secretary Bentsen, would again provide nonpublic information \n     about the Madison Guaranty case directly to the White House.\n       In addition, I found it extraordinary that the White House, \n     which was itself under investigation, would be given \n     nonpublic information\n      prior to Congressional hearings--particularly when Congress \n     itself was not given the information.\n\n  And now of course we have discovered that Mr. Cutler and others used \nthis information not only to assist in the drafting of Mr. Cutler's \ntestimony--but to help White House staff with the inconsistencies in \ntheir own stories.\n  I find this entire episode just another example of the extraordinary \nlengths the White House was willing to go to keep the facts from \nCongress, keep the facts from the American people, and ultimately to \nprotect the administration.\n  As I have said on this floor before, breaching the public trust is as \nserious an offense as committing a crime, or being found liable for \nfinancial penalties. Governments in free societies have a fundamental \npact with the governed. In exchange for the powers and responsibilities \nwhich is given the Government, the people expect fairness, evenhanded \njustice, impartiality, and they held the innate belief that those in \npower can be trusted to be good stewards of their power.\n  Our form of democracy relies on checks and balances to keep too much \npower from ending up in just one place--and Congress, as the people's \nclosest link to their Government has the responsibility to keep a sharp \neye out for abuses and breaches of the people's trust.\n  Thus every Member of Congress takes an oath of office, to uphold the \nConstitution--and certainly part of that duty to be ever watchful for \nabuses of power. Interestingly, and not surprisingly, it nearly always \nfalls to the party out of power to be the more diligent in watching out \nfor abuses.\n  No one disputes this.\n  But one other fact should also be noted. As important it is for the \ngeneral public to believe in and trust that their elected leaders are \nperforming their jobs in an ethical, truthful, and fair manner--we, in \nCongress, must also believe that those in high positions of \nresponsibility are telling us the truth. When we ask questions or make \ninquiries we must trust that administrations will tell the truth, will \nbe honest, and that when we get an answer, it is a full and complete \none.\n  Unfortunately, Madam President, it is this standard that inevitably \nsome administration officials seem unable to comprehend.\n  Instead of cooperation and truthfulness we have seen evasions, \nomissions, misstatements, and possibly outright lies.\n  And the story of potential abuse of the public trust, the \npoliticization of independent agencies and investigations, the use of \nconfidential material for political gain--it only seems to get worse \nthe deeper you look.\n  Madam President, the next rounds of hearings will go a long way \ntoward clearing the air, and I commend the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee for brining this matter back into the public eye.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  Madam President, let me begin these brief remarks by commending our \ncolleagues from New York and Maryland for what I think is a very fair \nand balanced resolution. Obviously, matters such as this are a source \nof deep controversy and can get out of hand. The fact that they have \npresented us with a resolution that is balanced and fair is a credit to \nboth the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from New York. Any \ndiscussion of this ought to begin with an expression of appreciation on \nthe part of all of us in this body, particularly those of us who will \nserve on the special committee and who will be working during this \ncalendar year to carry out the mandates and requirements of this \nresolution. Now I would like to make a few brief observations about the \nresolution.\n  As my colleagues know, Madam President, there was a vote by 98 to 0 \non March 17 of last year to look into these matters, and what we are \ntalking about here is a continuation of that process. This resolution \nis simply another step in a process designed to help the American \npublic know the facts about Whitewater.\n  Second, I would like to point out, Madam President, that the \nPresident has fully cooperated in this process. We ought to commend him \nfor this unprecedented level of cooperation.\n  Many of us recall other Presidents who, when confronted with similar \nsituations, have clogged up the courts of this land, fighting \neverything along the way. This administration has not done that. In \nfact, the administration has been entirely forthcoming.\n  As we discuss these matters, it is important to make it clear that, \nunlike previous situations where there was a constant conflict between \nthe executive branch and the legislative branch over documents and \ntestimony, that has not been the case here. The administration has \ncomplied with every document request, answered every question that has \nbeen submitted to it, and I am confident is ready and willing to \ncooperate in this second stage of the proceeding.\n  I think that is an important point to make because, as we look down \nthe road, there is the potential for a prolonged and nasty conflict \nbetween the executive and legislative branch.\n  Third, Madam President, I think last year's hearings, despite moments \nof passion and emotion, were credible and fair. I think it is important \nto point out and to state emphatically that it was the conclusion of \nthe committee [[Page S6777]] last year that there had been no violation \nof criminal statutes or ethical standards.\n  Of course, individual Members may have their own particular opinions \non those matters, and certainly that is their right. But, as a \nconclusion of the committee, let me restate, Madam President, there \nwere no violations of any criminal statute or any ethical standards. \nThat was the conclusion of last year's hearings.\n  Now we are going to go to a second phase. I have listened to some who \nare suggesting that there must have been some wrongdoing, or, even \nworse, they have already reached the conclusion that there was \nwrongdoing. Quite simply, that is inappropriate. The purpose of the \nhearings is to determine whether there was wrongdoing--we must not \nprejudge the matter.\n  We do not want to end up appearing like that famous character from \nthe West, Judge Roy Bean. Everyone will remember Judge Roy Bean. He \nused to say, ``We'll hang 'em first and try 'em later.''\n  Sometimes that can happen in congressional proceedings, and I know it \nis not the intention of anyone on the committee to have that be the \ncase.\n  So let us avoid partisan wrangling and get the facts on the table. \nNow the presumption of innocence may not apply to congressional \nhearings in the same way as in our court system, but there ought to at \nleast be an effort to fully consider matters, and let people have their \nsay, before we reach any conclusions.\n  Last year, the Senate held thorough hearings, as I mentioned earlier. \nThe committee heard from 30 witnesses, generating 2,600 pages of \ntestimony; 38 witnesses were deposed, generating some 7,000 additional \npages of testimony.\n  It is very difficult to sort through that much material and I want to \nthank the staff for the work they did. That was a herculean effort. \nBoth the majority and minority staff had to work extremely long hours \non this matter, Madam President, and they deserve our appreciation.\n  Obviously, Madam President, the Senate's integrity and credibility \nare at stake. The American public has a right to know the facts about \nWhitewater and the Senate has a constitutional obligation to see that \nthey do.\n  Last year, the facts were presented fully and impartially. That must \nbe our goal this year. The public, in my view, is fed up with the \npartisanship that seems to cloud every issue.\n  As we go through this process, I urge my colleagues to avoid that \npartisan pitfall. Because we are entering a presidential campaign \ncycle, that may be difficult for some. But we must all try. The \nPresident is sadly correct, and I suspect most of my colleagues, \nregardless of their political persuasion, would agree when he says that \nthe politics of personal attack are alive and well. I agree with the \nPresident that the best way to put this matter behind us is to address \nthe facts candidly.\n  Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield whatever time the Senator requires.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I will wrap this up.\n  Madam President, the public wants us to present the facts \nimpartially, come to our conclusions and then move on. And it bears \nrepeating that after going through such a process last year, the \nBanking Committee concluded that there had been no violation of \ncriminal statutes or ethical standards.\n  During this next stage, we must not get into political diversions and \ndrag this thing out. The American people want us to get on with the \nbusiness of creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity, of \ndealing with health care issues and education. They want us to tackle \nthe hard problems that they face every day.\n  I think it was there sense of frustration with politics as usual, \nmore than anything else, that created the changes in the Congress. We \nnow have a Republican leadership, and every committee is chaired by \nthat party. They now have an even greater responsibility to the public. \nThey must elevate the good of the nation above politics and I hope that \nthey will do so in proceeding with this matter.\n  Once again, I commend Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes for \nputting together a fair resolution and for stating their determination \nto wrap this matter up by February of next year. I hope we can stick to \nthat schedule and finish this job efficiently.\n  Finally, while the subject of the independent counsel statute is not \nthe subject of this particular resolution, Madam President, I want to \nsuggest that we revisit that legislation as soon as we can.\n  The idea of appointing an independent counsel was to keep politics \nout of these issues. Unfortunately, it seems that the statute may \ninvite fishing expeditions. We need to be very careful about spending \nthe taxpayers dollars in this way. Otherwise we will have some \nquestionable expenditures. I was told the other day that someone was \nlooking at a witnesses' grade school and high school transcripts. I \nhope that report is inaccurate because there is just no way to justify \nthat kind of expenditure.\n  There is the potential for an independent counsel to run wild and we \nneed to carefully monitor these matters. I caution those who would like \nto use independent counsels for political gain--regardless of whether \nit was a previous administration or this administration--that whatever \ngoes around comes around. We would be well advised, in my view, to take \na hard look at how some of these operations are being run.\n  Of course, Congress spends a great deal of money on these \ninvestigations. The Banking Committee spent about $400,000 last year, \nand this resolution authorizes another $950,000. But even that amount \nis only a fraction of what the independent counsel is spending. We are \nlooking at almost $10 million spent by the independent counsel and that \nis just the beginning of it. That figure will go higher.\n  Of course, the Federal Government must investigate serious \naccusations of wrongdoing to maintain the public trust. But when it \nappears there are more Federal agents operating in Little Rock than \nthere are in high-crime areas in certain parts of our country, then one \nought to pause and look carefully at what we are doing.\n  Again, I know that the independent counsel statute is not the subject \nof this resolution. I do not want to inject a whole new subject of \ndebate. But I think we ought to take another look at that law and make \nsure it is operating properly.\n  Again, I commend the chairman of the Banking Committee, my friend \nfrom New York, Senator D'Amato, and my colleague and friend from \nMaryland, Senator Sarbanes, for the fine job they have done in working \nout this resolution. We have a very difficult job in front of us. \nHopefully, we will conduct our work thoroughly, fairly, and promptly, \nand in a manner that brings credit to this great body. I look forward \nto the effort.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, at this time, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding me this time. I support the resolution and commend the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Banking Committee for presenting \na resolution which I understand will have wide bipartisan support.\n  I believe it is important to have a congressional inquiry on this in \nthe broad terms which are described in the resolution. It is with some \nregret, I note, that it has taken us more than a year to get to this \npoint. But it is better late than never, and these are matters where \ncongressional oversight is important.\n  I recognize the sensitivity of a congressional inquiry on a matter \nwhich is being handled by an independent counsel, also known as the \nspecial prosecutor. But the functions are very, very different where \nyou have an investigation which is handled through grand jury \nproceedings which are secret and which are directed at indictments. I \nknow that field with some detail, having been a district attorney \nmyself and [[Page S6778]] having run grand jury investigations. That is \nvery, very different from a congressional inquiry where we are \ninquiring into matters in the public record for the public to see what \nis going on in Government with a view to legislative changes.\n  The thrust and focus are entirely different between a grand jury \ninvestigation conducted by independent counsel and a congressional \ninquiry which will be handled through the Banking Committee. I am glad \nto see that the composition of the committee will be expanded to \ninclude the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, or \ntheir designees.\n  Madam President, the issues involved here have long been a concern of \nmany of us in this Chamber, and I refer to statements which I made last \nyear dated March 17, June 9, June 16, and June 21. I will not \nincorporate them because that would unduly burden the Record, but a \ngood many of my thoughts were expressed last year on the matter.\n  I was particularly concerned about issues involving the RTC as to \ntheir inclusion, which was not handled last year, and I am glad to see \nthat the Resolution Trust Corporation is included in the scope of the \ninquiry which we are about to undertake.\n  This matter was one that I focused on when we had an oversight \nhearing on the Department of Justice on July 28 of last year, and I ask \nunanimous consent, Madam President, that a number of documents be \nprinted in the Record which have not been made a part of the Record \nheretofore: My letter dated July 26, 1994, to Attorney General Reno; \nthe attachment of a list of documents which I had wanted to inquire \ninto during the proceedings before the Judiciary Committee; the \nresponse which was made by Robert Fiske, who was then independent \ncounsel; and a portion of the transcript dated July 28, 1994 before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, these documents will show on their face concerns \nwhich were on the record and which were apparent from such documents: \nthat there were considerable issues to be investigated in the RTC at \nthat time. It is unfortunate, in a sense, that there has been the long \ndelay, because we all know, as a matter of investigative procedure, \nthat leads grow cold and witnesses' memories diminish and that the best \ninvestigation is a prompt investigation.\n But the time factor is something that cannot be altered at this time, \nand at least now we will have a congressional inquiry which will move \nforward into these very, very important matters.\n\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut when he talks \nabout the presumption of innocence. I think that is indispensable as a \nmatter of fairness to all concerned. But these are questions which need \nto be answered, and questions do not imply an answer of any sort; they \nraise issues which ought to be answered. We ought to let the chips fall \nwhere they may. And in a Government based on a Constitution which \nelevates the separation of powers among the Congress in article I, and \nthe executive branch in article II, and the judiciary in article III, \nthe congressional oversight function is a very, very important \nfunction. Now, finally, we will be in the context where we will be able \nto inquire into these matters and to find out what those answers are.\n  I am confident that there will be a fair, judicious, quality inquiry \nconducted by the committee, and this resolution is one which I think \nought to be supported broadly by the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nU.S. Senate, Commmittee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC, July 28, 1994\n\n    (The following is a partial transcript of the above proceedings)\n\n       Senator Specter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Attorney General \n     Reno, as you know, I had intended to ask you questions about \n     the handling by the Department of Justice in the matter \n     involving David Hale in this oversight hearing, and I may be \n     able to cover the principal points of my interest without \n     undue specification, or at least undue specification from \n     your point of view.\n       At the outset, I would like to put into the record my \n     letter to you dated July 26, 1994, together with the \n     chronology of events and all the attachments which I sent \n     over to you, except for numbers 20 and 21. I may get into 20 \n     and 21. I think the balance have been in the record in one \n     form or another, and even if they haven't I think they are \n     appropriate for the public record.\n       [The letter referred to follows:]\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1994.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I have just noted that you are \n     scheduled to testify before the Judiciary Committee on \n     Thursday, July 28, at 2:00 p.m. at an oversight hearing.\n       In that hearing I intend to ask questions on the Justice \n     Department's role in investigations of Madison Guaranty and/\n     or ``Whitewater.'' While I have not had access to many of the \n     relevant documents, I have seen a few and am alerting you to \n     those documents which will formulate at least some of the \n     basis for my questions.\n       Some of the documents are referred to in my floor statement \n     on June 21. Other documents that I may refer to are listed on \n     the attached index.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       Senator Specter. I would also want to put into the record \n     the faxed letter from Robert Fiske, Independent Counsel, to \n     me, dated July 27, 1994.\n       [The letter referred to follows:]\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                            Office of the Independent Counsel,\n\n                                   Little Rock, AR, July 27, 1994.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The Department of Justice has sent \n     over to me a copy of your letter of July 26, 1994 to Attorney \n     General Reno, together with the index of documents enclosed \n     with it.\n       It is apparent from a review of the documents on that index \n     that they relate to the handling by the Department of Justice \n     of a particular criminal referral from the RTC. Based upon \n     interviews we have had with representatives from the Kansas \n     City Field Office of the RTC, we are currently actively \n     investigating this matter. Accordingly, I would respectfully \n     request that you not go into this subject with the Attorney \n     General at your hearing tomorrow since to do so might \n     prejudice our ongoing investigation. (For similar reasons we \n     request that you not go into the matter referenced by \n     documents #20 and #21.)\n       We have made a similar request to both the Senate Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House \n     Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs which, as you \n     know, are in the process of conducting Whitewater hearings. \n     Both of those Committees have agreed not to go into this \n     subject until we have completed our investigation.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                             Robert B. Fiske, Jr.,\n                                              Independent Counsel.\n\n       Senator Specter. At the outset, I want to say for the \n     record that I do not agree with the deference which the \n     Congress has accorded the independent counsel because I \n     believe that Congress has independent status, and at least \n     equal status, if not more important status, on matters of \n     public policy than the criminal prosecutions. But the Senate \n     has decided otherwise as a political matter, in my opinion.\n       As I reviewed the charter of Mr. Fiske, it seemed to me \n     that questions about oversight on what happened with David \n     Hale were not within his charter, his charter being to \n     investigate matters of possible criminal or civil wrongdoing. \n     I am advised to the contrary on that, and we may get into \n     that in some specificity.\n       So let me start in an effort to ask the questions in a \n     generalized way, but candidly as they arise on David Hale's \n     matter. I refer to a memorandum from RTC investigator Jean \n     Lewis to Richard Iorio which quotes officials within the \n     Department of Justice, which is why I ask you about this; \n     specifically, Ms. Donna Henneman in the Office of Legal \n     Counsel. Without making anything more specific as to the Hale \n     matter, my question to you as a general matter is, any time a \n     referral comes in to the Department of Justice that would \n     make the Department look bad or has political ramifications, \n     it goes to the Attorney General. Is that true?\n       Attorney General Reno. I don't know whether any time \n     something comes in to the Department that would make the \n     Department look bad it comes to the Attorney General.\n       Senator Specter. Well, if you don't know, who does, \n     Attorney General Reno?\n       Attorney General Reno. I would suspect that each one of the \n     95,000 people who hear something that might make the \n     Department look bad. I think your question is a little bit \n     broad. I cannot answer it. As I have tried to say from the \n     very beginning, when I appointed Mr. Fiske I tried to make \n     sure that he was as independent as possible. I have continued \n     to try to do that, and I think the [[Page S6779]] worst thing \n     that I could do would be to comment or talk about matters \n     that he is pursuing. I should be happy, because I have great \n     respect for the Senate and for you, at the conclusion of the \n     matter to try to respond to anything, including the \n     specifics.\n       Senator Specter. Well, I don't think that is sufficient, \n     Attorney General Reno, because I think this is a legitimate \n     matter for Judiciary Committee oversight, and we don't have \n     very much of it. But I accept your point that my question was \n     too general, so I will be specific.\n       The investigator, L. Jean Lewis, of RTC, had many \n     conversations with representatives of the Department of \n     Justice, as reflected in the number of the memoranda which I \n     sent on to you. So if it is too general as to whether any \n     time a referral comes in that would make the Department look \n     bad or has political ramifications it goes to the Attorney \n     General, I would ask you, were you personally informed about \n     the referral from the RTC on the check kiting case involving \n     Madison Guaranty?\n       Attorney General Reno. As I indicated to you, Senator, I \n     made a determination when I appointed Mr. Fiske that I would \n     not comment or make any comment. He has expressed to you that \n     he would prefer that I not comment on the specific matters. I \n     do not want to do anything that would impair has \n     independence. I do think you have an oversight function with \n     respect to the Department of Justice, and when it would be \n     appropriate for me to comment I would look forward to the \n     opportunity to do so.\n       Senator Specter. Well, tell me, Attorney General Reno, has \n     would it impair Mr. Fiske's investigation or prosecution for \n     you to answer a question as to whether you had personal \n     knowledge of a referral to the Department of Justice?\n       Attorney General Reno. I can't tell you, sir, because I \n     have tried to do everything in my power to make sure that Mr. \n     Fiske's investigation is independent and I don't know what \n     his investigation involves. Therefore, I am not going to say \n     anything that could possibly interfere with his \n     investigation.\n       Senator Specter. Well, my question to you is how could it \n     possibly interfere with his investigation to answer a \n     question as to when you had knowledge of a referral to the \n     United States Department of Justice.\n       Attorney General Reno. I don't know, sir, because I am not \n     going to take the chance of interfering with it. You would \n     have to ask Mr. Fiske because I don't want to do anything at \n     this time that would interfere or impair that investigation. \n     I do not know the nature of the process of that investigation \n     and it would be inappropriate for me to comment, but I do----\n       The Chairman. Put another way, Senator, how would it shed \n     any light in this oversight if the Attorney General answered \n     that question? What the hell difference does it make now?\n       Senator Specter. Well, the hell difference that it makes \n     now is on an earlier question which I asked that whenever \n     there is a matter with political ramifications that it goes \n     to the Attorney General--and I asked that question in its \n     broadest terms and was told that it was too general, so that \n     is when I came back to the specific question.\n       The Chairman. Let me ask the question the other way to the \n     Senator. Mr. Fiske's investigation in this matter is likely \n     to be wrapped up. He has been moving expeditiously.\n      Does it matter to the Senator whether or not the Attorney \n     General speaks to this issue today or in two weeks or a \n     month, or whenever it is when Mr. Fiske settles this part \n     of his investigation? I don't know when he is going to \n     settle that, but I mean he has been moving very rapidly.\n       In terms of oversight for next year's budget and last \n     year's actions, it seems to me the Senator would have plenty \n     of time to ask these questions as it would impact on the \n     outcome of the Senator's view as to what the Attorney General \n     should or shouldn't do in the future.\n       Senator Specter. Well, I would be glad to respond to the \n     chairman. It does make a difference to me, and it makes a \n     difference to me because this is an oversight hearing and the \n     request to the committee chairman to have oversight on these \n     matters was declined. There has been a charter which is very, \n     very narrow before the Banking Committee, and this does not \n     involve, to my knowledge, a matter which is within the \n     charter of Mr. Fiske until when I sent a letter to the \n     Attorney General, I suddenly find a reply from Mr. Fiske.\n       I had two detailed conversations with Mr. Fiske, the thrust \n     of which--and I would be glad to detail them--led me to the \n     conclusion that there was absolutely no interference with the \n     criminal prosecution, a subject that I have had some \n     experience with.\n       So when I asked the Attorney General a question as to when \n     she has knowledge of a referral, I can't conceive that it \n     interferes with an investigation, and that is why I am asking \n     an experienced prosecutor who is now the Attorney General how \n     could it conceivably interfere with a pending investigation.\n       Attorney General Reno. An experienced prosecutor, Senator, \n     doesn't comment about something that she doesn't know about. \n     I don't know about the details of Mr. Fiske's investigation. \n     But if Mr. Fiske doesn't have any problem with it, what I \n     would suggest that we do is prepare the questions, submit \n     them to Mr. Fiske. If he has no objection to my answering \n     them, then we will try to answer them because I honor your \n     oversight function and I would want to be able to honor that \n     and to not interfere with Mr. Fiske's investigation.\n       Senator Specter. Attorney General Reno, I did not say that \n     Mr. Fiske did not have a problem. He specifically told me \n     that he would like the field to be totally left alone. What I \n     said to you was that after talking to Mr. Fiske, I had no \n     doubt that these questions were appropriate, in my judgment, \n     on oversight by the Judiciary Committee.\n       Let me ask you this, Attorney General Reno. In terms of the \n     charter that Mr. Fiske has about investigating matters which \n     may involve a violation of the criminal or civil law, is the \n     handling by the Department of Justice of David Hale's matter \n     something that falls within that charter?\n       Attorney General Reno. I have tried to, again, let Mr. \n     Fiske define that based on the charter that we described so \n     that I would not in any way impair his independence.\n       Senator Specter. Well, do you have any interest in whether \n     any current employees of the Department of Justice are \n     subject to an investigation which might be within Mr. Fiske's \n     charter for possible criminal wrongdoings?\n       Attorney General Reno. Yes.\n       Senator Specter. Well, if that were so, would you have a \n     duty as the head of the Department of Justice to take some \n     action on those matters before a long investigation was \n     concluded?\n       Attorney General Reno. It depends on what they are, sir.\n       Senator Specter. Well, suppose they were obstruction of \n     justice?\n       Attorney General Reno. It depends on the nature of the \n     facts and the circumstances, sir\n       Senator Specter. Well, do you know anything about that on \n     the Hale matter?\n       Attorney General Reno. Again, sir, I can't comment on the \n     Hale matter.\n       Senator Specter. I am not asking you to comment on the Hale \n     matter. I am asking you whether you know anything about the \n     Hale matter.\n       Attorney General Reno. That would be commenting, sir, and \n     what I would suggest, if we want to pursue this, is that you \n     pose the questions and then let's see whether Mr. Fiske \n     thinks that they would in any way interfere with the \n     investigation. I am delighted to answer them if they don't \n     interfere.\n       Senator Specter. Well, I am not going to follow the way you \n     would like me to proceed. I make a judgment as to what I \n     think a Senator ought to do by way of oversight, and if you \n     have a concern about that I am prepared to discuss it with \n     you, but I am not prepared to take your instruction or your \n     suggestion.\n       The question that I pose on an investigation by Mr. Fiske \n     as independent counsel within his charter to investigate \n     crimes, obstruction of justice, within the Department of \n     Justice is not something which bears on anything which could \n     conceivably implicate the underlying facts on what David Hale \n     is doing.\n       Is Ms. Paula Casey--I understand that she is, but can you \n     confirm for me that she is still the United States attorney?\n       Attorney General Reno. Yes, sir, she is.\n       Senator Specter. Is she the subject of a criminal\n        investigation by Mr. Fiske?\n       Attorney General Reno. You would have to talk to Mr. Fiske.\n       Senator Specter. Do you know whether or not she is the \n     subject of a criminal investigation by Mr. Fiske?\n       Attorney General Reno. You would have to talk to Mr. Fiske. \n     I have avoided having anything to do with Mr. Fiske's \n     investigation in terms of any information that he may have so \n     that I do not impair his independence.\n       Senator Specter. Would you continue a United States \n     attorney operating actively if that United States attorney \n     were the subject of a criminal investigation?\n       Attorney General Reno. It would depend on the \n     circumstances.\n       Senator Specter. Well, under what circumstances would you \n     terminate such an attorney?\n       Attorney General Reno. It would depend on the \n     circumstances. Again, you get into a situation of \n     hypotheticals and it is far better that we look at the actual \n     facts, and I would be happy at the appropriate time to do \n     that with you.\n       Senator Specter. Well, Attorney General Reno, I consider \n     your responses, as I see them, totally unsatisfactory, and I \n     consider them totally unsatisfactory because I am not asking \n     you anything about a pending investigation. I am asking you \n     questions as to what came to your knowledge as the Attorney \n     General of the United States Department of Justice.\n       I am asking you questions about what you know and about \n     what your policy would be if there were charges of criminal \n     wrongdoing, and I don't ask these questions in a vacuum or \n     for no purpose. I ask these questions in the context of \n     having initiated an inquiry on oversight on something which \n     is outside the charter of the independent counsel.\n       The Chairman. In your opinion, Senator, right, is that \n     correct? In your opinion?\n       Senator Specter. Everything I say is in my opinion. You can \n     add that to everything. I don't speak for anybody but myself, \n     but I do speak independently for myself.\n       I took a look at an extensive series of correspondence \n     which has gotten to the Department of Justice and gotten to \n     the FBI and gotten to the United States attorney's office and \n     gotten to the executive office and gotten to the Office of \n     Legal Counsel, according to these documents, which I sent to \n     you as soon [[Page S6780]] as I knew there would be this \n     hearing so you would have an opportunity to review them. I \n     promptly advised the chairman as to what I intended to do \n     there would be no surprises about it.\n       The Chairman. That is correct.\n       Senator Specter. When I pursue the matter and find I have a \n     telephone call and a letter from the independent counsel, I \n     call him and then I am told that it is within his charter, \n     that there is an investigation which is underway for \n     obstruction of justice.\n       As I review the facts of this matter, I am struck with \n     wonderment as to how officials in the United States \n     attorney's office decline to have immunity granted to David \n     Hale, and then independent counsel comes in and in a short \n     time has a grant of immunity. Then officials in the United \n     States attorney's office in Little Rock recuse themselves in \n     a later matter, and I wonder how can they recuse themselves \n     in a later matter without having recused themselves in an \n     earlier matter, given their relationship to subjects of the \n     investigation.\n       I ran a big office myself as a prosecutor, and if I had any \n     reason to believe anybody in my office had any problem, I \n     wouldn't wait for anybody to cleanse it totally and \n     thoroughly and immediately. I do not believe that the charter \n     to the independent counsel takes away any of the authority or \n     the responsibility of the Attorney General to act in that \n     circumstance.\n       In my opinion--everything I say is in my opinion--the \n     questions which I have asked you are entirely appropriate \n     questions, and I give some additional background because I \n     think these are matters which ought to be answered, and I \n     intend to pursue them and I don't intend to wait.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       The Chairman. Thank you.\n       General, I think you have answered totally appropriately, \n     in my opinion. I think were you to do otherwise, in light of \n     Mr. Fiske's comments, you would be excoriated by Mr. Fiske \n     and anyone else. I guarantee you, you would have an article \n     saying that you have interfered if you went in and, quote, \n     ``cleansed,'' were there a need to cleanse. You would be \n     accused of whitewashing to avoid Mr. Fiske being able to \n     fully look at the matter.\n       You are answering, in my opinion, totally appropriately, \n     and you have done what I don't know many others have been \n     willing to do. You have said to this committee, without \n     having to have some big show on the floor, that when Mr. \n     Fiske says he is finished with this phase of the \n     investigation you will come back and you will answer \n     questions. It seems to me you are being totally appropriate, \n     but that is why there are Democrats and Republicans, \n     chocolate and vanilla, good and bad, right and wrong, \n     different points of view. Our opinions are different.\n       I respect this man. He did notify me. Stick to your guns, \n     don't answer his questions, in my opinion.\n       Senator Specter. If I might have just one sentence?\n       The Chairman. Yes. You may have more than one sentence.\n       Senator Specter. I don't think this matter has anything to \n     do with good and bad or chocolate and vanilla.\n       The Chairman. Well, it may not have to do with good and \n     bad, but it has to do with what one considers to be the \n     appropriate way for you to respond. I think you are \n     responding appropriately because I think you are in the \n     ultimate catch-22 position. At the request of all of us in \n     the Senate, you appointed a Republican named Fiske. Now, the \n     Republican named Fiske tells you, please don't respond to \n     anything having to do with this. You are being asked to \n     respond to something having to do with this, and if you \n     respond or don't respond, you are in deep trouble in the \n     minds of whoever wants to view you as being in trouble. I \n     think you are doing just fine. My view is worth no more, \n     probably a little less in this circumstance, than the Senator \n     from Pennsylvania's, but good job, General.\n\n                                 Index\n\n       1.

No record of \n     Madison criminal referral at Washington DOJ.\n       6. RTC-KC E-Mail, May 19, 1993. Madison matter forwarded to \n     Donna Henneman in ``Legal Counsel.'' Referral submitted to \n     that office ``because of the political ramifications and \n     political motivations.''\n       7. RTC-KC E-Mail, May 26, 1993. Follow-up call from Donna \n     Henneman (DOJ). RTC advised by an FBI agent in Little Rock \n     that it was a `very solid case of check kiting, and was \n     highly prosecutable.'' Henneman was growing increasingly \n     frustrated by the situation, because she had seen the \n     information, knew that it had come in, and couldn't \n     understand why she was having such a hard time tracking where \n     the referral and exhibits had gone.\n       8. RTC-KC E-Mail, June 8, 1993. Conversation with Donna \n     Henneman (DOJ). Madison Referral has reappeared on her desk. \n     Criminal Division has sent memo to Doug Frazier (in Depty. \n     Atty. General Heyman's office) advising him that there was \n     ``no identifiable basis for recusal of the U.S. Attorney in \n     the Eastern District of Arkansas.'' Referral sent to Frazier \n     for review and final decision.\n       9. RTC-KC E-Mail, June 23, 1993. Conversation with Donna \n     Henneman (DOJ). Package returned from Frazier. Frazier \n     appointed U.S. Attorney in Florida.\n       10. RTC-KC E-Mail, June 23, 1993. Further conversation with \n     Donna Henneman (DOJ). Spoke with Doug Frazier. Decision made \n     to return the referral back to the Arkansas U.S. Attorney. No \n     basis for recusal.\n       11. RTC-KC E-Mail, June 29, 1993. Source indicates Madison \n     referral has been returned to Little Rock. Acting U.S. \n     Attorney will not act on referral. It is being held until \n     U.S. Attorney designee Paula Casey takes office.\n       12. RTC-KC E-Mail, September 23, 1993. Conversation with \n     Donna Henneman (DOJ). Washington DOJ would like to be copied \n     on all future transmittal letters concerning Madison \n     referrals with an additional one paragraph summary of the \n     content of the referrals with the transmittal letters, so \n     that Henneman will be aware of those with ``sensitivity \n     issues.''\n       13. RTC-KC E-Mail, September 29, 1993. Conversation with \n     Donna Henneman (DOJ). DOJ would like copies of all future \n     Madison referrals sent to Washington in addition to sending \n     to U.S. Attorney in Little Rock. Henneman will confirm this \n     in writing.\n       14. RTC-KC E-Mail, September 29, 1993. Conversation with \n     Donna Henneman (DOJ). Washington DOJ withdrawing request for \n     referrals to be sent directly to Washington, but would still \n     like copies of transmittal letters with addendum summary \n     paragraph.\n       15. RTC-KC E-Mail, October 27, 1993. Conversation with \n     Donna Henneman (DOJ). Inquiry on whether declination letter \n     had arrived from Little Rock U.S. Attorney.\n       16. Letter of October 27, 1993 from Paula J. Casey (U.S. \n     Attorney) to L. Jean Lewis (RTC). Declination letter on the \n     Madison referral.\n       17. Letter of November 1, 1993 from L. Jean Lewis (RTC) to \n     Paris J. Casey (U.S. Attorney). Confirmation of declination \n     letter and the stipulation from October 27th letter that the \n     matter was concluded prior to the beginning of Paula Casey's \n     tenure and that the RTC had never been advised of such \n     result. Chronology of correspondence between RTC and DOJ.\n       18. RTC-KC E-Mail, November 15, 1993. Transmittal of white \n     paper outlining chronology of events related to 1992 Madison \n     referral. Challenges news article indicating that decision to \n     decline Madison referral had been prior to Paula Casey's \n     appointment.\n       19. RTC-KC E-Mail with attachment, January 6, 1994. \n     Discussion of contact with reporter.\n       20. Letter of September 15, 1993 from Randy Coleman (David \n     Hale Attorney) to Paula Casey. Coleman has been trying to \n     negotiate a plea and senses that Casey is reluctant because \n     of ``political senitivity.''\n       21. Letter of September 20, 1993 from Randy Coleman to \n     Michael Johnson. Reiterates interest in plea negotiations, \n     offering David Hale's information and willingness to \n     participate in undercover activities.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 31 minutes; the \nSenator from New York has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we have come to a point in this debate when \nwe are about to vote on this particular resolution. If I might, I would \nlike to talk for a few moments about the public's right to know, as the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee from New York has made \nreference to.\n  He says the public has a right to know what happened in the \nWhitewater matter. The public has a right to know who did what, when, \nand whatever. I can assure you that the Senator from Arkansas does not \ndisagree.\n  But I think also the public has a right to know something else. I \nthink the public has a right to know in this case exactly how much \nmoney of the taxpayers' dollars we are spending in the so-called \nWhitewater matter. I think the public has a right to know that with \nthis resolution, if it passes and if the funding goes through--and we \nall assume it will--the Senate alone will have spent, up through \nJanuary or maybe February of next year, in the Whitewater matter $1.350 \nmillion of Senate money to investigate this matter. I do not have \navailable the amount of money the House of Representatives has spent \nand will spend in the future. And we do not know exactly how much the \ncost of the independent counsel will be. But here are some figures I \nmight throw out for the Record at this time. To the best of our \nknowledge, Mr. [[Page S6781]] President, thus far, as of August 31. \n1994, the independent counsel, Mr. Starr and Mr. Fiske, combined, spent \n$1.879 million. Projected funding for the independent counsel for the \n1995 fiscal year is $6.3 million, which is a subtotal of $8.129 \nmillion, and a total, adding all the figures up, Mr. President, for \nboth the Senate and the independent counsel to investigate so-called \nWhitewater, comes to almost $10 million in taxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. President, I think there is something else the public has a right \nto know. I think the public has a right to know that this White House, \nthis President, this First Lady, this administration, has never one \ntime been accused of lack of cooperation. In fact, our President has \npointed out, as one of our colleagues has already mentioned, that to be \ncandid and truthful in this matter is going to be the quickest and best \nway to get to the bottom of it.\n  In the first round of hearings last summer, the committee heard from \n30 witnesses generating 2,600 pages of testimony, deposing 38 \nwitnesses, generating 7,000 pages of testimony.\n  The administration has produced thousands of pages of documents for \ncommittee review. This administration has complied with every document \nrequest. They have answered every question posed to it. The \nadministration is ready and willing to cooperate on this second round \nof hearings and it bears emphasis, I think, that after the long days of \nhearings and pages of documents reviewed, that the Banking Committee \nconcluded at the end of this hearing, in phase 1, that there had been \nno violation of a criminal statute and no violation of an ethical \nstandard.\n  Mr. President, I think, too, it needs to be added that at no time \nduring any of these investigations or any of these hearings, whether it \nbe in Little Rock or Washington, the Banking Committee or the special \ncounsel, wherever, to the best of our knowledge, not one witness, not \none person has taken the fifth amendment.\n  I think that this speaks loudly and clearly about this \nadministration's position, wanting to get on with the important \nbusiness of our country.\n  Mr. President, let me compliment our friend, Senator Sarbanes, for \nworking out what I think--and going forward with--is a fairly \nreasonable proposal in trying to attack this problem and to set up \nthese hearings. I think that there are some things, however, that I \nmust state that I do not feel are fair. I do not feel that it is fair \nfor one of the members of the committee, as he did earlier in this \ndebate, to come to the floor and say what should have been within the \nscope of this hearing and then start talking about those particular \nissues as if to condemn them, even though they are not in the scope of \nthese particular hearings.\n  Mr. President, I think for a Senator to come to the floor who is a \nmember of the Banking Committee and to make a statement like he knows \nfor a fact, or he has knowledge that Kenneth Starr, the special \ncounsel, is now going to reinvestigate the death of Vince Foster, I \nthink the public has a right to know how that particular Senator from \nNorth Carolina has knowledge of this so-called fact, Mr. President. I \nthink the Senator from North Carolina needs to explain how he knows Mr. \nKenneth Starr is now looking or relooking at the death of Vincent \nFoster.\n  Mr. President, we hope that these hearings will be fair. We hope they \nwill be soon. We hope that they will be done in a very efficient \nmanner. I am just hoping above all, Mr. President, that in this \nhearing, these issues are not going to be bogged down in the political \nmorass that we have seen some other hearings conclude with. I would \nlike to say, also, Mr. President, that I think for us to go back to the \n1990 Governor's campaign, I think is stretching it a bit. I do not know \nwhat that has to do with Whitewater. I think some of my colleagues \nwould like to see us investigate Bill Clinton when he was the attorney \ngeneral of Arkansas. Maybe we would like to go back to look at his \ncampaign of 1974\n when he ran for the U.S. Congress and was defeated. There might be \nsome who have no limits on how far back in time we should go.\n\n  I hope we can keep our eye on the ball. I am hoping, Mr. President, \nthat we can keep our eye focused on the issue of Whitewater and the \nparticular mission under which carefully this resolution has basically \npointed out would be the scope of this particular hearing.\n  I am also concerned that one of our colleagues has referred to the \n``the miserable job of Mr. Fiske.'' Those remarks were made earlier on \nthis floor. Of course, they refer to Mr. Fiske, who was allegedly fired \nfrom this investigation as special counsel because he was not finding \nout enough, bringing forward enough, to satisfy some of our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude once again, as I have done other times \non this floor, by quoting a note that Vince Foster wrote. It is his \nlast note. It was his last sentence in this note, when he said \n``Here''--reference to Washington--``ruining people is considered \nsport.'' Those were the words written by the late Vincent Foster.\n  I am hoping, Mr. President, that when this investigation begins, \nevery person involved with that investigation, from top to bottom, will \nrealize these are human beings; they have families; they have hopes and \ndesires; they have beliefs; and they have reputations. Hopefully, we \nwill not treat lightly those reputations, and hopefully we will make \ncertain that the character and the nature of these hearings seek \nfairness and justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. Let me say, I \ndid not have the opportunity to hear all of his remarks, but let me \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for what I have heard \nhim say. Let me associate myself with each and every one of his words. \nHe speaks from the heart, and he certainly speaks for all Members in \nrepresenting what we hope will be the ultimate goal of this committee \nas we begin this ever once more.\n  This resolution provides a sum of $950,000 for the purpose of \ncompleting the work on the Whitewater matter. I think it needs to be \nemphasized again, as we consider the funding, that this resolution \nincludes every issue related to Whitewater that has any credence \nwhatever. There ought not be any question about its work, its scope, \nand the effort undertaken after today by the Banking Committee.\n  The funding will expire on February 29 of next year. It is an \nadequate amount to fund and an ample allowance of time to permit \ncomprehensive and thorough hearings, while providing also for the \ncompletion of this issue.\n  In the 103d Congress, the Senate voted on March 17, 1994, on a \nbipartisan vote of 8 to 0, to authorize hearings on the Whitewater \nmatter. Senate Resolution 229, adopted in June of last year, authorized \na first round of hearings which were subsequently held by the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The new resolution creates a special committee, administered by the \nBanking Committee, to conduct the final round of these hearings. The \ncommittee will be comprised of the full membership the Banking \nCommittee, with the addition of one Republican and one Democratic \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Chairman D'Amato will also chair this special committee. Senator \nSarbanes will serve as the ranking member.\n  Last year, the Banking Committee heard from a substantial number of \nwitnesses and took thousands of pages of testimony. Last year's \nhearings were thorough, fair, and bipartisan. They are the model which \nthis year's hearings must emulate.\n  The majority, which conducted the hearings last year, were fair and \njudicious in their approach. The new majority in this Senate has the \nobligation to follow that record in exactly the same manner.\n  It is important to be thorough and comprehensive, because the \nAmerican people have a right to know all the facts about this matter; \nbut it is equally important that hearings be fair and responsible. We \nmust all strive to remember and draw the distinction between an \nunproven allegation and a known, verifiable fact.\n  What is at stake is the integrity and credibility of the U.S. Senate. \nThe last Senate recognized this by voting unanimously to authorize \nhearings when questions were raised that deserved examination. This \nSenate should follow that example. [[Page S6782]] \n  The Senate has the constitutional obligation to see that the facts \nare brought out. It has the moral obligation to do so fully and \nimpartially. If we do less, we risk reinforcing the unfortunate \nimpression that Senators care more about partisanship than about \nconducting the Nation's business in the best interests of all the \npeople.\n  The President has said that in an era of attack politics, the best \nway to put this matter behind America is to address the facts candidly. \nHe is entirely right.\n  The administration cooperated fully and extensively with hearings \nlast year and stands ready to do so again this year. Last year, the \nPresident ordered his administration to cooperate and all parties did \nso. Every document request was honored. Every question raised by the \ncommittee was answered.\n  Americans have the right to know the facts of Whitewater. But \nAmericans care about other matters which are also on the Senate agenda \na great deal more than they do about this.\n  Americans are now facing a budget which seeks to dramatically alter \nMedicare and student aid programs, as well as virtually every other \nthing the Government does. They are anxious about the future, because \nso many millions of Americans are either Medicare enrollees or have \nparents who are Medicare enrollees. They are anxious to see the Senate \nbegin the debate over the budget soon.\n  Americans expect the Senate to devote the bulk of our efforts to the \nissues that are of most importance to the majority of American people. \nI agree. That should be our priority. Today, no issue is more critical \nthan resolving the budget debate.\n  Mr. President, I urge prompt action on this resolution. I hope it \nallows for completion of this matter with fairness and impartiality, so \nthat Senators can focus their attention on the issues that deserve it \nmost, the problems facing the American people.\n  I thank the ranking member for yielding.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I did not mean to unduly delay acting on \nthis resolution, because I think most things that have been said \nsummarize where we are at, what we are attempting to do, and the scope \nof the investigation and the manner in which we hope to conduct it.\n  I think is important to point out that what one of my colleagues, the \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, pointed out is a matter \nof public record. That is that Judge Starr is reexamining all matters \nreviewed by Special Counsel Fiske, including Vincent Foster's death.\n  I think he alluded to that, and I think he did so in that context. \nThat is not an area we intend to revisit unless there are some very \nspecial circumstances, which I certainly do not envision. However, I \nthink we have to at least put it in that context.\n  As it relates to what the committee did and did not find last year, I \nthink it is important to note that the Republican minority did make \nfindings on the three major areas where there were questions of \nmisconduct and malfeasance. I will not attempt to enunciate all of them \nnow, but that was a very strong finding.\n  I would also like to point out that the majority made some findings \nand recommendations as it related to the need to indicate very clearly \nthat before Congress, all executive branch members and others who \ntestified are ``required to be fully candid and forthcoming,'' and \ntestify ``truthfully, accurately, and completely.''\n       The committee recommends that the President issue an \n     Executive order reinforcing this obligation and setting forth \n     procedures requiring the prompt correction, amplification \n     and/or supplementation of congressional testimony to ensure \n     that it is accurate, thorough and completely responsive.\n\n  Why did they do that? Without going through the entire history, it \nwas because it was clear and evident--and, by the way, we have sent to \nMr. Fiske and to his successor, Mr. Starr, those areas, we being the \nRepublicans on the committee, the minority--that those areas of \nconcern, that, at the very least, there was testimony that was \ndisingenuous, if not outright false. And that is being reviewed.\n  So, to say that there were no findings of any wrongdoing, that \neverything was OK, or to imply that there was nothing wrong, is simply \nan oversimplification and is not an accurate or fair representation of \nthe situation.\n  Now, I do not intend, nor is it my job and duty, to defend the work \nof the special counsel. The special counsel was appointed because the \nAttorney General concluded that it was necessary. It was not this \nCongress. I thought it was. I believe it was. There were leading \nDemocrats who spoke to the necessity--Senator Moynihan, Senator \nBradley, and others--as it relates to dealing with this. But as it \nrelates to the expenditures of money, let us look at the record.\n  This committee, I think, has been very judicious. The Democratic \nleadership working with Republicans last year authorized $400,000. We \nonly spent $300,000. This year we have set $950,000. I hope we spend \nless than that. We have been very judicious in using taxpayers' money. \nSo to date we have spent $300,000. Although that is not an \ninconsequential sum, we have been extremely judicious.\n  With regard to the expenditures and what has taken place with the \nspecial counsel, let me just indicate, first, that David Hale pleaded \nguilty. He was a municipal judge and has made some extremely serious \nallegations. The special counsel is reviewing his allegations with \nrespect to why he made certain loans that were illegal or \ninappropriate, who asked him to do so, and so forth.\n  Webster Hubbell, the third ranking official in the Attorney General's \noffice, pleaded guilty to charges that emanated, again, from this \ninvestigation.\n  Neil Ainley, president of the Perry County Bank, where large sums of \nmoney, $180,000, were taken out to fund campaign activities, pleaded \nguilty.\n  Chris Wade, a real estate agent who was the sales agent for \nWhitewater Development, pleaded guilty in a bankruptcy matter. Robert \nPalmer, last December, a Little Rock real estate appraiser, pleaded \nguilty to conspiracy charges relating to backdating and falsifying \nappraisals for Madison Guaranty.\n  I make these remarks because I do not believe that it is fair to \nleave the impression that this has just been a big waste of time and \nthat there was no wrongdoing. Five individuals, at this early and \npreliminary stage of these investigations, have already pleaded guilty, \nsome in very high, responsible positions. That is the work of the \nspecial counsel. He has to defend the appropriateness of the \nexpenditures which he makes.\n  However, I think for the record it is fair to reflect that several \nindividuals have pleaded guilty to various charges. As it relates to \nour work, I am going to reiterate that I believe this committee has \nproperly set forth the venue, the scope and the way in which it intends \nto move forward in a bipartisan manner to find out the truth and get \nthe facts. Was there an attempt to impede legitimate investigations \nundertaken at RTC? Why were certain people taken off the case? Why were \ncertain RTC investigators disciplined? Why was information about \nconfidential criminal referrals made public? Was there a failure to go \nforward? These are legitimate questions. There may be appropriate \nreasons. But, then again, we might discover inappropriate action.\n  So these areas are within the scope. We are not going to attempt to \ndig up something that does not appear to be really connection to the \nmatters that we have set forth. And it is our hope, depending upon the \nschedule of the special counsel as he goes through the materials, that \nwe can wind this up sooner rather than later, and conduct the business \nof the people in a manner which reflects credibly on our constitutional \nobligations as Senators.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time. My \ncolleague may have something to do. I am prepared to vote on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will take just a couple of minutes, I \nsay to my distinguished colleague from New York.\n  First of all, I want to underscore the positive and constructive way \nin which the chairman of the Banking Committee and members of his staff \ninteracted with us in trying to address the question of working out a \nresolution that we would bring to the floor of the Senate. Obviously, \nit is not an easy thing to do, and Members of the Senate have \n[[Page S6783]] differing views about this matter. But I do think we \nwere able to, in the end, work out a rational approach to this inquiry \nand investigation, which I indicated in a sense had been committed to \nlast year.\n  Obviously, you always have to work out carefully the scope questions, \nwhich has been done in this resolution, because the scope could be \ninfinite, in a sense, if you leave it to people's imagination. So there \nwere candidates for scope that I think went beyond the horizon, and \nthey are not included. But we have tried to, in effect, put a focus \nhere.\n  In fact, some of the questions the distinguished Senator from New \nYork just raised, that he felt emerged out of the previous hearings--\nand he made reference to last year's minority statement in the report--\nhave in fact been spelled out here as matters that could be looked into \nunder this resolution.\n  There were other candidates, of course, that were not included. We \nhave tried to be rational here. We have tried to be reasonable. The \nmatters specified herein have been the outcome of that process.\n  Second, I want to say the resolution has been put together in a way \nthat presumes that the two sides will work together cooperatively in \ncarrying out the inquiry, that the staffs will interact in that \nfashion, that material will be generally available and so on. We are \ntrying to get an inquiry here in which everyone is joined in trying to \nfind out what the facts are. A lot of questions are raised, and will be \nlooked into. If you did not raise questions, you would not have an \ninquiry, so I recognize that. But our job, I think, is to probe the \nfactual matter behind those issues.\n  I was interested that my colleague earlier used the word \n``allegations,'' and that is what it is until you actually get the \nfacts that sustain it. And that is the process we are going to engage \nin. Some things, you know, when you finally examine them, turn out to \nbe fairly innocent. At least I think. We had this point about Captain \nHume, who did not appear when he was supposed to be a witness.\n  Well, what happened--obviously there was a slip-up, but I think that \nis what it was, a slip-up. Captain Hume was deposed. He had over 300 \npages of deposition testimony. Apparently at his deposition he said he \nwas about to take a--go on a vacation. After that the hearing date was \nset. Everyone sort of assumed that Captain Hume could be brought back \nin for the hearing. A subpoena, I do not think, was issued for him.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I do not think it was issued.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do not think it was issued for him so he did not, as \nit were, ignore a subpoena. And he went on a hunting and fishing trip \nand could not be located, is what happened.\n  In the end, I think it was judged that given we had 300 pages worth \nof deposition it was not worth having another hearing simply to bring \nCaptain Hume in. I mean it is a small matter, but I only mention it to \nshow that sometimes when you really examine the facts you discover that \nsomething that looked amiss at first has a very simple, plausible, and \nreasonable explanation for it.\n  We expect, as I understand it, now to move forward with this. I know \nthat the chairman and his staff will be talking with our staff to begin \nto plan the first set of hearings which I think will probably be in the \nnext month or so, and then we can proceed from there as we schedule \nother matters which have been stipulated here in the resolution as \nbeing within the scope of the inquiry which this special committee will \nnow undertake.\n  But I do again want to underscore the, I think, responsible way in \nwhich the chairman and members of the staff have worked with us in \norder to try to frame a resolution which we could bring to the floor of \nthe Senate today which I think carries forward the legitimate \nrequirements imposed upon us in terms of carrying out an investigation \nwithout straying beyond what most people regard as reasonable bounds.\n  Mr. President, with that, I made my statement. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, and I would like to yield time to \nhim.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland for yielding.\n  Mr. President, when I was a student in law school I remember studying \ncriminal law. There never had been a lawyer in my family. So I knew \nnothing about any kind of law. But I remember the professor about the \nsecond day said, ``Remember, the presumption of innocence is the \nhallmark of our system of criminal jurisprudence.'' It is not \npresumption of guilt.\n  I asked the question, ``Should I defend somebody if they came into my \noffice and told me they were guilty?\"\n  He said that will be a personal call, but you bear one thing in mind. \nThat person may not know whether he or she is guilty under the law. \nThey may think they are and are not.\n  I am going to vote for this resolution. I have no objection whatever \nto a fair, open hearing giving everybody a chance to answer the \nquestions of this committee. But I have heard some names thrown around \nhere this morning.\n  Mr. President, in cases like this, all you have to do is throw out a \nname. Oftentimes you have destroyed a person or at least destroyed \ntheir reputation. And there has been entirely too much of that \nsurrounding this case.\n  So let me admonish my friends in the U.S. Senate, and \nespecially on this special committee, lawyers and \nnonlawyers, to ask yourself when you are making some of these speeches \nand you are throwing out names, why did not this happen, why did not \nthat happen? Well, hindsight is a wonderful thing. But ask yourself \nwhen you are throwing names around and wondering whether or not you are \ndestroying that person, a perfectly innocent person for life, you ask \nyourself this question: ``How would you like to be in that somebody's \nshoes and hear your name bandied around on the floor of the Senate \nwhich carries with it the connotation of some wrongdoing or some \nguilt?''\n  I hope the Members of this body will rise above that sort of thing, \nand when they say something and use some of these names in regard to \nthis hearing, make awfully sure they are not destroying some innocent \nperson needlessly and wrongfully.\n  I look forward to the hearings. I look forward to the people having \nan opportunity to say what they want to say and answer the questions of \nthe Members of this committee. But for God's sakes do not prejudge \neverybody that is going to be called as a witness before they get there \nand have an opportunity to answer the questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding me 2 minutes. I had not planned to speak again. But the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee made reference to three or four \nindividuals who have either pled guilty or have been indicted, et \ncetera. I would like to talk about some of those.\n  Neil Ainley worked with a bank in Perryville about 50 miles from \nLittle Rock. He pled guilty to four counts, but not one of those counts \nrelated to Whitewater; not even close to Whitewater. One was his so-\ncalled failure to file with the Internal Revenue Service a withdrawal \nof cash for the 1990 Clinton campaign; nothing whatsoever to do with \nWhitewater.\n  The second individual the distinguished chairman mentioned is Chris \nWade. If I am not mistaken, Chris Wade was a real estate broker I \nbelieve in Mountain Home near the Whitewater development area. Chris \nWade, subsequent to these many years of dealing with the lots at \nWhitewater, filed bankruptcy; not related to Whitewater in any way. But \nin the bankruptcy filing he failed to disclose either an asset or a \ndebt. I do not know all the facts but this matter is unrelated, totally \nunrelated to Whitewater; no relationship whatsoever to the President \nand Mrs. Clinton. But yet [[Page S6784]] the prosecution has now had \nhim plead guilty.\n  The third person referred to was Webb Hubbell. We know that case. \nWebb Hubbell has pled guilty. It is a sad day. He is a good friend. But \nit was nothing that related to Whitewater \nDevelopment Corp., absolutely nothing that related to \nMadison Guaranty, nothing whatsoever. Web Hubbell pled guilty to \noverbilling his clients; nothing to do with the RTC, nothing to do with \nWhitewater; totally irrelevant.\n  If we continue spreading this dragnet out further, if we go after \nevery person that has ever had contact with Bill Clinton or Hillary \nClinton or James McDougal or whatever, if they have ever made a phone \ncall to them, if they have ever borrowed money or given them a campaign \ncontribution, Lord only knows how long this investigation is going to \ngo. It will go beyond the year 2000.\n  I just hope that our colleagues on the Banking Committee will realize \nthat we must focus this investigation as it relates to Whitewater and \nto its original mission.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, ranking member, and \nthe distinguished chairman for yielding me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

What we would like to \ndo is bring the bill up, and if anybody has amendments, they can offer \nthe amendments and see if we cannot complete action. It is a program \nthat expires on June 30. I am not an expert on the program itself. I \nthink Senators Packwood and Chafee will be happy to manage the bill. I \nwill not do that.\n  I would like to ask unanimous consent that we turn to the \nconsideration of H.R. 483, the Medicare Select bill, but I am not going \nto make that request yet.\n  Is the Senator from West Virginia prepared to object to that?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

In light of the objection, I move to proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 483.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to proceed.\n  Is there debate on the motion?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is not one of the most broadly \nunderstood issues. But it is a very important one, Medicare Select. \nThere are, I guess, two issues that concern me. One--and this is less \nimportant, but nevertheless important to me--is the area of process. I \nhad written Senator Dole, the majority leader, a number of months ago \nasking for a hearing on the subject of Medicare Select. I was told in a \nletter back from the majority leader that we would have hearings on \nMedicare, obviously, and that Medicare Select would be a part of those \nhearings. The Finance Committee has not had any hearings on Medicare \nSelect and, therefore, that constitutes a problem.\n  Second, there is a study on Medicare Select which is going to be \ncompleted by the end of the summer, and it is not a frivolous study or \na frivolous problem. It is a serious problem involving seniors and \nMedicare supplementary insurance. Currently, 15 States are \nparticipating in the 3\\1/2\\-year experimental Medicare Select Program. \nThis bill would expand Medicare Select to all 50 States for 5 years.\n  One of the States that has Medicare Select is, in fact, the State of \nFlorida. I cosponsored legislation sponsored by Senator Graham that \nwould temporarily expand Medicare Select for another year. So this is \nnot just a question of those States that have Medicare Select wanting \nto continue to expand it, or to make it permanent, or whatever. We have \ngenuine concerns.\n  There are other issues involved. One of the conclusions of the \npreliminary evaluation of this study which I have been referring to, \nwhich will be completed at the end of the summer--and that is why I \nhoped we could wait until that time, this being the first year of a 2-\nyear session--was that about half of the savings in the form of cheaper \nMediGap premiums for beneficiaries came about as a result of \ndiscounting payments to hospitals.\n  Now, theoretically, if seniors are having their care actually \nmanaged, the Medicare Program would realize savings from the lower use \nof health care services. [[Page S6785]] \n  If, in fact, the savings are merely the result of hospital \ndiscounting arrangements, the Medicare Program is not going to benefit \nat all financially. Again, that is not an overwhelming factor, but a \nvery important factor in view of the overall Medicare cuts we are \nlooking at this year.\n  CBO, in fact, scored the expansion of the Medicare Select Program as \nbudget neutral, not as saving or costing Medicare, but budget neutral. \nThey said it does not cost and it does not save the Medicare Program \nany dollars at all.\n  Now, my colleagues and friends on the other side talk about expanding \nchoice and restructuring Medicare by getting more seniors into managed \ncare in general. Yet Medicare Select, one of the managed care options \nalready available under the Medicare Program in at least 15 States, \ndoes not save the Medicare Program money.\n  So far, therefore, claims from the other side on the so-called magic \nof the marketplace does not seem to be doing anything to save costs for \nMedicare. That is the point I am trying to make. Many people believe \nthat managed care is not going to save the amount of money that some \npeople think it is because the elements of managed care are not enough. \nThere is the cost of technology and more people getting older faster--\nthat number is increasing very fast.\n  The Consumers Union testified before the House Commerce Health \nSubcommittee that:\n\n       Lawmakers should not make permanent a managed care form of \n     insurance to plug gaps in Medicare coverage because of very \n     serious questions about the supplemental's plan deceptive \n     pricing practices and its effectiveness at holding down \n     health care costs. We should not make this program permanent \n     and expand it to other States until we know that it is really \n     a good deal for the customers.\n\n  That is all I am saying. I am simply requesting that the study which \nwill be ready by the end of the summer, which is already in progress, \nwhich has already issued a beginning report, be allowed to be \ncompleted, that we see if, in fact, it is good for consumers, before we \ntake any further steps.\n  Consumers Union has raised concerns that because of insurance \nunderwriting practices, seniors may be locked into Medicare Select \nmanaged care policies and be unable to purchase another MediGap policy.\n  We looked at MediGap 5 years ago, in 1990. We passed legislation on \nMediGap. It was very good legislation and it cut down on abuses and \nconsumer confusion. Seniors, for the most part, do have Medicare \nsupplemental policies. Sometimes they use it to help pay part of their \npremiums. Sometimes they use it to get more services that Medicare does \nnot offer. But it is very, very important.\n  HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, has voiced a concern \nabout a lack of quality assurance requirements for Medicare Select \nmanaged products.\n  Medicare HMO's are required to have an active quality assurance \ncommittee headed by a physician that gathers and analyzes data and \nworks for continuous quality improvement. That is important. There is \nno comparable requirement for Medicare Select managed care products.\n  Medicare HMO's are required to provide data on such indicators as \nwaiting times for appointments in urgent care, telephone access to HMO, \nboth during and after hours. There is no comparable requirement for \nMedicare Select managed care products.\n  Understand, I am not condemning Medicare Select. Fifteen States are \nusing it. Some of those States want it to be made permanent. Some are \nless happy about it, but this bill is a major expansion. Therefore, it \nis something that we need to look at closely.\n  To go from 15 to 50 without the benefit of at least the study \nCongress ordered so that we could make an orderly decision about this, \njust does not seem to me to make sense. It is for that reason that I am \nhere talking, hoping that we can do something about it.\n  If Medicare Select managed care is to be made permanent as a Medicare \noption, beneficiaries should be guaranteed the same level of assurance \non issues of quality, issues of access, and, for example, grievance \nrights, as they have already in other Medicare managed care options. \nThat seems sensible. Do the 15 have it? Do all of them have it? Do none \nof them have it? We need to know.\n  A preliminary analysis of the Medicare Select experiment that was \ncompleted last year by the Research Triangle Institute concluded that \nfrom Medicare's perspective, unless Medicare Select reduces use or \ndirects use to providers that cost Medicare less money, it offers \nlittle benefit to Medicare.\n  The preliminary case study also indicates:\n\n        Aggressive case management and restriction of networks to \n     the more efficient providers in the communities are rare. \n     Thus, it appears unlikely that Medicare Select will result in \n     claims cost savings for HCFA.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not think that these concerns mean that we \nshould end the Medicare Select Program. I want to be very certain on \nthat. I think that experimentation--State experimentation--is \ntremendously important. I believe in it.\n  However, I do think that several serious issues have been raised \nabout the Medicare Select Program, and as a result I have grave \nreservations about extending this program to all 50 States--that would \nbe 35 more States--in 5 years.\n  Instead, to avoid any potential disruption in those States that \ncurrently are participating in the Medicare Select experiment, we ought \nto extend their programs so that they do not have to stop enrolling new \npeople on June 30, 1995.\n  Now, that is an important point to make. We have a drop dead date we \nare facing rather quickly. They cannot take new enrollees unless we \nextend the current States that have the programs, which I am very much \nfor doing, so that we can learn more from those programs.\n  I would sincerely hope that before expanding it beyond those States \nthat now have it, we take a much closer look at the Medicare Select \nProgram in the committee of jurisdiction, which is the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Then I go back again to the process question. I asked the majority \nleader by letter if he would hold hearings on this subject. He answered \nme earlier, some months ago, that we would hold general Medicare \nhearings in the Finance Committee, and Medicare Select would be part of \nthose hearings.\n  They have not been part of those hearings. They have not been even \nmentioned in these hearings. That is important to me because I think \nthat process and the knowledge that one gains from that is tremendously \nimportant.\n  I find it somewhat disturbing that my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle who want to cut Medicare by $256 billion to balance the \nbudget and pay for tax cuts, and who talk on a daily basis about \nrestructuring Medicare, will not even take the time to consider a final \nevaluation of the Medicare Select Program. Congress mandated that this \nstudy be done. This was not somebody's whim. It was a congressionally \nmandated study. The Federal Government has already paid for this study \nto be done. But my colleagues are apparently not willing to wait a \ncouple of months to consider the results of that congressionally \nmandated study.\n  In some ways it seems to me that we are here more because the Senate \nis looking for something to do. I do not think this is the right way to \nhandle the problem of the Medicare Select Program. This came up \nsuddenly and here we are with it.\n  I want to make it very clear why I have objected to the idea of the \nSenate simply rubberstamping a bill passed by the other body. There is \nabsolutely no reason for us to be using up the time of the Senate on \nthis at this time. If the majority leader would simply give the \ncommittee of jurisdiction the chance to review the legislation and the \nstudy through something as basic as a hearing or a partial hearing or a \nsubcommittee hearing, then we could work out a course of action based \non a responsible process and careful thought about the substance which \nI have raised, which is very much in question. The Senate should, I \nthink, not acquiesce to a cavalier way of doing business, and that is \nwhat concerns me.\n  The majority leader wants the Senate to rubberstamp a bill that would \nturn a limited demonstration program, called Medicare Select, into an \nopen-ended national program. I am very concerned about an attempt to \npass legislation affecting the Medicare Program [[Page S6786]] without \nhaving it carefully considered by anyone in the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues, who are not present on the floor with the \nexception of the distinguished Presiding Officer, how many of them can \nreally tell me much about the Medicare Select Program? How many could \ngive me one short paragraph on what the Medicare Select Program is? I \nwould daresay it is probably six people; probably six people. And here \nwe are at a moment when there is not much else to do, awaiting the \nbudget resolution, but with some time to kill, and we are about to \nexpand into a national program something which is being experimented \nwith locally, by the States.\n  If anything is clear these days, the Senate should know what it is \ndoing when it changes Medicare. We are about to enter into a major \ndebate on Medicare as it concerns the budget resolution. So anything \nthat has the word Medicare in it, we ought to be precise, \nknowledgeable, and informed rather than having an hour's discussion and \nthen a vote of some sort, affecting profoundly what happens in this \ncountry. Medicare affects 33 million people--36 million to 37 million \npeople when you add on end-stage renal disease and the disabled, as \nwell as those over 65. It has enormous consequences. It has enormous \nconsequences.\n  As we learned during the MediGap debates, it is very hard, often, for \nseniors to resist buying policies which are constantly offered to them. \nThat was what the MediGap legislation was about. It was to discipline \nthis proliferation of policies to ensure folks could not prey on \nseniors who could not necessarily understand all the small print, or \neven read the small print in the policy. So this is about protecting \nseniors; about not misleading seniors; about making sure that seniors \nget the quality assurances that are verbally offered to them by those \nwho would sell Medicare Select.\n  It just seems to me that if we are about to talk about a $256 billion \ncut in Medicare, we really ought to know what we are talking about when \nwe do anything about Medicare, much less add on a new program, whether \nit costs or not.\n  Just yesterday Dr. June O'Neal, who is the new head of CBO, the \nCongression Budget Office, and whom I had not seen before, testified \nbefore the Finance Committee that quality--hear this, ``The quality \nwill suffer under the Medicare Program if we enact Medicare cuts of \n$256 billion.''\n  She said that seniors will have to pay more to get the same level of \nquality that they are currently receiving under Medicare. And I think \nthis is a very serious consequence. In fact, by the year 2002, I think \nthey will be paying $900 more per year and I think on an aggregate \nbasis they will be paying close to $3,500 more between now and the year \n2002. When you consider the fact that only a very tiny proportion of \nMedicare recipients have incomes of higher than $50,000 a year and that \nthe enormous majority of them are way down at $15,000 or $10,000 or \nbelow, in that area, something like that becomes an enormous \nconsideration. An additional $3,500? They already spend over 20 percent \nof their income on health care.\n  In fact, we had an interesting minidebate yesterday on whether or not \nthe cuts in Medicare will in fact cut Social Security for seniors. Of \ncourse, if that were to be the case, that would be a kind of third-rail \nitem on the American scene because cutting into Social Security is \nsomething we have all decided not to do. We came up with the judgment, \nnot so much during the hearing but after the hearing, that because of \nthe increases in premiums, et cetera, in copayments, seniors will have \nto pay for more costs for Medicare, that in effect their COLA increases \nunder Social Security in many cases will be wiped out entirely.\n  Will seniors see that as a cut in Social Security? I think it is \nquite possible they will. Because it is interesting--I would not have \nguessed this, I say to the Presiding Officer--that Social Security and \nMedicare are looked upon, in many ways, as the same by the people of \nthis country and by the seniors of this country. That whereas we said \nbefore ``Do not cut Social Security,'' people look upon Medicare as the \nsame sort of a sacred contract, so to speak, that the American \nGovernment and the American people have with each other, and not \nanother incidental program.\n  So I think this is a very serious problem. The Health Care Finance \nAdministration, HCFA, has voiced a concern about lack of Medicare \nSelect quality assurance requirements. HCFA is not a radical \norganization. It is a big organization, 4,000 people, who in fact are \nvery expert. Nobody knows they exist but they do, and they do all kinds \nof complicated work. They are expressing concern about Medicare Select \nquality assurance requirements, that they do not exist in this \nlegislation and they do exist for other managed care options. As I \nsaid, Medicare HMO's are required by law to have active quality \nassurance committees.\n  So I think there is lot at question here, and I just hope we could \nwork this out. I had suggested a variety of alternatives, options; that \nwe could take the States that now have Medicare and extend those for a \nyear and a half or 2 years. Some people say if you extend it for a \nyear, that does not really give the managed care company that is \ninterested in looking at Medicare much incentive to move ahead. It \nsounds like a year-by-year basis. Maybe we could do it for longer than \nthat. Maybe we could add on some more States, add on four or five more \nStates and allow that to happen.\n  But to take the entire country and open it up to Medicare Select when \na study which has already raised questions is still out there and \nquestions have been raised by health care experts in HCFA about \ninsurance problems, plus the fact that it is Medicare, which is \nprobably the most sensitive subject that could be discussed on the \nfloor of this Chamber, we ought to be careful. That is why I am not for \ngoing ahead at the present time with expanding this the way the \nmajority leader seems to want to do.\n  I will have more comments. But I do not see anybody at this point who \nwishes to say anything. So I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note the presence of the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island on the floor. I know he wants \nto speak. I will not take long. I talked a moment ago about the \nconcerns of the consumer groups and the Medicare Select Program. One of \ntheir concerns is called attained age rating. Just as insurance \ncompanies charge older people more for insurance in the under 65 \nmarket, MediGap insurers charge older seniors more for their MediGap \npolicies as they grow older. In the under 65 market, insurers claim \nthat age rating is a sound business practice because older people use \nmore health care services and because older people are better off \nfinancially than those who are 20 years old or younger. This argument \ndoes not work at all for those who are over 65 years old. In that \nimportant market, 85-year-olds are generally, as I hope we all know, a \nlot poorer than 65-year-olds.\n  Another question that has been raised is the so-called one time open \nenrollment period. When we worked in the Finance Committee--I know the \nSenator from Rhode Island worked very hard on that also--on the MediGap \nlegislation in 1990, we required insurers to have a one-time, 6-month \nopen enrollment period when seniors first turned 65 so that they would \nhave 6 months to simply enroll. During this 6-month period, an insurer \nunder the MediGap Program is not allowed to deny insurance to any \nsenior based upon their health status. That is an enormous statement in \nthe health insurance industry. It is an enormous statement. They are \nnot allowed during those first 6 months to make any health status \njudgments and thus say no to people. Consumer groups have raised a \nconcern that if seniors sign up with a Medicare Select managed care \nproduct and decide that they do not like that product, they may be \nunable to buy a MediGap policy later because the open enrollment period \nwould have gone by, especially, of course, if their health status is \npoor.\n  I want to just add those things.\n  I yield the floor.\n  [[Page S6787]]\n  \n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Let me discuss it with the Senator from Oregon.\n  But meanwhile, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor \nbe granted to a member of my staff, Douglas Guerdat during today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the submission of S.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, let me make a few comments on the so-\ncalled Medicare Select policies and explain first what they are.\n  Medicare does not cover all medical expenses. So a popular policy \nthat is sold in this country is called MediGap. You can buy it. It is \nvoluntary. You do not have to buy it. You can buy it. It basically \nfills in the holes that Medicare does not cover. There are different \nkinds of MediGap policies. You can get some that are more expansive and \nwith more coverage than others and they cost a bit more. But I \nemphasize they are voluntary.\n  Medicare Select is a particular form of MediGap policy. It is one of \nthe most popular policies that are around. It is about 40 percent less \nexpensive than other policies. It exists now in 15 States. You have to \nhave Federal permission to sell it. The authority to issue these \npolicies expires on June 30 of this year.\n  The House has passed a bill--let me check my figures--I think 408 to \n14, to extend Medicare Select to the rest of the Nation. This is hardly \na partisan issue with that kind of a vote. And if we, frankly, get a \nvote on it in the Senate, it is going to pass probably 80-20 or 90-10, \nunless I am mistaken. So do not let anybody be of the impression this a \nRepublican-Democrat issue. This has overwhelming support.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is one group that \nsupports it, and they monitor complaints about insurance policies \nthroughout the Nation. There are about 500,000 people enrolled in just \nthese 15 States in Medicare Select, and of those 500,000 policies, in \n1994, all of the insurance commissioners in those 15 States had 9 \ncomplaints--9--in comparison with 967 complaints against other types of \nMediGap policies, nonselect MediGap policies.\n  We passed this in the Senate 5 years ago. We were awaiting a report. \nThe report was due in January. It is not going to be out until next \nJanuary now. It is late. It is not going to come.\n  And again, Medicare Select has overwhelming support. I am going to \nread just a list of the groups that support expanding this to the 50 \nStates: The American Group Practice Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Managed Care and Review Association, the \nAssociation of Public Pension and Welfare Plans, Blue Cross and Blue \nShield Association, California Association of Hospitals and Health \nSystems, the Federation of American Health Systems, the Group Health \nAssociation of America, the Health Insurance Association of America, \nthe Medical Group Management Association, the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners, the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nand the National Governors' Association.\n  Now, Mr. President, you are not going to get a much better group than \nthat in terms of breadth and philosophical support. Our problem is that \nthis apparently is going to face an objection to coming up and \napparently a filibuster. I have no question but what the filibuster is \ngoing to be broken and going to be broken overwhelmingly. We will get \nthe 60 votes. But one of the problems the leader faces, of course, is \nthat once we are on to a bill and once cloture has been invoked, you \ncannot go to anything else. You can pull it down. And he would like to \nget onto the budget bill.\n  I say again, this is the middle of May. The authority for these \nprograms runs out next month. This Congress goes on recess in about 10 \ndays. And so unless we act now, these people who like these policies, \nto which there is almost no complaint, will be faced with rising \npremiums because they cannot be sold to anyone else.\n  So I hope that the leader will be successful in bringing this bill \nup, that we would have a short debate. I will be happy to agree to a \ntime limit on amendments or a time limit on the bill and get to final \npassage. I will emphasize again it passed 408 to 14 in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia in the Chamber. I would be glad to pose him some questions if \nhe is available to respond.\n  As the chairman of our committee just pointed out, we are talking \nabout Medicare Select. But what is Medicare Select, anyway?\n  Medicare Select is the name of a type of MediGap policy. It is \nsomething that seniors can buy to cover their Medicare deductibles and \ncopayments.\n  Medicare Select is a type of MediGap policy that permits managed \ncare; that is, a managed care MediGap policy. That is what it is.\n  What was the problem in getting this plan started and why the \nrestrictions? Why could not the insurance companies offer Medicare \nSelect if they wanted to? Because when MediGap legislation was \noriginally passed in the House of Representatives, there were some \nobjections to Medicare Select. A Representative from California did not \nbelieve in managed care. Consequently seniors were not able to have \nthese plans.\n  Well, finally, after patiently working at this several years ago in \nlate evening sessions, we arranged that there would be 15 States that \ncould try this and see how it worked out. And so 15 States have done \nit, and as the chairman of our committee pointed out, it has worked \nvery well. The trouble is that the option of these 15 States to offer \nthis policy ends June 30; which is what--a month and a half from now.\n  As the chairman pointed out, there is now a danger that we cannot \nextend Medicare Select because of having to deal with the budget, and \nso forth, and then all these people who have these MediGap policies--\nand, indeed, it is a MediGap policy--will not be able to buy it or \nrenew it.\n  Indeed, there is question about enrollments right now: Should a \nsenior enroll in a MediGap policy that has this managed care plan or \nshould I not? What happens if the plan is going to disappear?\n  Our point is not only should we extend Medicare Select but should we \nalso make it permanent.\n  But what about the rest of the States? Why should not seniors in \nother States have this option? In my State, for example, why should not \nmy citizens have the option of buying a MediGap policy that is $25 to \n$27 less per month, depending on the situation, than they are paying \nfor other MediGap policies?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me just finish. The Senator is objecting to that. \nWhat I find puzzling is the Senator, a distinguished member of the \nFinance Committee, has twice voted in the Senate Finance Committee and \ntwice on the floor to pass a permanent 50-State extension of \nlegislation that is before us. What has changed?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. What has changed, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, is that I had correspondence with the majority \nleader of the Senate, a letter that I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, and also the majority leader's response to this \nSenator.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   [[Page S6788]] U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC. March 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As ranking member of the Finance \n     Subcommittee on Medicare, Long-Term Care, and Health \n     Insurance that you chair, I would like to propose a hearing \n     on the Medicare SELECT program for oversight and an education \n     on its results so far.\n       As you know, Congress approved a 3-year, 15-state Medicare \n     SELECT demonstration project as part of the Omnibus \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990. Medicare SELECT offers seniors \n     less expensive Medigap premiums in exchange for receiving \n     their health care services from a selected network of health \n     care providers. Under current law, Medicare SELECT's \n     authorization--which was extended temporarily last October--\n     is due to expire on June 30, 1995, unless Congress takes \n     further action.\n       Personally, I would support extending this program for \n     another six months to maintain program continuity, with a \n     strong interest in avoiding the program's disruption while \n     allowing Finance Committee members an opportunity to fully \n     examine the knowledge available so far on the SELECT \n     demonstration. A temporary extension would give the \n     Subcommittee an opportunity to have a full hearing on the \n     Medicare SELECT program that would include results of a \n     formal evaluation of the demonstration project.\n       It is my understanding that preliminary results of an \n     evaluation study that is being performed by Research Triangle \n     Institute will be ready by the end of the summer. Information \n     that will be available includes data gathered from insurer \n     and beneficiary surveys, as well as claims analyses that will \n     examine the impact of SELECT enrollment on the use and costs \n     of Medicare services. Therefore, I believe it would not be \n     appropriate or prudent to extend this program on a permanent \n     basis to all 50 states until Finance Committee members have \n     the most up-to-date information on which to base future \n     legislative action.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter, and \n     I hope to work with you on this issue. Mary Ella Payne is the \n     contact on my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Rockefeller IV.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC. April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jay: Thank you for your letter regarding the Medicare \n     Select Program. I agree with you that this issue deserves \n     careful consideration, particularly if Congress intends to \n     extend the program permanently.\n       I know that the Chairman plans to hold extensive hearings \n     at the full committee level on the Medicare program--it's \n     costs, it's benefits, and what changes need to be made to \n     improve it. I have been assured by the Chairman that through \n     this process we will take a close look at Medicare Select, as \n     we will all parts of the Medicare program.\n       The Committee will obviously have its work cut out for it \n     this year. I look forward to working with you as we debate \n     some very important and complex issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I wrote the majority leader on March 21, and I said \nthis problem is going to be coming up. We know there is a deadline. I \nam fully aware of that. He wrote back on April 3, and he told me, ``I \nagree with you that this issue deserves careful consideration, \nparticularly if Congress intends to extend the program permanently. I \nknow that the chairman,'' that being Senator Packwood, ``plans to hold \nextensive hearings at the full committee level on the Medicare \nProgram.'' And, ``We will take a close look at Medicare Select, as we \nwill all parts of the Medicare Program.''\n  What I would say to my friend from Rhode Island is that we have not \ndone that. In the meantime, Congress mandated a study to be done, and \nthe study is in the process of being done. The study has also already \nraised several questions. Other groups raised other questions about \nquality, about being able to buy other medigap policies. So there are a \nnumber of questions that needed to be answered. I wished to do all of \nthis somewhat earlier, and I was given the promise that we would do \nthis somewhat earlier. It is just that the promise was not fulfilled.\n  I should say also that a number of questions have been raised which \nhave somewhat changed the atmosphere in the last several months. Before \nthe Senator came to the floor, I talked about questions which had been \nraised by a number of groups--pricing games, medigap availability, \nillusory costs, and things of that sort. The Senator from West Virginia \nwants to be sure.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, the Senator from West Virginia may wish to be \nassured, but I do not know how far we have to go. The National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners supports the extension of this \nprogram. We just had the list of those who were supporting Medicare \nSelect read by the chairman of our committee. You can go on and on and \nfind reasons not to do something.\n  But we are really in a very, very difficult situation here. This \nprogram expires in 30 days from now or 45 days from now. It seems to me \nwe ought to get on and extend it, and not only extend it but let the \nother States in on it.\n  Some mention was made about the Consumers Union's concerns about \nMedicare Select. But the fact of the matter is the Consumers Union's \nproblems that were raised apply to all medigap policies, not focused in \non Medicare Select.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, obviously, we need to work this out. \nThe time problem is not, in fact, a constraint on those States which \ncurrently have Medicare Select because I already said I would be \nperfectly happy to go ahead and extend them.\n  The question is: How can we, looking at some of these complaints \nabout not being able to change MediGap policies, discrimination of \nvarious sorts, how can we arrive at some kind of compromise which gives \nconsumer protection for these Medicare beneficiaries that would choose \nMedicare Select? How can we give them some kind of consumer protection \nover and above what is contemplated in the law that the Senator from \nRhode Island wants to get passed right away?\n  Would the Senator be willing to discuss those matters, if not \npublicly, privately?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator says we have to wrestle with \nthese problems. Who says there is a problem?\n  Let me just touch on one matter that the Senator raised, and that is \nthe so-called attained-age rating, with a suggestion that Medicare \nSelect, this type of managed care policy, MediGap policy, has this \nattained-age rating.\n  Well, the fact is that the attained-age rating is permitted under \ncurrent MediGap law. It is not restricted. The attained age is not \nsomething peculiar to Medicare Select. That is permitted under the \ncurrent MediGap law.\n  And so while it is true that most medigap policies and most Medicare \nSelect policies do not use the attained-age method, I do not see why \nyou focus in and say that is something peculiar to MediGap or Medicare \nSelect, because it is not.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia did not say it was \npeculiar, but I said it was a problem as far as the Medicare extension \nis concerned. Whether it applies to more medigap policies is not, at \nthe moment, of concern to me. I want to make sure that, in Medicare \nSelect, we can.\n  HCFA has concerns about quality and concerns about access. They are \nnot a frivolous organization.\n  I just think we have a chance to try to find an accommodation, \nhopefully in a quorum call, in which we could address some of the \nconsumer concerns and perhaps also accommodate the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the majority leader, and the Senator from Oregon in the \nprocess, since I am, obviously, very well aware of where the votes are \nin the situation. I just want to do the best I can to build in consumer \nprotection for a program which is young, which is actually only in 14 \nStates, and is not at all in all 50 States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do not concede that there are all these \nproblems or that there are these problems. It seems to me what the \nSenator from West Virginia is doing is applying a higher standard to \nthe Medicare Select, these managed care MediGap policies, than he is to \nthe regular MediGap policies. I do not think that is fair. I do not \nthink it is fair to say, ``No, in Medicare Select, you cannot have \nattained age,'' whereas it is permitted in the other MediGap policies.\n  The suggestion here is that we ought to have hearings on this. Well, \nI cannot speak for what the majority leader said, but all I do know is \nthat the Senate has passed a permanent extension of this proposal twice \nin the past 4 years. It was included in every major health reform \nproposal last year, including Senator Mitchell's, Senator \n[[Page S6789]] Dole's and Senator Packwood's bill, and in the \nmainstream coalition bill. All of them had Medicare Select in them. So \nit is not that we are coming up against some unknown item here that we \nbetter be terribly cautious of. As I say, it has been out in these \nStates. In 15 States, it is authorized. I cannot challenge the \nSenator's information when he says it is actually in practice, I \nbelieve he said, in 14 States.\n  All I know is that I think it is a good option that is less expensive \nand that we ought to give all the citizens a chance at it. And the \ncitizens from my State would like a chance at this. If they do not want \nto use it, that is their business. But if they have a right to choose a \nMediGap policy that is less expensive than the current ones, I think \nthey ought to have it and not be prevented from doing so because this \nCongress refuses to extend Medicare Select to all the States.\n  Again, no one is more thoughtful and compassionate in this Senate \nthan the Senator from West Virginia, so I am not sure why he takes this \nparticular position. Because, as we mentioned before, this passed in \nthe House 408 to 14. You could hardly get a motherhood resolution \npassed by that amount.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will yield, I think one could \npractically rewrite the Constitution in the House of Representatives by \nthat vote in the current climate.\n  If the Senator would further yield, he talked about standards being \nhigher for Medicare Select than for other medigap things. I think high \nstandards are important and I know the Senator from Rhode Island does, \ntoo. I want to see the Senator from Rhode Island and his State be able \nto have this program if that is what the State and the Senator wants.\n  I think the time crisis that the Senator refers to can be handled in \n60 seconds. That can be changed in 60 seconds.\n  My point is that for 2 months I have suggested extending the program \nto the 14 States with the program already in effect. What I am really \nsuggesting now is that we first look at the evaluation of the program \nbefore we open the door to all the other States. What I am really \nsuggesting is that, if we could perhaps suggest the absence of a \nquorum, we could work something out on this.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, our staff asked the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA] for suggested changes. Any problems? What do you \nthink we ought to do? They did not have any. They had no suggestions \nfor us.\n  Maybe the Senator from West Virginia can find, what we cannot find, \nany documented quality problem with this program. Now, some beneficiary \nsomewhere may object, I am sure they have, just like they have objected \nto a host of other medigap policies.\n  But, as I say, this has received a favorable report by the Consumers \nUnion and by Consumers Report magazine and by the State insurance \ncommissioners.\n  So, I do not have anything particular to offer. I would be glad to \ntalk with the Senator from West Virginia. Whatever ideas we have, we \nwould have to transmit them. Obviously, I would have to speak to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, whom I do not see on the floor here.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from Rhode Island made mention of no \nparticular problems being raised by HCFA. I think that raises, \ntherefore, this very important point. Because, in fact, Donna Shalala \nhas written to the Honorable Bill Archer, chairman of the Committee on \nWays and Means, on March 7 of this year.\n  And one paragraph says:\n\n       The case study portion of the Medicare Select evaluation \n     has already raised a number of questions about the Medicare \n     Select demonstration.\n\n  That is from HCFA.\n\n       As managed care options under Medicare are expanded, we \n     want to ensure that our beneficiaries are guaranteed choice \n     and appropriate consumer protections.\n\n  That is precisely what the Senator from West Virginia was asking for.\n  Donna Shalala goes on:\n\n       In addition, many of the select plans consist solely of \n     discounting arrangements to hospitals.\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia mentioned that at the beginning.\n  Donna Shalala goes on:\n\n       We would be concerned if the discounting arrangements under \n     Medicare Select were to be expanded to Medicare supplementary \n     insurance part B services. Discounting arrangements, \n     particularly for part B services, may spur providers to \n     compensate for lost revenues through increased service \n     volume. Consequently, we are concerned that such an expansion \n     would lead to increased utilization of part B services rather \n     than contribute to the efficiency of the part B program \n     through managed care.\n\n  Then she says:\n\n       We would, therefore, oppose such a change.\n\n  There is honest and open debate on this matter. I am still willing to \ntalk with the Senator from Rhode Island. I think we can work something \nout. Again, I, unfortunately, can count the votes, but the Senator \nwould like to have some consumer protection in this, and I think the \nSecretary of HHS would, too. I think, frankly, George Mitchell, in his \nbill, had open enrollment and major insurance reforms, and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island knows that well.\n  The Mitchell bill, in fact, did not propose to make Medicare Select \npermanent in the absence of coordinated open enrollment.\n  So I think there is room to work something out here, Mr. President, \nbecause I think everybody is talking with good will on both sides on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the problem here is--I know the Senator is \nconcerned about this--but the points he raises affect not Medicare \nSelect but affect the whole MediGap range. In other words, when he says \nhe is interested in open enrollment, there is no open enrollment now in \nthe MediGap policies. He is saying he wants it for Medicare Select. But \nthat means you want it presumably for all of MediGap.\n  Now, that is a very big separate issue that can come up any time. You \ndo not have to tag it on to a Medicare Select policy which, as I say, \nis just one of a whole series of medigap policies.\n  If the Senator wants to do that, that is changing the rules for the \nwhole series of policies that are issued under medigap.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will make one other point, if I might, and that is, as \nyou recall, when I said my staff spoke to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, what I said was they asked for suggested changes and \nnone came back. In the letter the Senator quoted from Secretary \nShalala, he mentioned somewhere in there concerns about expansion into \nthe part B plan. We do not do that. There is no expansion into that in \nthis Medicare Select.\n  So I will be glad to talk with the Senator. If he would like, we can \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and have a little chat here.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia would like to do \nthat, but if I might add one more thing, that is, the Senator is right \nabout part B, and the Senator from West Virginia just got carried away \nand read too much of a paragraph, which was a mistake on the part of \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Donna Shalala, on the other hand, is referring to the Medicare Select \nevaluation. She is referring to the Medicare Select evaluation in this \nletter which she wrote back on March 7, which should have been \navailable to all of us.\n  Bruce Vladeck, in his testimony on February 15 in front of the House \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce, raised a major concern with the \nadequacy of beneficiary protections under Medicare Select.\n  If that is not HCFA speaking, I do not know what is. Bruce Vladeck \nsaid:\n\n       There is no requirement for States to review the actual \n     operations of the Select plans once they are approved to \n     assure that quality and access standards are being met.\n\n  He does not like that. He is worried about that, and he says:\n\n       We feel strongly that beneficiaries should not have to \n     worry about the quality and access provisions on their \n     Medicare choices. We look forward to working with the \n     subcommittee * * *\n\n  And then Bruce Vladeck, the head of HCFA, said:\n\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\n       Our second concern is whether Medicare Select will make any \n     contribution to increasing the efficiency of the Medicare \n     program.\n\n  I think that goes off into another area. It is the consumer \nprotection area, I say to my friend from Rhode Island, which concerns \nme the most.\n  I might suggest the absence of a quorum in order for some \nconversation to go on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Medicare Select is a demonstration \nprogram. Evaluation will not be completed until December 1995. While \nthe demonstration program technically expires on June 30, the \nregulations governing the program clearly state that insurers must \ncontinue their coverage of current enrollees, even if no extension is \napproved.\n  There is no overwhelming urgency to pass this legislation. I do favor \na temporary extension, and I am prepared to support such an extension \ntoday. But I have a number of concerns about permanent extension of the \nMedicare Select Program.\n  First, extension of Medicare Select should be considered in the \ncontext of a whole range of managed care options we might wish to make \navailable to Medicare beneficiaries. There is a great deal of interest \non both sides of the aisle in expanding choice. The administration is \nworking on development of a PPO option. Before we make the Medicare \nSelect Program permanent, we should understand its impact and balance \nit against other options.\n  Second, Medicare Select raises significant concerns about beneficiary \nprotections. HHS has stated concerns about quality oversight. Most \nimportant, Medicare Select requires enrollees to receive their care \nfrom a limited set of providers. This may be perfectly acceptable to \nyounger, healthier, enrollees. As beneficiaries age and become sicker, \nhowever, they may find themselves dissatisfied with providers in the \nselect network. They can find themselves permanently locked out of \nregular MediGap coverage, with no ability to buy a policy to protect \nthemselves from the costs that Medicare does not cover.\n  This seems to me to be an excessive denial of choice that we should \nnot enshrine in permanent legislation without more consideration.\n  These concerns have been raised by Consumers Union and other consumer \nadvocates. Consumers Union, Families USA, and the National Council of \nSenior Citizens all are on record as opposing this legislation. These \nconcerns are serious and they deserve to be addressed.\n  We must always be especially concerned about the frailest and the \nmost vulnerable elderly. We want to provide options that improve the \nchoices available, not limit them. We want to provide benefits and \nservices that seniors need, not deprive them of necessary care. We \nshould move with great care in considering a measure that might have \nthat affect.\n  It is not my intention to terminate the Medicare Select demonstration \nor put it out of business. I would be willing to support the short-term \nextension of the program or a permanent program if these concerns are \nconsidered and addressed.\n  It is ironic that this particular Medicare issue should surface just \na day before we are to consider a budget resolution which would strike \na mighty blow at the integrity of the Medicare Program as a whole and \nat the retirement security of senior citizens it was designed to \nsecure.\n  This budget plan proposes to break America's compact with the \nelderly, and all to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax cut for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  The cuts in Medicare are unprecedented: $256 billion over the next 7 \nyears. By the time the plan is fully phased in, the average senior is \nlikely to pay $900 more a year in Medicare premium and out-of-pocket \ncosts.\n  An elderly couple would have to pay $1,800 and, over the life of the \nbudget, would face $6,400 in additional costs. Part B premiums, which \nare deducted right out of the Social Security check, will rise to \nalmost $100 a month at a cost of an additional $1,700 over the life of \nthe budget plan.\n  The typical senior needing home health services will have to pay an \nadditional $1,200 per year. Someone sick enough to use the full home \ncare benefit will have to pay $3,200. The fundamental unfairness of \nthis proposal leaps out from a few simple facts.\n  Because of gaps in Medicare, senior citizens already pay too much for \nthe health care they need. The average senior pays an astounding one-\nfifth of their total pretax income to purchase health care, more than \nthey paid before Medicare was even enacted. Lower income older seniors \npay even more.\n  Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. Its coverage of home \nhealth care and nursing home care is limited. Unlike virtually all \nprivate insurance policies, it does not have a cap on out-of-pocket \ncosts. It does not cover eye care or foot care or dental care.\n  Yet this budget plan heaps additional medical costs on every senior \ncitizen, while the Republican tax bill that has already passed the \nHouse, gives a tax cut of $20,000 to people making more than $350,000 a \nyear.\n  I ask any of our colleagues to travel to any senior citizens' home in \ntheir State and have a visit with retirees. Ask the retirees by a show \nof hands how many pay $50 a month or more for prescription drugs. \nAnywhere from 25 percent to 50 percent of the hands will go up in the \nair. Ask them how many pay $25 a month or more for prescription drugs, \nand the spontaneous groan in the audience will be enormous. It is an \nexpression that they are astounded that we do not understand that they \nare paying at least $25 a month or more and now 80 percent to 90 \npercent of the hands go into the air.\n  What has been the cost of the prescription drugs over recent years? \nThey have been rising at more than double, sometimes even triple, the \nConsumer Price Index.\n  Look also at the profits of the major pharmaceutical companies. It is \nan interesting fact that they are some of the most profitable companies \nin America, while at the same time the cost of prescription drugs, \nwhich are absolutely essential in order to relieve suffering or to even \nlive life in many instances, is going right up through the roof.\n  Now, that is a real issue for the seniors. That is an issue that we \nought to be debating out here this afternoon. That is an issue of prime \nconcern to every senior citizen.\n  I daresay, if any Member of the Senate went to a group of senior \ncitizens and asked them this afternoon, ``What do they want the U.S. \nSenate to be focusing on? The issue of prescription drugs or Medicare \nSelect?'' Ninety-nine percent would say, ``Look after the problems that \nwe are facing with prescription drugs.'' ``Look after the problems we \nare facing in terms of dental care and eye care.'' Look around the room \nand count the number of senior citizens who are wearing glasses. Look \naround the room at the numbers who need help and assistance with dental \ncare. Look around the room at the number of seniors who need the care \nof a podiatrist.\n  Our seniors think the U.S. Senate ought to be focusing on Medicare \nhere this afternoon. But we should not focus solely on Medicare Select, \nuntil we have a full and complete evaluation of that program, which has \nthe potential of some very important adverse effects, as well as some \npotentially beneficial effects.\n  We ought to insist that we have all of the facts before we move \nforward on a program that will unquestionably mean enormous profits to \nsome companies and industries. It will perhaps give at least the \nappearance of security to some of our senior citizens for a period of \ntime, but that security will be illusory unless it is carefully crafted \nand there are built-in kinds of protections which are not evidenced in \nthe proposal that we are reviewing or considering this afternoon.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, to compare the generous benefits \nthat the authors of the Senate resolution enjoy under our Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Program plan available to every Member of \nCongress to the less adequate benefits provided for Medicare.\n  We are going to find out that while the measure we will be debating \nhere in [[Page S6791]] the U.S. Senate cuts back on protections for our \nsenior citizens, we sure are not cutting back on the protections for \nany of the Members in the U.S. Senate. That is an interesting irony.\n  We heard so much in the early part of the year about how we will make \nsure that every law that we pass in the Congress is going to be \napplicable to the Members of Congress. Remember those speeches? We \nheard them from morning until eveningtime here in the Senate.\n And it is right that we do that. But how interesting that we do not \nsay we are going to provide for the American people all the benefits \nthat we have here in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  If we wanted to, we could give to the American people the kind of \nhealth benefits that we have, by extending the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program. Many of us have supported this in the past; many of us \nfought last year to try to make this available. FEHBP affects 10 \nmillion Americans. We have 40 million Americans who do not have health \ncare coverage, and 16 million of those who are children. We could do \nvery well if we just provided the extension of the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program to all Americans. But, again, we are not \ndebating that issue here. We are not involved in that debate here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  We are talking about the Medicare Select issue, a very narrow, very \ndefined issue. We will be debating, tomorrow, and perhaps the day after \ntomorrow, and for a series of tomorrows, the proposed cuts that are \ncoming in Medicare, in the budget proposal, that will not be utilized \nfor health care reform as we tried to do last year. We tried to provide \nsome prescription drug benefit. We tried to provide some home care. We \ntried to provide some community-based care. We tried to provide some \nadditional protections for our elderly.\n  But no, this year we are going to go ahead and cut the Medicare \nProgram to set aside a little kitty of $170 billion that can be used \nsomeday in the future for tax cuts for the rich. Take benefits away \nfrom the seniors in the Medicare Program, raise their copayments, raise \ntheir premiums, raise their deductibles, raise all of their costs so \nthat we can put over here a little saving account that can be drawn \ndown to allow tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.\n  That is what we will be debating. And it is also amazing to me that \nwe will have a time constraint on this issue that is going to affect \nthe quality of life for our senior citizens in such a dramatic way. We \ndo not have that time restraint this afternoon, when we are debating \nMedicare Select, but we will have it when that budget bill is called \nup.\n  It is important that we put some of these measures into proportion. \nThis issue, Medicare Select, is being pressed this afternoon. We are on \nthe eve of what will be a very important debate, not only here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate but across this countryside; whether or not we \nwant to say to our senior citizens we are going to cut your benefits so \nwe can use those savings, those cuts, those resources that we have \ncaptured from you to give a tax cut to the wealthiest individuals.\n  Maybe that is what the election was about last November. It certainly \nwas not about that in my State of Massachusetts. People will say, out \nhere on the Senate floor: They voted for change. Is this the kind of \nchange that the people voted for, Mr. President, $256 billion in \nMedicare cuts so we can provide $170 billion for tax reductions for the \nwealthiest individuals? Is that what the election was about last fall?\n  I do not believe so. And I think that is why all of us are seeing, in \nour own States, that those who are paying increasing attention to what \nwe are debating and what we are acting on, are going to be so concerned \nby this particular budget proposal.\n  Sure we have to get some savings in Medicare. Sure we have to have \nsome reductions in expenditures. But what we did last year, when we \nproposed comprehensive health care reform, was to try to bring about \nthe kinds of changes that over the long term are going to provide \nimportant quality health protections for our senior citizens, and \nsecond, to get a handle on health care costs. We need to get a handle \nnot only on Medicare and Medicaid costs but also on the total health \ncare system, since Medicare costs are only 15 percent of total national \nhealth expenditures. The notion that we can deal with escalating health \ncare costs by cutting Medicare alone, shows a fundamental lack of \nunderstanding of the basic elements of the health care debate.\n  Medicare provides no coverage at all for outpatient prescription \ndrugs, but they are fully covered under the most popular plan in the \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Program. The combined deductible for \ndoctor and hospital services under the average Blue Cross and Blue \nShield plan is $350; for Medicare the combined deductible is $816. Blue \nCross and Blue Shield covers unlimited hospital days with no \ncopayments; under Medicare, seniors face $179 per day copayments after \n60 days; $358 after 90 days. After 150 days Medicare pays nothing at \nall.\n  Compare the differences between what our seniors are facing and what \nthe Members of the U.S. Senate are facing. Medicare covers a few \npreventive services but does not cover screenings for heart disease, \nfor prostate cancer, for other cancer tests--all FEHBP benefits. Dental \nservices are covered for Members of Congress. We have them for Members \nof Congress--not for the Medicare recipients. Members of Congress are \nprotected against skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs by a cap on their \ntotal liability. There is no cap on how much a senior citizen has to \npay for Medicare copayments on deductibles.\n  Members of Congress earn $133,600 a year. The average senior's income \nis $17,750. For the limited Medicare benefits seniors receive they pay \n$46.10 a month, but for their comprehensive insurance coverage Members \nof Congress will pay a grand total of $44.05 a month. Seniors actually \npay $2 more out of incomes about an eighth as large.\n  Is that something for our seniors to hear about as we are going to be \nconsidering a program that is going to cut their programs even more--\nand yet not affecting the Members of Congress at all? We have had this \ndebate, some of us, for a number of years. Let us just give to the \nAmerican people what we give to the Members of Congress. But we are not \ndoing that, not with Medicare. We are being told to go ahead and \nprovide additional burdens on the senior citizens that are not being \nasked of the Members of Congress.\n  No wonder people wonder what this is about. Is this the change that \nwe voted for? I would love to ask a group of citizens in any State, is \nthis the change you voted for last November? For further cuts on the \nMedicare benefits, increasing copayments, increasing deductibles to the \ntune of $256 billion, taking $170 billion of it and reserving it over \nhere for tax cuts? Is that what the American people wanted as the \nchange? Or did they believe in what we have as Members of the U.S. \nSenate, and what more than 9 million other Americans have, the Federal \nemployees? Surely they were thinking when they voted, ``OK, if it is \ngood enough for the Members of Congress it ought to be good enough for \nall Americans, young and old alike?''\n  This debate is going to be important in these next several days. I \nhope and urge our seniors to watch this debate and listen carefully. \nListen carefully to those who are making recommendations to cut \nMedicare. Listen to their responses to the challenges about equity to \nour seniors.\n  This President has indicated he will listen. He will listen to \nproposals to cut Medicare if they are about total health care reform. \nThis means that we are going to do something for our seniors that is \ngoing to enhance the quality of health care in such areas as \nprevention, home care, and community-based systems. It means making a \ndifference by reducing deductibles or making payments for \npharmaceuticals so seniors will not be distressed every time they take \nmuch-needed prescription drugs; so they do not need to decide whether \nthey can afford to go down and get that prescription for $50, $75, $100 \nper month, when they do not have enough food on their table or heat in \ntheir home? We will have the chance to debate that. We welcome the \nopportunity to do so.\n  The authors of the budget resolution do not seem to understand how \nlimited the incomes of senior citizens are. Because of their budget, \nmillions of senior citizens will be forced to go without \n[[Page S6792]] the health care they need. Millions more will have to \nchoose between food on the table, adequate heat in the winter, paying \nthe rent, or medical care. This budget resolution is cruel. It is \nunjust. Senior citizens have earned their Medicare payments. They have \npaid for them, and they deserve them.\n  Medicare cuts in this resolution harm more than senior citizens. \nThese proposals will strike a body blow to the quality of American \nmedicine by damaging hospitals and other health care institutions that \ndepend upon Medicare. These institutions provide essential care for \nAmericans of all ages, not just senior citizens. And progress in \nmedical research and training of health professionals depends upon \ntheir financial stability. The academic health centers, the public \nhospitals, and the rural hospitals will bear especially heavy burdens. \nAs representatives of the academic health centers that are the \nguarantors of excellence in health care in America said of this budget, \n``Every American's quality of life will suffer as a result,'' because \nthere will be less funding to support the best health professional \neducation and training to the young people of this country, and there \nwill be a diminution in support for the research that is associated \nwith the great medical centers in this country.\n  In addition, massive Medicare cuts will inevitably impose a hidden \ntax on workers and businesses, who will face increased costs and higher \ninsurance premiums as physicians and hospitals shift even more costs to \nthe nonelderly. According to the recent statistics, Medicare now pays \nonly 68 percent of what the private sector pays for comparable \nphysician services; for hospital care, the figure is 69 percent. The \nproposed Republican cuts will widen this already ominous gap.\n  The impact of these cuts on local communities will be astounding. In \nmy State of Massachusetts we have 123 hospitals. Historically, one of \nthe best and most efficient hospitals has in Barnstable County, not far \nfrom my home on Cape Cod. But it has had increasing difficulty serving \nits patients in recent years. What changed? The doctors have not \nchanged. The nurses have not changed. The ability to get the good kind \nof equipment has not changed. The training that they went through has \nnot changed. What has changed? The percentage of Medicare beneficiaries \nbeing attended to in that hospital changed.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, any hospital that gets close to 55 and \n67 percent Medicare is headed for bankruptcy because of the \nreimbursement rates. What are we doing? Do you know what happens? \nHospitals must cut back on the nurses; they cut back on their outreach \nprograms in the community to work with children; they cut back on their \ntraining programs; they cut back, as much as they regret it, on the \nquality of care people get--not just for the elderly people, but for \nall the people being served.\n  What happens locally? Communities raise local taxes to try to assist \nhospitals, or they appeal to the State house and try to get additional \nresources. They try to get the revenues from someplace. Either \nlocalities accept a decline in health care quality or they have to \nraise additional resources locally or at the State level. Maybe some \nother States are experiencing generous surpluses, but you are not going \nto find many that are in our region of the country.\n  Financial cutbacks that have occurred in the past have made it \ndifficult for hospitals to provide the excellent services they are used \nto providing, and the kinds of cutbacks being discussed by the \nRepublicans now will only exacerbate this problem.\n  The right way to slow Medicare cost growth is in the context of a \nbroad health reform program that will slow health inflation and in the \neconomy as a whole. That is the way to bring Federal health care costs \nunder control without cutting benefits or shifting costs to the working \nfamilies.\n  In the context of a broad reform, the special needs of the academic \nhealth centers, the rural hospitals, and inner-city hospitals can also \nbe addressed. Unilateral Medicare cuts alone, by contrast, could \ndestroy the availability and the quality of care for the young and old \nalike.\n  The President said that he is willing to work for a bipartisan reform \nof the health care system, but our friends on the other side have said \nno. The only bipartisan shift they seem to be interested in is the kind \nthat says, ``Join us in slashing Medicare.'' That is not the kind of \nbipartisanship the American people want.\n  The authors of the budget resolution claim to protect Social Security \nwhile making draconian cuts in Medicare. But the distinction is a false \none because Medicare is part of Social Security. Like Social Security, \nit is a compact between the Government and the people that says, ``Pay \ninto the trust fund during your working years and we will guarantee \ndecent health care in your old age.'' This Republican budget breaks \nthat compact.\n  As the ceremonies on V-E Day this past week remind us, today's senior \ncitizens have stood by America in war and in peace, and America must \nstand by them now. The senior citizens have worked hard. They brought \nus out of the Depression. They fought in the Second World War. Their \nsons fought in the Korean war, and the Vietnam War. They have \nsacrificed greatly to advance the interests of their children. They \nplayed by the rules.\n  If this country is the great country that all of us believe that it \nis, it is really a tribute to the senior citizens. They have \ncontributed to Medicare. They have earned their Medicare benefits. And \nthey deserve to have them.\n  This Republican budget proposes to take those benefits away, and it \nshould be rejected.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6784-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6792-S6793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this afternoon \nto respond to those who have raised an issue about the current efforts \nto have the United States Embassy moved to Jerusalem, the capital of \nIsrael, instead of its current location in Tel Aviv.\n  There have been some suggestions that we are motivated for political \npurposes in 1995 to raise this issue. The history of these efforts \nconclusively refutes that contention. A bill was introduced on October \n1, 1983, S. 2031, cosponsored at that time by 50 United States \nSenators, which sought to have the United States Embassy and the \nresidence of the American Ambassador to Israel hereafter be located in \nthe city of Jerusalem.\n  That resolution was referred to committee and was not called for a \nvote, but it was later noted that in addition to the 50 U.S. Senators, \nthere were 227 Members of the House of Representatives who joined in \nendorsing that transfer of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  Then on March 26, 1990, Senate Concurrent Resolution 106 was \nintroduced, which called for the recognition of Jerusalem as the \ncapital of Israel, and that resolution was passed in the Senate by a \nvoice vote.\n  Then, following those actions, on February 24, 1995, a letter was \nsent to Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed by 92 U.S. \nSenators evidencing strong bipartisan support, again calling for the \nmoving of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  Mr. President, I was an original cosponsor of S. 2031 which was \nintroduced back on October 31, 1983; supported Senate Concurrent \nResolution 106 back in 1990; and joined in the letter of February 24, \n1995, evidencing my consistent support for this program.\n  Recently, the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, was in \nWashington, and the issue was raised as to whether or not action by the \nCongress of the United States in calling for the removal of the Embassy \nfrom Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be an impediment to the peace process \nwhich is ongoing at the present time because obviously we do not wish \nto interfere with the peace process. At that time, Prime Minister Rabin \nresponded that it was a [[Page S6793]] matter for U.S. Congressmen, \nSenators and Representatives, to express themselves as they saw fit. He \ndid not appear perturbed that action in this way would be an impediment \nto the peace process in the Mideast.\n  The negotiators of Israel and the PLO are scheduled, as I understand \nit, to take up the status of Jerusalem approximately a year from now. I \nthink there is no doubt about the Israeli position that Jerusalem is an \nundivided city, and certainly I think there is no doubt in the Congress \nof the United States about Jerusalem being an undivided city and it \nbeing the judgment of Israel as to where its capital should be. The \ntradition is, the unbroken tradition is that the embassies are located \nin the capital city, and it is a fundamental matter therefore that the \nUnited States Embassy and the Ambassador's residence ought to be \nlocated in the capital of Israel just as the Embassy and Ambassador's \nresidence are located in the capital city of every nation with the host \nnation determining where its capital should be.\n  We have to make decisions on matters of this sort, Mr. President, as \nwe see it. There is no doubt about the strong relationship between the \nUnited States and Israel, but judgments need to be made by Senators and \nCongressmen as to what we think is appropriate. Many of us have joined \nover the years in urging that the Embassy be moved to Jerusalem, and I \nthink that the record is consistent over such a long period of time \nthat there is no appropriate way someone could make a claim that it is \na matter for political purposes.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, has been singled out \nin a number of newspaper editorials, others of us less prominent than \nthe majority leader have not been so identified, but I am confident \nthat all of us in exercising our judgment in calling for the location \nof the U.S. Embassy to be in Jerusalem instead of Tel Aviv are doing it \nbecause we think it is the appropriate course of conduct, and no one, \nno fairminded person, can say that when the record goes back to 1983 in \nthe endorsement of this resolution, there could be any political \nmotivation. I think that ought to be considered and the record ought to \nbe set straight on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6792-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN FAMILY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe proposed Contract With the American Family which was the subject of \nan early morning ``Good Morning America'' telecast where Ralph Reed, \nJr., appeared as the spokesman in favor of the Contract With the \nAmerican Family, and I was invited to appear and did appear in \nexpressing my personal views on that subject.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that we have the fundamental contract \nwhich governs the relationship of Americans with their Government, U.S. \ncitizens with their Government, and the relationships among U.S. \ncitizens, and that basic contract is called the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is a document which has served this country very, \nvery well since 1787. And there is appended to the U.S. Constitution a \nBill of Rights which has served this country very well since 1791.\n  The first amendment of that Bill of Rights provides for freedom of \nreligion, which is the very basis of our American society--freedom of \nreligion, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, \nfreedom to petition our Government.\n  The United States was founded by the Pilgrims who came to this \ncountry in the early 1600's, coming for religious freedom. And if I may \non a personal note, Mr. President, say that my parents came to this \ncountry in the early 1900's for the same reason.\n  When the so-called Contract With the American Family calls for a \nconstitutional amendment involving freedom of religion and the first \namendment, I believe it is not well placed. I believe that the \nJeffersonian wall of separation of church and state is firmly \nestablished for the benefit of America, and I think it is most unwise \nto have an amendment to the first amendment freedom of religion, which \nis what is called for by this newly drafted Contract With the American \nFamily.\n  When Mr. Ralph Reed, Jr., speaks on behalf of that contract, and when \nhis mentor, Rev. Pat Robertson, speaks on the subject, Reverend \nRobertson makes the statement that there is no constitutional doctrine \nof separation of church and state, that it is a lie of the left, I \nbelieve that is directly contrary to the Constitution itself, to the \nintent of the Founding Fathers. Certainly this is not Arlen Specter's \nstatement. This is the statement of Thomas Jefferson, articulating the \ndoctrine of separation of church and state.\n  When Mr. Ralph Reed, Jr., articulates a need to change the law of the \nland as articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Casey \nversus Planned Parenthood and Roe versus Wade, which held on a \nconstitutional basis that a woman has a right to choose, there again we \nare looking for constitutional change, which I submit is unwise and is \nunwarranted.\n  There are some parts of the proposals which I think are fine. When \nthey call for an attack on criminals and in support of benefits for \nvictims, I heartily endorse that and have done that for many years \nsince my days as an assistant district attorney, through the DA of \nPhiladelphia, through my service in this body with special reference to \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  When they call to crack down on pornography as it relates to \nchildren, there is no doubt that the Supreme Court of the United States \nhas set a very rigid standard and we should do all we can to enforce \nthat standard. There, again, is something I have done personally over \nthe years in the district attorney's office in Philadelphia and here in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  And when there is a call to have women who are homemakers have \navailable to them the same opportunities for individual retirement \naccounts, I say that is just and right.\n  We have a contract with America in the Constitution which has served \nthis country so well. And in the House of Representatives there has \nbeen a Contract With America which has been adopted in large measure in \nthe House and has been adopted to some extent in the Senate and is \nunder further consideration and I think will be adopted with few \nsignificant changes.\n  But if every group comes forward to insist, Mr. President, on their \nown view of what there should be in the relationship between the \nGovernment and its citizens, among its citizens, then I suggest to you \nthat we are going to be a very, very fragmented society, and that it is \nnot wise to have any one group seek to determine the social mores of \nthis country.\n  This country is strong because it is a melting pot. It is strong \nbecause we recognize diversity. America is strong because we do not \nbreak into individual groups and have one group seek to impose its \nideas on any other group.\n  So when an idea comes forward that there ought to be an amendment to \nthe Constitution, I say no. When the idea comes forward that there \nought to be a change in the first amendment's freedom-of-religion \nprovision, I say no. When the idea comes forward that there ought to be \na change in the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States on a woman's right to choose, I say no.\n  It is time, Mr. President, in America for unifying actions, not for \ndivisive actions. One Contract With America from the Congress elected \nby the people of the United States is sufficient. What we really need \nto do is rely on the basic contract with America, and that is the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues that there \nis an effort underway to come to some agreement on H.R. 483, the \nMedicare Select bill. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement and pass the \nbill, maybe with one or two agreed upon amendments. If we can do it by \nvoice vote, [[Page S6794]] there would not be any additional votes \ntoday. We do not have that agreement yet. As soon as we do, I will \nnotify my colleagues. Senator Chafee has been working with Senator \nRockefeller and others. Hopefully, we will be able to advise our \ncolleagues in 10, 20 minutes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The majority leader is exactly right. We are working now \nwith staffs trying to see if we cannot come to an agreement on the \nproblems raised by the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. \nEverything seems to take longer than anybody thinks around here. So I \nwould say in the next half-hour, I hope, we can have some information \non whether indeed there would be the necessity for a vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think everything else that we can take up has been taken \nup. There is only one nomination on the calendar. There is no other \nlegislation that we can take up at this time.\n  Tomorrow we will start on the budget. I understand the Democrats will \nhave a caucus at 10:30 in the morning and, hopefully, they will allow \nus to start on the budget at noon tomorrow. Otherwise, we would have to \nwait until tomorrow evening to start on the budget. There are 50 hours \nof debate. Of course, it is more than just 50 hours.\n  We did indicate to and promise the President that we would try to \ncomplete the antiterrorist legislation before Memorial Day. So we would \nhave to finish the budget by next Wednesday night. I think we will need \nprobably a couple of days on the antiterrorism legislation and then \nthere would be the Memorial Day recess, which could be the last recess \nof the year, but I hope not.\n  Unless we can work out some accommodation on some of these major \nbills, the Senate will have no alternative but to stay here for a \nconsiderable period of time during what might have been the August \nrecess. If we can start on the budget tomorrow--the House should pass \ntheir budget tomorrow. We will start on ours tomorrow and have votes on \ntomorrow and on Friday and on Monday. If I were Members, I would be \nback on Monday; if there is ever a Monday on which there will be votes, \nit will be this Monday on the budget, and on Tuesday and, hopefully, we \ncan complete action on Wednesday. The final legislation would be the \nantiterrorism legislation.\n  So I suggest that we complete action on this bill, and if we can do \nit without votes, we will do it. If not, Members should not leave until \nthey have some final notice.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want the majority leader to know--and \nI will share this amendment--I have one amendment which I think may be \nnoncontroversial. I can limit it to 10 minutes. I would like to at \nleast show it to colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is on \nthe Medicare Select.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DOLE.

I find \nit hard to believe that the House and Senate have just completed action \non a rescission bill which would save about $16.4 billion--actually \nsavings around $9 billion, because of the $16.4 billion there is \nadditional money for disaster assistance in Oklahoma City and other \nprograms. I am a little bit bewildered because the President indicates \nif we send this bill to him--it will be back from the House this week \nand we will take it up next week--that he will veto it. I am puzzled \nbecause the President has said we ought to reduce spending. So we \nfinally get a little reduction in spending and at his first \nopportunity, he says: No, no; I am not going to sign it. I am going to \nveto it. And at the very time he is suggesting that he is not going to \ndo anything on the budget, not going to offer any budget of his own. We \nwill have a vote on the President's budget. He is just going to be a \nspectator and not participate in trying to reduce the deficit.\n  So it seems to me the President had a golden opportunity here to \nexercise some leadership and demonstrate to the American people that he \nwants to reduce Federal spending, but he struck out. He does not want \nto reduce Federal spending.\n  So what does he do? He tries to blame Republicans. We have cut too \nmany programs or we have done this or done that. It seems to me the \nPresident ought to carefully review what he said today and indicate to \nthe Congress that he will sign this rescission package. It is not easy \nto save money around here. The taxpayers wonder why we do not do more \nand this is a good example. We have been working on this rescission \nbill for weeks and weeks and months, in many cases in a bipartisan way, \nand before it even goes to the President he says he is going to veto \nit.\n  So I think he has missed a golden opportunity and I know he will try \nto figure out some way to blame Republicans. But we cut programs that \nwere not high priority and in addition we added spending for the \ndisaster in Oklahoma City and other programs the President had \nrequested.\n  So, Mr. President, if you have an opportunity to look at it one more \ntime, I suggest maybe you might want to reverse your position. Because \nif you are not willing to even save $9 billion in Federal spending, we \nare talking about many, many, many, many times that much in the budget \nresolution we are going to start debating here tomorrow.\n  If this is any indication of the leadership in the White House, it is \nprobably a forgone conclusion that the President will veto anything we \nsend him on the budget process.\n  So I would hope that this is not an indication of the trend. I think \nthey have blown a very good opportunity here to demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that if they are serious about cutting spending, \nserious about reining in the Government, serious about cutting back on \nsome of the Federal Government which the American people are tired of \npaying for, but unfortunately it appears the President of the United \nStates does not want to cut anything--``Don't touch anything, don't do \nthis, or don't do that''--he will sit on the sidelines and he will \nwatch the Republicans as we try to bring the budget into balance \nbetween now and the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6794-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6794-S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXTENDED USE OF MEDICARE SELECTED POLICIES\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow turn to the consideration of Calendar Order No. 92, H.R. 483, \nregarding Medicare Select, and it be considered under the following \ntime agreement: 10 minutes on the bill, to be equally divided between \nthe chairman and ranking minority member of the Finance Committee; that \none amendment be in order to be offered by Senators Packwood, Chafee, \nRockefeller, and Kennedy, on which there will be 10 minutes for debate \nequally divided in the usual form; and that following the conclusion of \ntime, that the amendment--namely, the Packwood-Chafee-Rockefeller-\nKennedy amendment--be agreed to; and that the bill be read a third time \nand passed and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table \nall without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, since this has been agreed to, I am \nauthorized to say there will be no further rollcall votes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 483) to amend title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act to permit Medicare Select policies to be offered \n     in all States, and for other purposes.\n\n  [[Page S6795]] The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dole \nbe added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Committee on Finance is hereby giving \na commitment to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, that there will be a hearing on Medicare Select once the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services submits its report on this \nprogram.\n  What we are doing is extending Medicare Select to all 50 States for \n18 months. This will continue unless the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices determines one of the following: That beneficiaries do not \nsave dollars compared to other MediGap policies or that there are \nadditional expenditures under Medicare or that access to quality care \nis diminished.\n  Mr. President, there will be a GAO study on whether or not \nbeneficiaries have a problem getting coverage under another MediGap \npolicy if they wish to change policies and recommendations if there are \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, that is the arrangement here.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Is the Senator from Rhode Island finished?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nRhode Island and to say that I agree with what he said and concur in \nthe amendment and do gladly accept it, as it were, and consider it \ngood.\n  What this will do, I think, is what was wanted on both sides of the \naisle, which is ideally what we strive for around here and rarely \nachieve. I had been reluctant to see the 14 States expanded to 50; the \nother side of the aisle wanted to see the 50. I did not have strong \nfeelings about the 50 until I understood more about what the study, \nwhich is going on now, will show. I also wanted to make sure that if \npeople leave Medicare Select and want to go to another MediGap Program, \nthat they are not precluded from being able to join another program \nbecause of preexisting conditions, which, of course, most older people \nhave.\n  It seems to me this is a good compromise. This would allow all 50 \nStates to go into this, if they chose to do so. There would be a period \nof about a year and a half that that would take place. Some people will \nsay the insurance industry does not want to do that because a year and \na half is not enough time. There are 450,000 people in this program \nnow, so it must be sufficiently interesting to the insurance companies.\n  I am pleased that there will be hearings on this. That was a part of \nmy original understanding with Senator Dole. Senator Dole, who is \nchairman of the Medicare Subcommittee that I am ranking member on, so \nto speak, he and I have agreed we will work out, along with others who \nwant to be involved--modifications to Medicare Select if the study and \nthe experience show that that should take place. I think that is \nentirely proper and fair.\n  The GAO study itself, I think, is important because it would analyze \nthe problems that seniors are having in switching MediGap policies. \nWhen we talk about MediGap policies, not everybody necessarily tunes in \non that, but that is incredibly important. Most seniors have MediGap \npolicies to make up for deficiencies in Medicare. These policies are \nvery important to seniors, and that is why all of this be done \nproperly.\n  So, from my point of view, the compromise is a good one. It was \ncarried out in honorable and good fashion between the Senator from \nRhode Island, Senator Chafee, Senator Packwood, and, obviously, the \nmajority leader and myself, and Senator Kennedy. I think it is a good \ncompromise. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I know the distinguished Senator from Texas wants to \nspeak briefly on this, and if she needs a few minutes of extra time, I \npresume the Senator from West Virginia will be agreeable to that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1108\n\n (Purpose: To extend the period for offering Medicare Select policies \n                              for 2 years)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send now to the desk an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, which is sponsored by Senators Packwood, \nChafee, Dole--does Senator Hutchison wish to be listed likewise?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Hutchison, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator \nKennedy, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. \n     Packwood, for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dole, Mrs. Hutchison, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Gorton, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1108.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMITTING MEDICARE SELECT POLICIES TO BE OFFERED \n                   IN ALL STATES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD.\n\n       Section 4358(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1990, as amended by section 172(a) of the Social Security Act \n     Amendments of 1994, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Effective Date.--(1) The amendments made by this \n     section shall only apply--\n       (A) in 15 States (as determined by the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services) and such other States as elect such \n     amendments to apply to them, and\n       ``(B) subject to paragraph (2), during the 5 year period \n     beginning with 1992.\n       ``(2)(A) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     conduct a study that compares the health care costs, quality \n     of care, and access to services under medicare select \n     policies with that under other medicare supplemental \n     policies. The study shall be based on surveys of appropriate \n     age-adjusted sample populations. The study shall be completed \n     by June 30, 1996.\n       ``(B) The Secretary shall determine during 1996 whether the \n     amendments made by this section shall remain in effect beyond \n     the 5 year period described in paragraph (1)(B). Such \n     amendments shall remain in effect beyond such period unless \n     the Secretary determines (based on the results of the study \n     under subparagraph (A)) that--\n       ``(i) such amendments have not resulted in savings of \n     premiums costs to those enrolled in medicare select policies \n     (in comparison to their enrollment in medicare supplemental \n     policies that are not medicare select policies and that \n     provide comparable coverage),\n       ``(ii) there have been significant additional expenditures \n     under the medicare program as a result of such amendments, or\n       ``(iii) access to and quality of care has been \n     significantly diminished as a result of such amendments.\n       (3) GAO study:\n       The GAO shall study and report to Congress, no later than \n     June 10, 1996, on options for modifying the MediGap market to \n     make sure that continuously insured beneficiaries are able to \n     switch plans without medical underwriting or new pre-existing \n     condition exclusions. In preparing such options, the GAO \n     shall determine if there are problems under the current \n     system and the impact of each option on the cost and \n     availability of insurance, with particular reference to the \n     special problems that may arise for enrollees in Medicare \n     Select plans.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, just in summary then, what we have done \nis, First, we have promised that in the Finance Committee we will have \na hearing on Medicare Select once the HHS report comes in; second, this \nlegislation extends Medicare Select to all 50 States, the 15 that have \nit now plus any others that want to come in over the next 18 months, \nand that it will continue indefinitely, beyond the 18 months unless the \nSecretary of HHS determines that the beneficiaries do not save money \ncompared to other MediGap policies or there are additional expenditures \nby the Government under Medicare, or access to or quality of care is \ndiminished. Finally, there will be a GAO study on whether or not the \nbeneficiaries have a problem getting coverage under another MediGap \npolicy, if they wish to change policies. Furthermore, the GAO would \nmake recommendations if there are problems.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to be a cosponsor of this \nsubstitute because I think this is one of [[Page S6796]] the important \npositive things that we can do for health care reform. This was brought \nto my attention by Congresswoman Johnson last year when we were afraid \nthat this option for our seniors in the 15 States using it might be \nlost in the shuffle, and I called Senator Chafee and we worked to try \nto make sure that this was extended. I am very pleased that Senators \nRockefeller and Chafee have now come to an accommodation to not only \nextend it for the 50 States but to allow all people in all 50 States on \nMedicare to have the option of selecting Medicare Select.\n  Medicare Select is health reform that works. Since I have been in the \nSenate, we have spent more time discussing the problems in our health \ncare system than about the models of achievement in the industry. What \nabout the reform that has accomplished savings in health care? Medicare \nSelect is a program we should encourage and promote, not to let die.\n  Medicare Select gives seniors an option to save money. In Texas, more \nthan 8,000 seniors are enrolled in Medicare Select plans and save an \naverage of 15 to 20 percent of the cost of Medicare supplemental plans. \nThis is a significant savings for those on a fixed income. Nationwide, \n400,000 people participate in this program in 15 States. If we allowed \nthis program to expire at the end of this year, seniors would be hit \nwith higher premiums.\n  Medicare Select policies are highly rated by Consumer Reports \nmagazine. In its August 1994 issue, Consumer Reports included 8 \nMedicare Select policies in the top 15 best value MediGap products \nnationwide. In fact, almost every health care reform bill introduced in \nthis body last year contained a permanent extension of this program to \n50 States.\n  The need to extend Medicare Select Program is critical. If this \nprogram were allowed to expire, premiums could substantially increase \nfor the current Medicare Select enrollees and, more importantly, would \nlimit options for new Medicare beneficiaries. With the recent report by \nthe trustees of the Medicare trust fund telling us of the dire straits \nof the Medicare Program, it would be unthinkable to start eliminating \ncost-effective options for providing care to the Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I appreciate Senator Chafee's and Senator Rockefeller's leadership on \nthis. I think they are taking exactly the right approach. I am glad to \nbe a cosponsor of this substitute. When we talk about improving health \ncare, here is one of the key ways we can do it so that we can provide \noptions for all 50 States for our seniors to have the ability to add to \ntheir standard Medicare plan options that they would want at an \naffordable price.\n  I hope we will adopt this quickly. I hope that the other seniors in \nthe States not now covered will look into this option, because this is \nthe way we can do what this Congress has been trying to do for 2 years, \nand that is to provide more cost-effective health care availability for \nour senior citizens. Thank you, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her kind comments. She has been a loyal supporter and active \nworker in connection with this Medicare Select effort. I congratulate \nher for what she has done.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate passage of \nthe Medicare Select bill, H.R. 483, which as passed by the House would \nextend the current demonstration program beyond its June 30, 1995 \ncutoff date and expand it from 15 States to the entire Nation.\n  While it has thus far been just a small 3-year demonstration program, \nthe Medicare Select Program has been a tremendous success in the 15 \nStates where it is offered, especially in California.\n  Medicare Select provides supplementary insurance--for copayments, \ndeductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs--for 100,000 California \nMedicare recipients (roughly 440,000 nationally).\n  Seniors enroll in the low-cost Medicare Select Program in exchange \nfor participation in a loose-knit managed care plan.\n  This network of providers are used to cut premium costs by 10-37 \npercent over fee for service medigap products, which translates into \nsavings on medigap premiums of up to $25 per month, or $300 per year.\n  In California, more than 2,200 new enrollees are being added per \nmonth, because the Medicare Select Program can provide low-cost, high-\nquality health benefits, while still retaining a high degree of choice \nover their physician.\n  There is no additional cost to the Federal Government.\n  However, under current law, no new Medicare recipients will be able \nto enroll in the program after July 1, 1995, when the demonstration \nprogram that was authorized in 1990 and extended for 6 months last year \nwill end.\n  To make sure that select is continued in California, I joined Senator \nChafee and others in introducing Medicare Select legislation earlier \nthis year, and am pleased that the House was easily able to pass \nlegislation that would extend the program for 5 years and expand it to \nall 50 States, with a bipartisan vote of 408 to 18.\n  This Medicare Select legislation should not be confused or dragged \ndown with other, more contentious health care insurance reform issues. \nCertainly, there are problems with the current medigap insurance \nprogram that must be addressed. However, this is a simple, \nstraightforward bill that should not be used for those purposes.\n  The Medicare Select Program is entirely voluntary, and should not be \nconfused with programs and proposals that would require seniors to join \nHMO's to get their Medicare. No seniors are being forced or fooled into \njoining, Medicare Select seniors can still receive service outside \ntheir plans, and no insurers are being forced to sell this type of \nproduct.\n  In fact, Consumer Reports has listed Medicare Select products as \namong its highest rated values, and extension of the Medicare Select \nProgram has been endorsed by the California Commissioner of Insurance \nas well as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n  Certainly, managed Medicare programs like Medicare Select must be \nimplemented carefully, in order to ensure that Medicare enrollees are \nappropriately informed of the benefits of this program, provided with \nhigh-quality services, and ensured access to highly trained physicians.\n  However, the matter at hand is straightforward, and the most \nimportant thing is that Medicare Select be extended. Therefore, I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Medicare Select legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Medicare \nSelect Program. The bill we are considering extends Medicare Select for \n5 years and allows all States to participate. Fifteen States are \ncurrently allowed to take part in this program which provides older \nAmericans with a managed care alternative to supplement their Medicare \nbenefits.\n  We have a strong managed care tradition in Wisconsin. Many seniors \nhad managed care options during their employment and wish to maintain \nthat choice of care as they retire. Medicare Select provides that \nopportunity and is very popular in my State.\n  Mr. President, if we do not act on this legislation, Medicare Select \nwill terminate on June 30. Over 26,000 Medicare recipients in Wisconsin \nwill face increased premiums and limited choices. 450,000 older \nAmericans in the 15 States will be hit with higher costs if the program \nis not extended.\n  At a time when the majority party is pursuing a budget proposal that \ncuts Medicare by $256 billion--which would greatly increase out-of-\npocket costs for older American's and ration care--we should not kill a \nprogram that currently saves money for older Americans and expands \ntheir options.\n  Detractors from this bill suggest that before we act, we should wait \nuntil a study being conducted for the Department of Health and Human \nServices is completed later this summer. Or will it be completed in \nDecember? No one seems to know when it will be ready. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, the study was due this past January. What's the holdup?\n  There is one date that I am certain of--June 30, 1995--the date when \nMedicare Select will terminate.\n  I am eager to see the results of the study I just mentioned. I \nbelieve it will have important ramifications on the future of managed \ncare and Medicare. [[Page S6797]] But we must not hold Medicare Select \nbeneficiaries hostage until a date uncertain.\n  During debate today, concerns have been raised about premium rating \nbased on age and one-time open enrollment periods under medigap \npolicies. I agree that these concerns should be addressed. However, \nthese issues relate to all MediGap policies, not just Medicare Select. \nWe should not single out those who benefit from Medicare Select in \norder to iron out differences in overall MediGap policy. We can and \nshould review these issues under Medicare reform and broader health \ncare reform legislation.\n  Medicare Select works for older people in Wisconsin. It saves \nbeneficiaries from 20 to 30 percent in premium costs than under \ntraditional medigap policies.\n  Medicare Select plans are subject to the same regulations as other \nmedigap policies which are regulated by the States. Select plans must \noffer sufficient access, have an ongoing quality assurance program, and \nprovide full disclosure of network requirements.\n  The program saves money for Medicare recipients, does not cost the \nFederal Government, and perhaps most importantly, provides many \nbeneficiaries and providers their first exposure to managed care.\n  Mr. President, time is running out. I urge my colleagues to support \nand extend Medicare Select.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rockefeller, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, for all of his help. I am glad we were able to work \nthis out. It looked a little sticky at first, but we have done it. I \nlook forward to working with him on the Finance Committee as we have \nthe hearings next fall or whenever the report comes in from HHS.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yielded the remainder of my time, so if the \nSenator will yield.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield. The Senator may take as much of my time as he \nwants.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There are two points I want to make that I think are \nvery important to those who might be listening and who might be \nconfused at this point. One is that we went from a 5-year extension to \na year-and-a-half extension. Then, as the Senator from Rhode Island \npointed out, the year-and-a-half extension would then become automatic \nunless the Secretary of HHS had objections or found problems or \nwhatever. That means that basically--I do not want this to be taken the \nwrong way--Donna Shalala who is watching this closely--I do not think \ndestructively but constructively--18 months would pass and she would \nstill be there. So that for some of the colleagues who might be worried \nthat this is an automatic extension, it is not, except as the merit \nallows that. I think that is a matter of great comfort to me, and it is \nanother reason why I appreciate the Senator from Rhode Island. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  So the bill (H.R. 483), as amended, was passed.\n\n                                H.R. 483\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 483) entitled ``An Act to amend title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act to permit medicare select policies to be \n     offered in all States, and for other purposes'', do pass with \n     the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the purpose of the recently collapsed \nautomotive trade negotiations between the United States and Japan and \nthe administration's subsequent announcement to impose reciprocal \nrestrictions on Japanese products and file an unfair trade complaint \nwith the World Trade Organization is simple That purpose is to open \nJapan's closed and protected auto and auto parts markets.\n  Yesterday, the administration took an important step toward opening \nJapan's automotive market to American products by announcing the \nspecific list of Japanese products to be sanctioned in retaliation for \nthe unfair exclusion of American products from Japan. We have listened \nto 25 years of trade rhetoric from one administration after another \npromising to open Japan's automotive markets to United States products. \nEndless talks and endless negotiations have not produced results. \nJapan's markets remain almost totally closed, and we have lost huge \nnumbers of jobs during this period.\n  I have a little chart here which shows the statements of American \nPresidents since 1971. Every President of both parties has had promises \nmade to him and, in turn, has assured the American people that we are \ngoing to act to open up Japanese markets to American products.\n  President Nixon in 1971 said:\n\n       Japan has accelerated its program of liberalizing its \n     restrictions on imports.\n\n  When President Nixon said that, the deficit with Japan was $1.3 \nbillion. [[Page S6798]] \n  In 1974, President Ford said:\n\n       The United States and Japan will negotiate to reduce tariff \n     and other trade distortions.\n\n  By that time the trade deficit with Japan had grown to $2.8 billion.\n  In 1975, President Carter said:\n\n       [W]e're trying to get the Japanese to buy spare parts and \n     parts for assembly of their own automobiles in the U.S.\n\n  By that time the deficit had grown to $2.9 billion.\n  President Reagan in 1983 said:\n\n       [W]e're encouraged by recent commitments to further open \n     Japan's markets.\n\n  By that time the trade deficit had grown to $21.6 billion.\n  In 1991, President Bush issued a statement through the Vice President \nas follows. Vice President Quayle said:\n\n       The President will take a direct message to the Prime \n     Minister of Japan after the first of the year, saying that we \n     don't anticipate continuing business as usual.\n\n  Well, by then the trade deficit was $43.4 billion. By now the trade \ndeficit is over $60 billion.\n  So actions clearly are long overdue. The administration's decision to \ntell Japan to either open its markets or it will face concrete \nreciprocal restrictions is the right thing to do and can best be \nunderstood by showing that decision in a historical context of these \nthree decades. When Japan has had total access to America's auto and \nauto parts markets while we have had no real access to Japan's \nautomotive markets, decades of painful history and lost American jobs \nhave proven that Japan will open its markets only when forced to do so.\n  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, JAMA, of course, \ncomplains about the announced sanctions. In fact, the day after United \nStates Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced last week that we \nwould take trade actions to open Japan's automotive markets to \ncompetition, JAMA put an ad in the Washington Post saying that managed \ntrade does not work. I find it incredible that Japan can even mouth the \nwords ``managed trade'' given the fact that they have the world's most \nmanaged economy and have had the world's most managed economy for \ndecades. They are the undisputed world champions of managed trade. \nTheir wall of protectionism against our auto parts and our automobiles \nhas been built over 30 years.\n  JAMA's own general director, William Chandler Duncan, before becoming \ngeneral director of JAMA, wrote a book. That book demonstrated just how \nJapan was able to stop the opening of its automobile market to the \nUnited States and to our automobiles, and that shutting us out of that \nmarket has been a three-decade-old conscious policy of the Japanese \nGovernment.\n  In 1973, Mr. Duncan published a book entitled ``U.S.-Japan Automobile \nDiplomacy, A Study in Economic Confrontation.'' What a painful part of \nour history is set forth in that book. The book provides strong \nhistorical support for the administration's decision to pry open \nmarkets which have been discriminatorally closed to American products \nfor three decades. William Duncan's book documents how Japan's \nautomotive industry was protected from outside competition by the \nGovernment of Japan in order to protect their domestic auto industry.\n  As you are going to hear from some of the quotes that I have \nexcerpted from this book, it is a demonstration of unfair trade policy \nat its worst. American negotiators suffering from Japan fatique have \nthree decades of fruitless negotiation as a cause of that fatique. An \nAmerican President has finally acted based on the certain belief that, \nunless we do as other countries and act to force open Japan's market \nwith reciprocal treatment, that market will remain closed.\n  Mr. Duncan's book gives us a historical view of the years 1967 to \n1971. It has only gotten worse.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that selected quotations from \nthe book entitled ``U.S.-Japan Automobile Diplomacy, A Study in \nEconomic Confrontation'' by William Chandler Duncan be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSelected Quotes From United States-Japan Automobile Diplomacy, a Study \n                       in Economic Confrontation\n\n       The period under discussion ranges from the opening of the \n     U.S. diplomatic offensive in the fall of 1967 until the \n     Japanese approval of the Mitsubishi-Chrysler joint venture in \n     June 1971 where Chrysler was limited to 35 percent ownership \n     of Mitsubishi over 3 years.\n       ``The course of trade and capital liberalization was not a \n     smooth one. It involved time-consuming consultations between \n     government and industry, long-term schedules of decontrol, \n     and complicated qualifications attached to concessions \n     granted. This naturally lead to frustrations, if not \n     bitterness, on the part of many American's anxious to share \n     in rapidly expanding Japanese markets.'' [Introduction, page \n     16]\n       ``Though this dispute was later attributed to a \n     misunderstanding, it nevertheless clearly indicates the \n     reluctance of the Japanese to negotiate as well as the type \n     of frustration that was to plague the U.S. team \n     continually.'' [page 4]\n       [January 1968] ``It was natural, therefore, that the \n     Americans would continue to emphasize the abolition of \n     Japan's quantitative trade restrictions. Again the Japanese \n     delegation would make no commitment beyond a vague statement \n     to make a forward looking investigation.'' [page 6]\n       ``While all the (Japanese) automobile companies indicated a \n     concern over the possible consequences of capital \n     liberalization the Toyota Motor Company was most adamant on \n     the issue. In January (1968) they went as far as amending \n     their articles of incorporation to the effect that no \n     foreigner could sit on the board of directors of the \n     company.'' [page 7]\n       [June-August 1968] ``The Japanese concessions were so \n     painfully slow in coming, and even then frustratingly offset \n     with other types of market restrictions, that the American \n     government never once gave the Japanese side an affirmative \n     response.'' [page 15]\n       [March 1968, LDP mission to Washington] ``Congressmen of \n     both parties emphasized in particular the problems of iron \n     and steel imports and the liberalization of automobile parts \n     . . . . especially, Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways \n     and Means Committee, pointing to the increase of Japanese \n     made automobiles into America, countered by saying that if it \n     is Japanese policy to promote free trade, it should \n     liberalize the import of American automobiles.'' [page 17]\n       [June, 1968, USTR's response to Japan's trade opening \n     proposal] ``One example that is giving us great concern \n     relates to one of our biggest export industries, and that is \n     the automobile industry. Here the Japanese have clearly \n     illegal restrictions . . . . This has been under bilateral \n     discussion since the beginning of the year. We have finally \n     told them (Japan) that unless they come up with a \n     satisfactory solution in a very short period of time, we will \n     invoke article 23 of the GATT to take them to court, which in \n     turn will most likely give us the ability to retaliate \n     against them.''

[page 22]\n       [August, 1968] ``Though none of these initial efforts were \n     realized, the considerable discussion generated by them point \n     out the intensity with which many Japanese feared the \n     entrance of the U.S. companies into Japan. Numerous articles \n     and statements in the Japanese press maintained that a `big \n     three' advance would result in a wave of take-overs of \n     Japanese firms.'' [page 24]\n       [Quote from Daiyamondo--Japanese newspaper] ``If we \n     liberalize within two years, it is certain that the second \n     class makers will be bought out by foreign capital . . . \n     Since their mission, if they invest, will be to maintain and \n     increase that investment, Americans will surely come to \n     manage it. In that case the Japanese will become slaves \n     driven unmercifully by American capital.'' [Duncan's comment] \n     ``This gives an indication of the strength of feeling among \n     those who advocated the so-called `Jidosha Joi Ron.' \n     `Jidosha' means `automobile' while `joi Ron' refers to the \n     `expel-the-barbarian' movement of the mid-nineteenth \n     century.'' [page 24]\n       [June 21, 1968, Prime Minister Sato] ``Capital \n     liberalization must be advanced according to present day \n     international trends. There is no problem with Japanese \n     shipbuilding, but capital liberalization for automobiles is \n     still impossible even though their exports have been \n     flourishing. Domestic production is a matter of great concern \n     and allowing the improvement of national prosperity is \n     essential. But we would like to promote foreign capital \n     induction in a way that will advance Japan's technology.'' \n     [page 24]\n       [July 20, 1968 debate between leaders of the major Japanese \n     automobile firms over whether or not the industry was over \n     protected]. ``Keeping in mind the fact that the government \n     has heretofore fostered the automobile industry as an \n     essential industry, the industry will in the future endeavor \n     to develop on a national basis.'' [Duncan's comment] ``This \n     latter point, known as the `Hakone Declaration' is quite \n     significant in that it was interpreted as a unanimous \n     agreement by Japan's major auto manufacturers not to tie up \n     with foreign capital.'' [page 28]\n       ``Henry Ford II continued to be the most outspoken \n     representative of the American industry: `The U.S. Government \n     never gets tough enough . . . if they (the Japanese) go far \n     enough and start importing still more [[Page S6799]] into \n     this country, you'll see a lot of action in Congress.''' \n     [page 32]\n       [Chairman of the Keidanren's Foreign Capital Problems \n     Committee, Teizo Okamura] ``If we continue to hold on like \n     this (to an isolationist attitude) there is the possibility \n     of escalating the `yellow peril thesis.' Presently there has \n     appeared a movement for voluntary restrictions on steel and \n     synthetic textiles, but it is conceivable that against \n     automobiles as well as voluntary restriction policy will \n     appear requesting a limit of 200,000 cars a year.'' [page 32]\n       [February 21, letter from Automobile Manufacturers \n     Association chairman Thomas Mann to acting assistant \n     Secretary of State Joseph A. Greenwald]. ``. . . The critical \n     area of discrimination is the severely restrictive policies \n     of Japan with reference to capital investment by the United \n     States auto interests. This is a clear violation of the \n     United States-Japan Treaty of Friendship Commerce and \n     Navigation. The Department of State may wish to consider the \n     advisability of again appraising the government of Japan with \n     these views. At the same time its attention might be called \n     to the consequences of a continuing denial to U.S. \n     manufacturers of opportunities for trade and investment in \n     Japan . . .'' [page 35]\n       [Duncan's comment] ``Though the contents of this letter \n     revealed nothing new as far as the U.S. automobile industry's \n     position was concerned, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo took the \n     unusual step of submitting the Mann letter directly to \n     Kiyohiko Tsurumi, the Economic Affairs bureau Director of the \n     Foreign ministry, a move which created considerable comment \n     in Japan and underscored the dissatisfaction of the U.S. \n     government as well as the auto industry with continued \n     Japanese recalcitrance.'' [page 36]\n       [1971] ``The automobile concessions, however, while \n     designed to mitigate these growing pressures were, \n     nevertheless, also a reflection of MITI's continuing efforts \n     to insure that the Japanese automobile industry would be \n     managed by Japanese citizens according to Japanese business \n     practices.'' [page 43]\n       [October 1969] ``The Japanese, however, resisted this \n     (American) pressure (for further concessions), maintaining as \n     before that they needed time to strengthen their industry so \n     that it could remain competitive with the `big three.' Their \n     reasoning is reflected in a document attached to the cabinet \n     announcement: . . . the actual situation of our country's \n     automobile industry is weak when compared with the mammoth \n     enterprises of the United States and Europe; thee are still \n     considerable differential, in capital power, technical \n     development ability, etc . . .. For this reason, it capital \n     liberalization were to be carried out with the situation as \n     it is now--there is strong danger that big disturbances would \n     be created in the automobile industry, through the advance of \n     foreign capital which has huge capital and enterprise \n     power.''

[page 44]\n       [1971] ``Additional pressure on the Japanese automobile \n     industry came as a result of the dramatic increase in exports \n     to the United States during this period.'' [page 46]\n       ``In July (1971) Toyota Motor Sales vice president Kato \n     revealed that Ambassador to the United States Shimoda had \n     warned the automobile industry that if the rate of exports \n     continued, the Japanese industry might expect either \n     protectionist measures in Congress or antidumping measures \n     such as had recently occurred with color television sets.'' \n     [page 46]\n       ``Throughout the negotiations the major Japanese automobile \n     companies were recording substantial profits; their exports \n     were expanding at a dramatic rate, and their sales in the \n     United States were increasing during a time when total U.S. \n     automobile sales were generally declining. Furthermore, they \n     were setting up assembly plants and selling equipment \n     abroad.'' [page 53]\n       ``In short, when the Japanese spoke of reorganizing an \n     industry they were referring to a government, or more \n     specifically, a MITI policy of encouraging the amalgamation \n     of designated industries into larger units so as to keep them \n     competitive with foreign firms on the one hand, and secure \n     from foreign acquisition on the other.'' [page 53]\n       ``One of the most striking aspects of these negotiations, \n     for example, was the strength of Japanese resistance to the \n     intense pressure applied by the United States. By 1969 \n     Japan's automobile industry was the world's second largest \n     with rapidly expanding exports and foreign assembly \n     operations; yet despite threats of a U.S. import surcharge, \n     appeals to GATT, pressure from international institutions, \n     and the implied consequences embodied in peripheral issues \n     such as textiles, Okinawa, etc. the Japanese refused to allow \n     the American automobile industry any more than a token \n     position in their automobile market.'' [page 111]\n       ``Since the prewar financial combines dissolved by the \n     occupation have, in different forms, gradually reconstructed \n     themselves, the Anti-Monopoly Law has become the center of \n     one of the more significant controversies in Japan. . . . it \n     did not discourage MITI from pushing for reorganization in \n     the automobile industry, or, for that matter, in other \n     industries as well.'' [page 113]\n       ``. . . given present day conditions, it is unlikely that \n     an American firm will in the near future acquire significant \n     management control of a Japanese automobile assembly \n     operation.'' [page 114]\n       ``The attempt of the American automobile industry to enter \n     the Japanese market covered three and a half years (fall \n     1967-June 1971) of frustrating negotiation and contributed \n     significantly to a growing uneasiness in Japanese-American \n     relations.'' [page 115]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two-and-a-half decades later, the story is \nthe same. William Duncan was hired to run JAMA, but his own book, \nwritten before he was hired by JAMA, is a dramatic reminder of Japan's \ndetermination to prevent us from having access to its markets.\n  Mr. President, I will just read three or four of those excerpts. \nAgain, this is the man who wrote about what happened in the late 1960's \nand early 1970's, wrote about how Japan acted as a government and an \nindustry to keep American products out of Japan in his book. He is now \nthe director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, JAMA. \nBut this is what he wrote prior to being hired as the director of JAMA.\n  In January 1968, this is what Mr. Duncan wrote:\n\n       It was natural, therefore, that the Americans would \n     continue to emphasize the abolition of Japan's quantitative \n     trade restrictions. Again, the Japanese delegation would make \n     no commitment beyond a vague statement to make a forward \n     looking investigation.\n\n  That was 1968, January.\n  In June 1968, again quoting Mr. Duncan's book:\n\n       These proposals clearly indicate the continued Japanese \n     determination to exclude foreign automobiles from their \n     markets.\n\n  Then in 1969, this is what Mr. Duncan said was going on:\n\n       By 1969 Japan's automobile industry was the world's second \n     largest with rapidly expanding exports in foreign assembly \n     operations; yet despite threats of a U.S. import surcharge, \n     appeals to GATT, pressure from international institutions, \n     and the implied consequences embodied in peripheral issues \n     such as textiles, Okinawa, etc., the Japanese refused to \n     allow the American automobile industry any more than a token \n     position in their automobile market.\n\n  Finally, from Mr. Duncan, the final quote that I will read here, \nalthough there are many more that will be in the Record, is the \nfollowing:\n\n       The attempt of the American automobile industry to enter \n     the Japanese market covered three and a half years (the fall \n     of 1967 through June of 1971) of frustrating negotiation and \n     contributed significantly to a growing uneasiness in \n     Japanese-American relations.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a long history here. It is written very \nclearly by the man who took a personal interest in that history at that \ntime. Two and a half decades later, the story is the same, albeit \nworse. The trade deficit has grown by a about 40 times what it was in \n1970.\n  Mr. Duncan was hired to run JAMA, but his own book written before he \nwas hired by JAMA is a dramatic reminder of how Japan's determination \nto prevent us from having access to its markets worked. It worked to \nJapan's advantage. It worked to our disadvantage. It worked to the \ndisadvantage of American workers who have lost jobs by the thousands \nbecause Japan has been allowed to maintain a protected market. We have \ntolerated it. It is long overdue that we stop tolerating it, and I am \nglad that the President finally took action to knock down that \nprotectionist wall which has surrounded the Japanese automobile and \nauto parts market for now three decades.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.

This morning, Mr. President, the President of the United \nStates, Bill Clinton, announced that he intended to veto the \nrescissions bill, a proposal to save some $16 billion of already \nappropriated money as a modest down payment on the tremendous fiscal \ncrisis facing the United States today.\n  This announcement was both a surprise and, I believe, almost \nunprecedented because, Mr. President, I am informed by the chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, and can speak from my own personal \nknowledge as the chairman of one of the subcommittees of the \nAppropriations Committee, that there was no communication emanating \nfrom the White House and directed at the conference committee which has \nbeen in almost continuous session for some 2 weeks on this rescissions \nbill about the President's desires or about his bottom line.\n  Mr. President, this is in dramatic contrast with conference \ncommittees on appropriations bills in the past, in either the Reagan \nadministration or the Bush administration, in which that contact \nbetween the White House and the Congress was constant and in which the \nbottom line of the President was always well and clearly known to \nmembers of the conference.\n  Here, by contrast, we had a situation in which the White House was \nalmost totally silent with respect to its request about rescissions. \nThe President still pays lip service to a $16 billion goal which must \nbe seven or eight times larger than the goal of his original \nrescissions bill itself. But only after the deed is done, only when all \nthat remains for the Congress is the formality of the approval of this \nconference committee report, do we hear, first, that it does not cut \nenough dollars from what the President describes as pork, and takes too \nmuch out of proposals which are of greater interest to him.\n  Mr. President, a few general remarks.\n  The President attacks spending on Federal courthouses, on the \nbuilding of U.S. courthouses in various parts of the country.\n  Mr. President, I have no dog in this fight. Earlier, there was a \ncourthouse in Seattle in one of these appropriations bills, but it is \nrescinded in this bill. So none of the so-called pork exists in my \nState.\n  And there is also criticism of a number of highway projects that were \nnot rescinded. But note, Mr. President, I said ``not rescinded.'' Every \none of these projects which the President of the United States now \ndescribes as pork, he signed into law less than a year ago. Last year's \nappropriations bill for transportation, for the Treasury Department, \nfor GSA, for the Post Office, was signed and hailed by the President. \nThose bills had every one of these projects contained in them and more \nbesides, a significant number that are rescinded in this bill. So today \nwe have described as pork proposals which the President hailed last \nyear and proposals which spent more last year when he signed them than \nthis year when some but not all have been rescinded.\n  What in the world could have happened to have changed the President's \nmind about specific projects in the course of 6 months, he does not \ntell us.\n  Mr. President, as recently as about 2 months ago, when the original \nrescissions debate had been completed in both the House of \nRepresentatives and here in the U.S. Senate, the President said of the \nSenate proposal,\n\n       The bill passed 99 to 0 in the Senate, and I will sign the \n     Senate bill if the House and Senate will send it to me. \n     That's how we should be doing the business of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is more than safe to say that the bill the \nPresident attacked today is considerably closer to the proposal passed \nby the Senate just a few weeks ago than those passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. In many of the very education and job training areas \nwhich the President now uses as an excuse to veto this bill, the Senate \nprovision prevailed, lock, stock, and barrel, was accepted by the \nconferees. In several others, the compromise is considerably closer to \nthe Senate provision than it is to the House provision, in some, it is \n50-50, and maybe, in one or two, it is closer to the House provision.\n  But, Mr. President, a tiny handful--2, 3, 4 percent--of the dollar \namount of rescissions fall into the categories which the President now \ncriticizes.\n  And, Mr. President, one more repetition of my first point. Not a word \nabout this 1, 2, 3, 4 percent of these rescissions being deal busters, \nbeing entirely unacceptable to the President, was communicated to the \nconference committee while it was in being.\n  Mr. President, is it not safe to say, overwhelmingly safe to say, \nthat the President of the United States wanted to have something in \nthis bill that could give him a political excuse for a veto? I regret \nto say that I believe that to be the case.\n  And one more not incidental point, Mr. President: there is a part of \nthis bill that the President of the United States mentioned today which \ncomes very close to home. I know the Presiding Officer will remember \nthe debate on the floor of the Senate here on so-called timber \nlanguage. That vote was very close in language, of which I was the \nauthor, and was substituted for much more stringent House language in \nthe course of the debate here in the Senate. But even our milder \nlanguage passed only by a narrow margin.\n  Briefly, the House of Representatives mandated a certain harvest \nlevel of salvage timber in all of the national forests of the United \nStates. The Senate, in language which I wrote, did not mandate any \nharvest at all but simply freed this administration to carry out its \nown plans for salvage timber and its own plans for harvest in the \nforests of the Pacific Northwest under option 9.\n  In no way did the House language require President Clinton and his \nadministration to do anything that it had not planned to do. It simply \nfreed what the administration wants to do, consistent with its views of \nall the environmental laws from the constant blizzard of litigation to \nwhich it has been subjected over the last several years.\n  And in fact, as recently as a week ago, the new Secretary of \nAgriculture, who, of course, has the Forest Service under his \njurisdiction, wrote a letter to the chairman of this conference \ncommittee, one of the few interventions by anyone in the administration \nwith the work of the conference committee, and said, and I am quoting \nhim:\n\n       We believe that the Senate provision which directs the \n     Secretary, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, to \n     ``prepare, offer and award salvage timber sale contracts to \n     the maximum extent feasible to reduce the backlog volume of \n     salvage timber in the interior'' offers a more responsible \n     approach than was adopted by the House.\n\n  So a week ago this Senate timber provision was evidently acceptable \nto the administration. Now, Mr. President, the timber provision which \nis denominated by the President of the United States today as being a \ngiveaway to big timber companies is the original Senate language \namended only in minor details in a way that the administration itself \nasked us to amend it.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, what Mr. Clinton now criticizes is a set of \nprovisions his own Secretary of Agriculture approved of by this \nlanguage a week ago with minor changes that they suggested themselves. \nIt is not the original House language.\n  Now, our Chief Executive is either ignorant of the rules which govern \ntimber sales in the Forest Service or deliberately disingenuous when he \nbegins, once again, the class warfare of big timber companies. Most of \nthe big timber companies in the Pacific Northwest at least are not \neligible to harvest Forest Service timber because they export some of \nthe logs that they own from their own lands--the Plum Creeks, the \nWeyerhaeusers of this world are not a part of this process at all.\n  Who are these so-called big timber companies that will benefit from \nthis? Let me read you a couple of letters that I have received in the \ncourse of the last month.\n  The first one is from Tom Mayr, of the Mayr Bros. Co. in Hoquiam, WA, \na local mill in that community. I am quoting:\n\n       Slade, you must realize that this amendment is the single \n     most important piece of legislation in over 5 years to Mayr \n     Brothers and many independent sawmills like ours. Congress \n     and President Clinton have said [[Page S6801]] that they \n     would get us timber, but there hasn't been any significance \n     sold since 1990 on the Olympic National Forest. Your \n     amendment would realize four of our 318 timber sales with \n     enough log volume to run the large log mill two shifts for 1 \n     year. This would put 50 people back to work immediately.\n\n  Or another one from one of what apparently are these huge timber \nconglomerates, the Hurn Shingle Co. in Concrete, WA, and I quote:\n\n       It is nice to see that there is some hope for our shake and \n     shingle mill. We have not operated our mill, due to lack of \n     raw materials, since December 1993. We only operated 12 weeks \n     in 1993. So, as you and I both know, any help you can give us \n     would be encouraging. These amendments are very important for \n     our company, as a wood supply would be something that we have \n     not had for a very long time.\n\n  These are typical responses, Mr. President, and it is that kind of \nsmall-town, independently owned company providing employment where it \nis not otherwise available that will be modest beneficiaries of the \nPresident's inadequate, in my view, option 9 and of the opportunity to \nharvest timber which has been partly destroyed by forest fires or by \nbug infestation all across the country and which, within a relatively \nshort period of time, will rot to the point at which it is not worth \nanything from a commercial point of view but becomes magnificent \nkindling wood for future forest fires, fires like that which devastated \nthe Northwest last summer.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a Chief Executive who criticizes timber \nprovisions his own Secretary of Agriculture previously approved, who \ncriticizes as pork spending on public buildings that he approved by his \nsignature on appropriations bills last year, and who criticizes modest \nreductions in programs he likes about which he was entirely silent \nduring the deliberations of the conference committee.\n  Mr. President, that is not the way in which a Chief Executive of this \ncountry should act. It is not responsible to the affected people. It is \nnot responsive to his duty to help us to begin to work toward a \nbalanced budget. It is not responsive in his relationships with this \nbody or with the House of Representatives.\n  I regret this politicization of the process, and I have every hope \nthat if we must begin this process over again, we say to the President, \nwhat we said this time we mean next time and if you want cooperation, \nif you want the additional money you have asked for for other programs, \nyou need to be willing to work with the Congress and stick to your own \nword in the future.\n  This is an extremely disappointing message, not just to the Members \nof this body who have worked so hard on coming up with an important \nbill, but because of its destructive impact on a drive toward \nresponsibility, fiscal prudence, and a change in the way in which \npolitics is practiced in the United States.\n  We were selected last year, Mr. President--I know this is \nparticularly true with respect to the Presiding Officer--because we \nwere going to do things differently and keep our commitments. We have \ndone so, and we are now frustrated in carrying out the people's will by \nthis action.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6800-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KAY RIORDAN STEUERWALD\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Kay Riordan \nSteuerwald, who passed away earlier this week in Rapid City after a \nlengthy battle with cancer. South Dakota has lost an outstanding \ncitizen.\n  Kay was one of South Dakota's premier leaders in the tourism industry \nfor many years. To her many friends in South Dakota and throughout the \nNation, Kay's name always will be associated with Mount Rushmore. As \npresident of the Mount Rushmore Mountain Co., Inc., Kay ran a first-\nrate, visitor-friendly concession operation at our Nation's shrine to \ndemocracy for 42 years until 1993. She attributed her success to an \nemphasis on good service and reasonable prices.\n  Kay also was a leader on the national level in tourism and national \npark concession circles. In the early 1980's, I recommended Kay's \nappointment to the U.S. Senate National Travel and Tourism Advisory \nCouncil. Through her position on that council and her leadership in \nnumerous other organizations, Kay was an outspoken advocate for the \ntourism industry, which has tremendous economic impact in all States.\n  Kay provided an excellent role model for women seeking to become \nsmall business owners. This is a reflection of her business acumen and \nher adherence to the work ethic. She succeeded as a businesswoman \nduring a period when for many years business was traditionally \nconsidered a man's world. Her first job was in the South Dakota \nTransportation Department in Pierre during the administration of \nDemocratic Gov. Tom Berry in the 1930's. Her career as a business owner \nbegan with her purchase of a coffeeshop and subsequently a hotel in \nMartin, SD. In 1941, she left Martin to become manager of the State \nGame Lodge in Custer State Park. Ten years later, she began operating \nthe concession at Mount Rushmore.\n  Over the years, Kay touched the lives either directly or indirectly \nof literally millions of visitors to Mount Rushmore. Countless \nindividuals have fond memories of a wonderful dinner--topped off by a \npiece of the Mountain Co.'s famous strawberry pie--in the Buffalo \nDining Room gazing out the windows at the priceless view of our four \ngreat Presidents on Mount Rushmore.\n  Kay was very active in many organizations and community activities. \nToo numerous to mention all of them, her civic involvement included the \nNational Park Concessionaires, National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, South Dakota Tourism Advisory Board, National Park \nFoundation, South Dakota Historical Society, American Council of the \nArts, South Dakota Cultural Heritage Center, South Dakota 4-H \nFoundation, and executive board of A Christian Ministry in the National \nParks.\n  Having led a life full of accomplishments, Kay also received numerous \nawards over the years. She was one of the few women ever to be named an \nHonorary Park Ranger by the National Park Service. She was the first \nwoman to receive the South Dakotan of the Year Distinguished Service \nAward from the University of South Dakota and was named South Dakota \nSmall Business Person of the Year by the Small Business Administration \nin 1980. May 5, 1982, was designated as Kay Riordan Day by Gov. Bill \nJanklow. In 1985, Kay received South Dakota's prestigious Ben Black Elk \nAward for Tourism.\n  In addition to her philanthropic contributions to numerous civic \nprojects, Kay also helped many people privately on an individual basis. \nShe frequently took young people under her wings and assisted them with \nfurthering their education or getting started in business. Kay was a \nstrong patron of the arts, particularly for native American artists.\n  Those of us who knew Kay can recall our own special encounters with \nher. I recall Kay's gracious hospitality when my wife, Harriet, and I \nspent our honeymoon in the Black Hills in the early 1980's. Kay always \nmade visitors feel welcome whenever they stopped by her business or her \nsecond-story office with the beautiful view of Mount Rushmore. Many \nlessons can be learned from Kay's perseverance in the business world, \nher strongly held personal convictions, and her courageous struggle \nwith cancer these past few years.\n  South Dakota has lost a true pioneer. In business, in her community, \nand in her heart, Kay was a trailblazer. Harriet and I extend our \nsympathies to her husband, Charlie; her nephew, Jack; and all her \nfamily and friends.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6801-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6801-S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n RECOGNIZING RECIPIENTS OF THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD FROM THE STATE OF \n                                MARYLAND\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today which is \nbeing cosponsored by Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Moynihan of New \nYork, Senator Bryan of Nevada, Senator Brown of Colorado, Senator \nNighthorse Campbell of Colorado, Senator Mack of Florida, Senator \nGraham of Florida, Senator Boxer of California, Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia, and Senator Robb of Virginia.\n  It is legislation that has, frankly, passed this body twice but has \ngotten mired down not because of controversy but because of \njurisdictional problems over in the other body. It is a bill that says \nwe have to do more in the area of research on finding less expensive \nways of converting salt water to fresh water.\n  I do not have a chart here of the world population and water supply, \nI regret to say. I will get that later when we are on the floor for \ndiscussion. But it would be dramatic. We have in the world today \nsomewhere between 5.5 billion and 5.8 billion people. By the middle of \nthe next century, when these pages will be around, in the middle of the \nnext century, we will have around 10 billion people. The world \npopulation is going up like this. Our water supply is not going up. It \nis constant. You do not need to be an Einstein to recognize that we are \nheaded for problems. This is not new.\n  On April 12, 1961, President John F. Kennedy was asked at a press \nconference what would be the great breakthrough he would like to see in \nhis administration. He responded:\n\n       We have made some exceptional scientific advances in the \n     last decade. They are not as spectacular as the man in space \n     or the first Sputnik, but they are important. I have said \n     that I thought that if we could ever competitively, at a \n     cheap rate, get fresh water from salt water, that it would be \n     in the long-range interests of humanity which would really \n     dwarf any other scientific accomplishments. I am hopeful that \n     we will intensify our efforts in that area.\n\n  And for a short time after his Presidency, we were doing some things \nin this area, and then because there is not an immediate problem, \ninterest diminished and research has diminished. Yet, we face some very \nserious problems. We know already about what is happening in \nCalifornia. The interesting thing is that the areas where we have \nsevere water shortages frequently are right at the water's edge. \nCalifornia has problems. I was just reading about Tampa, FL, the other \nday. Virginia Beach, VA, has problems. These are areas right at the \nwater's edge.\n  Our problems, frankly, Mr. President, are very minor compared to the \nproblems in the rest of the world. If we can look at my next chart \nhere, this is what is happening in terms of water shortages versus \nwater scarcity. The nations in blue face water scarcity, and water \nshortage are the nations in red. You will see what is happening very \nclearly. When you talk about water scarcity, you are talking about \nnations where the average water consumption is dramatically less--less \nthan half of what we consume in the United States per person in terms \nof water. They face very severe problems.\n  So those are the figures in blue, going from 7 nations in 1955 to 20 \nnations in 1990, and 34 nations are anticipated to have serious \nproblems by the year 2025.\n  In the Middle East, it is very interesting that you had President \nSadat, who was a giant in this century, saying, ``Egypt will never go \nto war again for land. If we go to war, it will be for water.'' In the \nMiddle East, also, both Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein have \nsaid, ``The potential for conflict in our area is because of water.'' \nThe agreement that has been worked out between Jordan and Israel \nincludes an agreement on water. It is just vital. Mauritania on the \nnorthern coast of Africa, when I was there a few years ago, was growing \n8 percent of their own food. It is a desperately poor country right on \nthe ocean. We do have a process of converting salt water to fresh \nwater, inexpensive enough that we can use it for drinking water. But 85 \npercent of the water that we use is used for industrial and \nagricultural purposes. And it is not inexpensive enough to use for \nthose purposes.\n  Spain is experiencing a drought right now. Spain has a number of \ndesalination plants, but they face major long-term problems. Greece and \nCyprus have a very similar situation. You can go through a whole series \nof countries. The Cape Verde islands are totally dependent on \ndesalination, except for very, very minimal rain fall that they get. \nEgypt, right on the Mediterranean, has a mushrooming population. If the \nPresiding Officer has not had a chance to visit Egypt, I hope he will \none of these years. You see that population in the capital city and you \nknow people have to eat and they have to drink. Egypt is dependent on 2 \npercent of its land. Yet, it is right on the Mediterranean. It \npotentially can be a garden spot. We have to turn that around.\n  Senator Reid joined me, I guess about 3 years ago, on a trip where we \nlooked at some water spots, including the Aral Sea. We looked in \nUzekistan. The Aral Sea was the fourth largest body of water in the \nworld, and the Aral Sea, Mr. Khrushchev was told, ``You can divert some \nof the water for cotton growing and it will eventually get back into \nthe Aral Sea.'' And, in the old Soviet Union, when the boss said, ``Do \nthis,'' it was done. And the water began to recede.\n  Senator Reid and I stood at the banks of the Aral Sea and looked down \n50 or 75 feet to dry land. The dramatic scene there was because \nshipowners--of course, not shipowners, but the people who ran them; \neverything was owned by the Soviet Union--the people who ran the ships \nwere told, ``Just keep your ships there, the water will come back.'' \nThe water did not come back. And you had this dramatic scene of ships \nsitting on dry land, 50 miles from where the water is.\n  It is a powerful thing. We have had headlines about oil shortages and \ngasoline shortages. Let me tell my colleagues, they are minor compared \nto the headlines we are going to have in another decade or two if we do \nnot get ahold of this question of converting salt water to fresh water \nmore inexpensively. What we are asking in this legislation that has now \ntwice passed this body unanimously is that we devote some of our \nresources to this cause. It is extremely important. Water is absolutely \nessential for the survival of humanity.\n  UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, tells us that 35,000 \nchildren worldwide die each day, the majority on the African Continent, \neither from hunger or disease caused either by lack of water or by \ncontaminated water. I wrote to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali \nsome time ago about what I am doing, and he wrote back:\n\n       I am particularly pleased to hear of your interest in water \n     issues and the legislation you are sponsoring on research on \n     less costly desalinization methods. As you rightly point out, \n     such concerns are uppermost in the minds of people in regions \n     where fresh water is scarce, not least in my own part of the \n     world. During my tenure as a Secretary General, I will do my \n     utmost to promote international cooperation regarding this \n     most crucial resource.\n\n  This may seem like something someone from Illinois or Oklahoma should \nnot be that much interested in. It affects all of us. It affects the \nfuture stability of the world, and it affects us even very directly in \nterms of prices. When California does not get enough water, fruits, and \nvegetables from California are going to cost more in Oklahoma and in \nIllinois. But it is much more significant than that. If we do not find \na less expensive way of converting salt water to fresh water, and more \nthan 90 percent of the world's water is salt water, the world is headed \nfor some very, very difficult times. I hope we will pass this \nlegislation and do the responsible thing.\n  I have one more chart here showing what is happening in the United \nStates alone. The United States, again, does not face problems anywhere \nnear as severe as the rest of the world. But you [[Page S6804]] see the \nwater availability is the blue line and you see it going down like \nthis. You see our population going up. It is clearly a problem that the \nUnited States has to face and the world has to face.\n  I am pleased to have bipartisan cosponsorship. I am pleased this body \nhas passed this legislation before. I hope we will do it again, and I \nhope our friends in the House can get the jurisdictional problems \nsolved and we can pass it over there. I believe it is genuinely \nnoncontroversial and is clearly needed by this country and by the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 811\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the South Carolina National Heritage \nCorridor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n       THE SOUTH CAROLINA NATIONAL HERITAGE CORRIDOR ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nHollings, to introduce the South Carolina National Heritage Corridor \nAct of 1995. This legislation would establish a framework to help \nprotect, conserve, and promote the natural, historical, cultural, and \nrecreational resources of the region which have national significance. \nA companion bill, H.R. 1553, was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives on May 3, 1995.\n  Specifically, this legislation would establish a national heritage \ncorridor in South Carolina running from the western Piedmont down along \nthe Savannah Valley toward Augusta, GA, then following the route of the \nold Charleston to Hamburg Railroad along the Ashley River Road to \nCharleston. This route contains 14 South Carolina counties: Oconee, \nPickens, Anderson, Abbeville, Greenwood, McCormick, Edgefield, Aiken, \nBarnwell, Orange- burg, Bamberg, Dorchester, Colleton, and \nCharleston.\n  Further, this measure would establish a 23 member Commission, \nconsisting of county representatives, South Carolina State officials, \nand Federal officials, including the Director of the National Park \nService. It authorizes the Commission to oversee the development and \nimplementation of a corridor management action plan. This plan will \ninventory the resources of the heritage corridor and discuss advisory \nstandards for the use and promotion of those resources. Mr. President, \nlet me emphasize that this legislation protects private property rights \nand will not interfere with local land use ordinances or plans.\n  The legislation requires the active participation of the Secretary of \nthe Interior, who shall appoint Commission members, approve the \ncorridor management action plan, provide assistance to the Commission, \nand report to Congress on the actions taken to carry out the act.\n  Finally, this legislation requires that the Federal cost share \npercentage, including annual operating expenses, may not exceed 50 \npercent. However, non-Federal matching funds may be not only cash, but \nalso services or in-kind contributions.\n  Mr. President, the heritage corridor concept is a technique that has \nbeen used successfully in various parts of our Nation to promote \nhistoric preservation, natural resource protection, tourism, and \neconomic revitalization for both urban and rural areas. Congress, \nrecognizing that heritage corridors provide a flexible framework for \ngovernmental and private organizations to work together on a \ncoordinated regional basis, has recognized and formally designated \nnumerous heritage corridor areas throughout the Nation. Many more are \nin various stages of planning or development.\n  The initiative to develop the South Carolina National Heritage \nCorridor is an outgrowth of a grassroots effort in my home State to \npromote the history, culture, natural resources, and economy of the \nregion. County visitor councils, historical societies, and other \nprivate and government entities are now participating in this project.\n  The corridor project was awarded a Federal grant for a demonstration \nproject linking cultural and economic development. Another grant has \nbeen awarded to conduct a feasibility study and plan for the \ndevelopment and management of the corridor. That work is well underway \nand will be completed this year.\n  As a result of those planning efforts, the corridor project has \nconducted a thorough asset inventory and is exploring management and \nmarketing alternatives. The enactment of this legislation, to provide \nfor national recognition, will permit the heritage corridor project to \nbroaden its efforts to preserve and promote the resources of the \ncorridor and to expand tourism and economic development in the region.\n  Mr. President, I would like to describe some of the historic, \ncultural, and natural resources and sites of national significance \nwhich are contained in the South Carolina National Heritage Corridor. \nLet me begin by referencing correspondence between Dr. Rodger E. Stroup \nof the South Carolina State Museum and Ms. Joan Davis of the South \nCarolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism. In his letter, \nDr. Stroup describes the path of the corridor, noting many specific \nsites and areas of national significance. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of Dr. Stroup's correspondence be printed in the Record \nfollowing these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. In many respects, the heritage corridor forms a \nmicrocosm of the lower South and its history. In the upper region of \nthe corridor, during the 1750's and 1760's, settlers and migrants came \nin search of rich lands. This area became a center of cotton and \nagricultural production. As westward lands opened up for settlement, it \nwas a major jumping off point for migration during the antebellum \nyears.\n  Significant events in the industrial and transportation history of \nthe South took place in the corridor. Graniteville was the birthplace \nof the southern textile industry. It is the site of the first large-\nscale cotton mill in the South, built in 1845. This became one of the \nmost important manufacturing centers in the pre-Civil-War South, a \nmodel for the textile industry. Located on one of the South's major \ncotton routes, it remains a textile center today. To accommodate the \nwestward moving cotton crop, South Carolina [[Page S6806]] merchants \nbuilt the Charleston to Hamburg railroad, the longest railroad in the \nNation in 1832. The corridor also contains precious natural resources. \nThe Francis Beidler Forest contains the largest remaining virgin stand \nof bald cyprus and tupelo trees in the world. Additionally, the \nCathedral Bay Heritage Wildlife Preserve contains unique geological \nfeatures known as the Carolina Bays. These oval depressions in the \nearth, the origin of which remains a mystery, hold black water lakes. \nThe significant riverine and estuarine systems of the ACE Basin form an \necologically diverse area which contains rare plants and serves as a \nwildlife and waterfowl habitat.\n  Finally, Mr. President, located within the corridor are numerous \nhistorical sites and national historic landmarks. For example, \nMiddleton Place, on the banks of the Ashley River is an 18th century \nplantation and the site of America's oldest landscaped gardens. It has \nsurvived revolution, civil war, and natural disasters. It was home to \nHenry Middleton, President of the Continental Congress and his son, \nArthur, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Battlefields of \nboth the Revolutionary War and of the Civil War are located in the \ncorridor. Of great historical significance is the Burt-Stark House in \nAbbeville. At this site, less than a month after General Lee's \nsurrender at Appomattox, the President of the Confederate States of \nAmerica, Jefferson Davis, counseled with his generals on the conduct of \nthe war. A decision was reached at this meeting to disband the Armies \nof the Confederacy.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the richness of this \ncorridor. The corridor has much more to offer; much that reminds us of \nwhere we have been as a nation and where we are today. These and other \nattractions are representative of the merging of several cultures along \nthe corridor--African, Caribbean, European, and native American. This \nlegislation will assist the communities throughout the heritage \ncorridor who are committed to the conservation and development of these \nassets.\n  Mr. President, the effort to establish a heritage corridor in South \nCarolina has broad support. The Governor of South Carolina, David \nBeasley, supports this endeavor. Various State agencies are working on \nthis project, continuing the efforts which began under the direction of \nour former Governor, Carroll Campbell.

Mr. President, I am privileged today to join with \nSenator Thurmond in introducing the South Carolina National Heritage \nCorridor Act of 1995. This act aims to protect, restore, and promote \nthe South Carolina National Historic Corridor--a 200-mile-long, 14 \ncounty swath in the western part of the State, running along the \nSavannah River Valley from the foothills of the Piedmont to North \nAugusta, at which point it follows the route of the old Hamburg-to-\nCharleston railroad all the way to Charleston.\n  This act has several objectives. It would protect the significant \nland and water resources of the national heritage corridor. It would \nsupport, through financial and technical assistance, the State and \nlocal governments, as well as the private sector, in developing a \nmanagement action plan for the corridor. And it would create a \nmanagement framework to bring together the State and local governments \nto jointly develop policies and programs to conserve and enhance the \ncultural, natural, economic, recreational, and scenic resources of the \ncorridor.\n  Mr. President, the historic corridor concept has been used by a \nvariety of public and private groups across the Nation to encourage \nhistoric and natural preservation, and to promote tourism and economic \nrevitalization. The approach has been used successfully in the \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts, in the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the \nLackawanna River Valley in Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. The heritage \ncorridor concept offers a flexible way for government and private \norganizations to work together to promote economic growth and job \ncreation.\n  Mr. President, with industry concentrated in a limited number of \nurban areas, it is no secret that small, scenic, towns, and rural areas \nare looking to tourism as a means of strengthening and diversifying \ntheir declining economies. The heritage corridor concept offers an \nopportunity for many communities to work cooperatively and pool their \nresources in order to boost tourism.\n  The South Carolina Heritage Corridor originated with a tourism \ncommittee in the city of Abbeville, SC, and has grown to include 14 \ncounties and over 40 towns and rural communities. This is a grassroots \nmovement that has captured the imagination and enthusiasm of citizens \nacross the western part of my State. The South Carolina Heritage \nCorridor is well conceived and holds tremendous promise for my State. I \nurge my colleagues' support for this important bill.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  South Carolina State Museum,\n\n                                                     Columbia, SC.\n     Joan Davis,\n     Community Development Division, S.C. Dept. of Parks, \n         Recreation and Tourism, Columbia, SC.\n       Dear Joan: I am intrigued with the concept of developing a \n     Heritage Corridor in fourteen counties along South Carolina's \n     western boundary. Stretching from Charleston to the mountains \n     the proposed corridor would take in all of the elements that \n     have characterized South Carolina for the past three \n     centuries.\n       Beginning in Charleston, one of the most cosmopolitan of \n     American cities before 1860, the corridor follows the route \n     of the old South Carolina Railroad through Colleton, Bamberg, \n     Barnwell and into Aiken County. When completed in 1831 this \n     was the longest railroad in the world. Prior to the civil War \n     this area was dotted with cotton plantations, the predominant \n     economic factor in the state's antebellum years. In Aiken's \n     Horsecreek Valley the state's textile industry was born \n     during the 1830's. Only a few miles away the Savannah River \n     Site was the nation's supplier of plutonium for nuclear \n     weapons during the Cold War years. From North August, the \n     terminus of the old South Carolina Railroad, the proposed \n     corridor follows the Savannah Valley to the foothills in \n     Oconee County.\n       Also a major cotton producing area before 1860, Edgefield \n     County was home to ten governors, a remarkable number for a \n     small county. Beginning in the 1820's the production of \n     alkaline glazed stoneware began in Edgefield and subsequently \n     spread throughout the South. Originally produced as \n     utilitarian storage ware, today Edgefield pottery is a highly \n     prized collectible.\n       The corridor continues along the Savannah Valley through \n     once prosperous cotton fields into Anderson County, a major \n     center of the state's textile industry. Around Anderson one \n     finds both traditional textile companies as well as a recent \n     influx of major multinational corporations.\n       The last section of the corridor takes one to the foothills \n     of the Appalachian Mountains. A journey through the proposed \n     corridor encompasses all of South Carolina's past and \n     present. From\n      cosmopolitan Charleston in the 1700's with its wealthy \n     merchants and rice planters to the challenges facing low \n     income residents of the Appalachians, the corridor crosses \n     not only the state's entire geography, but also \n     encompasses all of the state's peoples.\n       Historic sites, natural resources, cultural diversity and \n     modern manufacturing successes are all part of the proposed \n     corridor. A visitor who journeys through the corridor \n     certainly departs with an understanding of South Carolina's \n     history and development, as well as an appreciation for the \n     state's diverse geography and natural features.\n       This proposed corridor has several components of national \n     significance. As the cotton culture spread through this area \n     more and more planters became entrenched in defending \n     slavery, contributing to the forces that lead to the Civil \n     War. Leading proslavery advocates John C. Calhoun and James \n     Henry Hammond lived in the corridor. As residences of the \n     area their theories on states rights and slavery evolved from \n     personal experiences.\n       After the war the development of the textile industry in \n     the corridor changed the focus of South Carolina's economy \n     from an agricultural to an industrial base, a phenomena which \n     subsequently spread across the South. Finally, the location \n     of the Savannah River Site in the center of the corridor \n     reflects not only the Cold War strategy of the United States, \n     but also the challenge of the cleanup facing all the nuclear \n     production facilities across the country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Rodger E. Stroup, Ph.D.,\n     Director of Collections and Interpretation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                        Office of the Governor\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, April 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Developing the economies of the rural areas \n     of our state requires that we employ creative non-traditional \n     economic development methods. One such method is the \n     application of a deliberate strategy to capitalize on the \n     economic value of the rich cultural heritage and natural \n     resources embodied in many of the rural areas of our state. \n     Cultural or heritage tourism is one of the fastest growing \n     trends in tourism. The resulting potential for job creation \n     and tourism-related investment, if properly managed, can be a \n     significant factor in the economic growth of these rural \n     communities.\n       The proposed designation of a fourteen county region of our \n     state as a South Carolina National Heritage Corridor \n     represents a significant step forward in our efforts to \n     recognize and capture this valuable economic resource. This \n     is an area rich in cultural and natural resources with an \n     important American story to tell. What happened along this \n     corridor set in motion a style of socio-economic development \n     that spread throughout the lower South and Southwest and \n     eventually led to the industrialization of the region as well \n     as war between the states. It tells the story of the \n     development of agriculture, industry and transportation in \n     the South.\n       The direct effort from the state level, I have designated \n     the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism through its \n     Community Development program, to be responsible for staffing \n     this effort and providing a broad array of support for the \n     South Carolina Heritage Corridor.\n       We all recognize the tremendous importance and long-range \n     benefit of the initiative for South Carolina, and are \n     particularly pleased that the proposed area includes your \n     hometown of Edgefield.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David M. Beasley,\n                                                         Governor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 813. A bill to amend the Pennsylvania Avenue Development \nCorporation Act of 1972 to authorize appropriations for implementation \nof the development plan for Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and \nthe White House, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n     the pennsylvania avenue development corporation amendment act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I introduced a bill, at the \nrequest of the [[Page S6810]] administration, to amend the Pennsylvania \nAvenue Development Corporation Act of 1972, to authorize appropriations \nfor implementation of the development plan for Pennsylvania Avenue \nbetween the Capitol and the White House, and for other purposes.\n  The bill, when enacted, would authorize appropriations for salaries \nand expenses for the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation [PADC] \nfor fiscal years 1996 and 1997. PADC is the agency which is responsible \nfor the revitalization of the Pennsylvania area between the White House \nand the Capitol. Since PADC was created by an act of Congress in 1972, \nit has achieved notable success in transforming America's Main Street \nfrom ``a scene of desolation,'' in the words of a Presidential \ncommission formed in the late 1960's to study the condition of the \navenue, to a great boulevard worthy of its role in the Nation's history \nand its place in the center of the Nation's Capital City.\n  PADC is a successful example of how Government can work in \npartnership with the private sector to achieve beneficial results for \nboth. Since PADC's work began, it has spent $120 million in \nappropriations to build new parks, plazas, sidewalks, and other kinds \nof improvements to the public areas and attracted over $1.5 billion in \nprivate investment to the blocks on the north side of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. From the Willard Hotel to the Canadian Embassy, virtually every \none of the buildings that one sees in walking or driving down the \navenue from the Treasury Building to the Capitol has been constructed \nor restored since PADC began its block development program in 1978, \nguided by a master plan approved by Congress in 1975. Now over 20 \nprivately funded office, retail, hotel, and residential structures \nborder a public thoroughfare improved with seven parks and plazas and \nwidened sidewalks.\n  With only a few blocks remaining uncommitted for development, PADC is \nclose to finishing its master plan and is scheduled to terminate \noperation at the end of fiscal year 1997. The bill I am introducing, by \nrequest of the administration, will allow the PADC's 27-person staff to \ncomplete its original mission to economically revitalize and beautify \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n\n                                      Development Corporation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill, ``To amend \n     the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972 \n     to authorize appropriations for implementation of the \n     development plan for Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol \n     and the White House, and for other purposes.'' A similar \n     package has been transmitted to the Speaker of the House.\n       The draft bill would amend the Pennsylvania Avenue \n     Development Corporation Act of 1972 (86 Stat. 1266, 40 U.S.C. \n     871, as amended) to authorize appropriations of $3,043,000 \n     for fiscal year 1996 and such sums as may be necessary for \n     fiscal year 1997 for the operating and administrative \n     expenses of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\n       The draft bill is part of the Pennsylvania Avenue \n     Development Corporation's legislative program for the 104th \n     Congress. The Administration recommends the draft bill be \n     introduced, referred to the appropriate committee for \n     consideration, and enacted.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this legislation for \n     consideration of Congress, and that enactment of the \n     legislation would be in accord with the program of the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard A. Hauser,\n                                                 Chairman.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 814. A bill to provide for the reorganization of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n            the bureau of indian affairs reorganization act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to reorganize and restructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nI am very pleased to be joined by Senators Inouye and Domenici as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. This legislation is intended \nto stimulate discussion in the Congress and among the tribes on the \nreorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Since 1834, the Congress, the administration, and the American Indian \npeople have tried to reorganize and reform the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. Like the crusades of history, with each change in \nadministration the assembled bureaucrats have gone charging off in one \ndirection or another, commissioning studies or writing reports on the \nBIA, downsizing, centralizing, or decentralizing, whatever the \npolitical whim of the day dictated. From the Meriam Report in 1929 to \nthe joint tribal/BIA/DOI reorganization task force report, the Congress \nhas commissioned report after report on how to reform the way this \nNation deals with native Americans and their governments. Since the \nestablishment of the BIA in 1824, there have been over 1,050 \ninvestigations, reports, commissions, and studies detailing how the BIA \nshould be restructured, reorganized, or reformed. To measure the \nsuccess of all of these efforts, one needs only to look at the \nstatistics in the most recent census.\n  Nearly one of every three native Americans in this Nation is living \nin poverty. One-half of the families living on reservations are living \nin poverty. One-half of the Indian children under the age of six living \non reservations are living in poverty. Unemployment on Indian \nreservations exceeds 25 percent. For every $100 earned by U.S. \nfamilies, Indian families earn $62. The per capital income for an \nIndian living on the reservation is $4,478. There are approximately \n90,000 Indian families who are homeless or underhoused. Nearly one in \nfive Indian families living on the reservation are classified as \nseverely overcrowded. One out of every five Indian homes lack complete \nplumbing facilities. These simple conveniences, that the rest of us \ntake for granted, remain out of the grasp of many Indian families.\n  Since its creation in 1824, native Americans have relied on the \nBureau of Indian Affairs as the principle agency of the Federal \nGovernment which is responsible for meeting this Nation's trust \nresponsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. And yet based on \nits own studies and investigations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has \nfailed miserably in carrying out this Nation's solemn obligations to \nAmerican Indians. If the health, social, and economic conditions on \nIndian reservations are the measure of our performance as the trustee \nfor American Indians, then as a nation we have failed miserably.\n  It is time to change the way this Nation deals with American Indians. \nIt is time to bring an end to the long and dismal history of the \nfailures of the Federal Government to carry out its trust \nresponsibilities to American Indians. It is time to break down the \nbarriers to true tribal self-governance and self-determination by \nproviding Indian tribes with the authority to design both the structure \nand function of its trustee, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I remain \nconvinced that we will not make significant improvements in the living \nconditions on most reservations without a major reform of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation which will provide Indian tribes \nwith the authority to reorganize and restructure the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs at each level of the government. It provides Indian tribes with \nthe ability to tailor the Bureau of Indian Affairs to meet their unique \ncircumstances and needs. It will allow tribes to shape and redefine the \ntrust relationship with the Federal Government.\n  This legislation is the culmination of over 4 years of work by Indian \ntribes, the administration, and the Congress. This bill reflects the \nrecommendations of the joint tribal/BIA/DOI reorganization task force, \nwhich was established at the direction of former Interior Secretary \nLujan. Over the course of 4 years, the task force held 22 meetings \nacross all parts of Indian country to develop their recommendations for \nthe reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. These \nrecommendations fall into four general categories: Organizational \nreform, regulatory reform, education reform, and budget reform. The \nguiding principles established by the joint tribal/BIA/DOI \nreorganization task force are to decentralize decisionmaking of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, to provide maximum funding to Indian tribes \nfor service delivery, to maintain [[Page S6811]] the flexibility of the \narea/agency organizational design, to establish well-defined Federal \nand tribal roles at all levels of the bureaucracy, and to create a \ntribal-Federal consultation process to govern all aspects of the \nreorganization.\n  The legislation I am introducing closely adheres to the spirit and \nintent of the report of the joint tribal/BIA/DOI reorganization task \nforce. This bill will provide for the reorganization of the BIA at the \nagency, area and central offices with savings attendant to such \nreorganization to be allocated to the tribes. It will provide for the \ntransfer or delegation of decisionmaking authority to the tribe or the \nagency level of the BIA, consistent with the principles of self-\ngovernance and self-determination. The bill provides the authority to \nIndian tribes to develop, in negotiations with the Interior Department, \nreorganization plans for the area and agency offices of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. These plans may include a reorganization of BIA \norganizational structures, reallocation of personnel, delegations of \nsecretarial authority, transfers of functions, waivers of regulations \nor other authorities, reordering of funding priorities, and the \ntransfer of any savings realized by such reorganization directly to the \ntribes.\n  The bill also provides for the reorganization of the central office \nof the BIA so that Indian tribes from each area office can determine \nhow the central office resources used to provide services to their area \nshould be allocated. Tribes in each area of the BIA will be able to \ndetermine what services will be provided by the central office, what \nfunds and authorities should be distributed or delegated to the area \nand agency offices and what funds and authorities should be distributed \nor delegated to the tribes themselves. Finally, the bill will require \nthe Secretary to repeal the provisions of the BIA manual. Any provision \nof the BIA manual which are deemed necessary will have to be \npromulgated as regulations subject to review and comment. The bill will \nalso provide for the establishment of a tribal task force to recommend \nregulatory reforms in title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n  The introduction of this legislation marks only the first step in \ncarrying out the commitment made to Indian tribes when the joint \ntribal/BIA/DOI reorganization task force was first chartered. I remain \ncommitted to work with Indian tribes and the administration to realize \nthe vision of those tribal leaders who met for hundreds of hours in \ndeveloping recommendations to bring real and necessary change to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. I look forward to full and complete \ndiscussions with tribal leaders on this legislation and I urge all of \nour colleagues to join with us to ensure prompt enactment of \nlegislation to reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the accompanying section-by-section analysis appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Additional Conforming Amendments\n\n       Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary to prepare and \n     submit to the Congress, after consultation with the tribes, \n     the Committees of jurisdiction in the Congress, and the OMB, \n     recommended legislation containing technical and conforming \n     amendments to reflect changes made pursuant to this title.\n       Subsection (b) requires the Secretary to submit such \n     legislation to the Congress within 120 days of enactment of \n     this title.\n\n\n              Section 106. Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       Section 106 authorizes such sums as may be necessary to \n     carry out this title to be appropriated.\n\n\n                      Section 107. Effective Date\n\n       Section 107 states that this title shall take effect on the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n                       Section 108. Separability\n\n       Section 108 provides that if a provision of this title or \n     its application is held invalid, neither the remainder of \n     this title nor the application of the provision to other \n     persons or circumstances shall be affected.\n\n\n       Section 109. Suspension of Certain Administrative Actions\n\n       Section 109 provides that during the 2 year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment the Secretary shall \n     suspend the implementation of all administrative activities \n     associated with reinventing government, the national \n     performance review and other downsizing initiatives affecting \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It also states that during this \n     2 year period the reorganization compacts entered into under \n     this title shall be deemed to satisfy the goals of \n     reinventing government, the national performance review and \n     other downsizing initiatives.\n\n\n                  Section 110. Statutory Construction\n\n       Section 110 provides that nothing in this title may be \n     construed to alter or diminish the Federal trust \n     responsibility to Indian tribes, individual Indians, or \n     Indians with trust allotments.\n\n        Title II--Amendment to the Indian Self-Determination Act\n\n\n                    Section 201. Budget Development\n\n       Section 201 amends the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 450f et seq.) by adding\n      the following new title:\n                      Title V--Budget development\n\n\n   section 501. participation of indian tribes in the development of \n                            budget requests\n\n       Subsection (a) of this section requires, within 120 days \n     after enactment, the Secretary to establish a program to \n     provide information to Indian tribes concerning the \n     development of budget requests for the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and to ensure that each Indian tribe participates to \n     the maximum extent practicable in the development of the \n     budget request for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n       Subsection (b) of this section requires, within 120 days \n     after enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to establish a program to provide information to Indian \n     tribes concerning the development of budget for the Indian \n     Health Service and to ensure that each Indian tribe \n     participates to the maximum extent practicable in the \n     development of the budget request for the Indian Health \n     Service.\n       Subsection (c) of this section requires programs to the \n     maximum extent practicable to develop an estimation of funds \n     annually authorized to be appropriated for the benefit of \n     Indian tribes, develop an estimation of individual tribal \n     shares of the funds to be provided for the benefit of the \n     Indian tribe, and to provide each tribe with an opportunity \n     to establish individual tribal funding priorities. The \n     program shall also collect and disseminate information \n     necessary for effective planning and evaluation relating to \n     the comparative social and public health conditions of Indian \n     communities at the local, regional, and national levels.\n       Paragraph (2) of this subsection requires the Secretary of \n     the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     to support the creation of stable recurring base funding for \n     each Indian tribe, to maintain stability in the planning and \n     allocation of the IHS and BIA budgets to Indian tribes, to \n     assess the Federal programs of assistance to Indian tribes to \n     determine the relative need for providing Federal funds to \n     carry out each such program and determine the amount of \n     recurring base funding available to each Indian tribe to \n     carry out each such program.\n       Paragraph (3) of this subsection authorizes the Secretary \n     of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to enter into self-determination contracts, self-\n     governance compacts or make a grant to an Indian tribe to \n     carry out the information collection and dissemination \n     functions under this title.\n\n\n                  section 502. assessment methodology\n       Subsection (a) of this section requires the Secretary of \n     the Interior within 180 days of enactment to promulgate \n     standardized assessment methodologies to be used in carrying \n     out any budget determination for the BIA concerning levels of \n     funding that are necessary for each program area.\n       Subsection (b) of this section requires the Secretary to \n     ensure the direct and active participation of Indian tribes \n     at the local, regional and national levels in the negotiated \n     rulemaking process established under this section.\n       Subsection (c) of this section provides that the negotiated \n     rulemaking committee created under this section shall be \n     comprised of individuals who represent the Federal government \n     and individuals who represent Indian tribes. A majority of \n     the Committee shall be comprised of individuals who represent \n     Indian tribes.\n       Subsection (d) of this section authorizes the Secretary to \n     adapt the negotiated rulemaking procedures in accordance with \n     section 407 of this Act.\n\n\n                  Section 503. Reports to the Congress\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that the Secretary shall annually \n     prepare a report that describes the standardized \n     methodologies and includes an assessment of the level of \n     funding that is necessary to fund each program area of the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs. This report shall include an \n     assessment for each Indian tribe of the level funding \n     necessary for each Indian tribe to carry out each program \n     area and an assessment of the total amount of funds needed to \n     carry out all the programs areas with respect to which the \n     tribe receives services.\n\n\n              Section 504. Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       This section authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary to carry out this title.\n\n  Title III--Reform of the Regulations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs\n\n\n                        Section 301. BIA Manual\n\n       Section 301 requires the Secretary not later than 180 days \n     after enactment to conduct a review of all the provisions of \n     the BIA manual and to promulgate as proposed regulations \n     those provisions of the BIA manual that are deemed necessary \n     and to revoke all provisions of the BIA manual that are not \n     promulgated as proposed regulations. In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall consult with Indian tribes to \n     the maximum extent practicable.\n                        section 302. task force\n\n       Section 302 provides for the establishment of a Joint \n     Tribal-Federal task force on regulatory reform. The task \n     force shall be composed of 16 members, including 12 members \n     who are representatives of Indian tribes from each of the 12 \n     areas served by the BIA. The task force shall review the \n     regulations under Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations \n     and make recommendations concerning revision of the \n     regulations. The task force shall submit reports to the \n     Secretary as is deemed appropriate and shall not later than \n     120 days after its initial meeting submit a report to the \n     Congress and the governing body of each Indian tribe that \n     includes their findings and recommendations after reviewing \n     Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The task force \n     shall terminate 30 days after the date on which the task \n     force submits its report to the Congress. This \n     section also prohibits the Secretary from \n     promulgating any un- published regulation or \n     agency guidance that affects Indian tribes and from imposing \n     any nonregulatory requirement that affects Indian tribes.\n\n\n              Section 303. Authorization of Appropriations\n\n       Section 303 authorizes to be appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary to carry out this title.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join my esteemed colleague, the \nchairman [[Page S6817]] of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \nJohn McCain, in the sponsorship of a measure that is intended to \ninitiate discussion in the Senate of the means by which the \nreorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs is to be accomplished.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that there is some concern amongst my \ncolleagues that they have not sufficient time to review this measure \nprior to its introduction, and I want to assure these members that I \ntoo have questions about the mechanics of the proposed reorganization \nprocess, as well as the scope of the proposed reorganization--but I \nbelieve that it is important that we begin somewhere--and that we have \na legislative vehicle that will engender discussion and consideration \nof the specifies or reorganization.\n  For instance, it will be important, I believe, that reorganization at \nthe agency, area and central offices proceed in some orderly fasion--\ngiven the interdependency of the functions and responsibilities of each \nof these offices.\n  In the absence of some order--reorganization of agency offices prior \nto reorganization of area offices culminating in the reorganization of \nthe central office, for instance, as one possible means--there will \nundoubtedly be a predictable chaos if reorganization plans and compacts \nthat have significant impacts on other organizational units are \nattempted to be implemented--all at the same time.\n  Mr. President, I am also aware of the concern expressed by some \nmembers as to what impact the proposed reorganization may have on the \nBureau's responsibilities in the areas of education, tribal justice \nsystems, and other centrally administered programs.\n  But I believe that this discussion draft will, at a minimum, provide \nus with a framework for addressing these concerns, and I look forward \nto working with the chairman of the committee--our colleagues on the \nIndian Affairs Committee and the leaders of indian country--to refine \nthis discussion draft into an effective instrument for the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the joint Department of \nInterior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and tribal task force on the \nreorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join \nChairman McCain of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in sponsoring \nlegislation to bring about many needed changes to the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs [BIA] of the U.S. Department of the Interior. It is a special \nhonor for me to endorse the fine work of Wendell Chino, president of \nthe Mescalero Apache Tribe of New Mexico. He has worked for decades to \nchange the BIA. More recently, President Chino has focused his fine \nefforts through the BIA Reorganization Task Force for the last 4 years. \nAs the elder statesman of Indian leaders, President Wendell Chino's \nincisive and powerful voice has been heard about the continuing \nproblems in the BIA. We are pleased to introduce legislation to help \nbring these recommendations to fruition.\n  Wendell has long been a vociferous and humorous critic of the \ninfamous BIA. Wendell tells me that humor is necessary when you really \nwant to cry. We have a special trust relationship with Indians in \nAmerica, but far too often this trust has been neglected by a \ncumbersome bureaucracy.\n  As cosponsor of Chairman McCain's excellent effort to launch an \nimportant debate, I am aligning myself with those who view the BIA as a \ndetriment rather than a benefit to Indian people. I have spoken several \ntimes in Senate Budget and Indian Affairs Committee meetings this year \nabout the need to meet our special trust and treaty obligations to the \nIndian people.\n  As a proponent of the largest budget reductions ever presented in the \nhistory of the Senate, I have maintained the need to keep our promises \nto the Indian people. This is not only good for Indians, it is good for \nAmerica to know that her word is meaningful and can be relied upon.\n  When the Congress passes legislation and the President signs it, \nAmericans should be able to know that they have been well represented \nand action will follow that is in line with the promises. \nUnfortunately, America's history has not been so sterling when it comes \nto its promises to Indian people. There are books, movies, and \ntestimony to the many tragedies in our history with Indian people.\n  There have been some improvements in this century, but the violations \ncontinue. For example, as recently as 1962, the Congress and the \nPresident, in Public Law 87-483, promised to provide an irrigation \nsystem to the Navajo Tribe in exchange for water rights in the San Juan \nChama water diversion project. The Navajos have kept their agreement \nabout water rights, but the Federal Government is 20 years behind \nschedule in building the promised irrigation system.\n  I will not take the time to review other incidents here, I just want \nmy colleagues to know that we are aware of the promises, and that we \nshould do our part in promoting character counts in our own legislative \nactivity. I believe the bill we are introducing today is in line with \nthis goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the leading themes of \nthe executive summary of the joint tribal/BIA/Department of Interior \nadvisory task force on the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, August 1994, in the Record. This is for the benefit of my \ncolleagues who may want to look at the parameters of the fine work of \nthis task force, upon which Chairman McCain has based our legislative \neffort. I refer my colleagues to Chairman McCain's statement for a \nfurther explanation of the purposes of this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to review this exciting new thrust for the BIA.\n  On a closing note, I would like to add that my own bill, S. 346, \ncosponsored by Senator Daniel Inouye of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs, is not included in the bill we are introducing today. It is my \nintention to offer S. 346, a bill to establish an Office of Indian \nWomen and Families in the BIA, as an amendment during committee markup \nof this legislation. For the benefit of my colleagues, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my ``Dear Colleague'' letter of February 22, 1995, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge \nthe fine work of a former New Mexico Congressman who became Secretary \nof the Interior, Manuel Lujan. It was Secretary Lujan who appointed \nWendell Chino and Eddie Brown as cochairs of the BIA reorganization \ntask force.\n  It is my pleasure to join Senator McCain in introducing this bill. It \nis an honest and good effort to reform, in significant and positive \nway, our trust relationship with the American Indian people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 22, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: As we consider better ways to meet our \n     treaty and statutory obligations to the Indian people of \n     America through an improved Bureau of Indian Affairs, I would \n     like you to keep Indian women and youth in mind. It is my \n     belief that they are too often ignored in the Washington-\n     based policy decisions that can have a most direct impact on \n     their daily lives.\n       I am asking my Senate Colleagues to join me and the Vice \n     Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \n     Daniel K. Inouye, in sponsoring legislation to establish an \n     Office of Indian Women and Families in the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior.\n       Indian women are most often at the very bottom of the \n     economic ladder in America. They are the poorest of the poor. \n     While the tide of public opinion is against adding virtually \n     any new federal government employees, I believe it is time to \n     directly address the concerns and problems of Indian women in \n     the agency that is most responsible for their well-being.\n       In January of 1994, I held hearings in Window Rock, Arizona \n     and in Rio Grande Pueblo country in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n     Hundreds of women and tribal leaders expressed their support \n     for enacting this legislation. In the 103rd Congress, Senator \n     McCain worked very hard to bring the problems of Indian child \n     abuse to light. Many abusers were their BIA teachers.\n       Ramah Navajo District Judge Irene Toledo testified in \n     Window Rock that ``we do have a lot of children falling \n     through the cracks.'' Elsie Redbird told us, ``While American \n     women come up against a `glass ceiling,' Indian women have \n     problems getting off the floor.''\n       There are problems with gang violence, teen pregnancies and \n     AIDS. Child care, domestic violence, poor housing conditions, \n     and minimal economic opportunity are continuous problems on \n     our nation's Indian reservations.\n       How would this new Office of Indian Women and Families help \n     resolve these problems? The monitoring of participation rates \n     and beneficial outcomes for Indian women [[Page S6818]] and \n     children in on-going programs of the BIA and other federal \n     departments and agencies would be a critical first step.\n       Job opportunities outside the domestic or clerical levels \n     are too rare for Indian women. Yet the BIA and the U.S. \n     Department of Labor have little precise and current \n     information about the unemployment or underemployment \n     problems of Indian women.\n       Obviously, an Office of Indian Women and Families could not \n     be expected to move on all fronts at once. In fact, our bill \n     gives jobs and business development opportunities for Indian \n     women the first priority. Without such a permanent office to \n     advocate program and policy changes for them, I am afraid one \n     of our most precious and yet most neglected federal \n     responsibilities will continue to be a national shame.\n       Indian women and their families have little choice but to \n     live at the mercy of some of the most perplexing bureaucratic \n     mazes in our federal government. I believe this group of \n     American Indians would benefit by a more systematic \n     monitoring of their lifestyle problems, a more consistent \n     effort on our part to improve their lives, and a more \n     interactive approach that includes their active participation \n     in resolving their own concerns.\n       I hope you will join in cosponsoring S. 346, a bill to \n     establish an Office of Indian Women and Families in the \n     Department of Interior. Joe Trujillo of my staff can be \n     reached at 224-7086 if you have further comments or \n     questions. Thank you for your interest in American Indian \n     women and their families.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Leading Themes of Reorganization\n\n       Tribes recognized that simply changing the organizational \n     structure of the BIA would not result in a change in how well \n     it could deliver on its responsibility. All aspects of the \n     organization, systems and processes utilized by the BIA were \n     reviewed. The BIA's mission needed to be clearly defined to \n     guide its future directions. Four leading themes emerged \n     early, and the Task Force organized its efforts around them:\n       Organization Reform: The organizational levels and \n     functions needed to be clearly defined as to appropriate \n     roles, with the operational roles moved as close as possible \n     to where services were to be delivered. Accordingly, roles \n     were recommended for Central Office, Areas and Agencies. \n     Keeping in mind the differences between Areas, the Task Force \n     recognized that the Tribes in each Area and Agency needed to \n     be involved in the redesign of these organizations to meet \n     their respective needs. Too much of the overall resources of \n     the BIA were being dedicated to Central Office and Area \n     functions. Tribes felt that these resources could be better \n     utilized at the Tribe/Agency/school service delivery level.\n       Regulatory Reform: The authority by which BIA decisions \n     were made had been eroded at the levels nearest Tribes. The \n     Task Force recognized that laws, regulations and internal BIA \n     policies needed to change to return decision making to the \n     BIA organizational units closest to the client. In addition, \n     many inherent Tribal authorities had been usurped. Laws, \n     regulations and policies needed to be reviewed to remove \n     obstacles to Tribes freely exercising authorities for \n     decisions which were inherently Tribal.\n       Education Reform: The Task Force strongly felt that \n     emphasis needed to be placed on education for the following \n     reasons: (1) The failure to fully implement all provisions of \n     P.L. 95-561. (2) The indefinite organizational status of \n     education functions within the Bureau. (3) An assessment of \n     the current level of education services within the Bureau. It \n     was determined that a comprehensive plan was necessary to \n     ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness in education.\n       Budget Reform: The processes of planning, budgeting and \n     reporting on budget needs were in serious need of reform. \n     Throughout the first 20 years of implementation of the Self-\n     Determination policy, Tribal participation in decisions \n     regarding the designs of programs and the priorities for \n     funding them had actually been diminished. Tribes felt that \n     their needs were consistently understated or not reported to \n     Congress at all. Though they had assumed management of about \n     half of the budget resources under various Self-Determination \n     Act awards, the BIA and others in the Federal government \n     seemed to retain full control, and frequently disrupted the \n     maintenance of funding and services. A new system of \n     planning, budgeting and needs assessment was needed, and it \n     needed to be based on the Federal policies of Indian Self-\n     Determination and of dealing with Tribes on a government-to-\n     government basis.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 815. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \nthe assessment and collection of the excise tax on arrows; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n          Simplification of Imposition of Excise Tax On Arrows\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould simplify the Internal Revenue Code regarding the imposition of \nthe Federal excise tax on arrows.\n  Mr. President, this bill will benefit manufacturers, wholesalers, \nretailers, assemblers, and, most importantly, the consumers of archery \nequipment. In 1993, there were nearly 3 million licensed bow and arrow \nhunters in the United States, including 28,000 in my home State of \nUtah. These figures exclude the millions of individuals who enjoy \narchery as a hobby but do not hunt with a bow and arrows. Let me \nexplain both the present status of this excise tax and why \nsimplification is needed.\n  Under section 4161(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an excise tax of \n11 percent is imposed upon the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or \nimporter of an arrow or an arrow's component parts and accessories. A \ncomplete arrow consists of various component parts, namely: a shaft, a \npoint, a nock, and a vane. The arrow shaft is sold separately from the \npoint, nock, and vane, which are attached to the shaft to make a \ncomplete arrow. The assembly of these parts into a finished arrow may \ntake place at a wholesale manufacturing level, a distribution level, a \nretail level, or at the consumer level. Identifying the manufacturer \nfor purposes of the excise tax is difficult because of the long \ndistribution chain between the raw material supplier and the consumer. \nUnder current law, anyone who manufactures arrows, or the various parts \nof arrows, may be required to collect the excise tax.\n  The current interpretation of the tax on arrows has resulted in a \ngreat deal of confusion among retailers as well as among IRS field \nagents enforcing the law. Currently, local shops are subject to \ndifferent interpretations of what is taxable. Ultimately, the tax falls \non the last person in the chain to materially change the article before \nit is sold to the consumer. Unfortunately, several members of this \nchain may fit the definition of a manufacturer, and each is liable for \nthe tax unless certain registration requirements are met and exemption \nforms filed.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, the method for collecting the excise \ntax on arrows needs to be streamlined. My bill would change the \nimposition of the excise tax to fall on the component shafts, points, \nnocks, and vanes as they are manufactured, rather than on the \naggregated value of the assembled arrow. This is a\n significant change, but one that will greatly simplify the \nadministration of the tax. Under my bill, individual distributors, \nassemblers, and retail sellers of arrows or parts of arrows would no \nlonger be responsible for collecting the excise tax. Only the \nmanufacturers of these parts would bear the responsibility of the \nexcise tax. Thus, identification of the manufacturer would be much \nsimpler and clearer. Industry representatives, who support these \nchanges, have indicated to me that this simplification should increase \ncompliance and therefore enhance revenues. Enforcement by the IRS \nshould also be much easier under this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, the result of this bill is a narrowing of the \ncollection base. Instead of having thousands of distributors, \nretailers, or custom arrow shops being potentially liable for the tax \nas under the current law, about 65 companies would be liable under the \nbill. This simplification would save the IRS a considerable amount of \ntime and money in enforcing the tax. It also would free smaller dealers \nand stores from the burden of computing and remitting the excise tax.\n  The language in this bill accomplishes the needed simplification of \nthis particular section of the Tax Code. One consequence of this change \nis the possibility that a higher excise tax rate may be needed to make \nthe measure revenue neutral. The arrow manufacturing industry agrees \nthat this simplification is not intended to decrease revenue to the \nFederal Government. I am working with the Joint Committee on Taxation \nto find a rate of tax that will make the end result revenue neutral. \nThe bill, as introduced, Mr. President, includes an 11 percent tax \nrate, which is the same as under present law. It is my intention to \nadjust this rate, up or down, as needed, to keep this bill revenue \nneutral. I want to point out, however, that greater compliance should \nbe achieved by having a much smaller number of entities responsible for \nthe tax. This greater compliance, together with the savings realized \nfrom the reduced manpower requirements the IRS needs to enforce this \ntax, [[Page S6819]] should combine to allow an equal or lesser tax rate \nthan under current law. These factors should be considered when \ndetermining the revenue impact of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the amount of revenue we are talking about is around \n$13 million a year. These revenues are, by law, required to go to the \nPittman-Robertson fund, established by the Federal Aid to Wildlife \nRestoration Act. The proceeds of this fund go toward wildlife \nrestoration and hunter education programs administered by the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service. The bulk of this fund is, in turn, passed onto \nthe States to fund their own wildlife programs.\n  Under current law, arrows made by native Americans are exempt from \nthe Federal excise tax. The simplification bill I am\n introducing today would not remove or alter this exemption in any way.\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that today, more than ever, \nwe need to be mindful of the many burdens we are placing on small \nbusinesses and consumers through numerous Federal mandates and \nburdensome tax compliance measures. Businesses and consumers nationwide \nspend billions of dollars each year on tax compliance. Consumers, of \ncourse, pay for this compliance through higher retail prices for goods \nand services. We all know this money could be put to more productive \nuse. Even though this bill is small in comparison to the immense Tax \nCode, I think it is right on target in terms of helping us to achieve \ntax simplification.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a beneficial modification to the \nTax Code presented in a win-win framework. This bill has the support of \nthe Archery Manufacturers and Merchants Association, which represents \nthe majority of this industry. I hope this bill will be swiftly \nadopted, and I encourage my colleagues to support and cosponsor this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide equal protection for victims of crime, to \nfacilitate the exchange of information between Federal and State law \nenforcement and investigation entities, to reform criminal procedure, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act for myself as well as Senator Stevens and \nSenator Ashcroft.\n  Mr. President, for the past week, beginning last Wednesday, I have \ndiscussed on the Senate floor different aspects of the bill that I am \nintroducing this afternoon. I do not intend to go through every single \nprovision of the bill again this afternoon. But I would like to \nhighlight three or four of the principal areas of this bill.\n  I believe that when we look at any crime bill proposed in this \nCongress, we always have to ask several questions. The first is, what \nis the proper role of the Federal Government in an area that we all \nknow and understand is primarily local. Ninety to 95 percent of all \nprosecutions are done at the State, county and local level, not the \nFederal level. So if we are going to have a national crime bill, what \nis that niche? What is the proper role of the Federal Government?\n  The second question I believe that we always have to ask is, what \nworks? What can this Congress do in legislation, with Federal dollars, \nthat will really make a difference?\n  The bill that I am introducing this afternoon is the product of my 20 \nyears of being involved at different levels of Government, in law \nenforcement, being involved in this battle against crime. That \ncertainly does not mean that I am an expert. I do not think we have any \nexperts in this area.\n  However, I have seen it from every angle. I have seen it from the \nangle of a young county prosecuting attorney, a State senator who dealt \nwith it on the State level and tried to write appropriate State laws, \nthen on the House Judiciary Committee for 8 years, and then as \nLieutenant Governor of Ohio, where my principal job was to oversee our \nanticrime effort.\n  This bill is a product of that experience, but also probably more \nimportantly, it is the product of my listening and discussing the crime \nissues with the men and women in Ohio who are on the front line every \nsingle day, the police officers who have to deal with this problem--\nwhat works, what does not work.\n  One thing, Mr. President, that we know works, from our experience, is \nthe tools of technology. My bill will take America from 19th-century \ntechnology in the anticrime area into the 21st century. It does it in a \nunique way. It does it by putting $1 billion--which is certainly a lot \nof money, but only a little over 3 percent of this total crime package \nthat was passed last year, which my bill essentially is a rewrite of--a \nlittle over 3 percent of that total money over a 5-year period we spend \non technology for the local communities, for the local States.\n  What I have been advised by law enforcement throughout Ohio and what \nI have been advised by the FBI is that while last year's crime bill \nwent a long way to create the national databases that we need here in \nWashington and in the new facility that is being built in West \nVirginia, it will never be a complete system unless we grow the system \nlocally.\n  I come from Greene County in Ohio, and the Xenia police department, \nwhen they put information into the system or try to get information \nback out, it is not only important for them to do it accurately and for \nthat information to be in; it is not only important for the FBI to have \nthe national database; but for it to really be successful and work for \nthe local police department wherever that police department is, every \nother jurisdiction in the country has to do the same thing. Criminals \nmove around, information moves around, and it has to be accurate.\n  What our bill does is put the money into the local communities. What \nare we talking about? We are talking about, basically, four national \nsystems: a DNA system; a fingerprint system; a ballistic system, where \nwe can compare the grooves, for example, on shells and bullets; and the \nfourth, of course, is to identify criminals.\n  This type of technology matters. It does, in fact, help to solve \ncrimes. It matters when a police officer, at 3 o'clock in the morning, \nor a sheriff's deputy out on some dark road, has to pull someone over. \nIt matters when that police officer activates his or her computer or \ncalls back into the station to run that license plate. It matters that \nthe information in that computer is accurate so that police officer \nknows as well as humanly possible who that [[Page S6820]] person is \nbefore the apprehension has to be made, before that person is \napproached.\n  It matters when we have an investigation of a case and all the police \nhave is an unknown fingerprint, and they have to try to figure out \nwhere that fingerprint came from. It matters under the technology that \nwe have today: Take that unknown print and compare it with 4 or 5 \nmillion known prints of known criminals. It matters.\n  That is the type of thing that we can do with this new technology \nthat we never would dream of being able to do without the computers. \nAll this does, in fact, matter. This is a tool, a tool that will be \nrelatively cheap in regard to the entire crime bill.\n  Let me make very clear, Mr. President, the crime bill that we are \nintroducing today does not spend any more money. It basically accepts \nas given what this Congress has decided last year, and appears to be \ndeciding again this year, and that is over the next 5 years, we will \ndevote 30 billion Federal dollars, taxpayers' dollars, to the fight \nagainst crime.\n  The question that we have before Congress today is how best to spend \nthat money, and can we improve upon what the Congress did last year? I \nbelieve that we can.\n  The first thing that matters is technology. Our bill provides that. \nIt will make a difference. We will solve crimes. We will save lives.\n  Let me move now to the second area. The second thing that we know \ndoes, in fact, matter in law enforcement. It matters, Mr. President, if \nwe can take violent criminals off the streets. If we can take violent \ncriminals off the streets and lock them up and keep then locked up, we \nknow they at least will not be continuing to commit crimes.\n  My bill reinstitutes a program that the Bush administration had in \nplace for over a year and a half. It was called Project Triggerlock. \nThe principle behind Project Triggerlock was very simple. The principle \nwas that violent offenders who use a gun in the commission of a felony \nneed to be targeted by all U.S. attorneys in this country. And in \ncooperation with local State prosecutors and county prosecutors, if \nthey wish, then the U.S. attorney takes that case into Federal court, \nand under Federal law prosecutes that person. Then, when the person is \nconvicted, they are housed courtesy of the Federal Government. That is \na great assistance to law enforcement because in most cases, the \nFederal mandatory sentencing laws for violent offenders, particularly \nviolent offenders who use a gun in the commission of a felony, is \ntougher than it is in most States. We have a great deterrent effect.\n  During the last administration, in an 18-month period of time, 15,000 \nviolent career criminals were taken off the streets, prosecuted, locked \nup, and put away for a long, long time. That matters. That is what the \npeople in law enforcement call a specific deterrent. That person is \nlocked up and is going to be specifically deterred from committing \nanother crime as long as they are, in fact, locked up.\n  Let me turn now, Mr. President, to the third thing that matters: \nTechnology matters. Technology will solve crimes. It matters to lock up \ndangerous, violent people, particularly those who use a gun. The third \nthing that clearly matters that we have learned from experience, if a \ncommunity deploys police officers into a high-crime area, and if they \nare deployed correctly--call it community policing, call it whatever--\nbut if they are deployed correctly in the community, they will, in \nfact, reduce crime. There is an inverse relationship between the number \nof police officers put out on the street and the crime, the violent \ncrime that occurs in a given area.\n  President Clinton was right in regard to that basic concept. He is to \nbe congratulated for that. I think, though, that between the rhetoric \nand the details, something in last year's crime bill was lost. What was \nlost was a dedication of those tax dollars to be targeted to our most \ndangerous areas.\n  What my bill, the bill we introduce today, is doing, is to take a \nfinite amount of money that we have, $5 billion, and target it to the \n250 most dangerous places in this country to live, the 250 places in \nthis country where according to the FBI's own statistics, the crime \nrate is the highest. We are not talking about writing bad checks. We \nare not talking about forgery. What we are talking about is rape, \nmurder, armed robbery, and aggravated assault--the meanest, toughest \ncrimes that there are. When we put that into the computer and run that \nand compare that then by factoring with regard to population, that is \nhow we divided this money up.\n  We went further in our bill. Where the bill that was passed last year \nprovided that this money would last for 3 years and that these police \nofficers that the Clinton administration envisioned would be paid for 3 \nyears, our bill pays for them for 5 full years.\n  In addition to that, our bill provides for full funding, at 100 \npercent, so the local community has no match. There is no money the \nlocal community has to put in. The Clinton bill is a 75-25-match, where \nthe local community has to come up with 25 percent. There have been a \nnumber of communities that have had a problem with that, coming up with \nthose dollars. In fact, in Ohio it is my understanding the city of \nCincinnati, at least up until now, has not made a match to have any \npolice officers come in under this program. So our bill targets the 250 \ncommunities in this country where the violent crime rate is the \nhighest. Let me just give some examples of what this will actually \nmean. Let me just skip around the country.\n  In Detroit, MI, 96 police officers have been hired so far under the \nClinton plan. Our bill provides, at full funding for 5 years the hiring \nof 747.\n  Dallas, TX, 70 police officers hired so far. Our bill provides for \n604 police officers to be hired.\n  Atlanta, GA, 38 under the Clinton bill. Ours provides for 442.\n  Miami, FL, only six, according to the figures that we have come up \nwith--only six so far in Miami. Yet our bill provides for 402.\n  St. Louis, 23 under the Clinton plan, 386 under our plan.\n  Chicago, 308 under the Clinton plan, under ours 2,219.\n  There will be some people who have already suggested to me that maybe \nwhat you are doing makes sense but it does not make political sense \nbecause you are not spreading these police officers in every community. \nAnd that is true, we are not doing that. But I think what the American \npeople expect us to do and what we should do is to target those police \nofficers in those areas of the country where they are most needed. Our \nbill provides money to be targeted. But we also provide, for those \ncommunities that are not in that top 250 where the crime rate is the \nhighest, additional funds over and above what the Clinton \nadministration bill provided. We add an additional $1.8 billion over 5 \nyears. So those communities will have additional money, but not only \nadditional money, they will have a great deal of flexibility so if they \nwant to take that money and hire police officers or pay for overtime, \nthey can do that as well.\n  We may say, would it not be better just to spread these police \nofficers throughout the country? We talked about, particularly this \nyear, the basic functions of Government. What should Government do? \nWhat should Government not do? What should the Federal Government not \ndo? What should the State government do?\n  One of the basic functions of government, maybe the basic function of \ngovernment--certainly the oldest function of government, going back \nthousands of years to the time when governments of some sort were \noriginally formed, it may have been nothing more than a chieftain or a \nking or someone guaranteeing to provide safety for people--but the \nprimary function of government is to protect people and to make a safe \nenvironment for them to live.\n  We have a crisis today in our inner cities. We have a crisis in many \nparts of our country. It is not totally, exclusively devoted to the \ninner cities, but the inner cities certainly provide an example of \nwhere crime is very, very high. I think we have a moral obligation to \ntry as a country to address that problem. In 1987 the Justice \nDepartment estimated that 8 out of every 10 Americans will be victims \nof a violent crime at least once in their lifetime. Every year, one out \nof four households is victimized by a crime. An American is more likely \nto be injured by a violent crime than by a car accident.\n  So crime is a big problem and it is a big problem for all Americans. \nBut the [[Page S6821]] crime we are talking about, the violent crime, \nis really heavily concentrated in certain areas. Princeton Prof. John \nDeIulio reports that while Philadelphia--just as an example--while \nPhiladelphia contains only 14 percent of the population of the State of \nPennsylvania, it accounts for 42 percent of the entire State's crime--\nan unbelievable figure. What is happening to the children who live in \nthese high-crime areas? They are living a life, frankly, that would be \nunimaginable for Americans of my parents' generation.\n  Over 25 percent of inner-city children growing up in this country \nthink they are likely to be shot at some point in their life--25 \npercent, one-fourth of these children growing up. A male teenager \ngrowing up in an inner city is at least six times more likely to be a \nvictim of violent crime than a male teenager growing up somewhere else \nin the country--six times. I do not think we can give up on these young \npeople, these young Americans. They need hope and opportunity every bit \nas much as any other child in this country. They need a chance. And I \nbelieve putting more police in their neighborhoods is something we can \ndo to start giving them that chance, the chance to live without \nconstant fear for themselves and for their families.\n  Let us make no mistake about it, putting more police into those \ncrime-infested areas, the most crime-ridden areas of our country, is \nnot going to solve all the problems of those communities. We all know \nthat and we all have an obligation to work on the other problems--\nwelfare reform, jobs, making sure the schools in every neighborhood in \nthis country are good schools so the children do in fact have a chance \nand opportunity. But no matter what we do with our schools, no matter \nwhat we do with welfare, no matter what we do with job creation, \nnothing positive can really take place as long as crime does exist.\n  So, having community policing, having law enforcement targeted to \nthese areas, I believe, is clearly the right thing to do. I do not \nthink it is fair to say to that child who, because of accident of \nbirth, happens to be growing up in an area where he or she is six times \nmore likely to be killed than a child in a suburb, I do not think it is \nfair to say to that child: We cannot do anything about it. We are, for \npolitical reasons, going to spread out these police officers, these new \npolice men and women. We are going to spread them out throughout the \ncountry because for political reasons we think we can get more votes \nthat way for a particular bill. I do not think that is right. I think \nthe right thing to do is to target where these police men and women go, \nand that is what our bill does.\n  Our bill does many other things. I see my colleague from Michigan is \non the floor, so I am not going to speak very much longer, let me \nadvise him. But let me say in conclusion that this bill is aimed at \ndoing things that matter, doing things that will make a difference, \ndoing things that will get the job done. It is a very pragmatic bill, a \nvery hardheaded bill. And it basically says this: If we as a Congress \nhave made the decision, as apparently we have, that over the next 5 \nyears we are going to spend $30 billion on this very, very important \nproblem, then we should spend it correctly and we should listen to the \nmen and women who are professionals, who can tell us how to spend it: \nMore technology, more police officers deployed correctly, and finally, \ntaking off the streets the violent repeat career criminals.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I want to thank the original \ncosponsors of this bill, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nHatch, and ask for additional cosponsors. I look forward to working \nwith the Members of the Senate as we take these ideas that I presented \ntoday, this past week, presented in this bill, take these ideas, \nincorporate them with other ideas of my colleagues to come up with a \nfinal bill this year, or next year, that will in fact make a difference \nand will save lives, that will reduce crime.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much. At this point, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6803-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 338\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone] was added as a cosponsor of S. 338, a bill to amend \ntitle 38, United States Code, to extend the period of eligibility for \ninpatient care for veterans exposed to toxic substances, radiation, or \nenvironmental hazards, to extend the period of eligibility for \noutpatient care for veterans exposed to such substances or hazards \nduring service in the Persian Gulf, and to expand the eligibility of \nveterans exposed to toxic substances or radiation for outpatient care.\n\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Brown] was added as a cosponsor of S. 389, a bill for the relief \nof Nguyen Quy An and his daughter, Nguyen Ngoc Kim Quy.\n\n\n                                 S. 433\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kerry, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Simon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 433, a bill to regulate \nhandgun ammunition, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 619\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 619, a bill to phase out \nthe use of mercury in batteries and provide for the efficient and cost-\neffective collection and recycling or proper disposal of used nickel \ncadmium batteries, small sealed lead-acid batteries, and certain other \nbatteries, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 641, a bill to reauthorize \nthe Ryan White CARE Act of 1990, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the names of the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Pryor], the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], and the \nSenator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] were added as cosponsors of S. \n684, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nprograms of research regarding Parkinson's disease, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 689\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Murray, the name of the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton] was added as a cosponsor of S. 689, a bill to \namend the Solid Waste Disposal Act regarding the use of organic \nsorbents in landfills, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin], and the \nSenator from Montana [Mr. Burns] were added as cosponsors of S. 770, a \nbill to provide for the relocation of the United States Embassy in \nIsrael to Jerusalem, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6821-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6821-S6823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 14--RELATIVE TO THE PANAMA CANAL\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Mack, Mr. \nThomas, Mr. Smith, and Mr. D'Amato) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in a moment I shall send to the desk, a \nresolution urging the President to negotiate a new base rights \nagreement with the Government of Panama to permit the United States \nArmed Forces to remain in Panama beyond December 31, 1999. Senators \nCraig, Coverdell, Thomas, Mack, Smith, and D'Amato are principal \ncosponsors of the resolution, as are several other Senators who desire \ncosponsorship, and we will add those names this afternoon.\n  We feel strongly that it is in the United States strategic interest \nto maintain a military presence in Panama. Millions of Americans feel \nthat the Senate allowed President Carter to give away the Panama Canal \nto the great detriment of the security of the United States, and it was \nindeed a perilous mistake.\n  But what is done is done; I am not here today to reopen the Panama \nCanal Treaty debate. That may come later. For the moment we seek only a \nsimple base rights agreement--the kind of agreement we pursue with \nother countries in Europe and in Asia.\n  This resolution strongly advocates U.S. presence after the \nimplementation of the existing canal treaties. We believe it to be \nobvious that a U.S. military presence offers the best means of \nprotecting the canal and ensuring its neutrality.\n  Eighty percent of the Panamanians agree with that. The Panamanian \nForeign Minister agrees with that.\n  If nothing is done, then the American flag will be lowered for the \nlast time in Panama at noon on December 31, 1999, after having flown \nthere for almost a century. Thus, absent any change in the matter, a \nhistorical and unique relationship between the United States and Panama \nwill come to a close. The United States will withdraw completely its \nmilitary presence from Panama, and this Senator is absolutely persuaded \nthat should not happen.\n  In the Exchange of Instruments of the Ratification of the Panama \nCanal Treaties, a protocol--in ``The Treaty Concerning the Permanent \nNeutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal'' [Neutrality Treaty]--\nmakes clear that nothing in the treaties precludes Panama and the \nUnited States from agreeing to the stationing of United States military \nforces or the maintenance of defense sites in Panama after December \n1999. Specifically, the Permanent Neutrality Treaty states:\n       Nothing in the treaty shall preclude the Republic of Panama \n     and the United States of America from making, in accordance \n     with their respective constitutional processes, any agreement \n     or arrangement between the two countries to facilitate \n     performance at any time after December 31, 1999, of their \n     responsibilities to maintain the regime of neutrality \n     established in the Treaty, including agreements or \n     arrangements for the stationing of any United States military \n     forces or the maintenance of defense sites after that date in \n     the Republic of Panama that the Republic of Panama and the \n     United States of America may deem necessary or appropriate.\n  Latin America is important to the United States, and vice versa. \nEvery few years something dramatic happens in Latin America that has a \ndirect impact on the United States, whether it be a security threat or \na natural disaster. The United States needs a strategic military \ncapability in the region, and maintaining United States military forces \nin Panama will give us the best option and capability.\n  Many Americans have the misleading impression that Latin America is \nas close and accessible as their back yard. While parts of Latin \nAmerica are indeed only hours away, the vast majority of the region is \nnot that easily or quickly accessible. Geographically, Europe is not \neven half the size of South America. Brazil is larger than the \ncontinental United States.\n  If total United States military withdrawal from Panama is allowed to \nhappen, we will be left with no significant military presence in the \nregion. Furthermore, it will be both politically difficult and \nenormously costly to reintroduce U.S. forces into the region.\n  Keeping United States forces in Panama promotes stable democracies \nand market economies throughout the region; also it helps support \nUnited States efforts to counter the flow of illegal drugs. Without \nquestion, then, United States forces offer the best protection and \ndefense of the Panama Canal.\n  Although the United States is engaged in a draw-down of our forces \nboth overseas and in the United States, we are, nevertheless, leaving \nmore than 135,000 troops in Europe and almost 100,000 in the Pacific. \nMaintaining forces overseas is part of the military mission. Congress \nbudgets for this.\n  By the end of this year, however, only 6,000 troops will remain in \nPanama. This number will continue to diminish. In other words, United \nStates presence in all of Latin America is a mere drop in the bucket \ncompared to our presence in other parts of the world.\n  A continued United States presence is also supported by the \nPanamanian people. Current polls in Panama indicate that more than 70 \npercent of Panamanians questioned want the United States to maintain a \nmilitary presence in Panama.\n  Since a continued U.S. military presence is in the interests of both \nnations, it is the time to negotiate a new base rights agreement. The \nPanama Canal treaties provide for a continued United States military \npresence, and the Panamanian public overwhelmingly favors it. The \nUnited States Congress should strongly urge the President to begin \nnegotiating a new base rights agreement to keep United States military \nforces in Panama.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the results of \na recent public opinion poll commissioned by the U.S. Information \nAgency be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Panamanians Want U.S. Troops To Stay\n\n       Most Panamanians still hold favorable views of the United \n     States, despite political and economic frustrations since \n     Operation ``Just Cause'' in 1989. Moreover, Panamanians \n     continue to believe that some U.S. troops should remain in \n     Panama after 1999, despite the Canal Treaty agreements on \n     complete withdrawal.\n\n\n                              key findings\n\n       In a September 1994 poll, large majorities expressed \n     favorable opinions of the United States. Most thought the \n     U.S. had ``done much'' to promote democracy and economic \n     development in Panama.\n       An overwhelming majority rated the U.S.-Panama relationship \n     as ``good;'' many called it ``very'' good. Many also thought \n     the U.S. treated Panama with ``dignity and respect,'' but \n     opinion was more negative on U.S. efforts to understand \n     Panamanian problems. And a large majority thought the U.S. \n     expected Panama to cede to its wishes on important issues.\n       Better than eight in ten continued to believe that at least \n     some U.S. troops should remain in Panama beyond 1999--with \n     half endorsing the maintenance of present troop levels and \n     one-third favoring reduced levels. The main reasons given for \n     the extended U.S. military presence were ``security reasons'' \n     and ``employ-ment opportunities.''\n       Eight in ten or more also said it would be acceptable for \n     U.S. troops to remain in Panama to provide security for the \n     Canal, to continue the regional counter narcotics, fight, and \n     to provide assistance in natural emergencies or for refugees. \n     Better than six \n      [[Page S6823]] in ten thought it acceptable that the U.S. \n     provide support for American military forces in other parts \n     of the hemisphere from Panama bases.\n       In contrast to widespread doubts expressed in previous \n     years, half the public thought the Panamanian government \n     would be able to manage the canal well when it assumes full \n     control in the year 2000.\n             opinion of the united states remains very high\n       Panamanians have faced a variety of political and economic \n     frustrations since 1989 when General Manuel Noriega was \n     removed from power. These appear to have had little effect on \n     the favorable views most Panamanians have held of the United \n     States.\\1\\ In a September 1994 poll, eight in ten (82%)--\n     across all regional and educational levels--voiced favorable \n     opinions of the United States. Half (47%) expressed ``very'' \n     favorable views, while just over one in ten (14%) regarded \n     the U.S. unfavorably. On two key U.S. initiatives:\n     \\1\\ A USIA poll in mid-1990 found that 87 percent approved \n     (77% ``strongly'') of the U.S. sending troops to remove Gen. \n     Noriega and 75 percent considered the operation a \n     ``liberation'' rather than an ``invasion.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Eight in ten (83%) agreed that the U.S. had ``done much to \n     promote democracy'' in Panama. Six in ten were in strong \n     agreement, perhaps influenced in part by the successful \n     democratic elections in May.\\2\\\n     \\2\\ The winner, Perez Balladares, was inaugurated just a week \n     before interviewing for the poll began on September 8.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A similar majority (82%) also thought that the U.S. had \n     ``done much to promote the economic development'' of Panama. \n     Again, six in ten agreed strongly with the statement.\n\n\n            Most judge the U.S.-Panama Relationship as Good\n\n       A great majority believed that relations between Panama and \n     the United States were good (89%); four in ten (39%) felt \n     they were ``very'' good. Seven in ten agreed (72%)--and half \n     (48%) ``strongly'' agreed--that the U.S. treats Panama with \n     ``dignity and respect.'' (The university-educated were \n     somewhat less likely to agree with this statement than \n     Panamanians with less schooling.)\n       Public opinion was less favorable on two other aspects of \n     the relationship:\n       Opinion was split about evenly on whether the U.S. tries to \n     understand the problems facing Panama (44% said it does, 49% \n     said it doesn't).\n       A large majority agreed (80%; 58% ``strongly'') that the \n     U.S. expects Panama to ``give in to its wishes in matters of \n     importance to both countries.'' This perception apparently \n     did not influence favorable opinions on other issues, \n     however.\n\n\n              most still want some U.S. troops to Remain--\n\n       Panamanians continue to want a U.S. military presence in \n     Panama beyond December, 1999, when the Torrijos-Carter Canal \n     Treaties stipulate the withdrawal of all American troops. \n     There has been virtually no change in public attitudes on \n     this issue since 1991: Half the public (50%) said the U.S. \n     should maintain ``about the same number of troops it has \n     now,'' while a third (35%) said the troop presence should \n     remain in ``reduced'' form. Just one in ten (10%) preferred \n     that all U.S. troops leave Panama. In general, the less-\n     educated tended to support the status quo, while the \n     university-educated were somewhat more likely to favor a \n     reduced presence.\n\n\n                  for security and employment reasons\n\n       When those favoring a continued U.S. presence in Panama \n     were asked why they thought the troops should stay, most \n     mentioned either the security of the canal (46%) or \n     employment opportunities generated by the U.S. base (34%). \n     Political stability was mentioned by only a few (7%).\n       In addition, when asked if it would be ``acceptable'' for \n     U.S. troops to remain in Panama for selected purposes, large \n     majorities say yes to the following: to provide security for \n     the canal (87%); to continue the fight against illegal drugs \n     in the region (87%); to provide assistance in times of \n     natural disasters or for refugees in Panama (81%); and to \n     provide support for U.S. military forces in other parts of \n     the hemisphere (64%).\n       Only the last purpose, ``support for U.S. military forces \n     in other parts,'' was considered ``unacceptable'' by \n     significant minorities of the general public (27%) and the \n     university-educated (40%).\n\n\n         confidence increases on government management of canal\n\n       Public confidence in the Panamanian government's ability to \n     manage the canal when it assumes full control in 2000 appears \n     to have increased in recent years: Half (51%) believed the \n     government would manage the canal at least fairly well, while \n     four in ten (42%) thought it would manage the canal badly. \n     Interestingly, the university-educated were considerably more \n     optimistic about the government's management capacity than \n     the less-educated (62% to 45%). Polls in 1990 and 1992 had \n     found that large majorities believed the Panamanian \n     government was paying little or no attention to canal-\n     management matters and that it would be best if the U.S. and \n     Panama managed the canal together.\n\n\n                        how this poll was taken\n\n       This public opinion survey was commissioned by USIA and \n     conducted by CID-Gallup of Costa Rica. It is based on face-\n     to-face interviews with 1200 adults aged 18 and over in all \n     regions of Panama. Fieldwork took place September 8-18, 1994. \n     Sample construction and fieldwork were performed by CID in \n     accordance with USIA instructions. Questions were written by \n     USIA in consultation with AID and USIS Panama. They were \n     translated by the contractor, with final review by USIA.\n       The survey sample was selected by a modified probability \n     method, and covered both urban and rural populations. When \n     necessary, respondent selection was adjusted for age, sex, \n     and education to more closely match estimated population \n     profiles.\n       Ninety-five times out of one hundred, results from samples \n     of this size will yield results which differ by no more than \n     about 3 percentage points in either direction from what would \n     have been obtained were it possible to interview everyone in \n     the population. The comparison of smaller subgroups increases \n     the margin of error. In addition, the practical difficulties \n     of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce \n     other sources of error.\n       Additional information on methodology may be obtained from \n     the analyst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6821-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6823-S6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 120--ESTABLISHING A SPECIAL COMMITTEE ADMINISTERED BY \n          THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Dole) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

August 5, 1994) \n     (hereafter in this resolution referred to as ``the \n     independent counsel'');\n       (2) may make interim reports to the Senate as it considers \n     appropriate; and\n       (3) shall make a final comprehensive public report to the \n     Senate which contains--\n       (A) a description of all relevant factual determinations; \n     and\n       (B) recommendations for legislation, if necessary.\n\n     SEC. 5. POWERS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The special committee shall do everything \n     necessary and appropriate under the laws and the Constitution \n     of the United States to conduct the investigation, study, and \n     hearings authorized by section 1.\n       (b) Exercise of Authority.--The special committee may \n     exercise all of the powers and responsibilities of a \n     committee under rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate \n     and section 705 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, \n     including the following:\n       (1) Subpoena powers.--To issue subpoenas or orders for the \n     attendance of witnesses or for the production of documentary \n     or physical evidence before the special committee. A subpoena \n     or order may be authorized by the special committee or by the \n     chairman with the agreement of the ranking member, and may be \n     issued by the chairman or any other member of the special \n     committee designated by the chairman, and may be served by \n     any person designated by the chairman or the authorized \n     member anywhere within or outside of the borders of the \n     United States to the full extent permitted by law. The \n     chairman, or any other member of the special committee, is \n     authorized to administer oaths to any witnesses appearing \n     before the special committee. If a return on a subpoena or \n     order for the production of documentary or physical evidence \n     is incomplete or accompanied by an objection, the chairman \n     (in consultation with the ranking member) may convene a \n     meeting or hearing to determine the adequacy of the return \n     and to rule on the objection. At a meeting or hearing on such \n     a return, one member of the special committee shall \n     constitute a quorum. The special committee shall not initiate \n     procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement of a \n     subpoena unless the person or entity to whom the subpoena is \n     directed refuses to produce the required documentary or \n     physical evidence after having been ordered and directed to \n     do so.\n       (2) Compensation authority.--To employ and fix the \n     compensation of such clerical, investigatory, legal, \n     technical, and other assistants as the special committee, or \n     the chairman or the ranking member, considers necessary or \n     appropriate.\n       (3) Meetings.--To sit and act at any time or place during \n     sessions, recesses, and adjournment periods of the Senate.\n       (4) Hearings.--To hold hearings, take testimony under oath, \n     and receive documentary or physical evidence relating to the \n     matters and questions it is authorized to investigate or \n     study. Unless the chairman and the ranking member otherwise \n     agree, the questioning of a witness or a panel of witnesses \n     at a hearing shall be limited to one initial 30-minute turn \n     each for the chairman and the ranking member, or their \n     designees, including majority and minority staff, and \n     thereafter to 10-minute turns by each member of the special \n     committee if 5 or more members are present, and to 15-minute \n     turns by each member of the special committee if fewer than 5 \n     members are present. A member may be permitted further \n     questions of the witness or panel of witnesses, either by \n     using time that another member then present at the hearing \n     has yielded for that purpose during the yielding member's \n     turn, or by using time allotted after all members have been \n     given an opportunity to question the witness or panel of \n     witnesses. At all times, unless the chairman and the ranking \n     member otherwise agree, the questioning shall alternate back \n     and forth between members of the majority party and members \n     of the minority party. In their discretion, the chairman and \n     the ranking member, respectively, may designate majority or \n     minority staff to question a witness or a panel of witnesses \n     at a hearing during time yielded by a member of the \n     chairman's or the ranking member's party then present at the \n     hearing for his or her turn.\n       (5) Testimony of witnesses.--To require by subpoena or \n     order the attendance, as a witness before the special \n     committee or at a deposition, of any person who may have \n     knowledge or information concerning any of the matters that \n     the special committee is authorized to investigate and study.\n       (6) Immunity.--To grant a witness immunity under sections \n     6002 and 6005 of title 18, United States Code, provided that \n     the independent counsel has not informed the special \n     committee in writing that immunizing the witness would \n     interfere with the ability of the independent counsel \n     successfully to prosecute criminal violations. Not later than \n     10 days before the special committee seeks a Federal court \n     order for a grant of immunity by the special committee, the \n     Senate Legal Counsel shall cause to be delivered to the \n     independent counsel a written request asking the independent \n     counsel promptly to inform the special committee in writing \n     if, in the judgment of the independent counsel, the grant of \n     immunity would interfere with the ability of the independent \n     counsel successfully to prosecute criminal violations. The \n     Senate Legal Counsel's written request of [[Page S6825]] the \n     independent counsel required by this paragraph shall be in \n     addition to all notice requirements set forth in sections \n     6002 and 6005 of title 18, United States Code.\n       (7) Depositions.--To take depositions and other testimony \n     under oath anywhere within the United States, to issue orders \n     that require witnesses to answer written interrogatories \n     under oath, and to make application for the issuance of \n     letters rogatory. All depositions shall be conducted jointly \n     by majority and minority staff of the special committee. A \n     witness at a deposition shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by a member of the special committee or an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths, and a \n     complete transcription or electronic recording of the \n     deposition shall be made. Questions shall be propounded first \n     by majority staff of the special committee and then by \n     minority staff of the special committee. Any subsequent round \n     of questioning shall proceed in the same order. Objections by \n     the witness as to the form of questions shall be noted for \n     the record. If a witness objects to a question and refuses to \n     answer on the basis of relevance or privilege, the special \n     committee staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at \n     that time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling on the \n     objection from the chairman. If the chairman overrules the \n     objection, the chairman may order and direct the witness to \n     answer the question, but the special committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal enforcement \n     unless the witness refuses to answer after having been \n     ordered and directed to answer.\n       (8) Delegations to staff.--To issue commissions and to \n     notice depositions for staff members to examine witnesses and \n     to receive evidence under oath administered by an individual \n     authorized by local law to administer oaths. The special \n     committee, or the chairman with the concurrence of the \n     ranking member, may delegate to designated staff members of \n     the special committee the power to issue deposition notices \n     authorized pursuant to this paragraph.\n       (9) Information from other sources.--To require by subpoena \n     or order--\n       (A) any department, agency, entity, officer, or employee of \n     the United States Government;\n       (B) any person or entity purporting to act under color or \n     authority of State or local law;

Res. 121\n\n       Whereas Angola has suffered one of the most violent and \n     longest-running civil wars;\n       Whereas the United States was actively engaged in the war \n     in Angola, has provided more than $200 million in \n     humanitarian assistance to Angola since 1992, and has been a \n     key facilitator on the ongoing peace negotiations;\n       Whereas Angola is the last civil conflict in southern \n     Africa, and regional leaders including South African \n     President Nelson Mandela consider its resolution to be a top \n     priority;\n       Whereas an enduring peace in Angola, a potentially wealthy \n     country that is central to regional stability and economic \n     development, is in the national interest of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Government of Angola and National Union for the \n     Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) entered into the Lusaka \n     Protocol in November 1994 to secure a U.N.-supervised peace \n     settlement;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council voted in \n     February to send a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Angola to \n     monitor and enforce the peace process, and more than 600 \n     international monitors are deployed throughout the country;\n       Whereas continuing progress toward peace makes it more \n     likely that further deployment of UNAVEM III will occur soon;\n       Whereas the meeting between President Eduardo dos Santos \n     and Dr. Jonas Savimbi on May 6, 1995, at which both parties \n     reiterated their commitment to the Lusaka Protocol, \n     demonstrated that they possess the essential political will \n     to resolve outstanding issues, and encouraged all who want \n     peace in Angola;\n       Whereas achieving a lasting peace will require that all \n     Angolans work together to overcome bitter legacies of war, \n     which include a devastated infrastructure, millions of \n     unexploded landmines, a profound distrust between the \n     parties, weakened civil institutions, a crippled economy, and \n     a generation of young Angolans who have never known a \n     peaceful, civil society;\n       Whereas strong leadership is essential to ensure that the \n     wealth of Angola, long spent on war, now is used to \n     consolidate peace. Now therefore be it\n       Resolved That the Senate:\n       (1) Congratulates the people of Angola for the courageous \n     and determined steps their leaders have taken in support of \n     peace;\n       (2) Urges all parties in Angola to continue to strengthen \n     their commitment to the Lusaka process, which constitutes the \n     last, and best, chance for securing an enduring peace;\n       (3) Affirms that the United States will hold both Angolan \n     parties responsible for abiding by their commitment to peace; \n     and\n       (4) Calls upon the international community to remain \n     actively engaged in support of national reconciliation, \n     removal of landmines, economic development, and \n     democratization in Angola.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution, in \nconjunction with the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and others, which congratulates the people \nof Angola for the courageous steps their leaders have taken recently in \nthe name of peace and reconciliation in Angola. This has been an \narduous and painful process, but the recent meeting between President \ndos Santos and Dr. Jonas Savimbi, in addition to the deployment of the \nU.N. operation, signifies a dramatic breakthrough which may unlock the \ndoor to peace in Angola.\n  As we all know, Angola has been engulfed in civil war ever since its \nindependence from Portugal in 1975. It not only suffered vast \ndislocation and neglect following the colonial occupation, but also it \nbecame a classic superpower playground as Angola struggled to find for \nits postcolonial identity. Throughout the 1970's and 1980's South \nAfrica and Zaire launched frequent military incursions in support of \nthe Government of Angola, while mercenaries from Europe and elsewhere \nhelped the rebel forces of UNITA and Dr. Jonas Savimbi fight from the \nbush. 37,000 Cuban troops supported the government and the MPLA party, \nand their involvement sparked more independence wars in Namibia. The \nUnited States offered covert aid to UNITA in an effort to contain \ncommunism in Africa for ``national security'' purposes. In addition, \nthere were secessionist threats from the northern, oil-rich province of \nCabinda, which was, ironically, home to many U.S. oil companies \nthroughout the war.\n  This war killed over 1 million people, and displaced and disabled \nmillions more. Cities and fields are completely destroyed, and 9 to 20 \nmillion unexploded landmines, supplied by outside powers, lace the \ncountryside. Beautiful coastal lands and mineral-rich areas not only \nlay undeveloped, but have been damaged and destroyed by warfare. Bitter \nwar enmities between the MPLA and UNITA have created long-lasting rifts \nwhich will take at least a full generation to heal. Young boys, who \nfrom the age of 10 have been armed and fighting, are dislocated from \ntheir families. An entire people has never known civil society.\n  It was with the end of the cold war, the end of the United States-\nSoviet rivalry, that peace actually had a chance in Angola. When \nCongress prohibited military aid to Angola, Cuban troops withdrew, and \nSouth Africa began to change, negotiations were finally able to begin \nbetween the MPLA and UNITA. The peace process of 1991 resulted in the \nBicesse accords, and led to elections. But then disputed returns, and \nmilitant attacks on the MPLA by Savimbi, destroyed the process.\n  By 1992, serious negotiations had begun again. Thanks to the \nrelentless efforts of U.N. Special Representative Bedouin Beyh, United \nStates Ambassador to Angola, Edward de Jarnette, and others--including \nSouth African Nelson Mandela--the Lusaka accords were finally concluded \non November 5, 1994.\n  The accords secure a U.N. supervised peace settlement, which includes \nthe deployment of 5,600 U.N. peacekeeping troops, as well as 350 \nmilitary observers and 260 civilian police. It is intended to enable \nnational\n reconciliation, demilitarization, economic development, and \ndemocratization of Angloa. It will also enable the continued delivery \nof massive food lifts, which is keeping hundreds of thousands of people \nalive as the society builds a peacetime environment.\n\n  There have been some glitches in the peace process, and there have \nbeen many incidents we thought Angola would not survive. But the peace \nprocess made a big step last week when President dos Santos and Dr. \nSavimbi finally met face-to-face in Lusaka. [[Page S6827]] They met for \nseveral hours, and in the end emerged as cooperative negotiators, both \nsigning the Lusaka accords. They agreed to work as partners to resolve \noutstanding issues such as consolidation of the ceasefire, resolution \nof military control issues, demining operations, repair of \ninfrastructure, acceleration of the arrival of UNAVEM troops, the \nretreat of Angolan soldiers, and the formation of a national unity \ngovernment.\n  Finally, the two sides demonstrated that they have the political will \nnecessary to reach a lasting and durable peace. This meeting was a long \ntime in coming, and we in Congress should recognize what a milestone it \nis. For if Lusaka fails, Angola may lose its last opportunity for peace \nand prosperity. We have a lot to lose of that fails.\n  The resolution we are offering today congratulates the people of \nAngola for the courageous and determined steps their leaders have taken \nin support of peace. It also urges all parties in Angola to strengthen \ntheir commitment to the Lusaka process, and affirms American support \nfor both parties to abide by their commitments. Finally, because we \ncannot and should not do this alone, it calls upon the international \ncommunity to remain actively engaged with humanitarian, political, and \neconomic support to make this process a success.\n  Angola is potentially a wealthy country with soil fertile enough to \nfeed all of sub-Saharan Africa. It is also part of a region which has \nhad economic and stunning political success in the past few years. As \nAfrica seeks to put the cold war behind it, and as southern Africa \nconsolidates into a powerhouse region, the process in Angola becomes \nall the more important. The meeting convened last week realized many of \nthe gains made in recent months, and hopefully will set the process on \na new course.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6826-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I would like to address comments \nmade in the last few weeks by two officials of the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China regarding the United States and Hong Kong. \nFirst, as reported by Hong Kong radio and Nanhua Zaobao, Mr. Lu Ping, \nthe Director of the PRC's Office of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a \ndelegation of American businessmen in Beijing that he believes there is \na lack of understanding in the United States regarding Beijing's \nattitude towards Hong Kong. Second, Foreign Minister Qian is quoted in \nthe April 24 issue of Beijing Review as stating that the United States \nhas no interest in Hong Kong sufficient to justify the attention we pay \nto the area. I am dismayed that they have reached this conclusion for \ntwo reasons. First, because I believe that the United States is all too \ncognizant of Beijing's attitude towards the colony and has tried to \nmake that cognizance known; and second, because it demonstrates to me \nthat Beijing does not really understand what our concerns are.\n  At the outset, let me state that I do agree in part with Minister \nQian. Before the scheduled revision in 1997, Hong Kong affairs are a \nmatter of concern primarily to Great Britain and the PRC; after 1997, \nthey become a matter of concern primarily to Beijing. It is not our \nintent to instruct either London or Beijing on how best to accomplish \nthat reversion, or on what role Hong Kong should play as a reclaimed \npart of greater China after 1997.\n   This does not mean however, that I agree with what appears to be \nMinister Qian's correlative argument: that other countries therefore \nhave absolutely no role whatsoever to play before or after 1997.\n   As I previously noted in a statement about Hong Kong on the floor on \nApril 3, the United States is keenly following developments in Hong \nKong. This interest has two principle sources. First, we have a \ntremendous stake in the future economic and political stability of Hong \nKong after reversion. Second, how the PRC handles this transition has \nfar-reaching implications for our bilateral relations--and in some of \nChina's multilateral relations which include us--in other important \narenas. Let me address these in turn.\n  Our economic ties to the present Colony of Hong Kong are substantial. \nHong Kong is our 13th largest trading partner--7th in terms of \nagricultural trade. In 1994, two-way merchandise trade topped $21 \nbillion; U.S. exports accounted for over $11 billion. There are more \nthan 1,000 United States firms with a presence in Hong Kong, of which \nabout 370 have their regional headquarters there. At the beginning of \n1994, United States direct investment in Hong Kong on a historical cost \nbasis was approximately $10.5 billion.\n  This strong economic tie is facilitated--in fact, made possible--by \nHong Kong's friendly business climate, a stable government, an \nindependent judiciary firmly rooted in the rule of law and a vibrantly \nfree press. It is clearly a tie we have a very strong motive for \n[[Page S6828]] maintaining in its present form. And thus, it is from \nthis point of view that we take an active interest in Hong Kong affairs \nnow, and will most likely continue to take in the post-1997 world. How \nfaithfully the PRC adheres to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and \nthe Basic Law is of importance to us because of the impact such \nadherence--or lack thereof--might have no these specific areas, and, in \nturn, on our economic stake.\n  These are the logical steps that our Chinese friends do not seem to \nfollow. I think their failure is best illustrated by an article in the \nMay 8 edition of the Hong Kong Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po--a \nnewspaper with close connections to the PRC. In commenting on a speech \nby the United States Consul General in Hong Kong, the newspaper \nreported:\n\n       In his speech, Mr. Mueller said that the United States not \n     only has tens of thousands of citizens, over 1,000 companies, \n     and tens of billions of dollars of investments in Hong Kong, \n     but also exports billions of dollars' worth of products to \n     Hong Kong. These facts, he noted, show that maintaining and \n     developing economic and trade relations with Hong Kong is \n     conductive to safeguarding the common interests of Hong Kong \n     and the United States, this being indeed the point Mr. \n     Mueller was trying to make. What is strange is that Mr. \n     Mueller suddenly shifted from economic topics to topics such \n     as democracy, the legal system, and human rights in Hong Kong \n     * * * . (emphasis added).\n\n  So, let me explain simply how desiring to safeguard our economic \ninterests triggers a concomitant interest in those topics. If the PRC \ncannot or does not firmly establish and safeguard a local independent \njudiciary in Hong Kong after 1997, then businesses will become \nskittish, pull out of the area, and the economy will suffer. If the \ncivil and human rights presently available to Hong Kong citizens are \nnot safeguarded, and are instead limited to reflect those presently \navailable to citizens on the mainland where the government is not known \nfor its sterling democratic reputation, then businesses will become \nskittish, pull out of the area, and the economy will suffer. If the \npresent orderly and stable bureaucracy is replaced by one such as that \ncurrently in vogue in provinces like Guangdong where family or party \nconnections and a large amount of renminbi are more important than the \nrule of law, then businesses will become skittish, pull out of the \narea, and the economy will suffer.\n  We understand very well the PRC's verbal pronouncements that \neverything is fine and will remain so after 1997. But as I pointed out \nafter the visit here of Lu Ping, to be credible and\n calming those pronouncements need to be backed-up with substantive \nactions. So far, in some areas, that has not been the case, and it this \nlack of substantive assurances that concerns us. Let me illustrate.\n\n  A free press is one of the elements essential to Hong Kong's future \nas a center of international trade and finance. China has spoken about \nmaintaining freedom of the press, but we have seen growing signs of a \nmove to chill the colony's traditionally raucous press--a press which \nhas been quite even-handed at denouncing Beijing and London, but has \ndenounced Beijing nonetheless. There have been declarations that the \nPRC will not allow Hong Kong to become a ``nest of subversives''--which \nin the PRC's lexicon could well include free-minded members of the \nmedia. The PRC's Ministry of Public Security recently confirmed that it \nhas been gathering information on Hong Kong citizens who are ``against \nthe Chinese government.'' The PRC also tried in secret Hong Kong \nreporter Xi Yang and sentenced him to 12 years in prison for ``stealing \nstate financial secrets''--a term which could include such simple \nfigures as production levels of consumer goods, provincial GDP's, etc. \nFinally, there were the not-so-coincidental hostile actions taken by \nthe PRC against the Beijing commercial establishments of Hong Kong \npublisher Jimmy Lai after Lai published an open letter critical of Li \nPeng.\n  A continuation of the present common law, independent judiciary is \nanother element of Hong Kong's continuing economic success after 1997. \nBusinesses feel secure if they know that any commercial dispute in \nwhich they may be involved will be determined using settled points of \nlaw adjudicated by jurists beyond the influence of local politics or \ninfluence. The PRC has promised a continuation of this system, but \nagain their actions speak louder to us. Beijing has failed to endorse \nthe Hong Kong Government's draft legislation designed to implement the \nCourt of Final Appeal; failure to do so soon may leave the Hong Kong \nSAR without such a court for the critical period just after 1997. \nMoreover, China's past commitment to the rule of law has been very \nspotty at best. Although a signatory to the International Convention on \nArbitration, the PRC has blatantly violated that accord by allowing a \nShanghai firm to refuse to pay an arbitral award against it in favor of \na U.S. concern named Revpower. China is a signatory to several \nagreements concerning intellectual property rights, but their \ncompliance until lately was almost nonexistent. The terms of contracts \nin general in China appear to be binding on the foreign firm, and \nfungible as far as the Government is concerned--witness the recent \nunilateral breaking of McDonald's lease for a site on Tiananmen Square \nwith which my colleagues are no doubt familiar.\n  Aside from our specific interest in these specific issues and the \nramifications they will have for Hong Kong's future, how the PRC \nhandles this transition also has implications in other non-Hong Kong \nspecific arenas. How well the PRC keeps to their word will, I think, \ndemonstrate their dependability as they seek to accede to the WTO and \nother similar organizations. Moreover, it will serve as an indicator as \nto whether the Chinese are serious about their own commitments to \nforeign investors, and will be a signal to those considering future \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, on May 25 the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs, which I chair, will hold a hearing on this topic entitled \n``Hong Kong: Problems and Prospects for 1997.'' I look forward to \nhearing from several Hong Kong specialists about the present state of \nthe transition, where the problem areas are, and what they think the \nprospects are for the continuation of the colony's present economic \nprosperity after 1997.\n  In closing, let me reiterate that we are not seeking to meddle in \nGreat Britain and China's purely bilateral affairs. But, where the \nactions of either party might effect the business climate in Hong \nKong--and thus international investment--I believe that we have a \nlegitimate reason for showing interest, and the parties can be sure \nthat we will. This is our message to Beijing.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6827-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6828-S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THOUGHTFUL HOMILY OF MOST REV. EDWARD M. EGAN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I recently came across a copy of \na homily delivered last year by the Most Rev. Edward M. Egan, bishop of \nBridgeport, that I believe is worthy of inclusion in the Record.\n  With so much debate of late about the quality of public discourse in \nthis country, the words of Bishop Egan remind us of the need to be \nrespectful of the heartfelt opinions of others, no matter how strongly \nwe might disagree with their point of view.\n  The bishop's homily was delivered at the red Mass at Saint Matthew's \nCathedral here in Washington on October 2, 1994. The red Mass is an \nannual Mass celebrated for people involved in the legal profession and \nthe bishop urges lawyers, as ``protectors of thought and its free \nexpression,'' to do all they can to protect the speech of those who \nutter unpopular beliefs and to ensure that all people in our society \nare allowed to enter the national dialogue over the issues that govern \nour fate. Speaking to leaders of the legal community, including the \nAttorney General, and members of the Supreme Court, Bishop Egan \ncautioned that lawyers must ``insist that the unapproved point of view \nbe heard and explored.''\n  Bishop Egan has provided wonderful leadership in his time in \nConnecticut in so many different ways. I am proud to consider him a \nfriend. Whether my colleagues agree or disagree with all of Bishop \nEgan's words and examples regarding political correctness, I know they \nwill find his homily to be eloquent and thought-providing. It is in \nthat spirit that I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The homily follows:\n  [[Page S6829]]\n  \n      Homily of the Most Rev. Edward M. Egan, Bishop of Bridgeport\n\n       Your Excellency, Archbishop Cacciavillan, Reverend Clergy, \n     Members of the John Carroll Society, Distinguished \n     Representatives of the Bench and Bar, and Friends All:\n       This past summer, in Canton in the South of China, I sat in \n     a hotel restaurant with a Chinese tour-guide who spoke \n     English quite well. He had brought a busload of tourists to a \n     store that sold porcelain and silk; and once they were safely \n     inside, he invited me to join him for a cup of tea.\n       He was forty-five years of age, he told me. In his youth he \n     had dreamed of mastering the English language and French as \n     well. However, in the second year of his university studies, \n     the so-called Cultural Revolution had intervened.\n       His eyes flashed as he described that decade of madness in \n     China. He and dozens of his fellow students had been forced \n     to watch two of their professors killed in a public square by \n     a government-inspired mob. He had stood at attention for \n     hours on several occasions as thousands of books from the \n     university library were destroyed in bonfires. And in due \n     course, he had been taken to the West of China to labor for \n     three years on collective farms, his whereabouts unknown to \n     family and friends.\n       ``What,'' I asked him, ``were the leaders of the Cultural \n     Revolution hoping to achieve with all of this?''\n       ``They wanted the people to stop having unapproved \n     thoughts,'' he replied. ``They felt that the nation could \n     prosper only if all were thinking in the same way--their way, \n     the approved way.''\n       He winced a bit as he offered this explanation but was \n     clearly convinced that his analysis was correct. For he \n     repeated it word for word as he stared into his empty teacup: \n     ``They felt that the nation could prosper only if all were \n     thinking in the same way--their way, the approved way.''\n       You and I, my dear friends, are privileged to live in a \n     land in which the imposition of thought by government is \n     rejected out of hand. And in no small measure we have the \n     legal profession to thank for this blessing.\n       It was lawyers like Montesquieu and Montaigne who were \n     crucial in developing the basic political ideas of our free \n     society. Twenty-five of the fifty-six who signed the \n     Declaration of Independence, with its cry for justice and \n     equality, were practicing attorneys. Even more, the \n     fundamental charters of our nation, such as the Constitution \n     and the Bill of Rights, with their uncompromising commitments \n     to freedom of thought, were largely the work of legal experts \n     with names like Jefferson, Adams, Wilson, Jay, Wythe, and \n     Marshall.\n       Still, there are in our country today rumblings in many \n     quarters about thoughts that are approved and thoughts that \n     are not. Thus, the expression, ``politically correct,'' has \n     become a staple in our vocabularies. Indeed, over the past \n     year or two it has graduated to the level of a familiar \n     abbreviation. Few there are who do not know the meaning of \n     ``p.c.''\n       One is politically correct, we understand, when one agrees \n     with the ``important'' newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, \n     the ``best'' commentators, the ``most influential'' \n     personalities. Nor can there be any doubt that this \n     understanding is operating with remarkable efficiency. From \n     Atlantic to Pacific, the vast majority of adult Americans are \n     able to identify with extraordinary ease and accuracy those \n     ideas, positions, and thoughts which are today in our land \n     ``correct'' or, if you prefer, ``approved.''\n       The Readings from Sacred Scripture in our Mass this morning \n     remind us of two cases in point. The first of these Readings, \n     from the Book of Genesis, is among the most familiar in all \n     of Holy Writ. It speaks of the mind of the Divinity as \n     regards the basics of the human condition. The male, we read, \n     was from the time of creation not to be left alone. Rather, \n     he was to be joined by a companion, a partner, a wife, so \n     that together they might live out their years, two in fact \n     but one in heart and love. And from that love was to result a \n     miracle within the wife, a miracle before which every \n     generation since creation has stood in awe.\n       In our time, however, the miracle has become as well a \n     source of controversy. Simply put, the matter under \n     discussion is\n      this: May society stand idly by while a private party puts a \n     violent end to the miracle?\n       Those who have embraced the ``approved'' thinking, the \n     ``correct'' thinking, answer with a resounding ``yes.'' The \n     miracle, they allege, may be killed with impunity.\n       Others, however, dare to sing outside the chorus. Their \n     reasoning should not be difficult to understand. The being \n     within the mother, they note, gives strong indications of \n     being a human being, a person with an inalienable right to \n     live. Certainly, no one has ever been able to prove the \n     contrary. Hence, they conclude, society has no choice but to \n     fulfill its most fundamental duty as regards the being in \n     question. It must protect it against attack.\n       There is no hint of religion in any of this unapproved \n     thinking, though many religious people, for a multitude of \n     religious reasons, support it. There is no mention of \n     doctrine, dogma, sacred writings, or anything of the sort. At \n     issue are only matters which are properly and strictly \n     matters of the law: the meaning of personhood, the basic \n     rights of individuals, the power of legal presumptions, and \n     the most elementary and essential duties of society. These \n     and nothing more.\n       Still, there is a tactic abroad in our land to characterize \n     the unapproved thinking as exclusively religious and to \n     refuse to allow it a fair hearing on this score. The tactic \n     is clever, widespread, and effective. It should also be \n     frightening to all who cherish the free and honorable \n     exchange of ideas, positions, and thoughts--lawyers first and \n     foremost.\n       The Gospel Reading, too, calls to mind a controversy of our \n     time in which only certain thoughts appear to be approved.\n       The Lord, in the lovely account of Saint Luke, instructs \n     His closest followers not to keep children from Him. ``Let \n     them come to Me, do not hinder them,'' He says, ``for it is \n     to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.''\n       Parents there are, to be sure, who would not be comfortable \n     with having their children, the miracles of their love, \n     accept such an invitation. And in this free land of ours \n     their point of view is properly and vigorously protected. But \n     other parents there are who firmly believe that the \n     invitation of the Lord is most worthy, parents who wish their \n     offspring to be educated according to the mind and will of \n     the One Whom they call their God.\n       The thought of this second group is, of course, unapproved; \n     and the tactic for dismissing it is well-known. All monies \n     that governments collect to support schools, it is announced, \n     must go only to those institutions in which every mention of \n     the Divinity is outlawed. For otherwise, the state would be \n     sustaining religion.\n       But when such a rule is implemented, the unapproved \n     thinkers protest, is not irreligion being sustained? Why \n     erect a wall only between religion and the state? Why not \n     erect another, no less high, between the state and \n     irreligion? Or more to the point: Why not simply concede to \n     all parents equally the right to\n      choose the schools of their children and to share in the \n     funds gathered by society to support them.\n       The plea is somehow ruled out of order. The ``important'' \n     newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, the ``best'' \n     commentators, the ``most influential'' personalities have \n     spoken. It remains, it would seem, for lawyers to insist that \n     the unapproved point of view be heard and explored. For they \n     are uniquely positioned to do this as counselors, judges, \n     writers, thinkers, and legislators; and what is more: they \n     have a long and noble tradition in this land of respecting \n     and defending thought, even when it is ``unapproved.''\n       But the second Reading of our Mass this morning, from the \n     Epistle to the Hebrews, provides yet another reason for \n     lawyers to address the aforementioned issues of unapproved \n     thinking and any others that come to mind. That reason is, I \n     confess, plainly and exquisitely religious. It is simply \n     this: We are all children of the one Father in heaven; hence, \n     we have no choice but to listen to one another with \n     attention, concern, and love.\n       Many years ago I pastored a parish on the Southside of \n     Chicago. The community was African-American. In fact, one of \n     my parishioners often reminded me that I was very likely the \n     only white voter in the precinct.\n       My closest adviser was a retired army major who spent many \n     an evening chatting with me about life in the distressed \n     neighborhoods of the Windy City.\n       ``Father,'' he used to tell me, ``we are never going to be \n     the nation we should be as long as any of us are kept out of \n     the national conversation. We've got to find some powerful \n     folks to let us all in.''\n       This morning, thanks to the very kind invitation of the \n     Archbishop of Washington, James Cardinal Hickey, I have the \n     honor to speak to just such ``powerful folks.'' Over the past \n     thirty years, we as a nation have learned that the Black \n     community must be a respected participant in the ``national \n     conversation.'' We are every day becoming more aware that the \n     same is true of the Hispanic community. I pray that now is \n     the time for the religious community as well. And I pray too \n     that lawyers will lead the way in this regard, not only \n     because of their historic position as protectors of thought \n     and its free expression but also, and especially, because \n     they realize, indeed, embrace in faith, that we are all \n     children of one God, sisters and brothers who need--and have \n     a right--to be heard.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6828-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6829-S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO MR. DARWIN HINDMAN AND THE DOLPHIN DEFENDERS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto Mr. Darwin Hindman of Columbia, MO, and the Dolphin Defenders of St. \nLouis, MO. These outstanding Missourians are among 15 honorees \nnationwide to receive this year's Chevron-Times Mirror Magazines \nConservation Award. This honor is being bestowed in recognition of the \ncontributions made by Mr. Hindman and the Dolphin Defenders to \nenvironmental conservation and development. I congratulate them for \ntheir highly notable achievements and encourage their continued efforts \nto create balanced solutions to natural resources problems.\n  Mr. Darwin Hindman, Jr., the newly elected mayor of Columbia and \npresident of Missouri Rails Trails Foundation, Inc., is one of five \nreceiving the Citizen Volunteer Award. Mr. Hindman [[Page S6830]] is \nresponsible for establishing Katy Trail State Park along the north bank \nof the Missouri River. Through his public activism and fundraising \nefforts, Mr. Hindman successfully spearheaded creation of the Katy \nTrail that follows the historic Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804 to \n1806. Mr. Hindman also was instrumental in developing the MKT Fitness/\nNature Trail. Mr. Hindman and the foundation are working with the State \nand others to expand the Katy Trail, with the goal of extending it \nacross the State.\n  The Dolphin Defenders of St. Louis is a group of more than 50 inner \ncity children working to restore their neighborhood by improving the \nenvironment. Their name comes from the group's desire to mimic dolphin \nbehavior of protecting each other from danger. The Dolphin Defenders \nrevitalized a once trash laden vacant lot used by drug dealers and \nabusers into a beautiful environmental retreat now known as the \nPromised Land. The group has also recognized children surviving in \nviolent communities by planting 31 trees on Arbor Day in Visitation \nPark. The Dolphin Defenders are one of five nonprofit organizations/\npublic agencies to receive this year's Conservation Award. Moneys \nraised from the youth group's continuous collection and recycling of \ntires and glass bottles enable the Dolphin Defenders to pursue new \nenvironmental projects.\n  The honorees will be recognized at an awards dinner on May 17 in \nWashington, DC, and will receive a $2,000 award along with a bronze \nplaque acknowledging their achievements and continued efforts to \nenhance the environment. The awards program was established in 1954 by \nthe late Ed Zern, a nationally recognized sportsman, humorist, author, \nand former columnist for Field & Stream. Nearly 900 individuals and \norganizations have received this award since its conception to honor \nindividuals and groups who protect and enhance renewable natural \nresources.\n  My sincerest congratulations to Mr. Hindman and the Dolphin Defenders \nfor their significant accomplishments and contributions to conservation \nand the environment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6829-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6830-S6833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR POSITIONS\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on April 7, 1995, the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources filed the report to accompany S. 610, a \nbill to provide for a visitor center at the Civil War Battlefield of \nCorinth, MS.\n  At the time this report was filed, the Department of the Interior had \nnot submitted its position regarding this measure. The committee has \nsince received this communication from the Department of the Interior, \nand I ask that it be printed in the Record for the advice of the \nSenate.\n  The communication follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Legislation authorizing the construction \n     of a visitor center at Corinth, Mississippi, S. 610, has been \n     reported out of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. In addition to providing for a visitor center, \n     which would be administered as part of Shiloh National \n     Military Park, the bill authorizes the Secretary to mark \n     sites associated with the Siege and Battle of Corinth \n     National Historic Landmark.\n       On July 25, 1994, we testified before the House \n     Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands \n     regarding the proposed visitor center at the Civil War \n     Battlefield of Corinth. In our testimony we opposed \n     construction of an interpretive center at Corinth. We believe \n     such a facility is unnecessary given the presence of the \n     National Park Service visitor center at nearby Shiloh \n     Military Park. A visitor center at Corinth is particularly \n     difficult to justify in light of current fiscal constraints. \n     The cost estimate for the proposed 5,300-square-foot \n     interpretive center is $6 million which includes the cost of \n     development, operation and maintenance for 5 years.\n       We continue to oppose proposals to construct a visitor \n     center at Corinth. The current legislation, S. 610, would \n     give the National Park Service primary responsibility for \n     interpreting the story of Corinth. We believe this \n     responsibility rests more appropriately at the local level. \n     It is not fiscally possible for the National Park Service to \n     have interpretive centers at every significant site \n     associated with the Civil War. We believe we can \n     appropriately relate the story of the Civil War in this area \n     from our current facilities at Shiloh National Military Park.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      George T. Frampton, Jr.,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                                      Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on April 7, 1995, the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources filed the report to accompany H.R. 400, a \nbill to provide for the exchange of lands within Gates of the Arctic \nNational Park and Preserve.\n  At the time this report was filed, the Department of the Interior had \nnot submitted its position regarding this measure. The committee has \nsince received this communication from the Department of the Interior, \nand I ask that it be printed in the Record for the advice of the \nSenate.\n  The material follows:\n\n                              U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n                                    Wasington, DC, April 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express the Department \n     of the Interior (Department) position on H.R. 400, ``To \n     provide for the exchange of lands within Gates of the Arctic \n     National Park and Preserve, and for other purposes,'' as \n     reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \n     The proposed legislation includes two titles which relate to \n     Gates of the Arctic National Park (Title I) and the \n     acquisition of subsurface rights from Koniag, Inc. (Title II) \n     on the Alaska peninsula.\n       We strongly support Title I of H.R. 400, ``Anaktuvuk Pass \n     Land Exchange and Wilderness Redesignation,'' as approved by \n     the Committee. Title I authorizes a land exchange involving \n     the National Park Service (NPS), the Nunamiut Corporation and \n     the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation concerning lands in and \n     around Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. The \n     proposed exchange marks thousands of hours of work and over \n     10 years of negotiations among the affected parties. We \n     believe the proposed exchange would resolve difficult land \n     use issues, improve the management of the Park and benefit \n     the people of Anaktuvuk Pass. Accordingly, the Alaska native \n     community, the Department and private groups all supported \n     the version of H.R. 400 that the House of Representatives \n     passed unanimously on February 1, 1995.\n       As reported to the Senate, however, Title II of H.R. 400, \n     ``Alaska Peninsula Subsurface Consolidation,'' directs the \n     Secretary of the Interior to acquire oil and gas rights and \n     other subsurface interests on the Alaska peninsula from \n     Koniag, Incorporated. We strongly oppose Title II for the \n     following reasons. First, we do not believe that Koniag has \n     valid selections to some of the lands that the proposed \n     legislation would direct the Secretary to acquire. Second, \n     both the NPS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) \n     consider the acquisition of Koniag's mineral interests to be \n     an extremely low priority in terms of the missions of the two \n     agencies. However, even if we were to disregard this factor, \n     there is a third and most critical problem with the bill as \n     currently drafted: we believe that the directed appraisal \n     methodology would establish a significant negative precedent \n     in terms of longstanding and widely accepted appraisal\n      practices. In sum, we believe that the valuation and \n     acquisition of these interests, as directed by Title II, \n     do not serve the interests of the Department, the Federal \n     Government or the public at large.\n       A more detailed statement of our objections follows:\n       1. Status of Koniag entitlements and selections has not yet \n     been determined.--The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as \n     amended, authorizes Koniag to receive the rights to oil and \n     gas and sand and gravel used in connection with exploration \n     and development of the oil and gas to 343,000 acres. However, \n     Koniag has selected approximately 465,158 acres of subsurface \n     estate, an overselection of approximately 122,158 acres:\n       Alaska Peninsula NWR: 266,068 acres of subsurface \n     selections.\n       Becharof NWR: 14,080 acres of subsurface selections.\n       Aniakchak NM and pres.: 185,010 acres of subsurface \n     selections.\n       Total selections: 465,158 acres of subsurface estate.\n       Overselections: 122,158 acres of subsurface estate.\n       Title II does not resolve the issue of Koniag's \n     overselections. It is our understanding that the map \n     referenced in Section 201(8) includes all of Koniag's \n     selections, but does not identify Koniag's 275,000 acre \n     entitlement. The validity of certain Koniag selections is \n     currently the subject of administrative litigation. On \n     October 12, 1993, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \n     rejected a portion of Koniag's selections. Koniag has \n     appealed the BLM decision and the issue is currently before \n     the Interior Board of Land Appeals.\n       Based on the above, we object to proposed legislation which \n     would require the Federal Government to acquire property \n     where the validity of certain selections is under appeal.\n     [[Page S6831]]\n     \n       2. Federal land management agencies have determined that \n     these properties have extremely low priority for acquisition \n     by the Department.--It is our understanding that the proposed \n     subsurface selections have been examined for their economic \n     potential for oil and gas development. We also understand \n     that test wells have been drilled in the area and that the \n     results of the test drilling have not indicated commercially-\n     viable oil and gas deposits. Therefore, we do not believe \n     that the continued private ownership of oil and gas rights \n     within the conservation system units of the Alaskan peninsula \n     would pose a significant threat to refuge or park resources.\n       Title II envisions that the acquisition cost not exceed \n     $300 per acre on average. If this average cost is met, the \n     Federal Government would be required to provide $82.5 million \n     in land assets for these low priority mineral interests. We \n     believe that\n      the market value of these interests, as determined by an \n     approved appraisal, will not exceed a tiny fraction of \n     this envisioned value.\n       3. Proposed appraisal methodology would establish a \n     significant negative precedent for the standard appraisal \n     process.--We strongly oppose several provisions of the bill \n     which direct a specific appraisal methodology.\n       Section 202(b)(2) directs that the appraisal will be \n     conducted according to the standards of the ``Appraisal \n     Foundation,'' and that the ``risk adjusted discounted cash \n     flow methodology'' would be the sole method to establish \n     value. This direction that the appraiser must utilize one \n     single appraisal method violates broadly supported and \n     adopted appraisal principles and would likely lead to \n     inflated values for the subsurface rights at the expense of \n     the taxpayer. This section, therefore, is inconsistent with \n     the Appraisal Foundation standards referred to in the bill.\n       The Federal Government currently uses the Uniform Appraisal \n     Standards for Federal Land Acquisition (UASFLA), a product of \n     the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, which is chaired \n     by the U.S. Department of Justice. Federal and State agencies \n     use these standards to appraise lands for possible \n     acquisition. Federal courts have upheld these uniform \n     standards, which are based on fairness and equity. To support \n     the uniform appraisal standards, the Appraisal Standards \n     Board of the Appraisal Foundation has issued the Uniform \n     Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices.\n       The uniform appraisal standards used by both public and \n     private sectors establish three basic approaches to determine \n     fair market value: sales comparison, income and cost \n     approaches. The standards allow for all three approaches to \n     be considered and weighted according to specified factors.\n       In the case of the Koniag subsurface selections, there is \n     no proven mineral reserve, nor an established market. In \n     these situations, the uniform standards do not favor the \n     discounted cash flow methodology, as directed by Section \n     202(b)(2). In fact, the uniform standards specifically \n     caution against using the discounted cash flow methodology in \n     isolation. When appraising non-producing mineral interests, \n     the market comparison approach is considered the fairest and \n     most equitable appraisal method. Legislation that distorts \n     this process will lead to inequitable transactions and set a \n     harmful precedent that could seriously undermine future land \n     exchanges in Alaska.\n       Congressional action mandating that only one of the several \n     standard appraisal methodologies be used, particularly when \n     that\n      methodology may be totally inappropriate to the \n     circumstances, would render meaningless the principles of \n     fairness and equity that form the basis of the uniform \n     appraisal standards. Such action could encourage land \n     owners throughout the United States to demand that their \n     lands be valued in ways that have not gained acceptance \n     throughout the community of professional appraisers.\n       We also note one additional constraint in Title II that \n     deviates from the standard appraisal practice. In \n     contravention of appraisal ethics and standards, Section 202 \n     of Title II would limit the appraised value to a cap of $300 \n     an acre on average. Based on our desire to maintain the \n     integrity of the appraisal process, we object to imposing a \n     cap on the valuation process, just as we would oppose any \n     artificial floor.\n       4. The mandated timetables would divert personnel and \n     resources from other high priority acquisitions.--With the \n     consent and approval of the Congress, both the NPS and the \n     FWS are reducing the number of Federal employees in their \n     respective regions and headquarters offices. The respective \n     realty offices are also facing significant staff and budget \n     reductions in order to meet downsizing and budget targets. \n     The remaining realty staffs are currently working to reach \n     agreements with landowners within the Kodiak National \n     Wildlife Refuge, the Kantishna area of Denali National Park \n     and many other areas in Alaska. Negotiating and implementing \n     a priority land exchange would add to the current workload.\n       Based on the Department's experience in appraising \n     subsurface rights, mineral appraisals require significant \n     expenditures of staff time and appropriated funds to \n     complete. Directing the realty offices to complete these \n     appraisals within the 180 day time period would lead to \n     significant delays in work on the other high priority \n     activities to meet the terms of the proposed legislation.\n       5. Ability to execute appraisals within mandated \n     timetable.--Section 202 of Title II would require an \n     appraiser to submit an appraisal to the Secretary within 180 \n     days after the selection of an appraiser. Given the \n     complexity of the mineral appraisal process of such a large \n     area, and putting aside the issue of the discounted cash flow \n     method, this timetable would at best lead to a hastily \n     prepared appraisal that would not accurately value the rights \n     in question.\n       Because Title II could significantly harm the financial \n     interests of the American taxpayer, would undermine the \n     integrity of the standard appraisal process and would not \n     enhance the protection of natural resources or improve land \n     management, we strongly urge that the Senate not approve \n     Title II. We continue to support passage of Title I of H.R. \n     400, to protect significant natural resources in Gates of the \n     Arctic National Park.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      George T. Frampton, Jr.,\n\n                                      Assistant Secretary for Fish\n                                            and Wildlife and Park.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on March 29, 1995, the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources filed the report to accompany H.R. 694, \nthe Minor Park Boundary Adjustments and Miscellaneous Park Amendments \nAct of 1995.\n  At the time this report was filed, the Department of the Interior had \nnot submitted its position regarding this measure. The committee has \nsince received this communication from the Department of the Interior, \nand I ask that it be printed in the Record for the advice of the \nSenate.\n  The communication follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources favorably reported H.R. 694, the Minor Park \n     Boundary Adjustments and Miscellaneous Park Amendments Act of \n     1995 on March 29. The National Park Service testified in \n     support of this legislation when it was considered in the \n     House, and recommended several amendments. We would like to \n     provide our views on the substitute adopted by the Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee.\n       Sec. 105. Craters of the Moon. The National Park Service \n     supports Section 105, which revises the boundaries of Craters \n     of the Moon National Monument. We prefer the language in the \n     House version of H.R. 694 that authorizes the NPS to acquire \n     ``lands, water, and interests therein'' on the land being \n     included in the boundary adjustment. One of the primary \n     reasons for the boundary adjustment is to protect the \n     monument's potable water source and ``waters'' is not \n     currently included in the Senate version of Section 105.\n       Sec. 108. New River Gorge, Sec. 109. Gauley River, and Sec. \n     110. Bluestone River. We have no objection to the boundary \n     changes to existing units proposed in these sections. These \n     sections would amend the boundaries by including uneconomical \n     remnants, a large parcel proposed for donation, and two State \n     parks. The addition of the State parks would not change the \n     management of either State park.\n       Sec. 201. Advisory Commissions. This section would extend \n     advisory commissions for Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical \n     Park and Women's Rights National Historical Park. On February \n     10, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12838, \n     ``Termination and Limitation of Federal Advisory \n     Committees,'' ordering each agency to prepare a detailed \n     review of all existing advisory committees. As a general \n     policy, the Administration does not support provisions that \n     would establish or reauthorize advisory commissions; however, \n     with respect to Kaloko-Honokohau, given the limited extension \n     requested and the unique circumstances in this case, the \n     Administration has no objection to this short extension.\n       Sec. 203. Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. We \n     recommend enactment of this section, which would clarify the \n     authority of the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands \n     or interests in lands with appropriated funds. Passage of \n     this section would enable the NPS to use monies in the Land \n     and Water Conservation Fund for a specific parcel without \n     necessitating an Act of Congress to authorize each purchase. \n     We believe the proposed\n      amendments would enable us to respond to conservation and \n     recreation opportunities as they arise within the \n     authorized area of the park.\n       Sec. 204. William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom. The \n     President's budget estimate for fiscal year 1996 for the NPS \n     includes funds for the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom \n     in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The \n     classroom is a nonprofit organization, which operates an \n     environmental and special multicultural program in the Los \n     Angeles area that serves some 100,000 people annually, \n     including many inner-city elementary school children. The \n     language of this section would provide the authorization \n     necessary for the classroom to receive funding and for the \n     Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative \n     agreements. [[Page S6832]] \n       Sec. 206. Gauley Access, and Sec. 207. Visitor Center. We \n     recommend that these sections be deleted from the bill. The \n     public comment period on the Draft General Management Plan \n     (GMP) for Gauley River NRA ended in November 1994. Those \n     comments are guiding the completion of the final plan, which \n     will address the issue of a visitor contact facility and will \n     recommend locations for river access. We continue to maintain \n     that the general management planning process should be the \n     proper vehicle for determining the location of visitor \n     facilities within Gauley River NRA. It is anticipated the \n     plan will be released by the end of 1995.\n       Sec. 205, Miscellaneous Provisions, Sec. 208. Extension, \n     and Sec. 209, Bluestone River Public Access. We support \n     extending the provisions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act \n     for a 5-year period for segments of the Bluestone and Meadow \n     Rivers previously studied and determined eligible for wild \n     and scenic river designation. The general provisions relating \n     to cooperative agreements and remnant land for Bluestone \n     River Public Access are acceptable to the Department. We \n     recommend that any remnants purchased pursuant to Sec. 205 be \n     automatically included within the boundary of that park unit. \n     The costs of implementing the above sections, if amended as \n     we have suggested, would be between $1.5 million and $2 \n     million in additional land acquisition for the three existing \n     NPS units.\n       Sec. 305. Volunteers in the Parks. The National Park \n     Service increasingly relies on volunteers in many program \n     areas and reaps many benefits from this program. We recommend \n     the elimination of any cap on this appropriation as it would \n     allow for any budgetary increases that may be adopted in \n     future years.\n       Sec. 306. Cooperative Agreements for Research. The Senate \n     version allows the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements \n     with several entities, including ``private conservation \n     organizations.'' We prefer that this authority reflect \n     similar language in 16 U.S.C. 753, which allows the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to establish Cooperative Research Units with \n     ``non-profit organizations.'' The House version deleted this \n     authority completely.\n       Sec. 306. Carl Garner Cleanup Day. We have no objection to \n     establishment of the Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day.\n       Sec. 307. Corinth Interpretive Center. In addition to \n     providing for a visitor center, which would be administered \n     as part of Shiloh National Military Park, this section \n     authorizes the Secretary to mark sites associated with the \n     Siege and Battle of Corinth National Historic Landmark.\n       We oppose construction of an interpretive center at \n     Corinth. We believe such a facility is unnecessary given the \n     presence of the National Park Service visitor center at \n     nearby Shiloh Military Park. A visitor center at Corinth is \n     particularly difficult to justify in light of current fiscal \n     constraints. The cost estimate for the proposed 5,300-square-\n     foot interpretive center is $6 million, which includes the \n     cost of development, operation, and maintenance for 5 years.\n       We support each of the other sections not specifically \n     mentioned in this letter. However, we note that the \n     committee-reported bill does not include the extinguishment \n     of a reservation for the Army Corps of Engineers to deposit \n     dredging spoils at Fort Pulaski National Monument. We support \n     the House provision eliminating this reservation as the \n     reserved area contains two significant historic structures \n     listed on the National Register of Historic Places and \n     significant natural resource values. Extinguishment of this \n     reservation would assure permanent protection of these \n     values.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      George T. Frampton, Jr.,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                                      Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on April 7, 1995, the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources filed individual reports to accompany S. \n115, Colonial Park land conveyance; S. 127, Women's Rights NHP \namendments; S. 134, FDR Family land acquisition; S. 188, Great Falls \nHistoric District; S. 197, Carl Garner Federal Lands Cleanup Day; S. \n223, Sterling Forest land acquisition; S. 357, Kaloko-Honokohau \nadvisory commission; S. 392, Dayton American Heritage amendment; S. \n551, Hagerman Fossil Beds and Craters of the Moon boundary change; S. \n587, Old Spanish Trail study; and S. 601, Blackstone Heritage Area \nrevision.\n  At the time these reports were filed, the Department of the Interior \nhad not submitted its position regarding these measures. The Committee \nhas since received a communication from the Department of the Interior, \nregarding these bills, and I ask that it be printed in the Record for \nthe advice of the Senate.\n  The communication follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources recently reported several bills. The National Park \n     Service testified in support of similar versions of many of \n     these bills in the 103rd Congress. The following provides the \n     National Park Service's position on most of the bills \n     reported.\n\n\n               s. 115, colonial (va) park land conveyance\n\n       S. 115, which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \n     acquire and convey certain lands or interests in lands to \n     improve the management, protection, and administration of \n     Colonial National Historical Park, was reported with an \n     amendment to conform it to the bill approved by the committee \n     last year. The amendment struck the provisions which would \n     have allowed for the expansion of a specific area of Colonial \n     Parkway and in turn would have permitted the acquisition of \n     property immediately adjacent to the parkway. The property in \n     question has been subdivided and development of such will \n     result in a major visual intrusion to the parkway. The \n     Department of the Interior/National Park Service strongly \n     supported this section of S. 115. If a boundary expansion for \n     this area of the Colonial Parkway is not enacted by Congress, \n     the National Park Service will not be able to purchase this \n     land and it will be developed.\n       We support the provisions of S. 115 that would allow the \n     National Park Service to transfer the sewage systems to York \n     County, Virginia. We urge the Senate to consider restoring \n     the boundary adjustment and acquisition provisions struck by \n     the committee on March 15, 1995, when S. 115 comes before the \n     entire Senate for consideration.\n\n\n               S. 127, Women's Rights NHP (NY) amendments\n\n       S. 127, which would improve the administration of the \n     Women's Rights National Historical Park in the State of New \n     York, was reported from committee with the same amendments as \n     in 1994. These amendments delineate the properties the \n     National Park Service may acquire at Women's Rights NHP. A \n     property is also removed from the park. The development/land \n     acquisition ceiling is increased by $2 million to cover the \n     expenses which will be incurred for the permitted expansion. \n     The National Park Service has no objection to S. 127 as \n     reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \n     on March 15, 1995, and supports the legislation as amended.\n                S. 134, FDR family land (NY) acquisition\n\n       S. 134, which would provide for the acquisition of certain \n     lands formerly occupied by the Franklin D. Roosevelt family, \n     was approved by the committee with the same amendments \n     adopted in 1994. These amendments delineate specifically the \n     properties the National Park Service may acquire at the \n     Roosevelt Sites. Although we did not testify about specific \n     lands, the amended language, which delineates the tracts, \n     addresses the National Park Service's concerns for protecting \n     property at the Roosevelt Sites. The National Park Service \n     has no objection to S. 134 as reported by the Senate Energy \n     and Natural Resources Committee on March 15, 1995, and \n     supports the legislation as amended.\n\n\n               S. 188, great falls (NJ) historic district\n\n       S. 188, which would establish the Great Falls Historic \n     District in the State of New Jersey, was approved by the \n     committee with language similar to a bill reported from the \n     committee in September 1994, requiring a 50 percent local \n     match and limiting Federal funds. This language supports the \n     National Park Service's position and belief that defining the \n     maximum funding and requiring local participation through \n     matching funds is appropriate and necessary to limiting \n     National Park Service involvement in a site that is not a \n     unit of the National Park System.\n\n\n             S. 197, carl garner federal lands cleanup day\n\n       We have no objection to the enactment of S. 197, a bill \n     that recognizes the contribution of Carl Garner to our \n     Federal lands cleanup efforts. This is consistent with the \n     position the Department took on this legislation when we \n     testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands, \n     National Parks and Forest in the 103rd Congress. Carl Garner \n     originated this day, and we feel it is appropriate to include \n     his name in the official title.\n\n\n            S. 223, Sterling Forest (NY/NJ) land acquisition\n\n       The National Park Service (NPS) supports S. 223, the \n     ``Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1995'', as approved by \n     the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In the \n     103rd Congress, the NPS had opposed the original Sterling \n     Forest legislation that was introduced. A substitute was \n     adopted and subsequently passed the Senate, which addressed \n     the concerns of the NPS and the Department of the Interior. \n     The bill just reported from the committee, S. 233, reflects \n     our view that Department of Interior/National Park Service \n     involvement in Sterling Forest be limited to areas adjacent \n     to the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\n           S. 357, Kaloko-Honokohau (HI) advisory commission\n\n       S. 357 would extend the advisory commission for Kaloko-\n     Honokohau National Historical Park. On February 10, 1993, the \n     President issued Executive Order 12838, ``Termination and \n     Limitation of Federal Advisory Committees,'' ordering each \n     agency to prepare a detailed review of all existing advisory \n     committees. As a general policy, the Administration does not \n     support provisions that would [[Page S6833]] establish or \n     reauthorize advisory commissions; however, given the unique \n     circumstances in this case, the Administration has no \n     objection to this short extension.\n            s. 392, dayton (oh) american heritage amendment\n\n       S. 392 will facilitate the appointment of the Dayton \n     Aviation Heritage Commission. This bill will satisfy the \n     Department of Justice's concern that the process for \n     appointing commission members raises constitutional issues, \n     limiting the Secretary's discretion to appoint members to the \n     commission. These amendments will correct this issue and we \n     support enactment of S. 392.\n\n\n  s. 551, hagerman fossil beds and craters of the moon (id) boundary \n                                 change\n\n       The National Park Service supports S. 551, which would \n     revise the boundaries of Hagerman Fossil Beds National \n     Monument and Craters of the Moon National Monument. Similar \n     legislation was unsuccessful in the past two Congresses. \n     Passage of this legislation is critical to both parks. We \n     recommend however that S. 551 incorporate language from the \n     House version of H.R. 694 regarding Craters of the Moon \n     National Monument. That language authorizes the NPS to \n     acquire ``lands, waters, and interests therein'' for the area \n     of the boundary adjustment. One of the primary reasons for \n     the boundary adjustment is to protect the monument's potable \n     water source and ``waters'' is not currently included in S. \n     551.\n\n\n             s. 587, old spanish trail (co/nm/nv/ca) study\n\n       The National Park Service supports S. 587, which authorizes \n     the study of the Old Spanish Trail for potential inclusion \n     into the National Trails System as a national historic trail. \n     The present language is not specific, however, as to whether \n     national historic or national scenic trail status is sought. \n     Because of the existing highway and other development along \n     the trail we do not believe it would meet the national scenic \n     trail criteria. We recommend the bill be amended to limit the \n     study to national historic trail feasibility, which would \n     greatly reduce study cost and time to complete the project. \n     In addition, we recommend that the legislation be broadened \n     to allow study of all components of the Old Spanish Trail, \n     including the Dominguez-Escalante Trail, to assure a fair and \n     complete assessment of the trail, and if designation is \n     recommended, to allow inclusion of the trail's best \n     components.\n\n\n           s. 601, blackstone (ma/ri) heritage area revision\n\n       S. 601, would revise the boundaries of the Blackstone River \n     Valley National Heritage Corridor in Massachusetts and Rhode \n     Island. The bill approved by the Senate committee is the same \n     bill reported by the committee in September 1994. The \n     National Park Service supports S. 601, however, it does not \n     address the Department of Justice's concern regarding \n     appointments to Federal Advisory Committees. We will be happy \n     to provide the committee draft language to resolve this \n     concern. We hope the Senate will take this matter into \n     consideration before it takes final action on S. 601.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      George T. Frampton, Jr.,\n\n                                  Assistant Secretary for Fish and\n                                       Wildlife and Parks.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6830-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6833-S6835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       ALASKA POWER ADMINISTRATION ASSET SALE AND TERMINATION ACT\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 395) to authorize and direct the Secretary \nof Energy to sell the Alaska Power Marketing Administration, and for \nother purposes, as passed by the Senate on Tuesday, May 16, 1995, is as \nfollows:\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n     SEC. 101.

AMENDMENTS TO THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS \n                   ACT.\n\n       Section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)), is amended by striking paragraph (3) in \n     its entirety and inserting the following:\n       ``(3)(A) The Secretary may, in order to--\n       ``(i) promote development or increased production on \n     producing or non-producing leases; or\n       ``(ii) encourage production of marginal resources on \n     producing or non-producing leases; through primary, \n     secondary, or tertiary recovery means, reduce or eliminate \n     any royalty or net profit share set forth in the lease(s). \n     With the lessee's consent, the Secretary may make other \n     modifications to the royalty or net profit share terms of the \n     lease in order to achieve these purposes.\n       ``(B)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act other \n     than this subparagraph, with respect to any lease or unit in \n     existence on the date of enactment of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act meeting the requirements \n     of this subparagraph, no royalty payments shall be due on new \n     production, as defined in clause (iv) of this subparagraph, \n     from any lease or unit located in water depths of 200 meters \n     or greater in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the \n     Gulf of Mexico, including that portion of the Eastern \n     Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico encompassing whole lease \n     blocks lying west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, \n     until such volume of production as determined pursuant to \n     clause (ii) has been produced by the lessee.\n       ``(ii) Upon submission of a complete application by the \n     lessee, the Secretary shall determine within 180 days of such \n     application whether new production from such lease or unit \n     would be economic in the absence of the relief from the \n     requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of \n     this subparagraph. In making such determination, the \n     Secretary shall consider the increased technological and \n     financial risk of deep water development and all costs \n     associated with exploring, developing, and producing from the \n     lease. The lessee shall provide information required for a \n     complete application to the Secretary prior to such \n     determination. The Secretary shall clearly define the \n     information required for a complete application under this \n     section. Such application may be made on the basis of an \n     individual lease or unit.

If the Secretary \n     determines that such new production would not be economic in \n     the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay \n     royalties provided for by clause (i), the Secretary must \n     determine the volume of production from the lease or unit on \n     which no royalties would be due in order to make such new \n     production economically viable; except that for new \n     production as defined in clause (iv)(aa), in no case will \n     that volume be less than 17.5 million barrels of oil \n     equivalent in water depths of 200 to 400 meters, 52.5 million \n     barrels of oil equivalent in 400-800 meters of water, and \n     87.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water depths \n     greater than 800 meters. Redetermination of the applicability \n     of clause (i) shall be undertaken by the Secretary when \n     requested by the lessee prior to the commencement of the new \n     production and upon significant change in the factors upon \n     which the original determination was made. The Secretary \n     shall make such redetermination within 120 days of submission \n     of a complete application. The Secretary may extend the time \n     period for making any determination or redetermination under \n     this clause for 30 days, or longer if agreed to by the \n     applicant, if circumstances so warrant. The lessee shall be \n     notified in writing of any determination or redetermination \n     and the reasons for and assumptions used for such \n     determination. Any determination or redetermination under \n     this clause shall be a final agency action. The Secretary's \n     determination or redetermination shall be judicially \n     reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative \n     Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 702), only for actions filed within \n     30 days of the Secretary's determination or redetermination.\n       ``(iii) In the event that the Secretary fails to make the \n     determination or redetermination called for in clause (ii) \n     upon application by the lessee within the time period, \n     together with any extension thereof, provided for by clause \n     (ii), no royalty payments shall be due on new production as \n     follows:\n       ``(I) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(I) of \n     this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production \n     according to the schedule of minimum volumes specified in \n     clause (ii) of this subparagraph.\n       ``(II) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(II) of \n     this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production \n     for one year following the start of such production.\n       ``(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `new \n     production' is--\n       ``(I) any production from a lease from which no royalties \n     are due on production, other than test production, prior to \n     the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep \n     Water Royalty Relief Act; or\n       ``(II) any production resulting from lease development \n     activities pursuant to a Development Operations Coordination \n     Document, or supplement thereto that would expand production \n     significantly beyond the level anticipated in the Development \n     Operations Coordination Document, approved by the Secretary \n     after the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf \n     Deep Water Royalty Relief Act.\n       ``(v) During the production of volumes determined pursuant \n     to clauses (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year \n     during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on \n     the New York Mercantile Exchange for light sweet crude oil \n     exceeds $28.00 per barrel, any production of oil will be \n     subject to royalties at the lease stipulated royalty rate. \n     Any production subject to this clause shall be counted toward \n     the production volume determined pursuant to clause (ii) or \n     (iii). Estimated royalty payments will be made if such \n     average of the closing prices for the previous year exceeds \n     $28.00. After the end of the calendar year, when the new \n     average price can be calculated, lessees will pay any \n     royalties due, with interest but without penalty, or can \n     apply for a refund, with interest, of any overpayment.\n       ``(vi) During the production of volumes determined pursuant \n     to clause (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year \n     during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on \n     the New York Mercantile Exchange for natural gas exceeds \n     $3.50 per million British thermal units, any production of \n     natural gas will be subject to royalties at the lease \n     stipulated royalty rate.

Res. 121) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n       Whereas Angola has suffered one of the most violent and \n     longest-running civil wars;\n       Whereas the United States was actively engaged in the war \n     in Angola, has provided more than $200 million in \n     humanitarian assistance to Angola since 1992, and has been a \n     [[Page S6836]] key facilitator on the ongoing peace \n     negotiations;\n       Whereas Angola is the last civil conflict in southern \n     Africa, and regional leaders including South African \n     President Nelson Mandela consider its resolution to be a top \n     priority;\n       Whereas an enduring peace in Angola, a potentially wealthy \n     country that is central to regional stability and economic \n     development, is in the national interest of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Government of Angola and National Union for the \n     Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) entered into the Lusaka \n     Protocol in November 1994 to secure a U.N.-supervised peace \n     settlement;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council voted in \n     February to send a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Angola to \n     monitor and enforce the peace process, and more than 600 \n     international monitors are deployed throughout the country;\n       Whereas continuing progress toward peace makes it more \n     likely that further deployment of UNAVEM III will occur soon;\n       Whereas the meeting between President Eduardo dos Santos \n     and Dr. Jonas Savimbi on May 6, 1995, at which both parties \n     reiterated their commitment to the Lusaka Protocol, \n     demonstrated that they possess the essential political will \n     to resolve outstanding issues, and encouraged all who want \n     peace in Angola;\n       Whereas achieving a lasting peace will require that all \n     Angolans work together to overcome bitter legacies of war, \n     which include a devastated infrastructure, millions of \n     unexploded landmines, a profound distrust between the \n     parties, weakened civil institutions, a crippled economy, and \n     a generation of young Angolans who have never known a \n     peaceful, civil society;\n       Whereas strong leadership is essential to ensure that the \n     wealth of Angola, long spent on war, now is used to \n     consolidate peace. Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate:\n       (1) Congratulates the people of Angola for the courageous \n     and determined steps their leaders have taken in support of \n     peace;\n       (2) Urges all parties in Angola to continue to strengthen \n     their commitment to the Lusaka process, which constitutes the \n     last, and best, chance for securing an enduring peace;\n       (3) Affirms that the United States will hold both Angolan \n     parties responsible for abiding by their commitment to peace; \n     and\n       (4) Calls upon the international community to remain \n     actively engaged in support of national reconciliation, \n     removal of landmines, economic development, and \n     democratization in Angola.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6835-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 18, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will begin consideration of the budget resolution tomorrow at \nnoon, so I think Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout the day \ntomorrow, probably late into the evening, and again on Friday and, as I \nsaid earlier, on Monday. Because it is our desire to finish the budget \nresolution either on late Tuesday or Wednesday. And then if possible, \ntake up the antiterrorism measure before the recess, which begins on \nFriday of next week. I just urge my colleagues, alert my colleagues \nthere will be votes unless something happens I am not aware of on \nFriday and on Monday.\n  So, please plan your schedules accordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/17/senate-section/article/S6836-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
