For the information of all Senators, this morning the \nSenate will resume consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. \nThere is a pending committee amendment which I understand will need a \nshort-time limitation for debate prior to a vote. I hope we will reach \na consent agreement shortly with respect to that amendment so that all \nMembers can be notified as to when the first rollcall vote can be \nexpected.\n  Additionally, I ask for the cooperation of all Senators who have \namendments to this measure, to be available during the day so that we \nmay dispose of those amendments and complete action on the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill during today's session. Also, the Senate may \nconsider a resolution regarding the current situation in Iraq. \nTherefore, Senators should be prepared for rollcall votes throughout \nthe day. As a reminder, the Senate will recess between the hours of \n12:30 and 2:15 for the weekly policy conferences to meet.\n  Mr. President, I do wish to commend the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland for her work yesterday. I know she and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], did some \npreliminary statements and disposed of some work that could be \naccomplished, and that is very positive. I appreciate their time.\n  I think it is only fair and respectful of the two leaders of this \nsubcommittee that the Members come over here and offer their amendments \nand let us do our work. I hope that the two Senators who have worked so \nhard on this good legislation do not have to stand here and look at \neach other without some action taking place. As pleasant as that may \nbe, I know instead they would like to be dealing with Senators who have \nlegitimate amendments that may be offered.\n  I understand there are three or four serious amendments that have to \nbe offered and debated and probably voted on. Some others hopefully can \nbe worked out. But we must keep our eye on the ball. The thing that we \nhave to get done this week and for the next couple of weeks is these \nappropriations bills. It is the Senate's responsibility. Right after \nthis bill, we will go in short order to Interior appropriations and \nthen Treasury-Postal Service next week, and hopefully then I guess the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill, and finally Labor-HHS.\n  It is my intent, with the cooperation of the Democratic leader and \nall of our colleagues, to get through all of these appropriations bills \nin an expeditious manner. In order to do that, we are not going to be \nable to bring up a lot of other bills that do not have very tight time \nagreements, maybe not even if they do have time agreements. Until we \ncomplete these appropriations bills, I am going to do everything I can \nto limit the distractions, including issues that may cause us to start \ntangling with each other unnecessarily, so that we can hopefully have a \nspirit of cooperation and dedication in getting this work done.\n  I want to reiterate what I read in my opening statement. We did not \nget a response until 6:30 Monday afternoon in terms of some language \nperhaps that we could work out on the Iraqi situation. The appropriate \nSenators now are involved. Staff members are working. We hope we can \nget something worked out. We cannot give 2, 3, 4 hours to a resolution \nof this nature. Hopefully, we can come to something that is agreed to \nand bipartisan, and we can just have a vote that would be unanimous and \nmove forward. But I am working in good faith to try to accomplish that.\n\n  I want to plead again to Senators. Come on over and do the work. \nThese two Senators were jerked around considerably before the recess \nbecause they were ready to go, and we indicated that we were going to \ngo to their bill before the August recess. We did not get to it. But \nnow we are here, and they are doing good work. Let us give them our \ncooperation and get this bill done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the majority leader for his very kind words \nabout the way we have tried to move the bill. We, too, urge our \ncolleagues to come over, particularly those who now have an amendment \nthat they wish to bring to the floor. We were open for business \nyesterday, did 4 hours of very good, yeoman work. I think both sides of \nthe aisle want to move the bill. We would like to concentrate on the \nmajor amendments, space station and veterans health care, and if others \nwould just come over and discuss them with us, we believe we can iron \nsome of them out and move ahead.\n  I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9777-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3666, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3666) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Bond amendment No. 5167, to further amend certain \n     provisions relating to housing.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the parliamentary situation in which \nwe find ourselves is this particular provision dealing with the Bion \nProgram in NASA was included in the House bill. The committee amendment \nstruck the House prohibition on those activities.\n  So, procedurally, the people who want to maintain the amendment will, \nafter discussion, move to table the committee amendment, which is, I \nbelieve, the pending business. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Therefore, we can begin the discussion whenever the \nproponents wish. The tabling motion will come at the end of the \ndiscussion. We would like to make sure that everyone who wants to be \nheard on this issue has an opportunity. We do not yet have a time \nagreement. We talked about 2 hours last night. I would like to know \nfrom the proponents, and will be discussing with them, how much time we \nneed. There are some on our side who wish to maintain the amendment.\n  I hope we can wrap up the debate in fairly short order this morning \nand then move to the tabling motion. But I reserve my comments on the \nissue until those who are proponents have an opportunity to present \ntheir views.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I think that is a very good way to proceed. Hopefully, \nwe can conclude this before 11:30 and then be able to move to the Iraqi \namendment, so when we come back after the conference we can dispose of \nboth of those and be then ready to continue to move the bill. That is \nkind of the way I see it.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the ranking member for her very helpful \nsuggestions. My view is we are now open for business for the next hour \nor so. We could have a very spirited debate on this important issue, \nand I hope then we will be in a position to resolve it.\n  I ask my colleague from New Hampshire if he is ready to proceed. If \nso, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n         Excepted Committee Amendment on Page 104, Lines 21-24\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the pending amendment is a committee \namendment to strike the language in the bill, as the Senator from \nMissouri has just indicated, that prohibits funding from being used for \nthe so-called Bion 11 and 12 missions. The amendment will prevent the \nwaste of approximately $15.5 million on wasteful research involving \nsending Russian primates into space. Let me repeat that, because one \nmay wonder why we are spending money to send Russian primates into \nspace. I wonder that myself, but that is what we are talking about. \nWhat we are trying to do is prevent the waste of $15.5 million of \ntaxpayer money involving research--and it is wasteful research--sending \nRussian primates into space.\n  I would also like the record to reflect that Senators Feingold, \nHelms, Kerry of Massachusetts, D'Amato, and Bumpers have joined me in \nopposition to funding for this Bion Program. It is a bipartisan group \nof Senators, as you can tell, crossing the whole political spectrum. I \nbelieve Senator Feingold will be speaking on the issue, if not others.\n  Just so there is no confusion, the language before the Senate passed \nthe House by an overwhelming vote of 244 to 171. It appears on page 104 \nof the Senate bill. It reads as follows:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act for the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration may be used to \n     carry out or pay the salaries of personnel who carry out the \n     Bion 11 and 12 projects.\n\n  The pending committee amendment strikes this language. This is what \nwe object to. I want to say at the outset, it is very important, I \nspent almost 6 years on the Science and Technology Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives before I came to the Senate. On that committee \nI do not think there is anyone who was a stronger supporter of NASA or \nthe space program. I continued that support in my time in the Senate. \nThis is not, and I want to make it very clear, it is not a NASA-bashing \namendment. I am not asking these funds be taken out of NASA. I am just \nasking they not be spent on this particular project, the Bion project.\n  So let me make it very clear. This Senator has offered a number of \namendments in the past to cut spending, and I am proud of them, but \nthat is not what this is. I am not trying to take the money from NASA. \nI am trying to stop NASA from wasting money that NASA probably could \nfind good use for in some other way.\n  I had hoped the committee would retain the Bion language, given that \nit passed the House by a majority of 73 votes. I felt it was reasonable \nthat that language be retained. Frankly, I am disappointed it was not. \nWe had 147 Republicans and 96 Democrats on the House side who supported \nthe amendment to eliminate that funding.\n  There has been a great deal of criticism of the program from a wide \nvariety of groups: the science community--it is interesting--the \nscience community; not all in the science community, but many; taxpayer \ngroups, those who wish to save tax dollars; animal welfare \norganizations; and, as well, interestingly enough, from people who had \nthe courage to speak up inside NASA. So when we have NASA people, \npeople within the science community, animal rights organizations, and \ntaxpayer groups all together on an issue, I think it is worth the \nSenate's time to look at it very carefully.\n  This letter is from Tom Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste, \nwhich strongly supports this amendment. He says here, this vote will be \nconsidered for inclusion in their 1996 congressional ratings. This is a \ngroup I have come to deeply respect because they have the knack for \nfinding the most egregious examples of waste in the Federal \nbureaucracy. It is a very good group. Most Senators here are aware of \nthis group and the very good job they do.\n  Mr. Schatz is very specific in his letter. I ask unanimous consent \nthis letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of the \n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAW), I urge \n     you to support the efforts by Sens. Smith (R-N.H.) and \n     Feingold (D-Wis.) to eliminate funding\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\n     for two Bion missions in the FY 1997 Veterans' Affairs, \n     Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \n     Appropriations bill (H.R. 3666). By eliminating this \n     unnecessary program, taxpayers could save as much as $15.5 \n     million.\n       These missions, known as Bion 11 and 12, are joint U.S./\n     Russian/French flights scheduled for September 1996 and July \n     1998. The Russians will send Rhesus monkeys into space for 14 \n     days so that scientists can study the effects of microgravity \n     on the body. According to the Congressional Research Service, \n     Russia has been executing these missions since 1973, and NASA \n     has participated in the last eight, beginning in 1975. A \n     variety of experiments on rodents, insects, and primates have \n     been performed for the U.S. in the 17 years between 1975 and \n     1992, the date of the last Bion mission.\n       Data from the seventy-five successful Space Shuttle flights \n     or long-term stays by Russian cosmonauts, such as Valery \n     Polyakov's 439 day flight, could more accurately and less \n     expensively provide the information scientists need to study \n     these effects. In fact, NASA has performed several of its own \n     experiments on monkeys, including two shuttle missions. If \n     NASA feels that it is necessary to do further study on the \n     matter, they only need ask astronaut Shannon Lucid how she \n     feels when she returns from the Mir Space Station. Tax \n     dollars should not be spent on duplicative and wasteful \n     programs.\n       During consideration of H.R. 3666, the House supported an \n     amendment to eliminate funding by a solidly bipartisan vote \n     of 244-171. The Senate must also reject this funding. We urge \n     you to support Sens. Smith and Feingold and kill this program \n     at once. Any vote on this program will be considered for \n     inclusion in the CCAGW 1996 Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I will quote from the letter just a couple of lines:\n\n       On behalf of the 600,000 members of the Council for \n     Citizens Against Government Waste, I urge you to support the \n     efforts by Sens. Smith and Feingold to eliminate funding for \n     two Bion missions in the FY 1997 Veterans' Affairs, Housing \n     and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \n     Appropriations bill (H.R. 3666). By eliminating this \n     unnecessary program, taxpayers could save as much as $15.5 \n     million.\n\n  He goes on to say what these missions are.\n\n       These missions known as Bion 11 and 12 are joint U.S./\n     Russian/French flights scheduled for September 1996 and July \n     1998. The Russians will send Rhesus monkeys into space for 14 \n     days so that scientists can study the effects of microgravity \n     on the body. According to the Congressional Research Service, \n     Russia has been executing these missions since 1973, and NASA \n     has participated in the last eight, beginning in 1975. A \n     variety of experiments on rodents, insects, and primates have \n     been performed for the U.S. in the 17 years between 1975 and \n     1992, the date of the last Bion mission.\n\n  In addition, Mr. Schatz goes on to say:\n\n       Data from the seventy-five successful Space Shuttle flights \n     or long-term space by Russian cosmonauts . . . could more \n     accurately and less expensively provide the information \n     scientists need to study these effects. In fact, NASA has \n     performed several of its own experiments on monkeys, \n     including two shuttle missions. If NASA feels it is necessary \n     to do further study on the matter, they only need to ask \n     Shannon Lucid how she feels when she returns from the Mir \n     Space Station. (She has been up there several months.) Tax \n     dollars should not be spent on duplicative and wasteful \n     programs.\n\n  That is the end of the information from that letter. It is amazing \nthat NASA would ask the taxpayers of the United States, or this \ncommittee, bringing this bill to the floor, would ask the taxpayers of \nthe United States to spend $15.5 million to put monkeys in flight for \n14 days to find out what effect space has on those monkeys in 14 days \nwhen we put human beings in space for 469 days. If there is anyone \nlistening to me or anyone, a Member of this body, who can tell me how \nthat money is well spent, I would like to hear from them. Again, let me \nrepeat, putting monkeys in space for research for 14 days to find out \nthe effects on the body when we send human beings in space for 469 \ndays--can somebody help me? I am sending out the alert here.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the best examples that I have seen in \nmy entire congressional career of a case of a program that began with \ngood intentions that has outlived itself, because you see, many, many \nyears ago when we started this, astronauts were not the first in space, \nprimates were. We were obviously trying to find out the effects of the \nfuture human beings who were going to be in space. Well, that is past; \nthat is over. But, O my God, let's not cut a Government program. \nWhatever we do, let's keep it going, let's keep it funded, let's not \nget rid of any bureaucrats who might be doing research we do not need \nto do. My goodness, we certainly would not want to do that, but that is \nexactly what the situation is here, Mr. President. This is outrageous. \nIt is outrageous. There is no need for it, and, yet, we are doing it.\n  I also have a letter cosigned by Mr. Schatz and Ralph De Gennaro of \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, another antiwaste group that has done \nexcellent work on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I said it is estimated that this amendment would \nprevent the waste of 15.5 million taxpayers' dollars by prohibiting \nfunding of these two projects, Bion 11 and Bion 12, which involves \nsending primates into space. The Bion 11 mission is scheduled for \nliftoff this month, with Bion 12 in 1998.\n  Russian-owned rhesus monkeys would be launched from Kazakhstan in \nRussian capsules loaded with Russian technology for 2 weeks to study \nthe effects of weightlessness. I say to my friends, the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Missouri, who I know care about wasting \ntaxpayers' dollars, 14 days in space for rhesus monkeys to determine \nthe effects of weightlessness on the human body when we have human \nbeings in space for 469 days? Please, give me a break. Save $15.5 \nmillion. The House said so. Let's be reasonable.\n  I realize that some are going to suggest this is still important. I \nam waiting to hear how someone can tell me that it is. NASA has already \nconducted five similar missions using primates as test subjects, as \nwell as two shuttle missions dedicated to studying the effects of \ngravity on humans. Shuttle mission spacelab life sciences 1 and 2 \nfocused on the effect of microgravity on astronauts in 1991 and 1993. \nFive United States-Russian ventures in the eighties and early nineties \nsent primates into space to research the same subject. It is bad enough \nthe Russians are doing it. Why do we have to do it? I know there are a \nlot of people in my State of New Hampshire who would love to have that \n$15.5 million, a lot of needy people, people who do not have enough \nmoney for fuel in the winter--that is coming on us--or perhaps helping \nsome small business get started and create more jobs.\n  This is not an anti-NASA amendment. This is a commonsense amendment, \nand the taxpayers group says they are going to rate this one, and they \nshould, they absolutely should. I am glad they are doing it, because \nthis is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money.\n  I know year after year, we do see anti-NASA amendments. We always \nhave one from the Senator from Arkansas cutting the space station, and \nI oppose it every time because I support the space station. I oppose \nthat amendment because I support the space station. I have always voted \nagainst these amendments to cut NASA or to cut the space station.\n  As I mentioned, I was a member of the Science, Space and Technology \nCommittee in the House of Representatives for 6 years. I was a member \nof the Congressional Space Caucus and the Republican task force on \nspace exploration. So I come at this not anti-NASA, and every person in \nthe space agency who has worked there for any period of time knows \nthis. They also know that this project is a waste of money.\n\n  I coauthored NASA authorization bills. In fact, I wrote language \nproviding for the National Weather Service to conduct pH monitoring to \nprovide the public with access to information about the acidity of \nrainfall. I cosponsored a resolution urging support for the space \nstation budget and have consistently voted against efforts to cut the \nspace station. I cosponsored legislation to promote space \ncommercialization.\n  This is a pro-NASA amendment. That is what this is. This is a pro-\nNASA amendment because it is going to provide $15.5 million for \nsomething worthwhile. Taxpayers deserve to have their money spent \nwisely. They work hard to pay taxes to the Federal Government, and they \ndeserve to have that money spent, not only wisely but reasonably.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if you want to cast a NASA bashing vote, \nthen this amendment is not the amendment for you, because that is not \nwhat\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\nthis is. This amendment, this $15 million comes right out of important \nNASA programs like the space station and the space shuttle. But if you \nare like me and you are excited about the advances we are making in \nspace exploration, you ought to vote to eliminate this kind of waste \nand provide it in areas where the space program could use the money. \nEvery nickel we spend on the Russian Bion program is money that would \nhave been spent on important United States space priorities. Every \nnickel.\n  For example, we could divert this money to speed up the development \nof Lockheed Martin's Venture Star, the new X-33 single-stage reusable \nreorbit launch vehicle. The cost of this project will be about $1 \nbillion through the year 2000. This is exciting, revolutionary \ntechnology, and it represents precisely the kind of innovation that I \nam talking about and precisely the kind of innovation that the American \npeople expect out of their space program, which will create millions of \njobs in the 21st century.\n  Furthermore, in the Venture Star Project, we will have a public-\nprivate partnership that helps ease the financial burden on the \ntaxpayer. I am told that the estimated cost of sending payloads into \nspace on the Venture Star will be approximately $1,000 per pound, \ncompared with a $10,000 per pound cost on the space shuttle. A \ntremendous savings.\n  This $15 million could be used to accelerate the development of \ntechnology that will truly benefit our knowledge of space and enhance \nthe competitiveness of the U.S. industry.\n  Mr. President, we all know how a program takes a life of its own. \nThere has never been an example, as I said before, in all of my years \nin Congress that is a more egregious example of this exact fact: a \nprogram that went beyond what it was supposed to do and yet it \ncontinues because no one wants to pull the plug, because somebody is \ngetting some research dollars to do this, somebody is tending the cages \nof the animals, somebody is making the money, getting a salary \nsomewhere, so God forbid we should cut off a program.\n  I know that the current occupant of the chair, the Senator from \nColorado, has joined me on many occasions in cutting spending. I say to \nthe distinguished Senator that this is an example of the kinds of \nthings that he has fought for for so many years in the House and in the \nSenate. Again, a program to find out the effects of weightlessness on \nhuman beings by putting primates in space for 14 days. We now have \nhumans in space for over 400 days, and we still have the program. I \nrepeat that because I know the distinguished occupant of the chair came \nin after my comments. I want to be sure he heard them because I need \nhis vote on this issue.\n\n  The Bion Program is this kind of program. It has outlived itself. Let \nme give you a historical perspective. Let me read from a 1969 letter to \nSenator Peter Dominick, whose constituents at the time objected to NASA \nmonkey experiments identical to Bion. NASA stated:\n\n       The purpose of the biostat light mission is to determine \n     the effects of prolonged exposure to the space environment, \n     including weightlessness on the central nervous system, the \n     cardiovascular system, metabolism and the behavior of a \n     primate.\n\n  That was 1969. Thirty years later, almost, NASA still makes the same \nargument for the program even though humans have gone to the Moon and \nspent more than 400 days in space at one time. Shannon Lucid is there \nnow, and has been there a lot longer than 14 days.\n  According to a July 11, 1995, article in the New York Times, more \nthan 300 American and Russian astronauts have logged a total of 38 \nyears in space since Yuri Gagarin in 1961 became the first person to \nride a rocket into orbit. Think of that. More than 300 American and \nRussian astronauts have logged a total of 38 years in space since \nGagarin in 1961 became the first person. Yet we still have to send \nprimates into space for 14 days to determine the effects of \nweightlessness on the central nervous system? And 38 years of time in \nspace by humans. But the project continues.\n  Why should we waste $15 million on a Russian project that is \ndedicated to an area of research that American scientists have already \nexamined on seven previous missions? I do not know. Who knows? Nobody \nwants to pull the plug on the program. We do not want to offend the \nRussians? I do not know. We do not want to offend the French? I do not \nknow, and I do not care. My responsibility is not to the French, it is \nnot to the Russians. It is to the taxpayers. It just does not make \nsense. What are we going to learn?\n  Please, somebody, tell me what we are going to learn 15 million \ndollars' worth of new information on these two 14-day flights. The bill \nbefore us cuts NASA's budget for 1997 by almost $200 million below last \nyear's funding level. When I say ``cut,'' I do not mean it in President \nClinton's terms where we increase a program by billions of dollars and \ncall it a cut. That is the President's language. We have been through \nthat with Medicare and Medicaid where we increase a program by 25 to 42 \npercent and it is called a cut.\n  This is a real cut, Mr. President. In simple math in 1996 we spent \n$13.9 billion on the NASA budget. This year we spent $13.7 billion. So \nwe are going down. And yet we still waste this kind of money. I am not \narguing the need to cut the budget in light of our $5 trillion debt. \nBut if there is anything I hear consistently from my constituents back \nhome is they want us to start with waste, start with waste. Cut out the \nwaste, the fraud, the mismanagement and then we can look at other \nprograms that we may have to cut to get the job done but, for goodness \nsakes, start with the most outrageous, egregious waste of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  As one who is unabashedly a strong supporter for the NASA program, \nwho is looking forward to the development of a new and exciting \ntechnology in the space program, who is looking forward to space \nexploration and the space station and all the positive spinoffs we will \nget, who is looking forward to the jobs that are being created, I would \nhate to see this money wasted on controversial and outdated research \nthat reflects poorly on the agency. And it does. It reflects poorly on \nthe agency.\n  Somebody in management somewhere did not have the courage to tell \nsomebody they no longer had to attend those primate cages or whatever \nthey do or get any more money. Somebody did not have the courage to \ntell them or to move them to some other position. So here we go. This \nis going to reflect poorly on NASA. It reflects poorly on NASA.\n  The Senate has an obligation to stop it just like the House did, Mr. \nPresident. I would like to share with my colleagues an article from the \nWashington Post on August 30, 1996, entitled, ``Reducing Force a Bad \nIdea, Space Center Director Says.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 30, 1996]\n\n    Reducing Force a Bad Idea, Space Center Director Says--Multiple \n                Problems Predicted for Kennedy Facility\n\n                          (By Seth Borenstein)\n\n       Cape Canaveral.--Plans for a smaller work force at Kennedy \n     Space Center will lead to hundreds of layoffs in two years \n     and leave the center unable to do everything NASA expects of \n     it, the center's director said in a letter to his bosses.\n       A dozen different types of work at Kennedy--including some \n     safety inspections--can't be done if the center's civil \n     service work force is cut to 1,445 as planned in October \n     1998, Director Jay Honeycutt said in an Aug. 7 letter. There \n     are more than 2,100 federal workers at the space center.\n       A total of 547 people would have to be laid off as of Oct. \n     1, 1998, if the employment target doesn't change, Honeycutt \n     wrote. In the past, Honeycutt had said layoffs might be \n     avoided.\n       ``The reduction predicted in . . . [the 1999 fiscal year] \n     effectively removes all but direct mission operations support \n     as of Oct. 1, 1998,'' Honeycutt wrote. ``I do not feel this \n     is a prudent approach for the center . . . or the agency.''\n       In his letter, Honeycutt noted that the cuts would come \n     just as the space center begins overseeing massive upgrades \n     to the space shuttle and getting pieces of NASA's space \n     station ready for launch.\n       Honeycutt said the 1,445-employee figure that NASA wants to \n     impose on the center was based on it becoming a government-\n     owned, contractor-run facility--an approach that has been \n     heavily changed by NASA officials since it was announced in \n     May 1995.\n       NASA plans to shrink the center's government work force \n     even further by October 1999, though be less than originally \n     planned. The agency had set a target of 1,135 workers for \n     Oct. 1, 1999, but in late July NASA's deputy administrator \n     wrote the General Accounting Office to say the revised target \n     would probably be 1,360.\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\n       Honeycutt sent his letter to top space flight officials at \n     NASA headquarters and Johnson Space Center.\n       The letter was part of a private, ongoing dialogue between \n     the space center and Washington about staffing levels, but it \n     became public Monday on an Internet computer site devoted to \n     upcoming layoffs at the space agency, spokesman Hugh Harris \n     said.\n       Harris confirmed the letter on the non-NASA World Wide Web \n     site had been written by Honeycutt. He wrote that cutting the \n     civil service work force to 1,445 would, among other things:\n       Leave NASA unable to monitor the safety and quality of \n     contractors' work.\n       Make it impossible for the government to conduct safety \n     inspections of certain facilities.\n       Force the center to discontinue independent safety studies \n     called for by the federal commission that investigated the \n     1986 Challenger explosion.\n       Bring a halt to shuttle upgrade work beyond 1998.\n       Prevent the space center from making technological \n     improvements that would cut shuttle launch costs and save \n     NASA money in the long run.\n       If the current work force target for October 1998 isn't \n     changed, ``KSC's core engineering skills, [and] technical \n     expertise . . . are seriously eroded,'' Honeycutt wrote.\n       Outsiders said Honeycutt's letter was a serious action for \n     a center director to take.\n       ``After awhile you stop being overly polite,'' said Seymour \n     Himmel, a member of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel who \n     has studied morale and safety issues at the space center. \n     ``It's trying to be realistic about what they're being asked \n     to do with less, and what the consequences are.\n       ``You are put in a position where you don't know what the \n     hell to do,'' Himmel said of Honeycutt's situation. ``If you \n     really have the programs of the agency at heart, you've got \n     to stand up and be counted.''\n       A spokesman for Rep. David Joseph Weldon (R-Fla.), who is \n     vice chairman of the House space subcommittee, said Honeycutt \n     was justifiably upset. ``This is the doomiest and gloomiest \n     letter you will see,'' said the spokesman, J.B. Kump, \n     ``Hopefully, this will open some eyes at headquarters.''\n       Ed Campion, a spokesman at NASA headquarters, said the \n     agency takes comments such as those in Honeycutt's letter \n     very seriously. ``These are the kind of frank discussions \n     that we have to have when we're in tight budget times and \n     trying to make hard decisions,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. The article is about a proposal where 547 people would \nhave to be laid off as of October 1, 1998. For the $15.5 million we are \nspending on Bion we could afford to pay each of these people $28,000. I \nam not saying necessarily that I advocate that, but I just want to \npoint out how much money $15 million is. Every one of those people are \ngoing to lose their job. They could be paid $28,000 a year just from \nthis project. It is obvious they do not all make under $28,000, but the \npoint is, we are laying off American workers at the Kennedy Space \nCenter while we send $15.5 million to Russia to conduct redundant and \nwasteful research, not to mention the pain that you inflict on animals \nfor no purpose, no purpose whatsoever--no purpose.\n  I am not an advocate of totally eliminating all research, but I think \nif you all remember the recent story about the gorilla who picked up a \nsmall child that had fallen into a gorilla cage, picked it up in its \narms and gently carried it to the door of the zookeeper so that they \ncould open the door and carry that child out to safety, it saved the \nchild's life from other gorillas that may have hurt it when the child \nhad fallen into the cage. These are animals. They have feelings. Why \nwould you want to inflict this kind of pain for nothing? It is the same \nfamily. They are primates, gorillas and chimps or monkeys. Why would \nyou want to inflict that pain for no reason--no reason? To find out \nwhat weightlessness is like in space on these animals for 14 days?\n  Let me go a little further on to why this research is so wasteful. I \nam going to cite a number of quotes from NASA experts, NASA documents, \nscientists, scholars, and medical experts that prove this point.\n  Let me start with a memo from February 9 of this year. It was written \nby Jack Gibbons who serves as both the Assistant to the President for \nScience and Technology and the Director of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy. And it is written to Dan Goldin, the Administrator \nof NASA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, February 9, 1996.\n     Memorandum for Dan Goldin.\n     From Jack Gibbons.\n     Re Primates in Research.\n       I am following up on our conversation about the situation \n     at NASA with respect to the use of primates in research. I \n     sympathize with your concern that the era of need for \n     primates in NASA's research is now behind us, and that it may \n     be time to retire those animals. I would be pleased to talk \n     with you about the situation and to discuss alternate options \n     to consider.\n       I should point out that the Air Force is also interested in \n     options concerning their primates, and that the National \n     Institute of Medicine is planning to do a related study under \n     NIH sponsorship.\n       Please let me know if you want to follow up. I look forward \n     to hearing from you.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. This is on White House stationery, written on February 9, \n1996, from Jack Gibbons. And it is to the Director of NASA. Let me \nquote it. It is very brief.\n\n       I am following up on our conversation about the situation \n     at NASA with respect to the use of primates in research. I \n     sympathize with your concern that the era of need for \n     primates in NASA's research is now behind us, and that it may \n     be time to retire those animals. I would be pleased to talk \n     with you about the situation and to discuss alternate options \n     to consider.\n\n  How could you possibly be any clearer than that? This is from Mr. \nGibbons, who is involved with these programs at NASA, to the Director \nsaying it is time to wrap it up, we do not need the money for this \nproject. Yet, here it is, stricken by the House, to their credit \noverwhelmingly, by a bipartisan vote. But here we go again. Let us \nleave it in. Who is the lobbyist for this? Who is pushing this? Why is \nit still in here? Why are we fighting this battle on the Senate floor? \nWho is this? Where is this coming from?\n  NASA does not want it, apparently. Where is the lobby for this? I \nthink it is a strong affirmation of my point that this research is \nunimportant and unnecessary. They do not want it. As this memo clearly \nstates, our two top space officials did not think it was a priority in \nFebruary, yet here we are in September, by golly, we will put it right \nin there. Let us spend that money. I do not know who called whom but \nsomebody did, I guess.\n  In fact, they concluded without hesitation, these two officials, that \nthere is no longer any need whatsoever for such research, and the House \nof Representatives agreed with them overwhelmingly in June. I give a \nlot of credit to my friends in the House for acting reasonably.\n  Since February is there any new startling information out there \nsomewhere that provides some new development, some new revelation that \nnow putting primates in space for 14 days is somehow going to prove, \nhelp us to understand weightlessness and the effects on the nervous \nsystem for humans who have been in space for 469 days?\n  I want to hear this tremendous revelation of information. I want to \nhear about it. It must be exciting, because it persuaded somebody to \nchange their mind between June and now. Where is this information? \nWhere are the documents? People say, ``Why do you go out and get so \nexcited over $15.5 million, over a couple of rhesus monkeys?'' If \nenough people got excited over $15.5 million every time we wasted that \nkind of money, we would save money around here and get the budget \nbalanced a lot quicker and we would spend money a lot wiser. We have an \nobligation to take care of the little things, and the big things will \ntake care of themselves.\n  Proponents might talk about a recent commission that considered \nanimal welfare. The commission was thrown together with the expectation \nthat Congress might consider cutting the Bion Program. It is very \ninteresting that we see a situation like this. It makes me wonder. I \nhave been in Congress now 12 years. It really makes me wonder who is \nmaking the decisions in this Government? Who is really making the \ndecisions? You have a situation where the top two officials in NASA, \nwho deal with the project, do not want it. I don't know of any \nproponent in the White House that wants it. The House took it out. Yet, \nhere we are on the Senate floor battling over it, wasting a couple of \nhours of time, perhaps, arguing about this $15.5 million spent on this \nprimate research. Why? It really is amazing. Is somebody who works \nbelow these people going around them and somehow getting information \nhere to this Senate? Yes, probably. I think the Senator from Colorado, \nwho occupies the chair and who has had so many\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\namendments on this Senate floor and in the House regarding this kind of \nfunding, knows that. That is exactly what happens. Frankly, whoever is \ndoing this ought to be fired. They ought to be fired, and we would save \na little more money.\n  There have been a number of these sham committees already that were \nset up to study something long before this memo was written. So the \nlatest round has taught us nothing. There is a quote from Dr. Larry \nYoung, a professor of astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, MIT:\n\n       We are about at the limit of what we can do on shuttle \n     missions in terms of understanding the long play of \n     weightlessness as it affects humans and animals.\n\n  I would certainly think so. Fourteen days for primates and 400-plus \ndays for humans, and we are still putting primates in space to study \nweightlessness on the human nervous system.\n  This quote is from the final reports of the U.S. experiments flown of \nthe Soviet biosatellite Cosmos 2044 Bion 9:\n\n       The small number of animals studied after space flight \n     preclude drawing any major conclusions for the present.\n\n  Now, I don't know if I can stand here and say, well, there is no \ncircumstance at all, no chance that we might learn anything at all from \nthese launches. I am sure we can probably figure something out. Who \nknows? Maybe monkeys' ears grow more in space. We can probably come up \nwith something if we worked at it. But that is not the point. The point \nis that it is not cost effective, it is not humane, it is not an \nAmerican priority, and it is not NASA's priority. That is the point. It \nis not NASA's priority, not humane, not cost effective, and not cost \nefficient. Yet, we are going to spend the money anyway.\n  Unless I can get 50 people plus myself to disagree with the \ncommittee, we will spend it and put these animals through suffering for \nnothing. It is bad enough we have to do it for something, but here we \nare going to do it for nothing and spend the money. Unless I can get 50 \npeople to agree with me, that is exactly what will happen. I wonder how \nmany Americans even realize that we are still sending primates into \nspace. Frankly, until this amendment came to my attention, I didn't \nknow it.\n\n  Our two highest science officials, in the memo I just read, agree \nthat the area of need for primates in NASA's research is now behind us. \nWe have had humans in space for over 400 days. We have learned that \nmost of the problems associated with weightlessness occur after about 2 \nweeks in space, and the Bion flights are only 2 weeks long. Only in \nWashington, DC, really, only in Washington, only in the U.S. Government \nwould you have a project as ridiculous as this. I'll repeat that. We \nhave learned that most of the problems associated with weightlessness \noccur after 2 weeks in space. Yet, we put primates up for 2 weeks and \nthen bring them down. They are not just sitting in the capsule; they \nare doing all kinds of pretty nasty things to these animals while they \nare in there.\n  Mr. President, I do have some more comments to make, but I have used \nup a good portion of the hour. I think at this point I am going to \nyield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time for other \nSenators who may wish to speak.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend \nfrom New Hampshire for giving me an opportunity to answer some of the \nvery pertinent questions he has raised. The effect of this amendment \nwould be to prohibit NASA from spending $6.8 million in fiscal year \n1997 on an important, efficient, peer-reviewed, biomedical research \nprogram using rhesus monkeys flown on Russia's space vehicle. It \ndoesn't change the total budget. It forces NASA to withdraw from a \nsigned contract with Russia, override scientific peer review, and \nundermine the Animal Welfare Act, while at the same time handing animal \nrights extremists a victory.\n  Now, there is no one in this body who has any greater aversion to \nGovernment waste and unnecessary spending than I do. I think my record \nas a Governor and in the Senate is one of opposing Government waste. I \nhave challenged duplication of effort. I have pointed out time and time \nagain where the Federal Government wastes money duplicating efforts and \nwhere States and local governments have duplicating authorities. I have \nfought many battles to cut out unnecessary activities. I have fought \nthese battles where I know, from my experience as an ex-executive and \nas an administrator and as a legislator, where we can cut out waste.\n  But there is also another area where I think we have made a lot of \nmistakes in this body, and that is in the area of science. I had a few \ncourses in science, just enough to know that I am not a scientist. So \nwhen it comes to scientific matters, I think we ought to rely on the \nscientific community and get the best judgments from the scientists. If \nI were going to give a seat-of-the-pants science response, I might say \nsomething very simple like, ``We ought to be testing monkeys rather \nthan human beings.'' That is a nonscientific response. But good science \nis at issue here. Are we going to substitute the scientific judgment of \nthis body for the peer-reviewed science of the experts who have been \nbrought together to say that we need this research? There are perhaps \none or two Members of this body who are really qualified to make \nscientific judgments, who have some background in this area. I would be \ninterested to hear from them. But for the most part, we are going to \nhave to rely on what the scientists have told us. There are some in the \nopposing-Government-waste category who think that maybe, on the face of \nit, this is a wasteful activity. But they are plain wrong when you \ncompare the science.\n  Astronauts' bodies undergo major changes during long durations of \nspace flight, changes which are debilitating on return to Earth.\n  Some people can survive over a year in space. But we still do not \nknow how to prevent the changes, or even if these changes are \nreversible.\n  Let us see what science has said about it. Bion 11 and Bion 12 are \noutstanding values for the American taxpayer.\n  Who is lobbying for this? Mr. President, I have a letter here of July \n31, 1996 signed by Cornelius Pings, president, Association of American \nUniversities, C. Peter Magrath, president, National Association of \nState Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and Jordan J. Cohen, \npresident, Association of American Medical Colleges.\n  There you have it. That is a pretty tough lobbying group, the \nAssociation of American Universities, the National Association of State \nUniversities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the Association of American \nMedical Colleges. What do they say?\n\n       The Bion missions are designed to study the biological \n     effects of low gravity and the space radiation environment on \n     the structure and function of individual physiological \n     systems and the body as a whole. Bion 11 and 12 will focus \n     specifically on the musculoskeletal system. While the loss of \n     muscle and bone mass during space flight is well documented, \n     neither the rate nor the specific mechanisms involved are \n     well understood. Research on human subjects in this area is \n     difficult because human crew members regularly practice \n     countermeasures designed to nullify some of the adaptive \n     responses to microgravity. While these actions may enhance \n     crew performance and comfort, they also alter or mask the \n     physiological symptoms being studied. Since tissue loss in \n     the musculoskeletal system may be one of the critical factors \n     limiting human space exploration, it is essential that we \n     understand how and why these changes occur and how we might \n     prevent them.\n\n  Their conclusion is:\n\n       We strongly support the use of merit review to determine \n     how limited Federal funds may most productively be spent for \n     scientific research. The Smith amendment would override \n     scientific peer review . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       The Smith amendment would override scientific peer review \n     and force NASA to withdraw from a signed contract with \n     international partners. We urge you to oppose the amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, that is who is lobbying for this provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Association of American Universities, National \n           Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n           Colleges; Association of American Medical Colleges,\n                                                    July 31, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate turns to consideration of HR \n     3666, the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bills, \n     we\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n     understand that Senator Robert Smith plans to offer an \n     amendment prohibiting NASA funding of the Bion 11 and 12 \n     projects. We urge you to oppose this amendment.\n       We are concerned about the precedent this amendment sets in \n     terminating research that has been reviewed and approved on \n     the basis of scientific merit. The Bion missions have been \n     peer-reviewed and approved by five independent panels over \n     the past eight years. The most recent panel, which submitted \n     its unanimous recommendations to NASA Administrator Dan \n     Goldin only last week, found that the quality of science \n     proposed is very high, that there are no known alternative \n     means to achieve the objectives, and that the animal care and \n     welfare proposals meet all requirements and U.S. legal \n     standards.\n       The Bion missions are designed to study the biological \n     effects of low gravity and the space radiation environment on \n     the structure and function of individual physiological \n     systems and the body as a whole. Bion 11 and 12 will focus \n     specifically on the musculoskeletal system. While the loss of \n     muscle and bone mass during space flight is well documented, \n     neither the rate nor the specific mechanisms involved are \n     well understood.

Since tissue loss in \n     the musculoskeletal system may be one of the critical factors \n     limiting human space exploration, it is essential that we \n     understand how and why these changes occur and how we might \n     prevent them.\n       We strongly support the use of merit review to determine \n     how limited federal funds may most productively be spent for \n     scientific research. The Smith amendment would override \n     scientific peer-review and force NASA to withdraw from a \n     signed contract with international partners. We urge you to \n     oppose the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cornelius J. Pings,\n       President, Association of American Universities.\n     C. Peter Magrath,\n       President, National Association of State Universities and \n     Land-Grant Colleges.\n     Jordan J. Cohen,\n       President, Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Administrator took notice of the \nconcerns of those who objected to the Bion effort. He convened a high-\nlevel independent review program which completed its work on the Bion \nTask Force on July 1 with the unanimous recommendation to the NASA \nAdvisory Council that NASA proceed with Bion 11 and 12 missions.\n  He states in his letter of July 26:\n\n       . . . the NASA Advisory Council unanimously approved the \n     findings and recommendations of the Task Force and forwarded \n     them to me.\n\n  That is a letter of Daniel Goldin of July 26 of the NASA Advisory \nCouncil which is composed, among others, of professors at Stanford \nUniversity, Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \nFlorida A, DePaul University, California Institute of Technology, \nHarvard University, and a number of private sector organizations are \ninvolved. This NASA advisory council unanimously approved the \nrecommendation of the Bion task force chaired by Ronald C. Merrell, \nLampman professor and chairman, Department of Surgery of Yale \nUniversity.\n  That letter of July 2 to the advisory council says:\n\n       We unanimously recommend that the Agency proceed with the \n     Bion Project. In response to the three questions you asked us \n     to address in reaching our recommendation we find the \n     following:\n       1. The quality of the science proposed in the integrated \n     protocol is excellent. It has been reviewed by peers in a \n     very thorough and repeated manner and has withstood analysis \n     for nearly a decade. The science has been thoughtfully \n     integrated to accommodate an enormous matrix of material \n     which is highly likely to yield meaningful results.\n       2. There are no known alternative means to achieve the \n     objectives of the proposal. The data do not exist at present \n     and there are no alternative species to test the hypotheses. \n     Specifically, the use of Rhesus monkeys seems inevitable to \n     achieve the objectives.\n       3. The animal care and welfare proposals meet all \n     requirements and US legal standards.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Daniel C. \nGoldin and the attachments from the advisory council and the Bion task \nforce be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of \n           the Administrator,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on VA-HUD-Independent Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I wish to thank the Committee for \n     rejecting the limitation included in the House-passed version \n     of H.R. 3666, the FY 1997 VA-HUD-Independent Agencies \n     appropriations bill, which would have precluded NASA's use of \n     any appropriations in the bill for the conduct of the Bion 11 \n     and 12 missions. The Bion Program is a cooperative space \n     venture among the U.S., Russian and French space agencies for \n     the conduct of international biomedical research using \n     Russian-provided infrastructure, spacecraft, payload and \n     primates. The House limitation effectively threatened the \n     principle of rigorous peer review in biomedical research, and \n     the Committee wisely chose to delete this limitation.\n       As I indicated to you in my letter of July 5, a high-level \n     independent review of the program was completed by the Bion \n     Task Force on July 1, with a unanimous recommendation to the \n     NASA Advisory Council that NASA proceed with the Bion 11 and \n     12 missions. Yesterday, the NASA Advisory Council unanimously \n     approved the findings and recommendation of the Task Force \n     and forwarded them to me. I have accepted the recommendation \n     of the Council and the Task Force (enclosures 1 and 2) that \n     the Agency proceed with the Bion missions. I seek the \n     Committee's continued support for NASA's participation in the \n     Bion 11 and 12 missions as the Senate considers H.R. 3666, \n     and rejection of any amendment to restrict NASA's \n     participation in Bion.\n       Again, thank you for allowing NASA to pursue its open \n     process of review for selecting the highest quality science \n     by peer review in conformance with U.S. animal welfare laws \n     and the highest ethical principles.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel S. Goldin,\n     Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         NASA Advisory Council, National Aeronautics and Space \n           Administration,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Mr. Daniel S. Goldin,\n     Administrator, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Goldin: As you requested, a task force of the NASA \n     Advisory Council was formed to provide you with advice and \n     recommendations on NASA participation in the U.S.-French-\n     Russian Bion Program. The task force, led by Dr. Ronald \n     Merrell, met on July 1. The membership was technically \n     competent with broad expertise appropriate for addressing the \n     task force's charter.\n       At our meeting on July 24, Dr. Merrell briefed us on the \n     task force's activities and deliberations. We unanimously \n     approved its three findings and its recommendation to proceed \n     with the Bion project. We also support its strong advocacy \n     for continued efforts to strengthen the bioethics review \n     policy and process for animal experimentation to be \n     implemented before Bion 12. These findings and \n     recommendations are contained in the enclosed letter from Dr. \n     Merrell.\n       The public was present and participated in both meetings. \n     Members of the Bion Task Force are to be commended for the \n     seriousness, care, and depth with which they carried out this \n     sensitive task. If we can be of any further assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to ask.\n                                            Bradford W. Parkinson,\n     Chair.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              Yale University,\n\n                                      New Haven, CT, July 2, 1996.\n     Re Bion task force.\n\n     Bradford W. Parkinson, MD,\n     Chairman, NASA Advisory Council, NASA Headquarters, Code Z, \n         300 E Street SW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Parkinson: The Bion Task Force, summoned by the \n     NAC to consider the matter of Bion 11 and 12, met at NASA \n     Headquarters on July 1, 1996. We responded to the attached \n     charge and all members were in attendance except for Dr. \n     Borer. Assignments and logistics had been discussed on a \n     telephone conference call May 15. At our meeting we were ably \n     supported by Dr. Frank Sulzman and aided by an extensive \n     panel of NASA scientists as well as project participants from \n     France and Russia. The public was present and participated in \n     the presentations. The agenda for our meeting and the \n     assignments are attached. Minutes of our activities will be \n     ready shortly. However, I though it appropriate to report \n     immediately our recommendation.\n       We unanimously recommend that the Agency proceed with the \n     Bion Project. In response to the three questions you asked us \n     to address in reaching our recommendation we find the \n     following:\n       1. The quality of the science proposed in the integrated \n     protocol is excellent. It has been reviewed by peers is a \n     very thorough and repeated manner and has withstood analysis \n     for nearly a decade. The science has been thoughtfully \n     integrated to accommodate an enormous matrix of material \n     which is highly likely to yield meaningful results.\n       2. There are no known alternative means to achieve the \n     objectives of the proposal. The\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\n     data do not exist and there are no alternative species to \n     test the hypotheses. Specifically, the use of Rhesus monkeys \n     seems inevitable to achieve the objectives.\n       3. The animal care and welfare proposals meet all \n     requirements and US legal standards.\n       However, we were sensitive to the concerns raised by the \n     public and within our committee about divisive opinions over \n     animal research. We were reminded that NASA has been a leader \n     in bioethics and a driver for raising the standards of \n     biomedical research. Therefore, we strongly urge NASA to \n     devise and implement a bioethics review policy for animal \n     experimentation to include participation of a professional \n     bioethicist. This group should begin its activities before \n     Bion 12 is activated. We believe it is not morally justified \n     to proceed otherwise. We challenge NASA to raise existing \n     standards by this new policy and thereby continue leadership \n     in the realm of bioethics.\n       I thank you for the honor to chair this group and on their \n     behalf I thank you for the opportunity to serve.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Ronald C. Merrell, MD,\n\n                                   Lampman Professor and Chairman,\n     Department of Surgery.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Bion Task Force Charter\n\n       The charter of the BTF is to provide advice and \n     recommendations to the NASA Administrator on whether NASA \n     should continue to participate in the joint U.S.-French-\n     Russian Bion Program. Specific activities will include the \n     following:\n       (1) Review the integrity of the science plan for the \n     mission;\n       (2) Assure that there are no alternative means for \n     obtaining the information provided by these experiments; and\n       (3) Review the Bion Program for ethical and humane animal \n     treatment during all phases of the mission.\n       Membership is comprised of distinguished individuals with \n     expertise in medicine, biomedical research, ethics and the \n     humane care and treatment of animals.\n       The BTF will report to the NASA Advisory Council (NAC), and \n     will be staffed by the Office of Life and Microgravity \n     Sciences and Applications.\n       The BTF is expected to submit its report with \n     recommendations to the NAC in July 1996.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not think we need to say more about \nthis. It is very clear that the scientific community says we need it. \nWe can find out things on monkeys operating under the legal and ethical \nstandards that we cannot find out when we send humans into space, and \nwe are far better testing on monkeys under the ethical standards that \nare imposed what the impacts of weightlessness is.\n  I cannot understand all of the scientific jargon in the letters. But \nI can read the headlines. And the headlines from these letters are from \nthe scientific community supported by the Association of American \nUniversities, the Land-Grant Colleges, and the Association of American \nMedical Colleges which say that we need this information. Are we to \nsubstitute our scientific judgment for theirs? I happen to think \npersonally that would be the height of arrogance to say that we know \nmore about science than the professionals, the great leading scientific \nminds and institutions of higher education around the country.\n  That is why I hope, Mr. President, that an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority of this body will join me in rejecting the motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to continue this debate by first thanking \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. I am very pleased to be working jointly \nwith him and several other Senators on this matter. I believe that is \nimportant to pursue matters legislatively when there is unusual \nagreement on both sides of the aisle. And in this case there is that \nagreement between many of us on both sides of the aisle that this \nprogram needs to be reevaluated. I want to add a little bit to what the \nSenator from New Hampshire has said.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire and I are moving to table the \ncommittee amendment which would strike language that passed the House \nas an amendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill on June 26, 1996 by a \nvote of 244 to 171. The amendment was sponsored by Representatives \nRoemer and Ganske. The Senate Appropriations Committee, in preparing \nthe VA-HUD bill for the floor, has recommended that this language be \nstruck from the bill. The language would explicitly prohibit the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] from expending any \nfunds on the Bion 11 and Bion 12 missions. I believe that the \ncommittee's amendment to strike this language should not prevail.\n\n  That is why the Senator from New Hampshire, I, and others will move \nto table. As I said, Mr. President, this move to save this money passed \non a bipartisan basis in the House and in this body. It has the support \nof not only the Senator from New Hampshire and myself but also the \nSenator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], the Senator from North Carolina \n[Mr. Helms], the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], and the Senator \nfrom New York [Mr. D'Amato].\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire indicated, it would be pretty hard \nto come up with a more diverse group of Senators from a political point \nof view than that combination.\n  So what is this all about?\n  Under this program, NASA transfers money to Russia to launch the Bion \n11 and Bion 12 capsules, and also funds United States researchers to be \ninvolved in designing the experiments and interpreting the results. The \nBion Program gets its name from the small crewless Russian Bion \nsatellite it uses to launch biological experiments into near-Earth \norbits to study the physiological effects of space flight. Since 1973, \nRussia has launched 10 Bion satellites. The last was done with NASA \nparticipation for space flights of between 5 and 22 days.\n  In fiscal year 1993, $35.1 billion was appropriated to support this \nwhole program. At present, $15.5 million remains in the Bion account \nfor the next two flights.\n  So when the Senator from Missouri correctly points out that a little \nover $6 million will be involved in terms of this fiscal year, there is \nstill more to come--and still more in my view and in the view of the \nSenator from New Hampshire to be wasted if we do not take the steps \nthat we recommend today.\n  Bion 11 and Bion 12 are the last of these flight missions, scheduled \nto fly in October 1996 and July 1998 respectively with United States, \nFrench, and Russian participation. Two Russian-owned rhesus monkeys \nwill fly on each of the missions, scheduled to last 14 days, to study \nthe effects of microgravity on bone loss, muscle deterioration, and \nbalance.\n  I oppose the committee amendment to strike the Roemer-Ganske language \nbecause I believe that these funds could be allocated for higher \npriority science at NASA or preferably for deficit reduction. I am also \nconcerned that the scientific justification for the program is \nquestionable and the results redundant, given that NASA has both \nprevious Bion experiment data and significant human data on the effects \nof space flight. Since the Apollo missions humans have stayed in space \nfor months at a time, and on July 16, 1996, Shannon Lucid set the U.S. \nrecord for the longest space flight aboard the space station Mir at 115 \ndays, and as of last Friday has now spent 5 months orbiting the Earth. \nThere is substantial information and data with regard to the humans \ninvolved, which is obviously our ultimate concern. In addition, Mr. \nPresident, the last Columbia shuttle mission, which lasted 17 days, \nincluded an experiment similar to those proposed for Bion and in that \ncase was done on actual human astronauts.\n\n  The termination of expenditures on the Bion Program is supported by a \ncoalition of taxpayer and animal welfare groups, not simply animal \nwelfare groups. It includes Citizens Against Government Waste and \nTaxpayers for Common Cause, who have found a common ground on this \nissue and believe that the money can be saved from these missions.\n  Mr. President, the Bion Program, to quote, according to the February \n1996 Bion 11/12 Science Assessment, is ``very important for future \nlong-term manned space flights and life on a space station.''\n  Let me emphasize this statement. It says the Bion Program, and \narguably NASA's entire life sciences program, exists to support the \ncontinuation of the pursuit of long-term manned space flight and the \ndevelopment of the space station.\n  That is really the context in which we should be evaluating Bion and \nNASA's continued participation in it. It is not simply a crusade of \nanimal rights activists, as proponents would have you believe and as \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nfrom Missouri at least suggested in his remarks. There is much more \ninvolved for those of us who are concerned about waste in Government, \nand I think that includes everyone in this body.\n  Of course, there may be issues pertaining to humane treatment and the \nfuture of the Bion protocol, but for the Members of this body who do \nnot support the space station for fiscal reasons--and there are a \nnumber of Senators, including myself--Bion is really an outgrowth of \nspace station development and for that reason, as well, ought to be \nterminated for fiscal reasons.\n  For those who support manned space flight, I believe that the \nresearch which will be conducted on Bion 11 and 12, despite the Bion \nProgram having cleared a fourth reevaluation of the experiments, is \narguably duplicative. So it may well be something that standing alone \ncan be argued to have merit, but if it is already adequately being \ndone, it is still duplicative and it is still wasteful.\n  I say this despite the fact that individuals from two very well-\nrespected research institutions in my State of Wisconsin, Marquette \nUniversity and the Medical College of Wisconsin, have participated in \nthe Bion Program and one of the individuals actually will be directly \ninvolved in interpreting data from Bion 11.\n  I ask those in this body who support manned space flight to ask \nthemselves this question: Despite the scientific merit of the study \ndesign, will the termination of the Bion 11 and 12 flights keep the \nUnited States from sending astronauts into space if we cannot find the \nmechanisms behind bone calcium loss and the deterioration of muscles \nthat help humans fight gravity and stand upright? The answer is \nobvious. It is resounding. It is an empirical no. This will not make \nthe difference.\n  So the proponents of this program then make four primary arguments in \nsupport of the continuation of Bion. Let me just mention what their \narguments are and respond briefly. First, they say the scientific and \nhumane concerns are overblown and have been addressed.\n\n  Second, they say the Bion Program results are important for manned \nspace flight.\n  Third, they say we are likely to get useful domestic byproducts from \nBion research for osteoporosis and other disease sufferers.\n  Finally, they say with regard to the fiscal issues that the savings \nfigures are not savings at all. I will try to address all of these, and \nof course some of this has already been addressed by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, but I want to add to it.\n  I think the strongest argument against the Bion missions is the \nquestion of whether or not the experiments are redundant, which, of \ncourse, speaks to their importance to manned space flight. That is a \ndistinct question from whether or not the scientific study methods and \nthe experiment design will produce legitimate and scientifically valid \nresults.\n  Let me say a bit about them. Four of the rookie astronauts from the \nJuly 7, 1996, shuttle Columbia mission, which had a total crew of \nseven, participated both prior, during, and after the flight as, in \neffect, human guinea pigs in the study on the effect of human space \ntravel on the body.\n  Within an hour of touchdown, as reported on July 8, 1996, by the \nChicago Tribune, ``The four astronauts who had endured medical poking \nand prodding in orbit were in a clinic at Kennedy Space Center \nundergoing painful muscle biopsies and other tests. NASA wanted to \nexamine the men before their bodies had adjusted to gravity.''\n  The Houston Chronicle also provided additional detail on the mission \non July 8, 1996. NASA ``billed the mission as a preview of its \noperations aboard the U.S.-led international space station.''\n  Following landing, the Chronicle continues, ``The crew were ushered \ninto medical facilities at Kennedy for evaluation of their muscle, \nskeletal and respiratory and balance systems. The test included \nbiopsies of their calf muscles with large gauge needles and full body \nscans with a magnetic resonance imaging device.''\n  So the contention of the supporters of Bion has been that the Bion \ntests are too invasive to be done on humans and thus should be done on \nrhesus monkeys. As Charles Brady, a physician and one of the rookie \nastronauts, stated about the test as reported in the Orlando Sentinal \non July 7, 1996: ``Having had to subject many patients to things I \nwouldn't rather do at the time, I think it is appropriate that I have \nto go through with it.''\n  Now, why do I provide all this detail on the recent Columbia mission \nexperiments on astronauts? It is because NASA's real justification for \nthe Bion experiments is not that they are collecting data from the \nrhesus monkeys they are not collecting from astronauts. They are. It is \nthat they feel that the monkey studies will help them better interpret \nthe changes in humans from the biopsy studies and the studies in the \nnoninvasive tests they conducted on the Columbia astronauts. The \nastronauts' biopsies are limited in size, and allegedly the Bion \nmonkeys could provide more samples from more muscles. The Bion monkeys \nwill provide bone biopsies, to which astronauts would not submit, and \nthe Bion monkeys' results will be compared with the astronauts' \nresults.\n  Why do this? Because those involved in the experiments want to \nconfirm that, indeed, the same changes occur in immobile rhesus monkeys \nthat occur in reasonably active astronauts. What does this say in \nresponse to those who argue that these tests are not really that \ninvasive and should proceed on rhesus monkeys.\n\n  But to return to the main point, Mr. President, this is research \ndesigned to confirm that what we know about the body, that what we know \nabout the effect of space flight on the body is indeed what we already \nknow. We already know it. And this apparently is just an attempt to \nspend some of our tax dollars to confirm it.\n  I am concerned about this, given the amount that has already been \nspent to collect the astronaut data. The Rocky Mountain News reported \non June 21, 1996, that the Columbia shuttle astronaut study on the \neffect of space travel on the human body cost $138 million. And this \nexpenditure on the rhesus monkeys procedures will simply add to that \nfigure, I think that is unnecessarily, and would be redundant.\n  Let me return to the second issue. The second issue I want to address \nis the issue of humane treatment, because Senators will likely hear \nthat the Bion experiment animal treatment protocol has been reviewed \nseveral times--most recently in early July 1996.\n  In April 1996 NASA Administrator Dan Goldin set up an independent \npanel, chaired by the head of surgery at Yale, Dr. Ronald Merrell, to \nreview the care and treatment of the Bion monkeys, the fourth such \nreview. But, as the Bion launch is scheduled for October 1996, and the \npanel could not meet until July 1, the surgical procedures to implant \nmonitoring wires and the steel cranial caps on the monkeys went ahead \nin Kazakhstan in June at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in \nMoscow. NASA was then in the awkward position of agreeing to allow the \nRussians to proceed with the surgery even though it had not yet decided \nto support the mission.\n  What happened in the interim? The House agreed overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan vote to prohibit the continued spending of NASA funds on \nBion.\n  The independent panel met on July 1, 1996 and issued a letter the day \nafter the meeting. The letter does say that the proposed science will \n``likely yield meaningful results,'' the animal welfare proposal meets \n``U.S. legal standards,'' and that rhesus monkeys are appropriate \nsurrogate human animal subject for these types of experiments.\n  I am concerned the previous argument by the Senator from Missouri did \nnot include in his verbal statement, although he may have included it \nin the Record, the rest of the story, if you will, the rest of the \nletter.\n  I am concerned by how the Merrell panel letter concludes:\n\n       However, we were sensitive to the concerns raised by the \n     public and within our committee about divisive opinions over \n     animal research. . . . Therefore, we strongly urge NASA to \n     devise and implement a bioethics review policy for animal \n     experimentation to include participation of a professional \n     bioethicist. This group should begin its activities before \n     Bion 12 is activated. We believe it is not morally justified \n     to proceed otherwise.\n\n  The conclusion of the Merrell panel has led some to believe that the \npanel really met just for show, and that the\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\npressure of having already implanted wires in the monkeys made the \nrecommendations what they were. As the associate director for Life \nSciences at the Ames Research Center was reported as having said in a \nJuly 12, 1996, Science article announcing the Merrell panel decision \nand reporting the House vote ``we have to turn this [House vote] around \nin the Senate.''\n  On July 23, 1996 I received a letter in support of the Bion project \nfrom the Americans for Medical Progress Educational Foundation. The \nletter makes several arguments on the need for continuation of Bion, \nmost which I have previously described, but adds an additional one that \nI would like to share with colleagues--``the animal subjects in Bion \nare treated well and, upon return, will be retired in Russia and \nidolized as space heroes.'' I am sure the monkeys are very excited \nabout that, but I am not certain that the authors realized how \nconcerning and bizarre that statement sounds, particularly as a \njustification for spending $15 million over the next 2 fiscal years. \nOdder still, is that the statement has some basis in fact. NASA staff, \nin meeting with my staff, described that the chairs in which the \nmonkeys are restrained are actually lined with bear fur, the same as \nthe seats of the Russian cosmonauts. This is done because the Russian \ncosmonauts believe such seat covering is thought to be more \ncomfortable.\n  Finally, I believe that question about whether the Russians might be \nable to financially support these missions without United States \ninvolvement is unclear. On May 24, 1996, in a Science magazine article \non the Bion project, the director of biomedical and life sciences at \nNASA is quoted as saying ``if NASA were to pull out, Russia could \nproceed on its own. If they can afford to do it, they will. It's their \nanimals and their capsule.'' The July 12, 1996, Science paints a \ndifferent picture. Quoting the head of the Bion Program at the \nInstitute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow, Science reports that he is \nconcerned about the fate of Bion 12. ``Given Russia's cash strapped \nspace program,'' he says, ``if any partner pulled out it would pose a \nserious problem.''\n\n  In the end, either situation concerns me and I think it concerns the \nSenator from New Hampshire and the rest of us who are working on this. \nI believe it confirms why colleagues should oppose the committee \namendment and table it. If Russia can afford this experiment, then \nRussia should conduct it. If Russia can't support it, and the United \nStates is funding the lion's share of the program, then we should not \nproceed with a program about which there are serious lingering concerns \nabout humane treatment of the animal subjects as well as the necessity \nfor the program. The Merrell panel specifically calls for an additional \nethicist to be added to the research team, and I believe casts doubt on \nBion 11. I can assure Senators that if we ignore the action of the \nHouse, we will be asked to terminate Bion 12 next year. Instead, I \nthink we should act now to end our involvement and to reinstate the \nHouse-passed language.\n  Everyone knows the Federal budget has constant pressure from numerous \ncompeting needs, and NASA itself is facing significant pressures. For \nexample, last Friday's--August 30, 1996--Washington Post reported that \nthere is an ongoing dialog among top officials at Kennedy Space Center \nabout significant civil service cuts that may number as many as 1,445 \npeople with 547 layoffs at that site which now employs approximately \n2,100 Federal workers. Given those kind of pressures, this project \nmakes little sense. It cannot be fiscally justified.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and urge my colleagues to \nsupport the motion to table, which will have the effect of supporting \nthe committee amendment and opposing spending additional dollars on the \nBion Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friends from New Hampshire and Wisconsin, and I want to \nspeak in support of the Bion mission.\n  We are singling out a particular area of animal research because it \nhappens to be on a space flight, I guess, because it happens to be up \nthere a little bit above the atmosphere, going around, where we have a \nunique opportunity to do some of this research in the microgravity \nenvironment of near-Earth space. We are not talking about doing away \nwith all animal research, as I understand it. Yet, we have hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of animal research projects with \nanimals involved in medical research right here on Earth.\n  My distinguished colleague from New Hampshire said a while ago, why \ndo we need these monkeys up there because we have some 38 years of \nhuman experience in space? We do have that kind of experience. But I \nalso submit we have hundreds of thousands of years of human experience \nright here on Earth and we still find the need to do medical research \nhere on Earth and use animals to do that medical research.\n  So, if we are just against medical research using animals, that is \none thing. But to say that because we happen to be up here a little \ndistance off the Earth's surface, we are now going to prohibit it up \nthere, or to say the money spent, the comparatively small amount of \nmoney being spent on this is going to be cut out, I just think flies in \nthe face of what our experience has been with animal research.\n  What am I talking about? Here on Earth we now have open heart \noperations. I am a frustrated doctor at heart. I started out wanting to \nbe a doctor years ago. I got sidetracked by World War II. But when I \nwas in Houston with the astronaut program down there, Mike DeBakey was \na good friend of ours. I used to go in and watch him operate. Do you \nknow what all those operations were prefaced on? They prefaced them on \nanimal experiments. The heart operation, the valve replacements and the \noperations of heart replacement, all were done with animal experiments \nahead of time.\n  We could go on and on. For all the drug tests that we have in this \ncountry--I do not mean drug tests to see if people are using drugs, I \nmean drugs that are antibiotics and so on that we use--we preface our \nhuman use by making experiments on animals. I am sure the whole medical \ncommunity would be up in arms if we tried to knock all of that out.\n  We try out vaccines on animals. We try out bone research on things \nthat will make bones knit together better. We do that in animal \nresearch. We do that in eye research, we did corneal transplants on \nanimals--I believe it was rabbits, as I recall --before we did it on \nhuman beings. We did that because it is safer for people to have that \nkind of experiment.\n  We were concerned these experiments be done humanely, so we passed \nthe Animal Welfare Act. It is the law that sets the standards of how we \npermit animal research to be done in this country, so it is done \nhumanely. Those rules are basically the rules that we follow and also, \nas I understand it, the Russians follow, or are following now. I am the \nfirst to say some of the things we heard early on about the Bion \nproject, I questioned about whether it was being done properly or not. \nBut those things are corrected if they ever were true. They are being \ncorrected and they are being monitored very, very closely.\n  The point is, these Bion flights represent an effective approach to \nconducting very important biomedical research. To knock this out just \nbecause the laboratory happens to be up here weightless, going around \nin microgravity up a little bit off the Earth's surface here, to knock \nit out because it is part of the space program and ignore all of the \nother hundreds of thousands of animal research projects going on, I do \nnot think makes much sense.\n  Bion research is fundamental, peer-reviewed research at the center of \nNASA's program for exploring how the body changes in microgravity, and \nthere are a lot of changes. NASA and Russia have cooperated on Bion \nmissions for 20 years now. This is not something just starting up. We \nhave been at this for a long time. The fact is, we have used the Bion \nspacecraft to produce major findings on space flight and health.\n  Mr. President, the amendment's proponents argue that the Bion \nmissions are not necessary because we have already sent people in orbit \nand, therefore, we can study the effects of microgravity directly on \npeople who have already flown. Obviously, we know people have survived \nspace flight, but this\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\ndoes not mean we know what happens in our bodies. We are still trying \nto find out what the basic changes in the body are that occur in \nmicrogravity that give us some of the results that we get. Just as \nresearchers on the ground sometimes need to use animal models by the \nhundreds of thousands all over the country, researchers in space must \nuse animals as well.\n  The plain fact is that for some types of research, animals are better \nsubjects than people. For one thing, human astronauts are not \ngenetically uniform. Compared to lab animals, there is a lot more \nnatural variability in the human population from both environmental and \ngenetic factors. With the small sample sizes and brief time periods \ninherent in most space flight opportunities, more reliable baselines \nfor certain measurements can be obtained using lab animals.\n  Another benefit is that a lab animal's diet can be more easily \ncontrolled than an astronaut's. Astronauts up there for 14 days, 17 \ndays, as the STS-78 mission, get a little cranky when you tell them \nthey have to eat the same pellets for 14 days, or whatever it is you \nwant the animals to eat to control its diet and dietary intake.\n  Given the fact lab animals fulfill a vital role in microgravity \nresearch, it is imperative that these animals be treated in a humane \nway, and I agree with that 100 percent. All people involved with the \nBion Program should be held accountable for the animals' welfare, and \nthey are. The animals' care and well-being is maintained before and \nduring flight. Following the flight, the animals are returned to the \nRussian breeding colony, or another suitable habitat, where they are \nmaintained humanely for the remainder of their natural lives. This \nprogram has been reviewed--I point this out very specifically--this \nprogram has been reviewed by independent experts who have concluded \nthat it is legitimate science performed in a humane manner.\n  Several months back, Dr. Jane Goodall, who is famous for her primate \nexperiences in Africa along Lake Tanganyika in Africa--she is known all \nover the world, and I have known her a number of years--contacted me \nabout her concerns in this regard, about the Bion Program specifically. \nI relayed these concerns both by telephone and letter to NASA \nAdministrator Dan Goldin, who established an independent task force to \nreview the Bion project. I want to quote from a letter the task force \nwrote to the chairman of the NASA advisory council dated July 2, 1996. \nI think the letter was entered into the Record a little while ago by \nSenator Bond. The task force unanimously recommended the Bion project \nproceed with the following findings:\n\n       (1) The quality of science proposed . . . is excellent. It \n     has been reviewed by peers in a very thorough and \n     repeated manner and has withstood analysis for nearly a \n     decade.\n       (2) There are no known alternative means to achieve the \n     objectives of the proposal.\n       (3) The animal care and welfare proposals meet all \n     requirements and--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     and U.S. legal standards.\n\n  In other words, the Bion project is being conducted under our Animal \nWelfare Act, under the same guidelines we have for our own research \nlaboratories in this country.\n  In addition, the task force recommended NASA devise and implement a \nbioethics review concerning their policies for animal experimentation \nand that this review include participation by a professional \nbioethicist. Not only did Mr. Goldin accept this recommendation, but \nsuch a task force review is getting underway with not one but four \nbioethicists, in addition to other veterinarians and researchers.\n  Mr. President, NASA has made the space environment seem almost \ncommonplace. It has been an amazingly successful program. We see videos \nof astronauts floating in the space shuttle, and it looks like a lot of \nfun, and it is. But along with that goes an awful lot of research. It \nis a tremendous amount of research. That is the only reason we have the \nprogram, is to do basic research, not to see whether we can go up there \nand get back now, but to do basic research in orbit.\n  It is easy to forget just what a foreign and challenging environment \nspace is. Zero gravity is unique, not just in the history of human \nexperience, but in the history of life itself. Few of us have been able \nto experience weightlessness, and we are the first people to have done \nthat in the some 4.5-billion-year history of life on Earth. Nothing in \nour evolutionary history prepares us for being weightless.\n  But here is what we find after people are up there weightless for a \nperiod of time:\n  The bones begin to lose some of their mass. Calcium content comes out \nof the bones;\n  Muscles atrophy, they get less capable;\n  The body's system for maintaining balance begins to change;\n  Coordination is reduced;\n  The immune system becomes less effective;\n  Sleep patterns and the body's natural clock are affected. And that is \njust for starters.\n  Some of my colleagues may find this list has a very, very familiar \nring to it, and I talked about this in more detail on the floor \nyesterday. I know it has a familiar ring to me. It is not because I \nhave been in orbit, but because reduced muscle mass, bones becoming \nmore fragile, deteriorated balance and coordination, reduced immune \nefficiency and sleep disturbances are changes that occur with the \nnormal aging process here on Earth, as well as what happens on a space \nflight.\n  What are the mechanisms for these changes? Are the same mechanisms in \nplay among the aging on Earth and the astronauts in orbit? Would an \nolder astronaut experience slower or faster deconditioning on orbit? \nAre these changes reversible in space by some artificial means or here \non Earth for those of our elderly citizens, some 44 million, almost, \nabove the age of 60, as I pointed out yesterday? If so, then how do we \nmake these changes reversible for benefit right here on Earth?\n  We do not know the answers to these questions, and that is the \nchallenge. But, Mr. President, that is also the opportunity and that is \nwhy the Bion missions are so important, because when we identify the \nunderlying mechanisms by which the body adapts to space, we may also \nidentify much, much more.\n\n  What if this research leads to new insights on how to treat \nosteoporosis? Not only would that make the lives of thousands of \nelderly people more enjoyable, it would save countless millions of \ndollars in health care costs.\n  A better understanding of balance and vestibular changes in the \nelderly could help prevent falls and avoid debilitating injuries for \nelderly people. That is another area.\n  The immune system changes. Think what happens if we can just figure \nout what the common ground is between what happens to people in space \nover a lengthy period of time as the immune system goes downhill, \nbecomes less effective and in the elderly here on Earth whose immune \nsystems normally with old age become less effective. If we could find \nout by comparing back and forth what causes that kind of a mechanism, \ncan we trigger it off artificially, is this a new approach to AIDS, is \nit something we can learn here that is a new approach to cancer?\n  We do not know, but that is the purpose of research, to find out \nexactly some of those answers that are of benefit not only in space but \nwill have direct application to people's lives right here on Earth.\n  I am not trying to say that the Bion missions are the key to the \nfountain of youth. Far from it. But it is basic research on processes \nanalogous to aging that can only be performed on orbit, and we don't \nknow where it will lead. But if there is one thing we know from our \nwhole U.S. experience in supporting basic research throughout our \nhistory, it is that money spent in this area normally has a way of \npaying off beyond anything we normally see at the outset.\n  I think we owe it to our children and to our grandchildren to find \nthe answers as best we can to some of these things and the opportunity \nwe have to do that.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have heard me speak in detail about the \nvalue of basic research and how we do not always know what benefits \nwill come from such research. But let me just talk very briefly about \nsome of the benefits and technology spinoffs that have come out of the \nBion Program to date.\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\n  Doctors at the University of California at San Francisco are using \nthe biosensors and telemetry technology developed for the Bion Program \nto monitor the condition of fetuses with life threatening conditions. \nFor some congenital medical conditions, doctors can more safely and \neffectively operate on fetuses in the womb. Such surgery was much \nriskier before this sensor technology was available.\n  A computerized video system developed to test the behavioral \nperformance of Bion monkeys is now being used to teach learning \ndisabled children.\n  A device to noninvasively test bone strength was proven effective in \nBion monkeys and is now commercially available to assess the condition \nof human patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone diseases.\n  While conducting ground-based research in preparation for a Bion \nmission, Dr. Danny Riley of the Medical College of Wisconsin discovered \na staining technique that surgeons can use to more accurately reconnect \nthe peripheral nerves in severed limbs. And this discovery did not \ninvolve any amputation of animals' limbs to do that research. In the \npast, the only markers surgeons have had for accurately rejoining the \nperipheral nerves have been the positions and size of the nerve axons. \nDr. Riley discovered a staining technique that stains sensory axons but \nnot motor axons. Not only is this a boost for neurological research, \nbut it will improve the successful prospects for reattaching limbs that \nhave been severed.\n  Mr. President, to conclude--I gave a more lengthy statement yesterday \nin detail of some of these areas--but to conclude, Bion research is \nimportant. It is thoroughly reviewed research. It is conducted \nhumanely. It presents a real opportunity for new insights into the \nhuman body every bit as much as medical research right here on the \nsurface of the Earth.\n  We have a new environment up here. It is the microgravity of space \nflight. It offers a whole new opportunity to do animal research ahead \nof the human beings perhaps doing the same thing later on. As I said, \ninitially we do those same things right here on Earth with regard to \nall sorts of experiments that have led to heart operations, drug tests, \nnew vaccines, bone research, eye research, and so on, that we do here \non Earth. And I see no reason whatsoever why we should knock this out \nwhen it is a very, very valuable program.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will defeat this amendment and I \nhope our colleagues will see the wisdom of going in that direction \nalso. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Smith motion. A \nwhile ago, the chairman of this subcommittee on appropriations said \nthat we run into a lot of things in this business, and especially here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate, that we do not quite understand. I \nchair the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and, of course, Space, \nand NASA. That is the committee that provides the authorization for \nNASA.\n\n  So I state my support for the Bion Program and, of course, this \nappropriations here which rejects the House language that prohibits the \nfunding of the Bion 11 and 12 missions. In science and technology we \nrun into a lot of things that we do not quite understand because I do \nnot think there are very many of us on this floor that are scientists.\n  The Bion Program is an important cooperative space venture between \nthe United States, Russian, and French space agencies for international \nbiomedical research using Russian-provided support systems, their \nspacecraft, payload and, of course, the rhesus monkeys. It is a cost-\neffective program. It is based on sound science. It has been peer-\nreviewed, I think, four times. I could be wrong, but I think four \ntimes. And every time they have come away with the recommendation that \nthe research should move forward.\n  Some of the results are likely to provide insights into understanding \ncomplex physiological processes which occur during the normal aging \nprocess or are involved in Earth-based diseases such as anemia, \nosteoporosis, muscular atrophy and the immune system dysfunction.\n  In Billings, MT, the Deaconess Research Institute there has the \nlargest data base on osteoporosis in women that there is in the \ncountry. Because of a stable population in my town of Billings, MT, \nthey have been able to move forward on a lot of this research. But the \nresearch that is done in space becomes evermore important. Indeed, the \nfirst 10 missions of the Bion Program have already benefited our lives \nthrough technological spinoffs, such as the development of devices to \nmonitor human fetuses following life-saving surgery and to \nnoninvasively test bone strength in patients suffering from bone \ndiseases. These benefits to our health and well-being are an addition \nto the knowledge gained to help NASA protect the health and safety of \nour space travelers.\n  Yes, there are those who would like to scrap the space program \naltogether. I am not one of those. I am saying that this society, this \nAmerican society, in fact the unique American is a person that is \nalways reaching out, going into the unknown, exploring the unknown. \nWhen we quit doing that, then we lose a part of ourselves.\n  Basically, I have a hunch that this amendment is not really about \nNASA. It is an anti-animal research amendment. The animal welfare \ngroups have targeted the Bion project for elimination. They claim that \nresearch is not necessary and it is inhumane and it wastes the \ntaxpayers' money. And all of that could not be further from the truth.\n  Animal welfare groups are waging an all-out campaign against the \nprogram simply because four Russian rhesus monkeys are scheduled to be \nused in the Bion 11 and 12 missions. Because of this continued \npressure, the Bion Program has been continuously scrutinized and it has \nbeen continuously peer-reviewed. The experiments were peer-reviewed in \n1988, 1992, and again in 1993.\n  In December 1995 the Administrator of NASA, Daniel Goldin, again \nrequested an external panel of scientists to review the research. And \nthe 12-person panel of independent experts strongly recommended that \nNASA proceed with the remaining Bion missions. As in the previous \nreviews, their findings reconfirmed the importance of the program and \nits scientific merit. The panel concluded that the science is \nexcellent; rhesus monkeys are the appropriate species to address the \nscientific objectives; and there are no alternative means for obtaining \nthe essential information that will be gained from this research.\n\n  So the Bion Program is being debated here because the most radical \nanimal rights activists have elevated their own agenda above the \ninterests of good science and, further, above the lives of human \nbeings.\n  I think this amendment, if it is passed, will have very serious \nrepercussions on other Federal agencies. I think these agencies include \nthe National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans' \nAdministration. Their support for research in the biomedical and life \nsciences can also be jeopardized by the outcome of this vote \ntoday. There is a well-established scientific process leading to awards \nof Federal support. Being chairman of that committee, we deal with this \nevery day. The proposed experiments undergo peer review by experts, and \nthis includes the review of the use and care of animals that are used \nin research programs. So this is nothing new to the authorizing \ncommittee that I chair.\n\n  This amendment contradicts existing Federal policies, contradicts the \nprocedures for scientific peer review and laboratory animal welfare \nthat has already been put in place by Congress. It sends a message that \nMembers of Congress, not scientists, are the best judge of the quality \nof the science projects. I, therefore, challenge any Members of this \nbody, as certain projects come before us, especially in the area of \nresearch science and science development, that if everybody is an \nexpert on everything that we talked about and allocated money to do \nresearch for, I would really be surprised. But we do have a peer review \nsystem, and, thus, if the passage of this amendment were successful, it \nwould undermine the\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nwhole foundation that has been assumed on scientific research.\n  Animal research plays an integral part in all of our lives. It has \nbeen said that without animal research, most, if not all, of the \nmedical advances in the last century might never have occurred. For \nexample, we could still have polio, and today nearly 38 million \nAmericans would be at risk of death from a heart attack, stroke, kidney \nfailure, for the lack of medication to control their high blood \npressure. I could go on and on. I am getting more of an education in \nthat field all the time. I happen to be a very proud father of a doctor \nwho graduates medical school next spring. So I have a feeling that my \neducation is going to continue until they put me in the ground, so to \nspeak.\n  The antianimal research amendment forces NASA to withdraw from a \nsigned contract with the other nations--Russia and France. It derails \nscientific peer review and thwarts the Animal Welfare Act. Is this the \nmessage, I ask this body, that we want to send? Allowing a single \ninterest group that totally opposes animal research to dictate NASA's \nor other Government agencies' research goals cannot be tolerated. I \nhave seen these groups work. Sometimes they have a less-than-candid \nview of what has to happen as far as science and technology is all \nabout just to further their own cause.\n  So, Mr. President, the Bion Program is worthy. The amendment is not \ntruly about the merits of research or the costs, because the costs are \nnothing. What it is about is the welfare of animals being used for \nresearch. I support appropriate procedures to protect the safety and \nwell-being of animals, but this amendment is simply inappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator withhold for a second?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I am pleased to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I bring to the Presiding Officer's \nattention, and to my colleagues' in the Senate, I believe we are moving \nat a good pace in this debate. I see on the floor our colleague from \nTennessee, Dr. Frist, who wants to speak on this. I do, as well. I \nencourage anybody else who wishes to speak, to please come to the floor \nso we can move to concluding this debate before the respective caucus. \nI think this has been an outstanding discussion.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Maryland for pointing that out. I \nhope if there are others--particularly proponents of the motion to \nstrike--they will come down by the time the Senator from Maryland is \nprepared to talk. I have asked her if she will conclude comments on \nthis side. I think that the Senator from New Hampshire wants to close \nand then make the tabling motion. But I sincerely hope that we can wrap \nthis up by noon. The Senator from South Carolina would like to speak \nfor 3 minutes on this measure. I hope we can conclude this debate by \nnoon, or at least by 12:30, and then have the tabling motion. We will \ndiscuss with the leadership when that vote will occur.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, because, as I understand it, when the motion to \ntable is made, isn't the vote immediate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a nondebatable posture at that \npoint, that is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Must the vote occur immediately, or could it be delayed \nafter the party conferences?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless the Members would seek a unanimous \nconsent agreement to schedule it for a different time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. While the Senator from Utah is speaking, perhaps we can \ntalk with the leaders about how they wish to handle the vote. I believe \nthe Democratic leader wishes it to be after the conference.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I will defer to our \nleadership. I understand from the Senator from New Hampshire that there \nare no further speakers on his side. So we will hear from the speakers \nwho are now lined up to speak in opposition to that tabling motion. \nThen we will, after they have spoken, ask the Senator from New \nHampshire to proceed and make the tabling motion, perhaps, with a \nunanimous consent request that the vote be postponed until a time \ncertain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was particularly enlightened by the \ncomments of the Senator from Ohio, who has a unique perspective on this \nparticular issue. As I have noted here before, I come as the successor \nto Senator Jake Garn, who also has a unique perspective on this issue, \nand who, if he were still in the Senate, would be speaking out very \nstrongly in favor of the committee position.\n  We are talking about America's space effort, America's interest in \nexploring in space, and we made the decision, as a country, to put \nhumans into space for a prolonged period of time at some point in the \nfuture. It makes no sense to fund a program and put humans into space \nand not to do the research necessary to understand what will happen to \nhumans when they get there. That is essentially what the motion to \ntable would do. It would say, yes, we will go ahead and fund the \nprograms to put humans in space, but we will not fund the research to \nfind out what will happen to them.\n  We are told that we already know what will happen, that humans have \nstayed in space for 439 days. It is true that on the basis of that, we \nknow what happens. They experience loss of bone mass and muscle \ndeterioration, and brain and motor functioning is different. We know \nthat space affects the spinal cord and bones, muscles and immune \nsystem, as well as the brain. But what we don't know is whether these \neffects are long-term, and whether the bone and muscle loss is \npermanent. We don't know that. Can the deterioration be counteracted in \nspace? We don't know that. What else occurs that might not have \noccurred in 400 days that might occur for a longer period of time? We \ndon't know that.\n\n  We have an opportunity to find out by using animal experiments in \nspace. Science doesn't tell us where the answers are. As we look at the \ngreat breakthroughs in science, they have come, sometimes, with hard \nresearch. They have sometimes come by complete chance, as people are \nlooking for one thing and stumble across something else. But we do know \nthat they never come if the research is not conducted and if people do \nnot make an attempt to find out these answers.\n  I won't repeat all of the arguments that have been made on the floor, \nbecause I think they have been very cogent. I do agree that the Senate \nis not the appropriate place to try to micromanage a scientific project \nwhen, in fact, it has been subjected to the amount of peer review and \noverall management guidance that this particular program has.\n  The Senator from Ohio has quoted Dr. Ronald Merrell, the chairman of \nsurgery from Yale, who is the scientist who has written to the NASA \nadvisory council. I urge my colleagues to refer to those quotes. I \nwould like to add just a few more to those which we have already seen. \nFrom the American Physiological Society, I have a letter that says:\n\n       The research is scientifically necessary, important to \n     NASA's mission, and should be allowed to proceed.\n       The Bion research is intended to expand what we know about \n     how space flight affects muscles, bones, balance, and \n     performance. While human beings have spent long periods of \n     time in space, it has not been possible to fully document the \n     changes to their bodies. In part that is because for their \n     own comfort and protection, astronauts take medications to \n     counteract space sickness and do intensive exercise to \n     overcome the harmful wasting effects of prolonged \n     weightlessness. These countermeasures make it hard to \n     determine exactly what is happening to their bodies. The Bion \n     11 and 12 experiments are intended to fill gaps in our \n     knowledge so that we can find better ways to counteract the \n     effects of weightlessness on the body.\n\n  I found that interesting. I remember talking with our former \ncolleague, Senator Garn, about the problems that he had both preparing \nfor his space flight and some of the space sickness experiences he had \nwhile he was there. He took the countermeasures to which the letter \nthat I quoted refers, and he was able to function properly. But that is \nsomething that had not occurred to me until this letter came in as a \nreason why we need to proceed with the animal research.\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n  From the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology, I \noffer the following:\n\n       To kill this program just as mankind embarks on permanent \n     presence in space would be a serious mistake.\n\n  From the Association of American Universities, the National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges, I have this quote:\n\n       We are concerned about the precedent this amendment sets in \n     terminating research that has been peer reviewed and approved \n     on the basis of scientific merits.\n\n  That is another interesting thought where the Congress has authorized \nscience to go forward. The science has been peer reviewed. It has been \ndeclared to be appropriate. Then for the Congress to come in and say, \nno, we do not like your peer reviews, we are not going to pay any \nattention to the scientists, we are going to override it, is, indeed, a \nbad precedent for us to set.\n  Finally, from the Americans for Medical Progress Educational \nFoundation, this quote:\n\n       Bion makes sense.\n       (1) Scientifically it will yield critical knowledge of the \n     effects of space travel on human physiology. This knowledge \n     is essential for the safety of current and future space \n     travelers;\n       (2) Financially, $14 million of the total $33 million has \n     already been spent. To halt in midstride would mean that all \n     of that money was wasted. More to the point, Russia has \n     funded the vast majority of the costs of all of these \n     projects. If the United States was to attempt to garner this \n     data on its own, the costs could exceed $.5 billion.\n\n  In summary then, Mr. President, I am a supporter of the space \nprogram. I believe we should move ahead with our attempt to discover \nand explore in this final frontier. I do not believe that we should \nprepare the space program to send humans up into space without doing \nall of the appropriate research that we possibly can on the impact on \nhuman physiology of space travel. This program is the most intelligent, \nthe most carefully charted, and the most financially responsible way \nfor us to gather that data.\n  For those reasons I support the committee's position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the tabling motion and in \nsupport of the Bion research project.\n  My perspective is a bit different than many of the people that you \nhave heard from today in that we have talked this morning and debated \nthis morning about animal research, about the use of various animals, \nnotably monkeys and primates in research.\n  I stand before you as one who has seen through my own picture window \nas a heart and lung transplant surgeon, as a heart specialist, as a \nlung specialist, as someone who spent the last 20 years of his life in \nthe field of medicine, as one who has been a beneficiary of that \nresearch and seen the great benefits to mankind, to people throughout \nthe world.\n  My perspective is one of a scientist who has written over 100 papers \nthat have been peer reviewed. I would like to come through the peer-\nreview process because I think it is not only critical to the way we \naddress this fairly complex issue but one which I think the peer-review \nprocess and the importance it places on our review will go a long way \nto keep us, Members of Congress, from micromanaging the scientific \nprocess today.\n  About 2 months ago I was in Tennessee, and someone came up to me and \nhanded me a picture of a young 6-year-old boy. I did not recognize the \nboy, to be honest. But the two proud grandparents, I found out later, \nhanded me the picture and were a little surprised I did not recognize \nhim. But I did not recognize him because I had not seen him in 6 years. \nHe was 6 years old. At 3 weeks of age I had done a heart transplant on \nthat young boy when he was, I think, 20 or 21 days of age. Now he is \nalive today playing baseball and in the first grade. I talked to his \nparents actually just a couple of weeks ago.\n  The research which allowed me to take the 5-week-old heart and put it \nin a 3-week-old individual that has allowed this little boy to be alive \ntoday came out of operations on monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and, yes, as a \nU.S. Senator I can tell you that I have operated on rhesus monkeys. I \nhave done it in a humane way, and those were treated just like other \npatients--were given anesthesia and were protected. Safeguards were in \nplace. But that little boy is alive today because I learned that \nprocedure and helped to figure out that procedure based on operating on \nmonkeys about 8 years ago.\n  I can't help but think of a 60-year-old man today who I did a heart \ntransplant on about probably 6 years ago who was kept alive for about \n32 days with an artificial heart. That artificial heart I had learned \nto implant and figured out the details of in animal research spending \nday after day operating and placing that device in animals before \nplacing it into a human being who is alive today because of the \ntechnology and because of the scientific advances that were made \nbecause of animal research.\n  I can't help but think about 1986 when I was engaged very directly in \nprimate research doing heart-hung transplants on monkeys. Just 12 \nmonths after doing those heart-lung transplants on monkeys in a humane \nway, I was able to transplant in a 21-year-old woman who had in-stage \nheart and lung disease, who underwent the first successful heart-lung \ntransplant in the Southeast back in 1985.\n\n  So you can see that I stand before you as someone who has had very \ndirect experience in the benefits of this type of research. I say all \nof that because a lot of the rhetoric that has sprung around today of \nmonkeys in space and getting monkeys off the taxpayers' backs we really \nneed to put aside and engage this in a very serious and scientific way \nbecause this scientific research, I think, can be critical to the \nsafety of human beings both in space but also ultimately in this \ncountry.\n  Much has been said in terms of the peer-review process. Let me tell \nyou as a scientist, as someone who has operated on monkeys, as someone \nwho has taken that research to the human arena, I cannot stand before \nthis body and before the American people and say that I, Bill Frist, a \nphysician with about 16 years of medical training, can evaluate this \nspecific research. So what do I do? I turn to my peers who are experts, \nwho five times in the past through a peer-review process have looked at \nthese specific projects and said that this is sound research, that this \nis important research, important research that needs to be carried out \nin this environment and elsewhere.\n  We have to be very careful, I think, in this body before engaging in \nthe micromanagement of the type of research that goes on in this \ncountry, or that will go on. The temptation is going to always be, I \nthink, to rely upon what feels best to us as legislators, or to people \nwho come before us. I think we have to be very careful, in setting \nnational priorities, to rely upon the medical community, to rely upon \nthe scientific community through that peer-review process.\n  In that regard, much has been made already this morning of the fact \nthat the Bion experiments have been peer reviewed five times for \nscientific merit. We have already talked about that. In December 1995 \nan expert panel of scientists--the Bion Sience Assessment Panel--\nconducted a review of the science which encompasses the United States \nand French portions of the experiments. We know that the Bion \nassessment panel--this was mentioned by the Senator from Wisconsin--\nrecommended certain procedural improvements in program management that \noverall the panel has commended since as meritorious and recommended \nthat the Bion 11 and 12 missions proceed.\n  In addition to this 1995 review, we had reviews of outside committees \nin 1988 and 1992 and 1993. In 1988, a panel convened by the American \nInstitute of Biological Sciences reviewed and determined the scientific \nmerit of the experimental proposal submitted in response to a NASA \nresearch announcement.\n  In March 1992, a second independent review of the integrated United \nStates-French set of flight experiments was conducted to assess \ncontinued relevance of rhesus experiments, and again they recommended \nthat the rhesus project should continue. And in July 1993, an \nindependent science critical design review gave the rhesus\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nproject the authority to proceed with the transition to payload \ndevelopment.\n  I did receive a letter from the Association of American Medical \nColleges which most people know represents over 120 accredited U.S. \nmedical schools, represents some 400 major teaching hospitals, \nrepresents 74 Veterans' Administration medical centers, 86 academic and \nprofessional societies representing 87,000 faculty members and the \nNation's 67,000 medical students and 102,000 medical and surgical and \nother medical specialty residents.\n  This letter basically says that ``the AAMC is deeply concerned about \nthe precedent the House action sets in terminating research that has \nbeen reviewed and approved on the basis of scientific merit. The Bion \nProject has undergone repeated external expert review.''\n  They close by saying that the AAMC, that is, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, ``strongly supports the use of merit review \nto determine how limited Federal funds may most productively be spent \nfor scientific research.''\n  Again, a letter that has been quoted already this morning, from the \npresident of the Association of American Universities, from the \npresident of the National Association of State Universities and Land \nGrant Colleges, and from the president of the Association of American \nMedical Colleges reads: ``The Bion missions have been peer reviewed and \napproved by five independent panels over the past 8 years. The most \nrecent panel found that the quality of science proposed is very high.''\n  And let me underline this following part, that ``there are no known \nalternative means to achieve the objectives'' and that ``the animal \ncare and welfare proposals meet all requirements of United States legal \nstandards.''\n  In closing, as I step back again as someone who has seen the benefits \nof science in primate research, as someone who has some experience with \nthe peer review process, I would like to caution my fellow Members that \nwe must be very careful in micromanaging biomedical research. That is \nwhy we have a peer review process, and that is why it works so well. So \nlet us let that process work.\n  I do hope my colleagues will support the continuation of the Bion \nProgram for these reasons and resist that temptation to micromanage \nresearch which has also met the criteria of numerous peer reviews.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield me 3 minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to thank the able Senator.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 3666, the fiscal year \n1997 appropriations bill for the Department of the Veterans Affairs, \nHousing and Urban Development, and independent agencies. This is a \nbroad measure which provides appropriations for a variety of programs. \nIt funds veterans, public and assisted housing, environmental \nprotection, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other \nprograms. I commend the managers of this bill for their balanced \napproach in funding the many Government functions contained in this \nbill.\n\n  Mr. President, let me note a few of the highlights of this bill. This \nbill reflects the intent of Congress of keeping Government costs under \ncontrol. The total appropriation, $84.7 billion, is only a slight \nincrease over last year's funding. However, it is $2.8 billion less \nthan the President requested. Reductions to the President's request are \nprimarily in administrative costs. In most program areas, for actual \nbenefits, funding in this bill is above the President's request.\n  I particularly support the committee's funding proposal for veterans \nprograms. This bill provides $39 billion for veterans, which is an \nincrease over last year's funding and above the President's request. \nThese funds will adequately provide for veterans' compensation and \npensions, medical care, and construction projects related to outpatient \ncare, medical research, and veterans' cemeteries.\n  As a member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and as chairman of \nthe Committee on Armed Services, my commitment to the veterans of our \narmed services remains strong.\n  I have stated many times that the highest obligation of American \ncitizenship is to defend this country in time of need. In return, this \ngrateful Nation must care for those who are in any way disabled because \nof their patriotic duty in our Armed Forces. I believe the funding \nlevels in this bill will provide the resources for the Government to \nmeet its obligations to our Nation's veterans.\n  Again, I congratulate the managers of this bill for the support of \nour veterans. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I think we are about to move to the conclusion of this debate, and I \nthink it has been an excellent debate. I think proponents of \nterminating the Bion Project are, indeed, well-intentioned people in \nthe Senate, the Senator from Wisconsin, and the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I think their sensitivity and concern about the sanctity \nof life should be acknowledged. It is exactly because of our concern \nabout human life that many of us who are proponents of science and \ntechnology support well-regulated, well-monitored, well-thought-through \nand necessary animal research.\n  The issue of animal research is not new to this Senator. As a Senator \nfrom Maryland, I not only have the honor of representing one of the \nprimary space centers in the United States, Goddard, but I also \nrepresent the National Institutes of Health as well as Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and the University of Maryland, all of which engage in very \nstrong scientific research and, in many instances, do use animal \ntesting in their protocols.\n  So as someone who believes that we need to have scientific \nbreakthroughs to save lives, whether it is at NASA or NIH, I do believe \nwe do need to have animal research in life science projects.\n  I am not alone in that view. We have heard from a Senator-astronaut, \nSenator Glenn, from Ohio, who, as we know, was the first astronaut-\nSenator to orbit the Earth, and I think Senator Glenn is alive today \nbecause the first lives to go into orbit were monkeys and we knew how \nto deal with gravity, how to deal with oxygen, how to make sure that we \ncould launch him and bring him back safely. We heard from the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Bill Frist, a medical doctor, \nagain talking about the compelling nature of doing animal research in \norder to be able to save human lives.\n  Much has been said about this project, and I would like to use this \nopportunity to engage in a factual conversation.\n  Just to go over some of the facts, I would like to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention that Bion 11 and Bion 12 are two cooperative \nUnited States, Russian, and French space flights and they are scheduled \nto go up October 1996 and July 1998 using Russian Bion biosatellites. \nNow, Bion spacecraft are satellites that do not have crews on them, so \nthis will be unmanned. They were developed by the Russians, and they \nfly biological experiments with, yes, primates--rodents, insects, and \nplants--in near Earth orbit.\n  In very general terms, the major objectives of these biosatellite \ninvestigations are to study the effects of low gravity and space \nradiation environment on the structure and function of individual \nphysiological systems and the body as a whole.\n  Understand, this is not the space shuttle with monkeys on it or \nrodents or insects or plants. These are 8 feet in diameter. They carry \na 2,000-pound payload. We have had about 10 of these since 1973. What \nwe are talking about here are 10 monkeys that were on previous Bion \nmissions that were recovered. In the Bion protocols the monkeys are \nactually recovered. Also, Bion protocols do not include the sacrifice \nof monkeys. So we are not talking about ghoulish, Kafka, grim practices \nhere. We are talking about research, done on mammals, that has been \nadequately scrutinized for protecting the animals.\n  First, the experiments have been peer reviewed four times for their \nmerit. So, no, these are not just idle experiments. They have been \nreviewed on many occasions for their scientific merit. The\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\nwhole point of their scientific merit was to ensure we were getting a \ndollar's worth of research for a dollar's worth of taxpayer dollars. \nAnd, was there another way to do this research on Earth? The answer \ncame back resoundingly that this was valid scientific research and it \nwas worth the money and it was worth the effort.\n  These protocols are evaluated and monitored for humane treatment of \nanimals. Prior to the external peer review by a group called the AIBS, \na scientific group, there was a prerequisite for funding in which the \nproposals needed to be reviewed by the sponsoring institution's \ninternal animal care and use committee. This is in accordance with the \nAnimal Welfare Act, that every institution that conducts research with \nFederal funds must have an animal care and use committee, it must \ninclude a veterinarian, a scientist, an ethicist, and so on. So, again, \nit was not ``let's put a bunch of monkeys or rodents in space and put \nelectrodes on them and see what happens.'' All of the scientific \nprotocols were used to ensure the Animal Welfare Act was honored and \nwas practiced on this project.\n  I knew there would be reservation because this was done by the \nRussians. We are not in the cold war, so that is not the issue. But, \nfrankly, one of the characteristics of the Russian space agency was the \nastronauts were known for their incredible bravery. It was an endurance \ncontest. Often, their work focused on endurance test research.\n  What ours is, though, is more about how we can protect astronauts in \nspace, but also learning from life science projects that would study \nthese biological effects that would protect people here on Earth.\n  What I am told is that NASA is gathering data on bone mass, muscles, \nbone structure, healing in space, osteoporosis--something of tremendous \ninterest to me--and so on. This research is leading to enormous medical \nadvances. This benefits you and I and other Americans. We hope to save \nyoung children because of Bion research. We are helping to protect \nwomen from debilitating bone disease, particularly osteoporosis.\n  Let me share a few examples. The Bion Project has enabled scientists \nto study the cause, treatment, and prevention of spinal cord injuries \nin space by using this primate research. The Bion Project has also \nproduced data on fluid and electrolyte balance. This has tremendous \nimpact on research for people with kidney problems on kidney dialysis. \nOften, people get sick not only because their kidneys are in failure \nbut because of the failure to maintain an electrolyte balance. It has \nalso looked at the generation of new blood cells and the whole issue of \nimmunology. It is related to cancer research.\n\n  We could give many examples of this. One of the things I think has \nalso been very important is, because of the technology to monitor the \nprimates, we have also been able to improve other monitoring systems--\nfor example, on fetal health, which I know is of great interest to many \nof our colleagues. The 8 joint Bion missions to date have produced \naccess to space for 100 U.S. experiments, 90 peer review journals, and \nhas accounted for one-half of all the life science flight experiments \naccomplished with nonhumans. According to NASA, similar unmanned \nsatellite programs developed by NASA alone, without Russian support, \nwould cost 20 to 30 times as much.\n  It is not our job to review the project for scientific merit. In \nfact, that has been established. It has been reviewed four times for \nthat merit. I believe we need to ensure the ongoing part in this.\n  Ames Research Center has an excellent animal care program, as \ndemonstrated by its full accreditation by the Association for the \nAssessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. \nThis is a nonprofit organization that reviews animal research around \nthe facilities to make sure they are fit for duty and humane in their \noperation.\n  So I think this project is of merit. I think we should continue it. I \ndo not think we should cancel it.\n  Earlier in the conversation, someone talked about the OSTP, the \nPresident's Office of Science and Technology. They also do support the \nproject. I have a letter here from Dr. Gibbons stating that. I ask \nunanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.\n     Memorandum for Dan Goldin, Administrator, NASA.\n     From: John H. Gibbons, Assistant to the President for Science \n         and Technology.\n     Subject: BION Task Force Recommendations.\n       Thank you for transmitting to me the recommendations from \n     the BION Task Force of the NASA Advisory Council. I was \n     pleased that you decided to form the Task Force to provide \n     you with independent and expert advice on the program. Their \n     recommendations are clear and confirm earlier findings by \n     other groups charged to review BION missions 11 and 12. The \n     scientific merit of the proposed research, as determined by \n     rigorous peer review, was judged as excellent and important \n     to the future of manned space flight. Furthermore, it is \n     noteworthy that the review panel observed that there is no \n     known alternative means to achieve the objectives of the \n     program. I also was pleased to learn that the animal care and \n     welfare proposals for the Rhesus monkeys meet U.S. legal \n     standards. Finally, I am sympathetic with the Task Force's \n     compliments to NASA for its leadership in bioethics and their \n     encouragement for NASA to expeditiously implement a bioethics \n     review policy, thereby continuing its leadership in this \n     important arena.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It said:\n\n       I was . . . pleased to learn that animal care and welfare \n     proposals . . . meet U.S. legal standards . . . and the \n     [NASA] task force compliments . . . its leadership in \n     bioethics [as well as its scientific merit].\n\n  So, when you hear from the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from \nTennessee, the scientific community, I think the evidence speaks for \nitself.\n  I know the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to conclude the debate \non this, and that is his right. We respect that. I just ask unanimous \nconsent that, when the Senator makes his tabling motion, the vote occur \nat 2:15.\n  I will reel that right back in. Senator Bond and I were trying to \nexpedite the vote. It is just a clarification of the time. Many of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are flying back in. They may be \ndelayed until afternoon, and I know they want to have their voices \nheard on this most important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, this debate, on the part of those who are \ndefending the project, I must say, has been very skillfully conducted. \nFrankly, someone who was paying maybe just a little attention to this \nand not to all of the detail would probably agree with them. It is \nunfortunate the debates and facts get twisted on the floor of the \nSenate as they do.\n  This basically now is coming down to being an anti-NASA vote, which \nit is not. I have made a very strong point earlier in my comments about \nmy strong support for NASA.\n  It does not take one dime from NASA. It allows NASA to reprogram the \nmoney into areas that I believe and I think NASA would probably agree \nare more important.\n  It is also coming down as being total opposition to any and all \nresearch that has ever been done on animals in the name of helping \nhuman beings. That is not the issue either.\n  The issue is very simply this: Do you continue to do research after \nyou have gotten the facts? Do you continue to do research over and over \nand over again for no reason?\n  No one has presented any good reason for this project. There have \nbeen some general statements made about research by some very \nsophisticated people who I certainly respect, such as the Senator from \nTennessee. That is not the issue. Once you develop a vaccine or once \nyou develop something that cures a disease, do you continue to do the \nsame research on the same vaccine over and over and over again once you \nhave found out what it does? If you vaccinate your child against \nsmallpox, do you continue to vaccinate over and over and over and over \nand over again, or is there some limit? That is the issue. Do you want \nto continue to waste $15.5 million on research which is duplicative or \ndon't you? That is the issue.\n  The Senator from Maryland said a few moments ago, ``It's not our job \nto review this project, or any project, for scientific merit,'' \nreferring to this project. ``It's not our job to review this project \nfor scientific merit.''\n  I ask my colleagues, if it is not our job, since this bill is before \nus, whose\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\njob is it? Whose job is it? The White House said, ``We don't need this \nproject.'' In essence, that was the conclusion they drew. The \nAdministrator of NASA, in a memo that cites him, basically agrees that \nwe do not need it. The House of Representatives has voted \noverwhelmingly, 244 to 170-something that we do not need it. So if it \nis not our job to review it, why is it here? Why is it in this bill? \nWhose job is it to review?\n  When we take that attitude, that is one of the reasons why we have a \n$5 trillion debt, Mr. President, because no one wants to take the time \nto review these projects, and the truth of the matter is, we have \noversight responsibility in this body, and I take it very seriously. So \nwe should review it. We should review everything. We do not review \nenough. If we reviewed more, we would find a lot more waste.\n  There has been a lot of testimony from people who are experts, and \nsome who pretend to be experts, in this debate. Let me cite a couple, \nbecause I think it is important to get some balance here.\n  Sharon Vanderlipp is a veterinarian. She writes a letter to me in \nwhich she says:\n\n       As former chief of veterinary services for NASA Ames \n     Research Center--\n\n  That is where this work is done; that is who supervises this project.\n\n       As former chief of veterinary services for NASA Ames \n     Research Center, and as a veterinarian with more than 15 \n     years experience in the specialty of laboratory animal \n     medicine--\n\n  I hardly would consider her an animal rights activist, I think we \ncould draw that conclusion fairly safely. She spent 15 years in \nlaboratory animal medicine--\n\n     I am writing to request your support of Smith-Feingold \n     regarding the Bion experiments. I support animal-related \n     research when there are no other research alternatives and \n     when the derived benefits justify the loss of animals lives \n     and monetary expenditure.\n       This is not the case in the Bion project.\n       It is the charge of the U.S. Senate to represent the will \n     of the constituency in determining how their tax dollars will \n     best serve them. There is still time to salvage this $15 \n     million.\n       During my service at NASA Ames Research Center, July 1993 \n     until my resignation in March of 1994, a review of the \n     medical records of the nonhuman primates indicated NASA's \n     failure to provide appropriate surgical monitoring, pre- and \n     post-operative care. Post-operative deaths were not uncommon. \n     These records were reviewed indepth by myself and included \n     animals involved in the Bion protocols.\n\n  She goes on to talk about some other violations.\n\n       NASA officials repeatedly ignored my request for assistance \n     in resolving a variety of animal welfare related issues.\n\n  She also says:\n\n       Many of the individuals associated with the animal research \n     components of Bion protocols are the same individuals who \n     demonstrated a total lack of respect for animal welfare laws.\n\n  And on and on.\n  Mr. President, there are people who are very close to this project, \nhighly respected people, who differ, as we heard differing opinions \nexpressed here earlier. I respect those differences. It does not mean, \nthough, that just because they have differences that they are correct.\n  I have a page here listing seven or eight physicians. Senator Frist \nis a physician. I respect him. But here are physicians who disagree \nwith him on this project. Let me just read a couple.\n  Dr. Roger White, board certified anesthesiologist, Mayo Clinic, Mr. \nPresident--Mayo Clinic:\n\n       Any assessment must be reviewed as one of the most invasive \n     experimental procedures ever imposed on an animal, beginning \n     with surgical procedures of implementation of multiple \n     monitoring devices. It is particularly aggressive to the \n     point of being macabre as well as cruel.\n\n  The Senator from Maryland said all this was done in the best interest \nof the animal, nothing macabre was done. I am not sure that was the \nterm she used.\n  Let me read exactly what is done. I think we should know what is \ndone. It is the subject of debate. I do not think this is the only \nissue, but I think we should say what is done.\n  Now remember, no matter how you feel about research, this is done \nbecause, and Senator Glenn brought this up, we want to determine the \neffects of weightlessness on these animals in space. Astronauts train \nand exercise vigorously in space to keep their muscles and their bones \nmoving so that they don't atrophy, if you will. These monkeys are \nrestrained. They cannot move. So I ask whether or not this kind of \ntreatment is necessary now in this day and age after we have had \nastronauts in space over 400 days at a time to determine the effects of \nweightlessness on monkeys who are restrained, who cannot move.\n  I do not know what ``macabre'' means. I do not know what ``gruesome'' \nmeans or ``grotesque'' means. I thought I knew what it meant until I \nheard the statement from the Senator from Maryland. If this isn't, then \nI would like to know what it is.\n  This is in a letter to Daniel S. Goldin from Leslie Alexander of the \nHouston Rockets. They live in the Houston area, have business in the \nHouston area. They are very supportive of NASA and the space program, \nas I am. This is what is done to the animals in question:\n\n       The Bion space project causes unimaginable suffering to the \n     young monkeys.\n\n  Again, thinking of the words ``macabre,'' ``cruel,'' whatever you \nwant to call it. If you don't think it is, fine, then you should vote \nthe other way.\n\n       The tops of the monkeys' skulls are opened, electrodes are \n     wired to their brains, holes are cut in their eyelids and \n     eyeballs, wires are run through the holes and stitched to \n     their eyeballs. The wires are threaded under their scalps to \n     reach the circuit boards cemented into the openings in their \n     skulls. Eight holes are then drilled into each monkey's skull \n     so a metal halo can be screwed into it for immobilizing the \n     animal for up to 16 days. Fourteen electrode wires hooked up \n     to seven muscles in the monkeys' arms and legs tunnel under \n     the skin and exit from a hole in the animals' backs. A \n     thermometer is surgically buried in each animal's stomach \n     and it too exits their backs. Straight jackets are sown on \n     to monkeys to keep them from ripping the wires out of \n     their bodies.\n\n  He goes on to say that this project is cruel, pointless, wasteful, \nscandalous, shameful, and harmful to NASA's reputation.\n  Mr. President, if you assume--if you assume; I do not--but if some \ndo, that this type of medical research is necessary, then why do it \nafter you have the results? How does a monkey, restrained, that cannot \neven move, how does this experiment in space help anybody find out \nanything? And the truth of the matter is, Mr. President, it does not. \nAnd everybody in NASA knows it. Mr. Goldin knows it. The White House \nknows it. And 244 Members of the House know it. But somebody in this \nGovernment, some bureaucrat, somebody who is not in a leadership role \non this, has decided otherwise.\n  So they send in this stuff. And they make it out to be an issue that \nsomehow if you oppose this kind of treatment, that somehow you are \nopposed to all research, that you want to let heart doctors not have \nthe opportunity to test and to do the things they have to do to \ndetermine how to operate on a human being. It is outrageous to make \nthose kinds of statements on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This is a \nrepetitious, unnecessary, experiment putting these monkeys through this \nfor 14 days in space to find out the effect of weightlessness, when an \nastronaut moves around. He exercises. They give them, as the Senator \nfrom Ohio knows, prescribed exercises to do in space. They move around. \nA monkey in a straitjacket cannot move. And yet we still are doing it.\n  This is not 1960. This is 1996. We have had 40 years of humans in \nspace. Why are we doing it? Because somebody, whom we cannot identify--\nno name has been given--in this bureaucracy has decided we have to have \nit. And it is being painted that this Senator is opposed to NASA.

Hyg. Board-Certified \n     Internal/Emergency Medicine, Harvard Medical School\n       During my service at NASA/Ames Research Center (July 1993 \n     until my resignation in March 1994), a review of the medical \n     records of the non-human primates indicated NASA's failure to \n     provide appropriate surgical monitoring, pre- and post-\n     operative care, and analgesia. Post-operative deaths were not \n     uncommon. . . . NASA officials told me NASA had no control \n     over the care of BION monkeys in Russia. Veterinarians \n     participating in the project who had visited the Russian \n     facility and observed the animals on location told me \n     conditions were ``draconian'' and that the animals received \n     food of little or no nutritional quality.--Sharon Vanderlip, \n     D.V.M. former Chief of Veterinary Service, NASA/Ames Research \n     Center.\n       The question is: [W]ill this project substantially \n     contribute to [astronauts'] health in future space missions? \n     . . .

Ebner, Ph.D., Physiologist.\n\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I might interrupt to propound a \nunanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire yield for \nthe purposes of that unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe we have reached agreement on the \nunanimous-consent request that the vote on the tabling motion, which \nSenator Smith is about to propound, occur at 2:15. After he makes that \nmotion, then the pending amendment would be set aside, and Senator \nMcCain would be recognized to offer an amendment or amendments. And we \nwould recess at 12:30 and come back in to vote at 2:15. And when that \nvote is concluded, Senator Bumpers will be recognized to offer his \namendment related to the space station. There is no time agreement on \nthat. But debate will begin at 2:30 roughly, 2:30, 2:35, while the \nIraqi briefing is going on. Would my colleague care to comment on it?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Democratic leader has instructed me, \non behalf of our side of the aisle, to, upon the completion of the \nSenator from New Hampshire's debate and his anticipated motion to \ntable, that we agree to the unanimous consent that a vote occur at \n2:15. We further agree that between now and the time we recess for \nparty caucuses that Senator McCain will be speaking on his veterans \namendments. And the Democratic leader also agrees to the unanimous \nconsent that upon the completion of the vote on the Feingold-Smith \nmotion, that we move to the debate on the space station as proposed by \nSenator Bumpers.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I, therefore, propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest that when Senator Smith makes his tabling motion, that that \nwill be set aside with a vote to occur on that amendment at 2:15, that \nwhen he completes the propounding of that motion, then Senator McCain \nbe recognized to offer his amendment or amendments, further, that upon \nthe completion of the vote on the Smith-Feingold motion, Senator \nBumpers be recognized to offer his amendment on the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues are here who wish to \nspeak. I will be very brief. In another few moments I will be \ncompleting my remarks. I will then move to table.\n  Mr. President, I have cited a number of doctors who have indicated \ntheir opposition to this. Again, one other one I want to mention comes \nfrom Dr. Neal Barnard who wrote me a letter regarding whether or not \nthis is research that is worthwhile or not.\n\n       Relevant studies have already been conducted on humans, the \n     results of which are obviously more pertinent to human space \n     flight. Extensive data is also available from previous human \n     space missions, some which have exceeded 400 days. NASA's \n     experiments using rhesus monkeys to study motion sickness, \n     calcium loss and ``sea legs'' are not applicable to humans \n     at all. The physiology of monkeys and humans differ \n     drastically. A restrained monkeys with electrodes \n     implanted in his legs cannot hope to offer insights into \n     the largely neurological, short-lived and self-correcting \n     problem of ``sea legs. ``* * * We already know of methods \n     to limit calcium loss and treat the symptoms of the motion \n     sickness and ``sea legs.''\n\n  Of course, in this case the monkey is restrained. So any benefits \nwould be minimal.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me conclude on these few points. Sending a \nprimate into orbit 30 years ago, 40 years ago, you could claim there \nwould be some justification. But this is 1996. We have had, as I said, \n38 to 40 years of humans in space. Even our two highest science \nofficials in the memo I already cited have said that project is not \nnecessary.\n  We have had humans in space for over 400 days at a time. Just about \nthe time astronauts begin experiencing some of the problems associated \nwith weightlessness the Bion trip with the monkeys end. Most of the \nweightlessness problems referred to by Senator Glenn happened after the \n14th day in space. And these monkeys are brought out of space in 14 \ndays. In the 2-week Bion missions the animals are being monitored by \nremote electronic instruments.\n  The February 1996 Bion science assessment report said a major \nweakness of the overall project is the limited data collection \ncapability. Many of the experiments planned for Bion 11 are weakened by \nthe lack of a digital data storage. There are any number of people who \nwould indicate that this research is bad.\n  The second reason is even less of value, the bulk of research that \nwould\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\ndeal with muscle loss and bone deterioration. Our astronauts are placed \non rigorous exercise regimes, as the Senator from Ohio knows, while the \nanimals are strapped in and remain immobile.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that all of the members on the \nassessment panel that the proponents have all cited--they have all been \ncited here--admitted that the fact that the animals are restrained is a \nmajor flaw.\n  Let me just end on this point, Mr. President.\n  I don't know where the votes are going to fall on this. But, look, \nthis is $15.5 million spent on a program that is supposed to look at \nthe weightlessness of monkeys in space when, in fact, we have had \nhumans in space for almost 40 years, and inflicting unbearable pain on \nthese animals. To do that kind of thing for no reason, I think there is \nno validity to it. I think it says a lot about a society, a lot about \nthe people in the Senate, frankly, who have the courage to stand up and \nsay, you know, the Citizens Against Government Waste are correct that \nthis is a waste of taxpayers' money. They are going to rip this vote, \nand they should. It is a waste of taxpayers' money, and whether you are \nan animal rights advocate or you want to save taxpayers' dollars, it \ndoesn't matter.\n  I don't really particularly care which side you are on. I just need \nyour vote. That is the point. The point is that it wastes Government \nmoney. If you want to stop wasting Government money, you ought to vote \nto table the committee amendment, and if you believe that you should \nnot do duplicative research on animals--not eliminate all research--\nthen you ought to vote for the amendment.\n  So I think that really says all that needs to be said.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I move to table the committee amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays having been ordered, the \nquestion will be before the body at 2:15 this afternoon, consistent \nwith a previous order.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5176\n\n       (Purpose: To control the growth of Federal disaster costs)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5176.\n       On page 75, line 10, after the word ``expended'' insert the \n     following: ``Provided, That no money appropriated for the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency may be expended for the \n     repair of marinas or golf courses except for debris removal: \n     Provided further, That no money appropriated for the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency may be expended for tree or shrub \n     replacement except in public parks: Provided further, That \n     any funds used for repair of any recreational facilities \n     shall be limited to debris removal and the repair of \n     recreational buildings only.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that this amendment is \naccepted by both sides of the aisle. That is my understanding. I would \nbe glad to have a rollcall vote, but I believe it will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would restrict the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency [FEMA] from spending funds on certain low priority \nitems. Specifically, the amendment would prohibit FEMA from expending \nfunds for the repair of marinas or golf courses except for debris \nremoval, for tree or shrub replacement except in public parks, and \nlimits what can be repaired at recreational facilities.\n  This amendment is based on recommendations made by the inspector \ngeneral at FEMA. The inspector general's report concludes,\n\n       . . . that while grant funding appeared to be within the \n     legal parameters of the program, policymakers may want to \n     consider whether program eligibility should continue to \n     include repairing such nonessential facilities as golf \n     resorts, marinas for large boats, tennis courts, archery \n     ranges, and equestrian trails, all of which serve a \n     relatively small segment of the population.\n\n  This amendment gives us that opportunity.\n  According the IG's report, based on their inspection sample alone, \nhad this amendment had been in effect, about $171 million could have \nbeen saved. That $171 million could have used to assist others more in \nneed.\n  Some will argue that adoption of this amendment would place greater \nburdens on State and city governments. While that is partly true, it \nignores the fact that the Federal Government does not have an automatic \nobligation to repair city and State facilities. For example, FEMA spent \n$5,687,002 to repair the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard.\n  While I am sure that the good people of Anaheim appreciate this \nFederal largess--and will undoubtedly enjoy watching their sporting \nevents with a working scoreboard--such repair is not a Federal \nresponsibility.\n  The Anaheim Stadium is an entity that charges admission. I would \nassume it strives to make a profit. Yet I have heard of no one offering \nto pay back the Federal Government for its investment. And I'm not sure \nthat many would believe that scoreboard repair is something that would \nfall under the responsibilities of FEMA.\n  Mr. President, there are needs in my State of Arizona that FEMA has \npromised to address but has yet to fund. And this is only one of many \nexamples from around the country. In Kearny, AZ, flooding washed out a \nbridge that allowed students to go to school. FEMA has agreed to fund \nthe building of a new bridge, but has yet to produce the needed \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I am not asking that Arizona be treated differently \nthan any other State or that a problem in my State be given any \npreferential treatment. But I highlight this issue because allowing \nchildren to go to school is more important than the repair of a \nscoreboard or the fixing of a golf course.\n  Mr. President, the Disaster Relief Act of 1970, specifically excluded \nStates and local facilities ``used exclusively for recreations \npurposes'' from receiving Federal funds. In subsequent disaster relief \nlegislation, Public Law 93-288, the authorizing committee chairman \nstated ``such funds should not be spent on golf courses, football or \nbaseball fields, tennis courts, parks or picnic areas * * *.'' Yet the \nlaw does not specifically prohibit such expenditures.\n  The inspector general's report states:\n\n       [A] community hit by a disaster needs to have its \n     hospitals, schools, and police department functioning as soon \n     as possible; it does not need to have its golf course \n     repaired, or not at federal expense. However, as the Public \n     Assistance program currently operates, a golf course is just \n     as eligible to receive grant funding as a hospital, a marina \n     is just as deserving as a school, and an equestrian trail is \n     just as worthy as a police department.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that the people at FEMA will be able to \nprioritize a little better than they have. Unfortunately, now we have \nto take legislative action. We must prioritize where Federal dollars \nare spent and golf courses, horse trails, and luxury boat marinas \nsimply are not high priorities.\n  Mr. President, since its creation, FEMA has been the Federal \nGovernment's disaster response agency. In recent years, we have come to \ndepend more and more upon FEMA. And although FEMA has been criticized \nat times for acting too slowly, it has done an admirable job. From the \nhurricane disasters on the east coast, to the California earthquake, to \nthe flooding along the Mississippi River, FEMA has reacted to help \nthose most in need.\n  FEMA deserves praise for all its good work. But it also appears that \na change in the law that dictates how it spends tax dollars is clearly \nin order.\n  I recall being here on the Senate floor when the junior Senator from \nCalifornia made an impassioned plea to pass the California earthquake \nemergency appropriations bill. She showed the Senate pictures of the \ndisaster and some of the unfortunate individuals affected by it. Those \npictures were stirring, and the Senate quickly passed the bill. Well, I \nwould like to share some pictures that tell a less compelling story.\n  This first picture is of the city of Indian Wells, CA, golf course--\nwhich is known as a vacation resort facility. Indian Wells has a \npopulation of about 2,600 people and one of the highest household \nincomes in the country: Approximately $100,000, which is almost triple \nthe national average of $32,000.\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\nThe city has four private golf courses. This course, which is open to \nthe public, charges a staggering $120 per person--including cart--for a \nround of golf. And because of the cost to golf at Indian Wells, the \ncourse runs a surplus of about $1 million a year.\n\n  Yet, Mr. President, when in 1993 the golf course sustained flood \ndamage, FEMA gave the city of Indian Wells $871,977 to repair cart \npaths, sprinkler systems, and erosion. Mr. President, the general \npublic does not--or cannot afford--to use a golf course in a resort \nvacation community that charges $120 per person. And spending the \ngeneral public's money to restore this exclusive golf course is just \nwrong.\n  The next picture is that of the Links at Key Biscayne. This course \nreceived $300,000 for tree replacement.\n  The famous Vizcaya Mansion Museum and Gardens in Dade County, FL, \nreceived over $70,000 for uninsured tree and shrub damage. The IG \nreport notes,\n\n       . . . [that] since the county charges an admission fee to \n     tour the museum and gardens, policymakers should determine \n     whether the Federal Government should be responsible for \n     restoring the opulent gardens of a tourist attraction.\n\n  The next picture is of the Dinner Key Marina in Miami, FL. This \nmarina only allows boats to use its slips if such boats are 30 feet or \nmore. Slip fees range from $230 to $850 per month, the equivalent of \nthe monthly housing rent for most Americans.\n  Mr. President, I had my staff call some local boat stores there. They \nwere informed that the cost of a 30-foot basic yacht starts at about \n$90,000. Not many middle and lower income individuals that I know of \ncan afford a $90,000 yacht. Clearly, this facility is used only by the \nwealthiest of individuals, and not by the general public.\n  Simply said, FEMA should not be spending its money on these projects. \nMr. President, FEMA did not have to spend money on these golf courses \nand marinas, but the Agency chose to. And the money was, indeed, spent. \nWe can't afford to continue this practice.\n  I recognize that natural disasters do not discriminate. They affect \nthe poor and the rich. The Federal Government's dollars are limited, \nand we cannot afford to spend them equally on the poor and the wealthy. \nWe must prioritize how we spend the taxpayers' money. We only have a \nfinite amount of money to spend. And as long as natural disasters \ncontinue to occur--and indeed they will--we cannot afford to continue \nto fund these kinds of repairs.\n  There are many examples of waste and abuse of FEMA funds in this \nmanner, in the manner I have elaborated here, and this amendment would \nstop that waste. I hope that it will be adopted.\n  Mr. President, the inspector general made a report in May of 1996 \nentitled ``Intended Consequences--the High Cost of Disaster Assistance \nfor Park and Recreational Facilities.'' I think it is a very worthwhile \ndocument.\n  Just to quote from a couple of findings on page 10, it says:\n     Based on our sample, we found that FEMA has paid millions of \n     dollars for tree replacement in golf courses, parks, and \n     other recreational areas. Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, \n     Florida, received almost $3.5 million for tree replacement as \n     a result of Hurricane Andrew. Approximately $1.7 million, or \n     almost half of this amount, was to replace trees in areas \n     that were not used for recreational purposes. More than $1.6 \n     million of the $1.7 million was to replace trees in a 3.5 \n     mile stretch of a median strip and swale areas (side of the \n     road) through the park that were damaged in the disaster and \n     $100,000 was to replace trees in parking lots.\n\n  Ms. MUKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For purposes of clarification, this Senator knows full \nwell that the Senator from Arizona is a graduate from the Naval \nAcademy, and knows essentially the issues around the Chesapeake Bay. I \nam very sympathetic to the Senator's desire to implement the report of \nthe IG. I have another flashing light about the marina issue.\n  Let me ask a few questions because the Senator knows from his time on \nthe bay that we have 2,300 miles of shoreline with many marinas, and \nthey are the small businesses, kind of general stores along the water. \nSome are higher income persons, as the Senator said. But a lot of them \nare owned by people named Buck, and this is what keeps them going.\n  My question is about the consequences of the Senator's amendment. Is \nthe prohibition limited only to publicly owned marinas, or does it \ninclude private sector marinas as well?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe, according to the inspector general's report, \nthat it would exclude marinas from receiving any Federal funds--this is \ntheir report--except for debris removal.\n\n       Marinas in our inspection sample incurred over $22.3 \n     million in disaster damage, not including debris removal \n     costs. Most of these marinas are for recreational boaters and \n     serve a small segment of the public. Some of the marinas . . \n     . generated enough revenue to cover their operating expenses \n     prior to the disaster, and a few of them produced excess \n     revenue which was transferred to the local government's \n     operating general fund accounts. Most of the damage to the \n     marinas was to piers and docks rather than buildings, which \n     were insured. The impact would be mitigated by purchasing \n     insurance, which some of the marinas have already done for \n     their buildings.\n       Within our inspection sample we found that eliminating \n     marinas would have resulted in Federal savings of at least \n     $17 million.\n       In commenting on a draft report of the associated direct \n     response recovery directive, it was difficult to justify \n     excluding marinas while allowing other types of like \n     facilities which are also designed for recreation, such as \n     swimming pools . . . tennis courts . . . because of the cost, \n     marinas generally cater to a small segment of the population.\n\n  So in answer to the question, if there is a way to shape this \nlegislation in either the report or in amendment language so that we \ncould make sure that where there are low-income people and low-income \nboaters and not the minimum of 30-foot vessels, then I would be more \nthan happy to work with the Senator from Maryland to clarify the intent \nof this language.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  If I might comment, first I want to reiterate my support for the IG \nreport and for the general thrust of the Senator's amendment. I thank \nhim for the courtesy of acknowledging the cost and the very nature of \nthe geography of the State of Maryland with its 2,300 miles of \nshoreline. When it says ``small impact,'' that might be true with all \nof the continent, but Maryland is unique.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri wishes to accept the amendment. I \nwish to cooperate. I wonder if our staff can see what we can do to \nensure that the issue of marinas--that we get rid of waste, but yet I \nwant to protect the small business guys that are named Buck and Harry. \nThe Senator knows what I am talking about.\n\n  So if I could have the concurrence, I look forward to working with \nthe Senator. Again, I thank him for his courtesy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMaryland. She raises a very valid point. There are mom-and-pop \noperations at marinas. I would be happy to try to work with her in \ndiscriminating between those kind of facilities that are only available \nto a few. I think we can work that out.\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We can't agree to a modification until we know what the \nmodification is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside \nuntil such time as we reach agreement for modification, and then we \nwill bring it up at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I also ask my friend from Missouri--\nas he knows, I have two other amendments. One, I believe, is in \ndiscussion stage with his staff, and the other, I believe, is \nacceptable to him. Would he like me to discuss either one or both of \nthose amendments at this time or wait until a later time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to confer with my ranking \nmember to determine whether one of those might be accepted now. I do \nhave a couple of minutes. I would like to comment on this FEMA \namendment because this is a very important and very complicated issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is that the concern the Senator has about the \npopulation changes and so on? We have discussed this. I believe the \nSenator in his steadfast way has represented that he would like to \noffer an amendment on another\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nissue, and I think we could take it. Does the Senator from Missouri \ndesire to acquiesce in that?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we can take that amendment. I have \nsome further comments on that to accommodate my colleague. I will save \nthose comments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be glad to put my statement in the \nRecord because, as the distinguished managers of the bill know, this \nissue has been ventilated on numerous occasions. I point out that for 3 \nyears this amendment has been accepted and then dropped in conference. \nSo I feel compelled here in the fourth year to ask for a recorded vote \nto make sure that the Senate is completely on record on this issue, in \nall due respect to my two dear friends and colleagues. But 3 years in a \nrow is enough. I would be glad to submit my statement for the Record.\n  On that amendment, I will be asking for a recorded vote at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. We have a unanimous-consent agreement to proceed to the \nspace station amendment at 2:30. That will require a vote.

Is there objection?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5177\n\n    (Purpose: To require a plan for the allocation of Department of \n                Veterans Affairs health care resources)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right object, I do not \nintend to object, but I think it would be necessary for me at this time \nto send the amendment to the desk. I ask indulgence of my colleagues to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 5177.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, below line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 421. (a) Plan.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall develop a plan for the allocation of health care \n     resources (including personnel and funds) of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs among the health care facilities of the \n     Department so as to ensure that veterans who have similar \n     economic status, eligibility priority, or medical conditions \n     and who are eligible for medical care in such facilities have \n     similar access to such care in such facilities regardless of \n     the region of the United States in which such veterans \n     reside.\n       (2) The plan shall--\n       (1) reflect, to the maximum extent possible, the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Network and the Resource Planning and \n     Management System developed by the Department to account for \n     forecasts in expected workload and to ensure fairness to \n     facilities that provide cost-efficient health care; and\n       (2) include--\n       (A) procedures to identify reasons for variations in \n     operating costs among similar facilities; and\n       (B) ways to improve the allocation of resources so as to \n     promote efficient use of resources and provision of quality \n     health care.\n       (3) The Secretary shall prepare the plan in consultation \n     with the Under Secretary of Health of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (b) Plan Elements.--The plan under subsection (a) shall set \n     forth--\n       (1) milestones for achieving the goal referred to in \n     paragraph (1) of that subsection; and\n       (2) a means of evaluating the success of the Secretary in \n     meeting the goal.\n       (c) Submittal to Congress.--The Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress the plan developed under subsection (a) not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the plan \n     developed under subsection (a) not later than 60 days after \n     submitting the plan to Congress under subsection (c), unless \n     within that time the Secretary notifies Congress that the \n     plan will not be implemented in that time and includes with \n     the notification an explanation why the plan will not be \n     implemented in that time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is the third year in a row that \nSenator Graham of Florida and I have sponsored legislation to better \nallocate health care funding among the Veterans Department's health \ncare facilities. Despite the fact that this amendment would enable \nveterans to receive equal access to quality health care, no matter \nwhere they live or what circumstances they face, this piece of \nlegislation has never been made law.\n  Mr. President, in March 1994, I originally brought to Secretary Jesse \nBrown's attention the inequity in veterans access to health care. \nDespite their knowledge of the problems in the system that is currently \nbeing used, the Department of Veterans Affairs is still using an \narchaic and unresponsive formula to allocate health care resources. \nThis system must be updated to account for population shifts. That is \nwhy Senator Graham and I are continuing our efforts, for the third year \nin a row, to change the way health care is allocated among veterans \nhealth funding by eliminating funding disparities among VA health care \nfacilities across the country.\n  The veterans population in three States, including Arizona, is \ngrowing at the same time that it is declining in other parts of the \ncountry. Unfortunately, health care allocations have not kept up with \nthe changes. The impact of disparate funding has been very obvious to \nme during my visits to many VA Medical Centers throughout the country, \nand particularly in Arizona, and was confirmed by a formal survey of \nthe Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, which was conducted by \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars [VFW] in April 1994.\n  The problem has been further verified by the General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] in a report entitled ``Veterans Health Care: Facilities' \nResource Allocations Could be More Equitable.'' The GAO found that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs continues to allocate funding based on \npast budgets rather than current needs, and has failed to implement the \nresource planning and management system [RPM] developed 2 years ago to \nhelp remedy funding inequity.\n  Mr. President, the GAO cities VA data that the workload of some \nfacilities increased by as much as 15 percent between 1993 and 1995, \nwhile the workload of others declined by as much as 8 percent. However, \nin the two budget cycles studied, the VA made only minimal changes in \nfunding allocations. The maximum loss to a facility was 1 percent of \nits past budget and the average gain was also about 1 percent.\n  This inadequate response to demographic change over the past decade \nis very disturbing, and, I believe, wrong. To illustrate the problem, I \nwould point out that the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center experienced \nthe third highest workload growth based on 17 hospitals of similar size \nand mission, yet was only funded at less than half the RPM process.\n\n  Mr. President, the GAO informs me that rather than implementing the \nRPM process to remedy funding inequities in access to veterans health \ncare, the VA has resorted to rationing health care or eliminating \nhealth care to certain veterans in areas of high demand.\n  The GAO says:\n\n       Because of differences in facility rationing practices, \n     veterans' access to care system wide is uneven. We found that \n     higher income veterans received care at many facilities, \n     while lower income veterans were turned away at other \n     facilities. Differences in who was served occurred even \n     within the same facility because of rationing.\n\n  The GAO also indicates that there is confusion among the Department's \nstaff regarding the reasons for funding variations among the VA \nfacilities and the purpose of the RPM system.\n  Mr. President, this problem must be addressed now. This amendment \ncompels the VA to take expeditious action to remedy this serious \nproblem and adequately address the changes in demand at VA facilities.\n  To conclude, I want to reiterate that I find it simply unconscionable \nthat the VA could place the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center at the \nbottom of the funding ladder, when the three VA medical facilities in \nthe State of Arizona must care for a growing number\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nof veterans, and are inundated every year by winter visitors, which \nplaces an additional burden on the facilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the VFW survey be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also want to finish my time by emphasizing to this \nSenate that the problems that exist at the VA have occurred for years, \nand that it is about time that we change the system to give our \nveterans the better care they deserve.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1994.\n     In Reply Refer to: 94-24.\n     John T. Farrar, M.D.,\n     Acting Under Secretary for Health (10), Veterans Health \n         Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Farrar: A member of my staff, Robert F. O'Toole. \n     Senior Field Representative, conducted a survey of the \n     Phoenix, Arizona, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center, on March 14-15, 1994. During his time at the medical \n     center, he was able to talk with many patients, family \n     members and staff. This enabled him to gather information \n     concerning the quality of care being provided and the most \n     pressing problems facing the facility.\n       While those receiving treatment in the clinics and wards \n     felt that the quality was good, they almost all commented on \n     the long waits in the clinics and the understaffing \n     throughout the medical center. In discussing their problem \n     with various staff members, it was noted that nurses were \n     under extreme stress. More than one was observed by Mr. \n     O'Toole in tears when completing their tour. The nursing \n     staff on evening shifts must rush continually through their \n     duties in an attempt to cover all their patients needs due to \n     the shortage in staffing in both support and technical \n     personnel.\n       In attempting to determine the reason for this problem, it \n     became apparent that the station was grossly underfunded. \n     Which means that the staff must either take unwanted \n     shortcuts or continue to work beyond the point expected of \n     staffs at the other medical centers. While it is well \n     understood that the Veterans Health Administration is \n     underfunded throughout the system, it is clear from the \n     comparisons that this facility has not received a fair \n     distribution of the available resources resulting in the \n     deplorable situation now facing the health care team.\n       Another problem in Phoenix that must be addressed is the \n     serious space deficiency, especially in the clinical areas. \n     The ambulatory care area was designed to handle 60,000 annual \n     visits. In fiscal year 1993, the station provided 218,000 \n     annual visits, almost four times the design level. Many \n     physicians are required to conduct exams and provide \n     treatment from temporary cubicles set up inside the waiting \n     rooms. This bandaid approach has added to the already \n     overcrowding.\n       The other problem that we feel should be pointed out is \n     that of the staffing ceiling assigned to the Carl T. Hayden \n     Veterans Medical Center. Currently, the medical center has a \n     FTEE of 1530 which is over the target staffing level. Based \n     on available reports, the medical center would need an \n     additional 61 registered nurses just to reach the average \n     Resource Program Management (RPM) within their group. This \n     facility operates with the lowest employee level in their \n     group when comparing facility work loads, and 158th overall. \n     To reach the average productivity level of the Veterans \n     Health Administration medical centers, they would need an \n     additional 348 full-time employees. While it is realized that \n     this station will never be permitted to enjoy that level of \n     staffing, it is felt that they, at the least, should have \n     been given some consideration for their staffing problems \n     during the latest White House ordered employee reductions.\n       To assist the medical center to meet their mandatory work \n     load, and the great influx of winter residents, it is \n     recommended that the $11.4 million which was reported to the \n     Arizona congressional delegation to have been given Phoenix \n     in addition to their FY 94 budget be provided. To enable the \n     station to handle the ever increasing ambulatory work load, \n     the Veterans Health Administration must approve the pending \n     request for leased clinic space in northwest Phoenix and, the \n     implementation plan for the use of the Williams Air Force \n     Base hospital as a satellite outpatient clinic, along with \n     the necessary funding to adequately operate the facility. In \n     addition, VHA should approve and fund, at a minimum, the \n     expansion of the medical centers clinical space onto the \n     Indian School land which was acquired for that purpose.\n       Approval of the above recommendations would make it much \n     easier for this medical center to meet the needs of the ever \n     increasing veteran population in the Phoenix area. There is \n     no indication that the increasing population trends will \n     change prior to the year 2020. This hospital cannot be \n     allowed to continue the downhill slide. The veterans of \n     Arizona deserve a fair deal and the medical staff should be \n     given the opportunity to provide top quality health care in a \n     much less stressful setting.\n       I would appreciate receiving your comments on the Phoenix \n     VA Medical Center at your earliest opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Frederico Juarbe, Jr.,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                        National Veterans Service.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, under the previous order, we were supposed \nto adjourn at 12:30. I ask unanimous consent that I may be permitted an \nadditional 5 minutes to comment on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5176\n\n  Mr. BOND. I want to address the FEMA amendment because the Senator \nfrom Arizona has raised some excellent points, and I believe they are \nvery important points this body ought to address.\n  In fact, the Senator's amendment stems from one of a series of \nreports I requested of the inspector general last year in an effort to \nreduce Federal disaster relief costs and improve FEMA operations. The \nIG has found a weak financial management system at FEMA as well as a \nnumber of questionable practices in terms of disaster expenditures. The \nmost recent IG report found some very startling and troubling examples \nof what could be characterized as an abuse of taxpayer funds.\n  We have already seen the pictures of a golf course where fees as high \nas $120 per person were charged yet has received $872,000 in public \nassistance grants following flood damage.\n  Let me make it clear, because this area is very complicated, that the \ndisaster relief that we are talking about is available only to publicly \nowned facilities. If they are privately owned, there are SBA loans that \nare available. But the FEMA disaster assistance goes generally with the \ncost share 25 percent local or State cost share with the Federal \nGovernment providing the other 75 percent.\n  We talked about marinas and golf courses, but we could talk about \nequestrian trails, archery ranges, and other facilities benefiting a \nvery small segment of the population where they receive millions of \ndollars for tree and shrub replacement. I believe very strongly in \ntrees and shrubs; I plant a lot of them myself, but I seriously \nquestion whether that is an essential use of our scarce taxpayer \ndollars. There is erosion repair, sprinkler systems, and the like. In \nexamples of the facilities the IG looked at which received Federal \nfunds between 1989 and 1995 totaling $286 million, the Federal cost \nshare was between 75 percent and 100 percent.\n  While I strongly support the intentions of the Senator from Arizona, \nI am delighted that we are going to have an opportunity to work with \nhim and other colleagues because we have asked of the FEMA Director, \nand he has promised, to report back to Congress by October 1 a \ncomprehensive plan to reduce the amounts spent and to improve controls \non disaster relief expenditures. He has promised to respond to the \nseries of IG and GAO reports that I have requested. These reports do \ndetail a number of what I would consider very questionable \nexpenditures. There is a much larger issue, and we must pursue it \ncomprehensively, not only in the position I serve on this subcommittee \nbut I formerly cochaired a task force on disaster relief with the \nSenator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, and we have in that task force \nexpressed our grave concerns about the escalating costs of FEMA \ndisaster relief.\n  Last year, some of my colleagues may remember, in this subcommittee \nwe had to cut $7 billion in other agency programs, primarily housing, \nhousing programs, in order to pay for the Northridge earthquake, and in \ntight fiscal times we have to be far more prudent in the kinds of \nrelief we provide for public facilities where they are essentially \nprofitmaking though publicly owned facilities.\n\n  I can assure my colleague from Arizona that I intend to hold FEMA's \nfeet to the fire in their commitment to submit a plan by October 1. It \nis essential not only that we but the authorizing committees address \nthis issue.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from Arizona and others, \nparticularly my colleague from Maryland, who are very much concerned \nabout this issue.\n  If there are no further Senators wishing to speak, I yield back my \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9778-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Simon, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n     Bryan, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Wyden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5178.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, strike lines 6 through 7, and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``sion and administrative aircraft, \n     $3,762,900,000, to remain available until September 30, 1998. \n     Provided, That of the funds made available in this bill, no \n     funds shall be expended on the space station program, except \n     for termination costs.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, this \namendment would terminate NASA's space station program. This morning on \nthe way to work, I was discussing this amendment with my administrative \nassistant, and we were discussing the fact that this is perhaps the \nfifth year I have offered this amendment in an effort to stop what I \nconsider is a disaster in the making. She said, ``Why do you persist in \ndoing this every year?'' That is an easy question to answer. The short \nanswer is that I believe very strongly that we are embarked on the \nexpenditure of $100 billion that, in the final analysis, is going to be \nconsidered by every physicist, every top medical man in the country, \nand by most Members of Congress, those who are willing to admit that we \nmay have made a mistake, as a terrible financial disaster.\n  We still have a chance to prevent that disaster. If we were to adopt \nthe Bumpers amendment today, we have a chance to save between $50 and \n$74 billion. I invite all of my colleagues to look at the budget for \nthe future. Defense continues to go up. Entitlements will continue to \ngo up. Everything will go up, except that roughly 18 percent of the \nbudget which we call domestic discretionary spending, within which lies \nthis $100 billion for the space station.\n  Do you know what domestic discretionary spending is? It is not Social \nSecurity. It is not Medicaid. It is not senatorial pensions, Government \npensions, or military pensions. It is not interest on the debt. It is \nthat very small portion of money that Congress still has some control \nover that determines the kind of nation we are going to be. It is the \nmoney we spend on education. How many times have I said that when \nAmerican families sit around the dinner table in the evening and talk \nabout what they love the most, it is not that Mercedes out in the \ndriveway, it is not the farm out back, or that posh office downtown, or \nthe country club and the golf course on weekends. It is their children.\n  The more money you pour into wasteful spending, like the space \nstation, the less you are going to have for the thing you love most, \nyour children. When people talk about how much they love their \nchildren, what do they talk about? They talk about their education. \nWhat else? They talk about their children, long after the parents are \ndead, being able to breathe clean air and drink clean water. And where \nare the environmental constraints and improvements located? In domestic \ndiscretionary spending right there with the space station.\n  When people talk about their children, they talk about how to keep \nthem out of gangs, the place where so much of the crime in this country \nis located. Where is law enforcement found? Right in that small pocket \nof money for domestic discretionary spending.\n  So this vote is about whether you believe in space. This vote is not \nabout whether you get teary-eyed every time you see the shuttle take \noff. You are making a big, big decision, a big, big choice on where you \nwant our country's money spent. For every dime you put into the space \nstation, it is a dime that will not be available for our children's \neducation. It will not be available for legitimate, honest-to-God \nmedical research. It will not be available for all of those things that \ngo right to the heart of what kind of nation we want to be.\n  In 1984--some Members of this body remember it well--Ronald Reagan \nstood on the floor of the House of Representatives and he talked about \nthe space station and how we were going to build a space station and \nhave it completed by 1992. In 8 years we were going to build this \nmonumental demonstration of our scientific skills. For how\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\nmuch? $8 billion. That was the cost. By the time we spent $11 billion \nwe didn't even have a good blueprint.\n  So President Clinton came to town and said this thing is out of \ncontrol. It is much too expensive. Back in those days it was called \nSpace Station Freedom, and the cost was absolutely staggering. So \nPresident Clinton said, ``Bring me another plan.'' So they brought him \nthis plan called the Alpha, and he signed off on it. But it is not the \nAlpha anymore. It is the international space station because the \nEuropean Space Agency is participating. And Russia is going to \nparticipate, if we give them the money. They are totally incapable of \nparticipating otherwise.\n  Mr. President, do you realize that we have been in space for almost \n35 years? We have been in space for almost 35 years, and the Russians \nhave had a space station of one kind or another since 1971. For 25 \nyears the Russians have had a space station. The first one in 1971 was \ncalled the Soyuz I. Then there were five succeeding Soyuzes. Then the \nMir, which they deployed in 1986 and is still there in 1996. The Mir \nhas been up 10 years.\n  You are going to hear during the course of this debate all of these \nmonumental claims about what we have gotten out of the space program so \nfar. You are going to hear people talk about AIDS, cancer, arthritis \nand all of the terrible diseases that people fear so much. I am going \nto respond on the front end right now by saying, ``Ask the Russians.'' \nThey have had a space station up for 25 years. Ask them. What have they \ngotten? I will tell you the answer. Nothing. You are going to hear all \nkinds of exotic technical arguments about different kinds of cells and \ncrystals, protein crystals, gallium arsenide crystals. You are going to \nhear about bone structure, cell structure, and what all you get in \nspace.\n  I am going to give you a bunch of quotes that are not particularly \ninteresting to listen to, but I am going to quote them to you anyway \nbefore I finish this statement, where every single scientist in \nAmerica, every physicist who is not on NASA's payroll, every medical \ndoctor worth his salt in America, says that to try to justify the space \nstation on the grounds of scientific and medical research is laughable. \nYou will not hear me reading to you a statement prepared by NASA. You \nwill not hear me reading a statement to you that was prepared in a big \nfour-page ad by Boeing. I am telling you that I am not a scientist. I \nam not a doctor. You can tell me anything, and I cannot refute it. But \nI will let the experts refute the arguments for the space station.\n\n  I used to say that I believe in picking the best brains in America. \nOn any subject I can find the best brains. If I were going into \nanything, say, into the popcorn business, I would go to somebody that \nhas been successful in the popcorn business. If I want to know about \nmedical research, I might go to the Harvard Medical School. I will \nquote for you some of those people. If I were going to do something in \nan area of physics, I would go to somebody in the American Physical \nSociety. Do you know who that is, Mr. President? The American Physical \nSociety is 40,000 physicists. It is virtually every physicist in \nAmerica. I will tell you before I finish this statement how adamantly \nopposed to this space station the American Physical Society is. I will \ntell you why the top medical people at Harvard and all across the \ncountry, from the Arthritis Foundation on down, are utterly opposed to \nthe space station. You do not have to be a scientist to know the reason \nthey are opposed to it. They are opposed to it because it is an utter \nmisuse of the money.\n  Let me digress for just a moment. I assume that most people in this \nbody heard President Clinton's acceptance speech at the convention the \nother night, and you heard him say that in the past 4 years we have \ndoubled the life of AIDS victims. That is a monumental success. Do you \nknow what the space station had to do with that? Nothing. Do you know \nwhy we were able to do that for the people who are victims of AIDS? \nBecause we put $12 billion a year out at the National Institutes of \nHealth where real medical research takes place. How does it take place? \nThe National Institutes of Health passes the money out to schools like \nthe University of Arkansas, MIT, Harvard, and Pennsylvania and all of \nthe other great universities of this country.\n  It is those universities and the private sector who have been going \nall out to find a cure for AIDS, or something that would prevent it. \nBut what is Congress doing? We are getting ready to drop another $74 \nbillion into the space station--$74 billion. Where I come from, $74 \nbillion ``ain't bean bag.'' When the year 2002 comes around, you are \ngoing to see this domestic discretionary spending account having gone \nfrom today's $264 billion to $220 billion.\n  We are going to cut it $40 billion over the next 6 years. You tell \nme. How are we going to find the money to fund the things that we want \nto fund? We are not only going to have to cut $40 billion out of the \naccount by the year 2002 but we are going to continue to fund this \nspace station. It will be safely ensconced in that $224 billion.\n  Mr. President, when it looked as though the space station might be in \nserious trouble, everybody said, ``Well, let's make it an international \nproject. Let's get the Russians involved. Let's get Europe involved.'' \nAnd so we have been able to get them involved to some extent. But I can \ntell you that right now the Russians are 6-8 months behind. They are \nsupposed to build a module where the astronauts will live and control \nthe station. The Russians are going to build a module where the men \nactually live, or the men and women, whichever the case may be. They \nare behind. And the Russian Government has not given the Khrunichev \nCorp. that is supposed to build it any money to build it with.\n  I am one who has favored virtually all the assistance we have given \nto Russia and will continue to do everything I can to help foster \ndemocracy in Russia because I think it is to our advantage and we are \nthe beneficiaries. But if you think the Russians are going to come in \non time and they are going to be able to launch all their Soyuz rockets \nright on time, you have to be smoking something.\n  It is going to take 90, about, space shuttle flights to deploy the \nspace station and to service it. You know something that is really \ninteresting? How many times have you ever heard your mom talk about \nsomething that is worth its weight in gold? Well a pound of water sent \nby shuttle from Earth to the space station once it is deployed--1 pound \nof water, 1 pound of food, 1 pound of anything--will cost $12,800, \ntwice the cost of gold. Can you believe that? Every time we launch that \nshuttle today it cost almost $400 million. We are going to have 90 \nshuttle flights to deploy the space station and to service it and take \nfood and water to our astronauts.\n  And so when they talk about the $50 billion for these shuttle flights \nto service and maintain the space station, there is a big assumption, \nand the big assumption is that everything is going to happen right on \ntime, that the launches will take place precisely when they are \nsupposed to, they will arrive at the space station right when they are \nsupposed to, they will hook up right when they are supposed to. The \neditors of Space News say it is utter folly to plan on that basis.\n  The space shuttle was supposed to take off for the Russian space \nstation Mir in July. But it was grounded for six weeks because of \ntechnical problems. Yesterday it was on the launch pad being prepared \nfor a launch on September 14. Do you know where Atlantis is right now? \nIt is back in the hangar. It is in the hangar in Florida because a \nhurricane is approaching Florida. So they had to probably download it, \nthat is, take the fuel out of it, and put it in the garage. What if we \nwere planning to launch the Atlantis today? We could not because of the \nhurricane. You say that is no big deal. It is a big deal. It cost \nmillions every time you miss the target to take off in one of those \nthings. To assume that every one of those missions is going to take off \nright on time and everything is going to go hunky-dory, as the General \nAccounting Office says, is the height of folly.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have already built 17 percent of the hardware \nof the space station. That translates into 167,000 pounds. So the \nargument on the other side will be that we have gone so far, we have \nalready put this much money into it; we cannot stop now. Lord, how many \ntimes have I heard that argument in 22 years I have been in the Senate. \nOnce a month.\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\n  I was absolutely the most shocked person in the Senate when we killed \nthe super collider because I had listened to that argument for 3 years. \nThree years I had been trying to kill that thing. Incidentally, I do \nnot take a lot of credit for that. The House killed it. The House \nkilled it and held firm in the conference. We only got about 44 votes \nin the Senate to kill it. You cannot kill anything in the Senate that \ncosts money. You can get a lot of noise about balancing the budget \nuntil you start trying to balance the budget.\n\n  Two weeks ago Aerospace Daily said that the space station \nconstruction budget is already $500 million above target. If you think \nthe current $94 billion estimate, which is what the General Accounting \nOffice says it is going to cost, NASA says 72 or 3--I will put my money \non the General Accounting Office. They say it is going to cost $94 \nbillion if everything goes perfectly from now on. Everybody knows it is \ngoing to cost more than that because everything will not go perfectly.\n  On that night when Ronald Reagan assured the American people that we \nwere going to build this space station in 8 years for a total cost of \n$8 billion, NASA also said here is what we are going to do with the \nspace station. Here is the mission. Listen. This is 1984.\n  No. 1, we are going to make it a staging base for future missions. If \nwe decide to go to Mars, we will have the space station there. We can \npark a rocket there, refuel it and send it on to Mars. That mission is \ngone. No longer one of the missions.\n  No. 2, we are going to make a manufacturing facility out of it. For \nexample, we will manufacture crystals for computers. They will be \nperfect because they are made in space. Nobody can tell you quite why \nzero gravity is important. Most physicists will tell you it is not \nimportant. But everybody assumes if you do it in space it must have \nsome kind of benefit, or you must be able to do something in space you \ncannot do anyplace else. I will come back to that argument in a moment.\n\n  But, No. 2, it says we are going to make a manufacturing facility out \nof it--gone. It is no longer one of the missions.\n  No. 3, we are going to make a permanent observatory out of it. I \nassume we were going to observe Mars and space and observe the Earth \nalso. So, No. 3 was to make a permanent observatory, observing the \nstars and the planets--gone. No longer one of the eight missions.\n  No. 4, we were going to make a transportation node, sort of a bus \nstop in space. But that mission is gone too.\n  No. 5, a servicing facility. It will be a place where shuttles could \npark and get any service work done. If they had to recharge the \nbatteries, put on new fuel, whatever. We could also repair satellites \nthere. It was going to be a garage in space--gone. No longer one of the \nmissions.\n  No. 6, it was going to be an assembly facility where we would \nassemble a satellite or a spacecraft for further use, to go to Mars or \nmaybe just to orbit the Earth or something else. That was the sixth \none, to make an assembly facility--that is gone.\n  No. 7, a storage depot, where we would store fuel and parts and \nsupplies, a gas station in space--gone.\n  No. 8, a research laboratory to study the impact of weightlessness--\nthat is still there. Of the eight original missions, seven are gone. \nSo, with this mission of research laboratory now the only mission \nremaining, what are they going to do? They are going to do medical \nresearch, according to a very lengthy statement that was put into the \nRecord by my very good friend from Ohio.\n  Let me digress for a moment and say the Senator from Ohio and I came \nto the Senate together and we have become very close friends. He is one \nof the finest men I know. But he is entitled to be wrong occasionally. \nHis wife, Anna, will tell you that. We just happen to disagree on this. \nWe do not disagree on much.\n  But when it comes to the kind of research you are going to do, let us \ntalk about the life sciences, the medical research part of it. As I \nsaid earlier, I am not a doctor, so I have to depend on people that I \nrespect, whose judgment I trust. So, here is then-Presidential Science \nAdviser D. Alan Bromley. He wrote the Vice President remarks on March \n11, 1991, and here is what he said:\n\n       The space station is needed to find means of maintaining \n     human life during long space flights. This is its only \n     scientific justification, in our view. And all future design \n     efforts should be focused on this one purpose, how to \n     maintain human beings in space.\n\n  He went on to say.\n\n       The primary thrust of whatever life research is conducted \n     will be focused on manned space exploratory programs. \n     Medicine and commercial applications will be secondary.\n\n  Carl Sagan--who, incidentally, favors the space station because he \nfavors space exploration, but the purposes are quite different, \naccording to Carl Sagan, than those of the proponents of the space \nstation--said:\n\n       The only substantive function of a space station, as far as \n     I can see, is for long-duration space flight.\n\n  Before I forget it, here are the organizations who oppose this thing: \nThe American Physiological Society, American Society for Biochemistry \nand Molecular Biology, American Society for Pharmacology and \nExperimental Therapeutics, American Society for Investigative \nPathology, American Institute for Nutrition, American Association of \nImmunologists, American Society for Cell Biology, Biophysical Society, \nAmerican Association of Anatomists.\n  Let me continue. Here is what the American College of Physicians \nsaid, in April 1992:\n\n       We agree that much if not all of the money slated for the \n     space station, the super collider, SDI, and for \n     defense intelligence could be better spent on improving \n     the health of our citizens, stimulating economic growth, \n     and reducing the deficit.\n  Here is what the American Physical Society said on July 24, 1994. \nBear in mind they speak for 40,000 physicists who are charged primarily \nwith building the space station. Here is what they said in 1994:\n\n       The principal scientific mission of the station is to study \n     the effects on humans of prolonged exposure to a space \n     environment. Medical researchers scoff at claims that these \n     studies might lead to cures for diseases on Earth.\n\n  David Rosenthal, Harvard Medical School, testifying on behalf of the \nAmerican Cancer Society. Listen to this:\n\n       We cannot find valid scientific justification for the \n     claims that this will affect vital cancer research. Based on \n     the information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a \n     strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer research \n     in space over critically needed research on the Earth.\n\n  Dr. Sean Rudy, who runs the American Arthritis Foundation:\n\n       I will submit to you the medical research done here on \n     Earth is of greater value than that planned in space. Space \n     station proponents have indicated that the space station will \n     provide a first-class laboratory. We used to have first-class \n     laboratories in universities and medical schools across the \n     country. Reports by the National Institutes of Health and \n     National Science Foundation have indicated that in over 51 \n     percent of the biological laboratory research, space is \n     deemed inadequate for the conduct of research. Furthermore, \n     the National Science Foundation report estimated that the \n     capital construction backlog for lab research space is $12 \n     billion. Should our priorities now be a first-class \n     laboratory in space or correction of a long-standing \n     deficiency in laboratories throughout the country?\n\n  His point is not debatable, not arguable.\n  Donald Brown, president of the American Society for Cell Biology, in \nan article in the Washington Post called ``Who Needs A Space Station?'' \nHere is what he said:\n\n       In reference to experiments on cellular processes in normal \n     and diseased cells and organisms, there is no obvious need \n     for this research. It is extremely difficult to imagine what \n     special conditions space might provide for answering \n     important questions about the causes, diagnosis and treatment \n     of human diseases.\n\n  Dr. James Van Allen--everybody has heard about the Van Allen \nradiation belt around the Earth. Here is what he, the world's most \nfamous astrophysicist, said:\n\n       There has been nothing that resulted from the manned space \n     program, essentially nothing in the way of extraordinary \n     pharmaceuticals or cures for disease or any extraordinary \n     crystals which have revolutionized electronics. Claims to the \n     contrary are false--not true.\n  If you are not going to listen to people like James Van Allen, I \nmight as well sit down and go home. If you are not going to listen to \npeople like Alan Bromley and Dr. Rosenthal, what am I\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\ndoing standing here? What I am doing is quoting the top people in \nAmerica, the people everybody should look to on issues like this.\n  Then we have the subject of growing cells in zero gravity. For some \nreason or another, we have this cockamamie idea that if you want to do \nresearch, if you can just do it in zero gravity, somehow or another you \nare going to get some benefit that you could not possibly get on Earth.\n  But here is what the Space Studies Board said on the subject:\n\n       The promise of protein crystallography and potential \n     usefulness of microgravity in producing protein crystals of \n     superior quality should not provide any part of the \n     justification for building a space station. Growing crystals \n     of superior quality in space is not close, nor is it likely \n     to become close, to being cost-effective. It currently is, \n     and is likely to remain, faster and very much less expensive \n     to obtain superior quality crystals on the ground.\n\n  On making industrial crystals, here is what T.J. Rodgers, the founder \nof a semiconductor company said:\n\n       I run a semiconductor company, and I am director of \n     Vitesse, a gallium arsenide semiconductor company. So I know \n     about this stuff. All I can say is, this program of growing \n     gallium arsenide wafers in space is a colossal con job, and \n     there is nobody I know in my industry who wants those wafers \n     in the first place. There is no economic benefit to \n     increasing the purity of crystal beyond the point we can \n     currently improve it. The cost is huge, and the economic \n     benefit is almost nil for that last step.\n\n  Namely, going into space.\n  Dr. Al Joseph, founder of Vitesse, a gallium arsenide semiconductor \ncompany. I have met Dr. Joseph two or three times. Here is what he said \non industrial crystals:\n\n       The idea of making better gallium arsenide crystals in \n     space is an absurd--\n\n  Absurd.\n\n     business proposition. Even if you give me perfect and pure \n     crystals made in space, it won't help me commercially, \n     because 90 to 95 percent of my costs and 85 to 90 percent of \n     the integrated circuit yield on a wafer is driven by what I \n     put on the wafer and not so much by the purity of the wafer \n     itself. The cost of one trip to the space station would \n     finance just about everything the American electronic \n     industry needs to do to ensure its technological superiority \n     for years to come. That's for sure.\n\n  I have never seen a project or a mission as desperate for a \njustification as this one. I look at those ads Boeing puts out. Of \ncourse, Boeing is the prime contractor. They stand to make billions out \nof this. And so that makes their efforts slightly jaundiced to me. I \ncertainly understand why any Senator in Florida, Texas, California, and \nMaryland, I can understand why any of those Senators would vote for \nthis. They have a lot of jobs in their State, and those jobs pay well \nover $100,000 each. The cost of this project in jobs will be the most \nexpensive jobs program in the history of America, by far.\n  On microgravity research, one of the most interesting statements I \nhave seen was by Dr. Bromley when he talks about manned space flights \nand how important that is to microgravity. Dr. Bromley said:\n\n       The human habitation of the space station is fundamentally \n     incompatible with the requirement that the microgravity \n     experiments be unperturbed.\n\n  In other words, if you are operating in microgravity, you don't want \nanybody jarring around in the space station. And so he says, having men \non board is incompatible with any research that requires zero gravity \nor even microgravity.\n  The Space Science Board of the National Research Council said in \n1991:\n\n       Continuing development of the Space Station Freedom cannot \n     be supported on scientific grounds.\n\n  One article in Newsweek in 1994 I thought had the best one. ``What is \nthe space station for?'' That is a question that nobody has been able \nto answer.\n  The author said something which was demeaning in a sense to \nastronauts, which I am reluctant to quote. But he called them a bunch \nof people floating around in space looking for something to do. Well, \nthey are all very brave men. We are always proud of our astronauts. I \ndon't know when I have ever been prouder than I was watching our \nastronauts repair the Hubble telescope, a magnificent thing to behold \nand they saved the country a tremendous amount of money, simply because \nit was flawed in the first place.\n  In 1995 the National Research Council's Space Studies Board said:\n\n       The committee reaffirms the findings of the previous report \n     that there is little potential for a successful program to \n     develop manufacturing on a large scale in space for the \n     purpose of returning high-quality, economically viable \n     products to space.\n\n  And the American Physical Society, once more:\n\n       It is the view of the Council of the American Physical \n     Society that scientific justification is lacking for a \n     permanently manned space station. We are concerned that the \n     potential contributions of a manned space station to the \n     physical sciences have been greatly overstated and that many \n     of the scientific objections currently planned for the space \n     station could be accomplished more effectively and at a much \n     lower cost on Earth on unmanned robotic platforms or on the \n     shuttle.\n\n  There are a lot more quotes I could give you. I am just telling you \nwhat all the top people in the country say.\n  I think about the fact that we have been in space almost 35 years and \nwe have had space stations up since 1971, and nobody walks in here and \nsays, ``Here is where we found a cure for this,'' ``Here is where we \nmake great advances of that.''\n  Tang, Velcro, magnetic resonance imaging, Teflon--the space station \nhad nothing to do with those.\n  The space program had nothing to do with those. Yet those myths \npersist that somehow or other we have gotten Tang and Velcro and Teflon \nand all those things out of the space station. That has been debunked \ntotally, so I will not use it anymore. But I will say this. There are \nnot 10 medical doctors in this country who would support the space \nstation if you gave them the option of putting this $2 billion into the \nNational Institutes of Health, who in turn will put it out to the great \nresearchers of this country to cure or make great advances toward \ncuring some of the terribly incurable diseases we have--it is a no \nbrainer. You think about the poor National Institutes of Health sitting \nover there able to fund only one out of every four good applications. I \nam not talking about one of four of all applications; I am talking \nabout one out of four they would like to fund, that they consider \nviable, scientifically viable.\n  I saw a thing that my good friend, Senator Glenn, sent out about the \nNational Institute on Aging, that they can do studies on aging on the \nspace station. Do you know one shuttle flight would fund the National \nInstitute on Aging for a full year?\n  When you say, What do you get out of the space station that you do \nnot get out of just a shuttle flight? The answer is always, Well, it \ntakes longer. You can't do this research in 2 weeks. It takes longer. I \ndo not know how much longer.\n  Then if you ask what kind of research? You hear all of these \npossibilities. Well, we can look at this and we can look at that and we \ncan look at this and we can look at that. They give you some \ncomplicated stuff. NASA has all that stuff cataloged on a computer over \nthere. They can give it to you in spades.\n  As I say, we have been at it 35 years. We have not gotten anything \nyet except a space suit. Space suits are marvelous contraptions, but \nthere is not much demand for space suits in this country. There is a \nlot of demand for education. There is a lot of demand to feed the poor. \nThere is a lot of demand for cleaning up our rivers and lakes. There is \na lot of demand for stopping gangs in high schools. There is a lot of \ndemand for bringing crime under control and doing something about \ndrugs. No demand for space suits.\n  So Mr. President, if I were to ask each Member of this body, if you \nhad a chance to go back over the last 15 years and spend the $4 \ntrillion that we spent that we did not have--the deficit has gone up $4 \ntrillion since 1981--if I were to ask you, would you have spent the $4 \ntrillion over the last 15 years the same way we spent it? Why, of \ncourse you would not have. If you had a chance right now, if somebody \ncame to you and said, Look, here's a chance to save $74 billion on this \nspace station. Do you think you could solve some of this country's \nproblems? Why, it would be like a child at Christmas; people saying, \nOh, my gosh, we could educate every child in the country for what \nthat's going to cost. We could pave every road in the country for what \nthat's going to cost. We could go through all those things.\n  Every problem we have in this country can be traced not to a lack of\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\nmoney, but to the way we spent it. It would not have been for a space \nsuit, even though I am a strong proponent of the space program. I got \nteary-eyed with the rest of America when I watched John Glenn soar into \nspace. I have gotten teary-eyed a lot of times, but not as teary-eyed \nas I am going to get after we have spent the rest of this $74 billion \non the space station.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, just a brief statement. Someone, sometime, somehow \nshould get out here and support the wonderful leadership of our \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas on this particular score. I have \nbeen relatively quiet on the space station because I have learned after \n30 years how to stay quiet up here.\n  With respect to any kind of space program, necessarily having been \nthe chairman and now the ranking member of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, I am very much an enthusiast of the space \nprogram. So my brief comment is to save that space program. I have \nwatched it over the past several years.\n\n  I can remember back in 1993 that we had President Clinton coming in \nand having to ask that the space station be redesigned. Why, Mr. \nPresident? Because in 1984 when we started this program it was sold to \nthe American public as an $8 billion program. Then in 1987 it went to \n$16 billion. By 1993, when President Clinton took office, it was some \n$30 billion. So the distinguished President said, ``Well, go back to \nthe drawing boards. I don't want to come in here as the new Chief \nExecutive and cancel an important program for space, so let's see what \nwe can do to redesign it.'' And the cost went down on that redesigning \nto some $19.4 billion. That was in early 1993.\n  By the end of the year, those working on the program realized that \neven that was not realistic. So the President and Vice President \nannounced a joint program with the Russians of $17.4 billion. That was \nonly for the station itself. We found out, after we went down and asked \nGAO to look at the costs and everything else, that with launch and \noperational costs through the year 2012 the total cost of the space \nstation is $93.9 billion.\n  So I am sitting there and I am trying to be a good friend, which I \nam, of the space program. I think it has been a wonderful American \nsuccess. There is nothing that has thrilled me more than seeing the \ndistinguished Senator seated here in front of me, the Senator from \nOhio, who is a true American hero--we all thrilled at his courage and \nhis valor and his common sense. I am sorry we differ on this particular \nscore. But I am forced to talk money.\n  When I talk money, Mr. President, I get to that space program. I \nfound out, when I listened at the hearings, that the science, \naeronautics, and technology account of NASA, everything except the \nhuman space flight and the civil service salaries and related mission \nsupport--all the rest of it, other than the human space flight and \ncivil service salaries--was some $5.9 billion this past year and by the \nyear 2000 is estimated to be or cut back by NASA to $5.2 billion, which \ndoes not take care of inflation, which does not take care of cost-of-\nliving adjustments and everything else.\n  So I am in a catch-22 situation. I want the space station like \neveryone else, but I am looking at the formative basic fundamental \nspace program, including these unmanned programs as well as the rest of \nthe human space flight account, and I am saying that investment in \nhuman valor and technique and courage, namely, the astronauts \nthemselves, what we have going on in Houston and at Cape Kennedy is \njust too valuable to risk cutting to save this massive hardware \nproject. We should not be cutting back and paring and scraping and \neverything else in NASA, like that little debate we are having and have \njust voted with respect to the Bion Program. I agree with that \nscientific program. The Post picked up the word ``monkey'' and said you \ncan run a touchdown on this one, saying let us get rid of this program. \nWe already had humans up there and now you want to finance $15 million \nworth of monkeys. That is good at election time, but it is outrageous \nnonsense.\n\n  Our problem here in the U.S. Senate is that we choke on the gnat and \nswallow the camel. All those debating and wanting to do away with the \n$15 million should be voting for the $15 million, and all those looking \nat space and its program, generally speaking, ought to be withholding \nvotes for the space station. There are priorities, there are times we \nhave to make choices, and we still, Mr. President, are not out of the \nwoods in a budget sense.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, has been a \nleader in trying to get us on a pay-as-you-go basis. He knows exactly \nof which I speak. I can give you exact figures where we still are \nincreasing that deficit and debt. I say that too quickly, where we are \nstill increasing that deficit. When we increase the deficit, we \nincrease the debt, which increases interest costs on the debt, which \nincreases taxes, because you can't avoid interest costs. They say there \nare two things you can't avoid, death and taxes. Well, put interest \ncosts in the column with taxes. They can't be avoided. They must be \npaid.\n  All of that crowd running around on the floor of the U.S. Congress \nsaying, ``I am against taxes, I am against taxes, I am against taxes'' \nare raising the debt $1 billion a day, and $353 billion is the \nestimate. If growth continues and inflation starts in, it will be more.\n  I was around, Mr. President, as chairman of the Budget Committee when \nwe were at less than $1 trillion in debt. Then comes what gobbled us \nall up, namely that supply-side nonsense, which my distinguished friend \nfrom Kansas, Senator Dole ridiculed. He had a favorite story. I can \nhear it on the floor of the Senate. ``Mr. President, there is good news \nand bad news.'' You would say, ``Senator, what is the good news?'' He \nsaid, ``A bus load of supply-siders just went over the cliff.'' You \nsaid, ``What is the bad news.'' He said, ``There was one empty seat.'' \nNow, my poor friend Bob Dole has taken the empty seat, and we are doing \nit seriously here.\n  Haven't we learned anything going from less than $1 trillion under \nRonald Reagan, who was going to balance the budget in 1 year, to $5 \ntrillion under the Reagan-Bush administrations? And they are talking \nabout who is really for balanced budgets. Well, to balance the budget, \nwe have to do all of the above, as they say in the classroom, on that \nlocal option quiz, not just true or false. It is all of the above. Yes, \nyou are going to have to freeze spending, cut spending, and yes, you \nare going to have to increase taxes to get on top of this monster.\n  We in the Budget Committee, with eight votes, two of our \ndistinguished Republican colleagues, and six of us on the Democratic \nside, 10 years ago almost voted for a value-added tax dedicated to \neliminating the deficit and the debt. The reason we did it is because \nwe realized that freezes were insufficient. The spending cuts under the \nbest of the best spending cutters, Ronald Wilson Reagan, were not \nenough. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was not enough, automatic cuts across the \nboard. So we needed taxes. We voted it at that time. Now, all \ndiscipline and reality is gone.\n  You have to withhold new programs. That was my vote against \nvoluntarism--against AmeriCorps. Maybe I am the only Democratic Senator \nwho voted against it. I helped start the Peace Corps. I can give you \nchapter and verse, where we had the conference down in Miami, and we \ncalled first the then-candidate, John Kennedy. We could not get him and \nwe got Myer Fellman, his legislative assistant on the line. I proposed \na program to Jim Gavin at the conference, head of Arthur D. Little, and \nquoting William Paley, called it the Freedom Corps. That is how we \nstarted it. The first broach of the subject was in Cadillac Square in \nDetroit, and we fleshed it out during the week to be presented in San \nFrancisco.\n\n  So I believe in voluntarism, which the Peace Corps is. But I had to \nwithhold on this new program because in order to get it we played the \npeanut in the shell trick. We took away 347,000 student loans--the \nmoney, therefore--in order to finance 25,000 volunteers, who get paid \nat the cost of $25,000 apiece. I wish I could have gotten out\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nof high school hoping to go to college and jumped into a $25,000 \nprogram. But that is what we are doing here, trying to identify with \npollster politics. We have a real problem on our hands. We are not \ntalking here on the floor of the U.S. Senate about saving the space \nprogram, and we should be.\n  When I see my distinguished colleague who has really gotten into the \nsubject in tremendous detail, the Senator from Arkansas--and nobody \nhere to support him--I feel I must speak by way of conscience, having \nlistened, because we got these hearings before our committee on all the \nfacets of the particular program. When you get the environmental \nsatellites, the aeronautics programs, all those things that will be \njust practically decimated, and in order to go for a space station, \nthen it is just bad planning--particularly at a time when the United \nStates of America is in a position of having to stop the hemorrhage of \ntax increases, $1 billion a day. Tell the American public out there. \nThe media are not doing their job. They have no idea. The candidates \ncan run and get elected, saying, ``I am for cutting spending, I am for \ncutting spending, I am for cutting spending.''\n  Then they come up here with that silly nonsense of wanting to abolish \nthe Department of Commerce. Who do you think I am on the telephone with \nnow? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I am trying \nto find out whether that hurricane now bearing down on South Carolina \nis going to hit my house again like Hugo did down in Charleston. What \nare we going to do with the patent office? We can go down the list of \nthe various endeavors at that department. Our export endeavor was \nridiculed. They ridiculed Secretary Brown, who was doing what every \nGovernor worth his salt did. He got offices in London, in Tokyo, \ntalking to industry, and that is what the Secretary should be doing.\n  That is the effort they want to get rid of, the Department of \nCommerce, and departments for energy, education, and housing, and then \nthey come around here and put $93.9 billion in a program that is going \nto really hurt the basic space program, where we are going to have to \nreally cut back on the valued astronauts, the human side, to pay for \nthis hardware. We are just going to make it truly unattractive for \nthem. Their sacrifice is great enough. They practically have to \nseparate themselves from their families and everything else. Their \ndiligence, and time and time again, their discipline and everything \nelse is the hardest work in the world. There is not enough pay. But \nthen they say, like we have at NIH--if you cut the research, the smart \ngraduates see that of all the particular research grants that were \npresented this year, we were able to actually fund less than 20 percent \nof those who passed muster competitively. We are not funding. So the \nsmart researchers, scientists, and graduates say, well, there is no \nfuture there. I don't want to work my way into trying to get a space \nstation, saying, ``Wait a minute. There is no future there.''\n\n  So I have voted to support the basic space program. I have never \ntaken the floor because I did not want to, as chairman of that \nparticular program, indicate opposition to space. I worked with the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio when President Reagan was in office to \nsave the space program. I will work again to save the space program. \nMr. President, that is why I am here this afternoon to save the space \nprogram. In this budget climate, we cannot keep both the basic space \nprogram and the space station.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9799-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9804-S9820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SPACE STATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas as a cosponsor of his amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to terminate funding for the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration Space Station program, which the General \nAccounting Office estimates will cost American taxpayers $94 billion.\n  Every day, the working families of Massachusetts have to make tough \nchoices about what they can afford, how to pay the rent, and whether \nthey can send their kids to college.\n  The Federal budget deficit, while reduced by two-thirds due to \nPresident Clinton's leadership and the courage of the Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress in 1993, is still too high and must be eliminated. \nIt is a drain on our economy and, increasingly, the debt service we pay \nis robbing us of the ability to make badly needed investments in our \nfuture. I have been working in the U.S. Senate to make the tough \nchoices necessary to balance the budget.\n  When measured against this imperative, I believe the space station's \npotential benefits--which I recognize--do not stand the test. I believe \nwe must terminate funding for this program.\n  We cannot spend nearly $100 billion of the taxpayers money to fund \nthe space station and then say that we do not have enough money to put \ncops on the beat, clean our environment, and ensure that our children \nget the best education possible.\n  The Senator from Arkansas, joined by several others of us, has made a \nvaliant effort to halt this project again and again over the past \nseveral years. I am hopeful that this year the time has come when the \nSenate will exercise fiscal responsibility over our Federal budget, \nlike any family in Massachusetts would over its own family budget, by \nterminating the space station immediately in order to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  In 1984, NASA justified the space station based on eight potential \nuses. Now only one of these assignments remains: the space station will \nbe used as a research laboratory. However, the costs of performing \nscientific research in space simply outweigh the potential benefits. It \nwill cost over $12,000 to ship 1 pound of payload to the space station.\n  Many of my colleagues support the space station because it creates \njobs. But the project's costs for developing jobs are exorbitant--those \njobs will cost approximately $161,000 each. If invested here on terra \nfirma, that amount of money would fund three or four or even more jobs.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I have fought, along \nwith the distinguished Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] and \nother Senators, to secure funding for many important scientific \nprograms. Many of these programs have been shortchanged in order to \nhelp pay for the costs associated with the development of the space \nstation. Allowing this extraordinary large science program to receive \nfunding at the expense of these other so-called small science \nprograms--which I believe will produce more products and more valuable \nproducts--is unacceptable. These small programs are creating thousands \nof high wage technology jobs at a fraction of the cost associated with \nthe space station.\n\n  In the space program itself, the enormous level of funding consumed \nby the space station is crowding out much smaller programs for \nsatellites and unmanned space probes, which most experts consider more \ncost-effective than manned missions.\n  These activities are aimed at expanding our understanding of the Sun, \nthe solar system, and the universe beyond. The specific programs in \nthis category include the ``new millennium,'' a program to build \nrobotic spacecraft one-tenth the size and cost of satellites; the \nCassini mission to Saturn, scheduled for launch in 1997; continuation \nof the Discovery missions, each of which costs less than $150 million, \ncan be launched within 3 years of the start of its development, and is \nused by NASA to find ways to develop smaller, cheaper, faster, better \nplanetary spacecraft; and the Mars surveyor program which funds a \nseries of small missions to resume the detailed exploration of Mars \nafter the loss of the Mars Observer mission in 1993.\n  Funding for projects in this area will be approximately $1.86 billion \nin fiscal year 1997 which represents a 9-percent reduction from last \nyear. The academic research establishment is concerned that the space \nstation appears to be draining funds from these other space projects.\n  Also included among the programs placed at risk by the space station \nis the mission to planet Earth, NASA's satellite program to explore \nglobal climate change by means of a series of Earth observing \nsatellites launched over a 15-year period, beginning in 1998--a program \nendorsed by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Given the structure of congressional appropriations bills, the \nenormous\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\nfunding for the space station has come not just at the expense of other \nspace programs but at the expense of environmental research and other \nimportant activities that promise to improve the lives of our citizens \nand enhance our security more completely.\n  Building the space station has become a joint effort between the \nUnited States and Russia. We all want to see continued progress in \nUnited States-Russian relations. However, we should be encouraging \nRussia to house and feed its own people, provide jobs, and above all \ncare for its deteriorating nuclear powerplants and dismantle its \nnuclear missiles and warheads. Asking Russia to commit its resources to \npursue an uncertain and risky space station venture instead of \nencouraging it to tend to these important matters is unwise.\n  Some may argue that we have lost our vision if we terminate the space \nstation. But their concern is misplaced. We still have vision. But the \nvision is to restore the American dream to our citizens, to restore \ntheir sense of safety on the streets, to invest in technology that will \nincrease our competitiveness and the quality of jobs, to invest in \nresearch that will cure our deadly diseases, and to restore our \ncommunities to the condition where children can learn and dream.\n  It is time to decide. I think the American people are watching \nimpatiently to see whether the U.S. Congress can deliver spending \nreductions for programs that are politically popular but fiscally \nunwise.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, \nfor his continuing leadership on this important issue. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote to terminate the space station.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Bumpers amendment \non space station. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, which authorizes and oversees the NASA \nbudget, I believe space station will be the foundation of our space \nprogram for many years to come. In just 1 year, we will finally begin \nthe assembly of the largest structure ever constructed in space. Space \nstation also is one of the most ambitious international science exports \never undertaken. Space station will bring together the United States \nand its foreign partners--Japan, Western Europe, Canada, and its newest \npartner, Russia--in this great challenge to build an orbiting \nlaboratory to conduct important microgravity and biomedical research \nrequiring the unique environment of outer space. The research of space \nstation is expected to eventually lead to new drugs to fight disease, \nimprove our health, and permit the invention of new advanced materials. \nThese benefits will be enjoyed and experienced by the entire world \ncommunity.\n  In addition, we can expect commercial spinoffs and breakthrough \ntechnologies just as past NASA programs have spawned such great \nadvances as communications satellites. Many products we take for \ngranted today were the result of work performed on NASA missions. Laser \nfaxes, pacemakers, advanced water filters, hearing aid testers, and \nDoppler radar systems all were generated from NASA projects. I am \nconfident space station will usher in a new generation of such advances \nto benefit the world.\n  Mr. President, after a decade of hard work and planning, NASA is \nfinally prepared to embark on its greatest challenge. Americans in 37 \nStates have contributed their time and talent to brings us to this \npoint. More the $15 billion already has been spent, not including the \n$6 billion invested by our foreign partners. Next winter, the first \nelement of space station will be launched--a propulsion and navigation \nsystem--to begin the assembly of the facility which will conclude in \nthe year 2002. It is in our national interest to move forward, into the \nfuture, and begin assembly of the space station.\n  Let me say my support for the space station is not without some \nreservations. For instance, I continue to be concerned about the \nprogram's heavy reliance on Russian contributions of critical hardware \nand launch services. Since joining the program 3 years ago, our former \ncold war rival has gone from being a nonparticipant in the program to \nan indispensable partner. For example, over half of the 73 space \nmissions to assemble and supply the station are Russian launches, \ncompared with about 27 shuttle launches. Moreover, both the navigation \nand propulsion system as well as its crew rescue vehicles are to be \nbuilt and launched by the Russians. While NASA assures Congress and the \nNation that the space station could still survive even if the Russians \nwere to withdraw, this may be wishful thinking.\n  I am also concerned about the cost of the space station project. NASA \nestimates the total cost of the program at $30 billion through the year \n2000. In a report released last month, GAO indicated space station is \nexperiencing troubling cost overruns which, if left unchecked, could \nultimately balloon to $400 million.\n  In addition, there have been recent reports of cost increases which \nthreaten to exhaust much of the reserves budgeted for the project. If \nthis program experiences any significant cost overruns, its huge budget \ncould start to crowd out other worthy space programs like Mission to \nPlanet Earth--which I consider the most important and relevant of all \nof NASA's activities. Clearly, this result would not be in the public \ninterest.\n  These concerns were addressed at our July 24 hearing on space station \nand again at a meeting between the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nBurns, and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. With regard to the Russian \nissue, Vice President Gore and Administrator Goldin recently traveled \nto Russia where they negotiated an agreement in principle regarding the \nrespective roles and responsibilities of Russia in the program. The \nagreement will be the basis for a formal memorandum of understanding to \nbe finalized later this year. Participants in the United States-Russian \ntalks are confident the Russians will make a firm commitment to provide \nthe support to which they have agreed. However, in the event the \nRussians do not perform, NASA has viable contingency plans to move \nforward using United States contractors to replace any lost Russian \ncontribution.\n  As for the space station costs, NASA has assured the Commerce \nCommittee the alarming press accounts are overblown and the program \nwill exceed neither its $2.1 billion annual cap nor its cost estimate \nof $17.4 billion from October 1993 through assembly completion in the \nyear 2002. NASA is mindful of the potential for cost overruns and the \nneed for better cost control systems. In that connection, the head of \nthe space station program, Wilbur Trafton, testified before our Space \nSubcommittee that NASA has budgeted $2.9 billion over the program's \nlife to cover unexpected cost overruns. Administrator Goldin is an \nexceptionally talented administrator so I have great confidence in \nNASA's assurances the program is on track and within budget.\n  Accordingly, I support the space station, but as chairman, of the \nCommerce Committee, I continue to monitor its progress closely through \nour oversight function. The program has come a long way from the early \n1980's when the space station was still a dream of President Reagan and \nexisted only as the blueprints of NASA engineers. Space station is now \nalmost a reality. The plans have been finalized, hardware has been \nbuilt, and the launches have been scheduled. Next year the space \nstation adventure will finally begin with the launches have been \nscheduled. Next year, the space station adventure will finally begin \nwith the launch of its first piece of hardware. Now is the time to go \nforward, not backward, and move the country and our technology into the \n21st century. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this \ncountry's future by opposing the Bumpers amendment. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senator Bumpers to terminate the international space \nstation. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas again tells us that \nAmerica should abandon its commitment as the leader of this historic \nendeavor. Supporters of this amendment have many reasons why we should \ndesert our international partners just when we are about to launch the \nfirst sections of this incredible project into orbit. Mr. President, I \nreject these arguments for a number of reasons.\n  First, Mr. President, the opposition talks of cost overruns, and yet, \ndespite\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\nthe complexity of this task and the various challenges that will be \nencountered as the station moves from the drawing board to reality, \nNASA is committed to remaining within the $17.4 billion projected cost \nfor the redesigned space station. Frankly, Mr. President, we have cut \nand trimmed the resources available for the space station to the point \nwhere NASA has little, if any, flexibility in dealing with the \ninevitable challenges it will face. Today we debate the very existence \nof the space station when we should be talking about maximizing NASA's \nflexibility within the limits that we have already placed upon them.\n  Second, the opposition tells us that NASA may divert science funds to \nconstruction accounts, thereby leaving the station with no scientific \ncapability at all. While NASA may rephase funds intended for developing \nscientific experiments, this management initiative in no way reflects a \nreduction in NASA's commitment to research on the space station. Some \npayload facilities are developing ahead of schedule, and NASA is wisely \ncoordinating these elements to be complete when the station is ready to \naccept them. This rephasing of funds will allow NASA to augment its \nprogram reserve accounts to place them at acceptable levels. This is \nthe type of planning and initiative that we should support, not attack.\n  Third, we are told that the contractors involved in the station's \nconstruction are encountering significant problems with the first two \nnodes. Mr. President, if all great research and development projects \nwere terminated because they encountered significant problems, we would \nbe without many, if not all, of the greatest discoveries in human \nhistory. Yes, the space station is a great challenge, but, the men and \nwomen working on the station have yet to encounter an obstacle that \nthey cannot surmount. In fact, node 1 has recently completed a \nsuccessful pressure test and will now undergo a post-test inspection \nand final preparation for launch. This is an exciting time for the \nspace station and we should be focusing our attention on its permanent \nsuccesses and not its temporary set-backs.\n  Fourth, termination of the international space station will undermine \nthe credibility of the United States with its international partners \nwho have already invested more than one-half of their planned $10 \nbillion contribution. We have taken the lead on this project and given \nour word that we will see it through. Leadership requires resolve and \ncharacter. It is not in the American character to break our promises \nand abandon our friends and partners, especially when the prize we all \nseek is within our grasp.\n  Finally, Mr. President, termination of the space station will end any \npromise of meaningful space-based long-duration research in cell and \ndevelopmental biology, human physiology, biotechnology, fluid physics, \ncombustion science, materials science, low-temperature physics and the \nlarge-scale commercial development of space.\n  For decades, the space program has driven science and technology \ndevelopment, motivated our children, and inspired a nation and the \nworld. Mr. President, we stand at the threshold of a new millennium. \nLet it not be said that we squandered one of our first opportunities \nfor greatness in the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. President, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to propound a unanimous-consent \nrequest. We have I believe cleared this on both sides of the aisle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to \namendment No. 5178 after 2 hours of debate and that the time be equally \ndivided between Senator Bumpers and Senator Bond with 15 minutes of the \ntime under my control allocated to Senator Hutchison, 10 minutes \nallocated to Senator Mikulski, 20 minutes allocated to Senator Glenn, \nand that no second-degree amendments or motions to refer be in order \nprior to the vote in relation to the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. SIMON. Will the Senator from Maryland yield 5 minutes to me?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I can only yield Senator Bumpers' time. Actually in \nbehalf of the opposition to my position, I will graciously yield to one \nof the great Senators 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for her \ngraciousness.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Ohio. No Member of the \nSenate has shown more courage. Any of you who have visited the Air and \nSpace Museum and seen that little thing that John Glenn crawled into, I \ndo not know very many human beings who would risk what he did.\n  So I speak in opposition to his position with great reluctance. But \nmy friends, we simply have to get hold of things.\n  This morning's New York Times has an op-ed piece by Paul Krugman, a \nprofessor of economics at MIT. He says, in referring to the two \ncandidates for President:\n       The sad truth about this year's economic debate is that the \n     biggest issue facing the Federal Government--the issue that \n     should be uppermost in our minds--is not being discussed at \n     all. Most of what happens in our economy is beyond the reach \n     of government policy. In particular, the evidence suggests \n     that it is difficult for the Government to have any visible \n     effect on the economy's long-term growth rate.\n       There is one thing, however, that the Government can and \n     must control: its own budget. And it is heading inexorably \n     toward fiscal disaster, as the baby boomers in the tens of \n     millions march steadily toward the age at which they can \n     claim Social Security and Medicare. True, the crisis is still \n     about 15 years away. But we expect responsible adults to \n     start preparing for their retirement decades in advance; why \n     shouldn't we ask the same of our Government?\n       Unfortunately, everything that a responsible government \n     should be doing now--raising taxes, raising the retirement \n     age, scaling back benefits for those who can manage without \n     them (that means for the affluent, not the poor)--is \n     political poison.\n       It may be too much to ask the candidates to preach \n     responsibility to the public, but we can at least ask them \n     not to make things even worse by offering goodies the nation \n     cannot afford.\n\n  My friends, this debate is an illustration of why we need the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. There are a lot of good \nthings that we would like to do. If we had a $100 billion surplus, I \nprobably would vote for a space station, even though the Aviation Week \n& Space Technology of August 26 starts off its story--the heading is \n``Cost Increases Add to Station Woes''--with the first paragraph:\n\n       NASA is considering ways to scale back early scientific \n     work on the international space station to pay for cost \n     increases that threaten to exhaust reserves for the project.\n\n  There are a lot of things that we would like to do that we just \ncannot do. I think the space station is one of them. I happen to \nbelieve that both political parties are being irresponsible right now \nin asking for a tax cut. Would I like a tax cut? Sure. Would the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, my friend from Idaho, like a tax cut? \nSure. We ought to restrain ourselves and not have tax cuts until we \nhave the surplus. That means that we are going to have to restrain \nourselves on some spending that would be nice but is it essential for \nour Government. And a space station is one of those things. I think we \nhave to use some common sense.\n  I say to my friend from Arkansas who is here that I am going to be \nleaving the Senate shortly. You are not going to get an amendment like \nthis passed until we have a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget. Until that time, candidates for office are going to \ncontinue to promise tax cuts, and we are going to vote for things like \nthis that really do not make sense. I hope that one of these days we \nwill recognize that Thomas Jefferson was right when he said we need \nfiscal constraint in the Constitution that we do not have.\n  In the meantime, let us do what is right on this and say, it would be \nnice, it is not essential, and let us not vote for it. That is what we \nought to do.\n  Let me just add. I want to commend my colleague from Arkansas for \nyear\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\nafter year after year pursuing this. I know he feels like he is in the \nbottom of a well of no one listening. But if we do not push for this \nkind of restraint we are going to have fiscal chaos in this country. \nThat is the simple reality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to Senator Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for up to \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I gave a very lengthy statement yesterday on the space \nprogram, and the space station in particular, on items that got into \nconsiderable detail on the various aspects of the scientific reasoning \nfor it, the corollary between some of the things that happened to \nastronauts in space and the normal processes of aging here on Earth, \nand how some of these things are being investigated, or planned to be \ninvestigated more in the future than they have been up to now. But I \nthink these are very, very interesting. But for a few minutes, I will \nnot use all of my 20 minutes on this, and I do not want to go back and \naddress all of those things I did yesterday much as I would like to \nhave that time. I know we are under some time constraints. But I want \nto make sure that we get into the Record, or that we put out for our \ncolleagues' consideration, some items that express concerns about the \ncost growth and schedule slippage on the space station without getting \ninto the scientific background of justification of why we are doing \nthis thing at all because those were put out by my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers, in a ``Dear Colleague'' letter.\n\n  Let me just respond to his comments of a little while ago. I do not \nhave a better friend in the Senate than Senator Bumpers. We came in \nhere the same day. I would say that our voting records are nearly \nsimilar, except once a year we get into opposition on this particular \nitem. I always regret that we have to oppose each other on this because \nwe both feel strongly about this particular issue. So this is not a \nslam at Senator Bumpers. But I do want to respond to some of the things \nthat were put out in his ``Dear Colleague'' letter.\n  In that letter it stated, ``Scheduled delays in cost overruns will \nadd additional billions to the price of the project.''\n  The bottom line is that as of now the station is over 45 percent \ncomplete. The hardware is being cut. This is not some prospective thing \noff into the future. The hardware is in existence; 45 percent; 122,000 \npounds of the space station have already been built and are currently \nundergoing testing. According to GAO, the $17.4 billion project is \nabout $89 million over cost and about $88 million behind schedule. I \nrepeat. It is a $17.4 billion project, and only $89 million over cost. \nThat is roughly within 1 percent of the planned targets. I think that \nis better than probably 99 percent of Government projects, or maybe \neven industrial projects also.\n  I think very clearly NASA and its contractors need to strive to \ncomplete the project on time and on budget, of course. The facts \nindicate that the program is slightly--I say slightly--over budget; the \nfigures I just gave--and behind schedule. However, NASA managers are \ntaking steps to reverse that trend. A very important tool in NASA's \ncase is its contract with the prime contractor, Boeing, which ties a \nvery substantial portion of Boeing's payment to successful performance \nof the contract.\n  Here is another very important management tool for dealing with cost \ngrowth. Administrator Goldin set up a program reserve, so included \nwithin these planned $17.4 billion program costs are program reserves. \nNearly $3 billion of the station's budget fall into this category. \nThese are funds which are to be used for unplanned or unforeseen costs. \nIt is a research program. You cannot define it like buying 22 trucks \noff the line at GM or Ford or some place where you know the exact \ncosts, and so on. So you do have to plan for unplanned or unforeseen \ncosts. That is a likely occurrence when one is designing and building \nand testing and operating a very unique research facility, the only one \nof its kind.\n  Up until recently, NASA had not had much need to tap into these \nprogram reserves. The program was going along well, being well managed, \nstaying within budget. However, the last half of fiscal 1996, 1997, and \n1998 are the peak construction and spending years. It is during this \ntime that program managers anticipated they might need to use reserves. \nThe bottom line is that there are adequate reserves to fund all \nanticipated cost growths that are foreseen right now.\n  Also, my friend from Arkansas said in that ``Dear Colleague,'' ``NASA \nis considering making up the shortfall by diverting funds intended for \ndeveloping scientific experiments on the station. If this happens, NASA \ncould end up with a space station with no scientific capability at \nall.''\n  That is a very troubling assertion. But my colleagues know, I \nbelieve, that research to be performed on the station will \nsignificantly benefit those of us right here on Earth. The research is \nthe reason we have the program. It is not just to let a few people go \nup and experience the view from up there in space. It is to do the \nbasic, fundamental research in the new laboratory of space, a \ncapability that humankind has never had before through our hundreds of \nthousands of years of existence here on Earth. For the first time, we \ncan use this new laboratory of space.\n  So I have asked NASA about this issue and NASA reports the following:\n  Station managers have taken steps to ensure that the scientific \npayloads are being developed on a parallel course with the space \nstation vehicle and are synchronized with their planned use aboard the \nspace station. NASA has shifted some funds from the space station \nscience accounts to the program reserve accounts where they may be \nneeded for construction of the vehicle itself during the next year or \nso. Before these schedule changes were made, some of the scientific \npayloads were moving ahead of schedule and would have been completed \nbefore they would have been used on the station. The rephasing of some \nof these development activities also has the effect of freeing up \nfunding planned for the next 2 years but that would simply augment the \nprogram reserves and place those reserves and figures at a more \nacceptable level as a percentage of the total budget for those 2 years. \nSo in the end there is no reduction in the commitment to research on \nthe space station. It is a matter of timing, not a reduction in \nscientific capability.\n  The overall level of funds for science activity has not been reduced \none penny.\n  Also it has been said, an issue has been made of the problems that \nhave been encountered by NASA and Boeing in building the space \nstation's nodes, the connecting pieces for the space station modules. \nEarlier this year one of the nodes failed a pressure test. However, \nthis problem has been corrected. Last week, just a week ago, the nodes \npassed the pressurization test. There have been some costs in schedule \npenalties when this problem has been addressed. However, the costs can \nbe met through the use of the program reserves I mentioned a moment \nago.\n\n  Let me say this pressure test takes it up to about 1\\1/2\\ times what \nthe normal pressure will be in that structure while it is in space. \nThey have approximately a sea level pressure, slightly over sea level \npressure, which is 14.7 pounds per square inch. I think it is planned \nthat the station will operate at 15.2, and they went up to 1\\1/2\\ times \nthat 15.2, and it passed with no problems. So NASA does not believe \nthat any delays in launching any space station element will occur as a \nresult of this now corrected problem. It was a problem at one time, but \nthat has been overcome.\n  Finally, the Senator from Arkansas has asserted that the Russians are \nfalling behind on their share of the program and that the United States \nis bailing out the Russians by renting time on the Mir spacecraft. The \nRussians play a crucial role in the international space station, but \ntheir participation will result in the United States ultimately \nspending less on the program rather than more.\n  The schedule problems encountered by the Russians have been the \nsubject of high level government-to-government negotiations. In July of \nthis year, 1996, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and Vice President Gore \nsigned a document detailing key milestones for both sides to meet in \norder to keep the program on schedule. This meeting resulted in needed \nfunds being freed up\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\nwithin the Russian bureaucracy so that work on the Russian components \ncould continue. That is just a month and a half ago, a little less than \nthat. The Russian officials have assured NASA that their schedule \nslippages can be eliminated as long as necessary funding levels are \nmaintained.\n  In the meantime, the United States and Russia are continuing to \ncooperate on what I think is an exciting program, a productive joint \nprogram on the Mir space station. As many of us are certainly aware, \nU.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid is still up there right now completing a \nrecord-setting stay on the Mir space station. When she comes back down \nin another week or so, I believe she will have about 185 days in space. \nWhen she comes back down, she will be replaced by another U.S. \nastronaut, John Blaha, thus continuing what will eventually be 2\\1/2\\ \nyears of continuous U.S. presence on the Russian station. This streak \nbegan with Norm Thagard's mission last year.\n  The goals of this first phase of United States-Russian space \ncooperation are being met and include, No. 1, experience in long-\nduration space operation. As discussed above, U.S. astronauts are \ngetting invaluable experience to better understand the requirements of \nsustained permanent space operations. This experience will enable NASA \nscientists and engineers to more productively plan for the research \nthat will be conducted on the international space station.\n  No. 2, science research. U.S. astronauts Norm Thagard and Shannon \nLucid have conducted literally hundreds of experiments during their \nrespective stays on Mir and hundreds more are being planned over the \nnext 2 years.\n  So, Mr. President, those are just a few comments in rebuttal to what \nwas put out in the ``Dear Colleague'' letter that was sent around. I \nwill reserve the remainder of my time here to reply to some of the \nother areas, so I will yield the floor at this time. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have remaining, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to have Senator Mikulski \nrecognized for her time, and would allocate 10 minutes to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise again this year in support of \nAmerica's space program and in opposition to the Bumpers amendment that \nstrikes the funding for the space station. How ironic it is, at this \ntime of great space discoveries like the possibility of life on Mars, \nthat my colleague wants to eliminate one of NASA's greatest programs. \nOnce again, I will come to the defense of the American people who \ndepend on the space station in so many ways.\n  What do I mean? I am talking about jobs. Killing the space station is \nabout jobs, and jobs in the United States of America. It is about \nputting people out of work or keeping people on the job, many thousands \nof men and women who work directly in the program or in factories that \nwork on the space station itself. There are many thousands whose jobs \nresult from the multiplier effect of the station's construction. Most \nare middle class, blue and white-collar workers who make family level \nwages, with health security, and we want to be sure that they have \npaycheck security, health security and can count on this job.\n  They are the same kind of Americans who are already affected by \nmilitary base closings. For my colleagues who insist we need a defense \nconversion strategy to deal with the end of the cold war, the space \nstation is an opportunity to retain our high-tech manufacturing skills \nfor a civilian economy.\n  My opponent claims that commercialization as a result of the space \nstation is not materializing. The 1993 National Association of Public \nAdministrators committee report stated this:\n\n       Through university-based partnerships with industry and \n     government, and also through traditionally federally \n     sponsored commercial space initiatives conducted at diverse \n     NASA field centers, private investment in commercial space \n     processing ventures has grown.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues not to be lulled into thinking that killing \nthe space station will not have a serious negative effect on our \neconomy, the economy of the State of Alabama, and more important, on \nthe lives of thousands of Americans throughout the entire United \nStates, both in Alabama and in Texas.\n  Also, let us fight for the space station for scientific value. One of \nthe points raised by my opponent is there is little science of any \nvalue that will be done aboard the space station. Quite the contrary: \nThe science proposed for the space station cannot be accomplished on \nEarth. The space station science requires access to very low levels of \ngravitational force, and it must be sustained. It is technologically \nimpossible to create a low-gravity environment for this type of \nresearch without going into space orbit.\n  The thinking behind the Bumpers amendment is the same kind of \nthinking that would stifle our understanding of bacteria and germs that \ncause disease. It is that kind of philosophy that would have stopped \nMadam Curie from discovering radium, from which the field of radiology \ndeveloped, or Jonas Salk from finding the cure for polio.\n  With technology being developed for the space station, scientists are \nalready beginning to understand how cancer cells form in the human \nbody, and they can do so because of a zero-gravity environment which \npermits them to grow tissues just like they are growing in the human \nbody. What does that mean? We can actually simulate tumors in a way we \ncould never do here on Earth. For those who say, ``Do not give it to \nNASA, give it to NIH,'' there is a joint agreement between NASA and the \nNational Institutes of Health, just on this exact same kind of life \nscience research.\n\n  This type of research has produced important microgravity research \nfindings. This is particularly so in the area of protein crystal \ngrowing. No other lab on Earth can simulate that kind of tissue growth. \nOther labs must contend with the distorting factor of gravity.\n  What does the absence of gravity mean? It will allow the kind of \nresearch that produces new insights into human health and disease \ntreatment, like heart and lung functions, cardiovascular disease, \nosteoporosis, immune system functionings, and so on.\n  The other reason we support the space station is because of \ntechnological innovation. The space station is not only about science, \nit is about technology development. By the mere fact of building the \nstation and by the mere fact of doing medical and life science and \ncrystal development, in order to do the research we have to develop new \ntechnology. That can be medical equipment technology, mineralization \ntechniques, and a whole series of other things. That has been the \nhistory of NASA.\n  Also, let us be clear, the space station is about the entrepreneurial \nspirit that has been at the heart of our country's aerospace industry. \nIn the history and development of ideas, there are always the naysayers \nwho say let us stick with the status quo. But we can do better. Through \nhistory it has been bold people with entrepreneurial ideas, backed up \nwith resources, that invented new technology that led to new products \nthat led to new jobs that has made the United States of America an \neconomic superpower. We are an economic superpower because of our \nscientific and technological development. In high-technology \ninnovation, the United States has always led the way. U.S. \ncompetitiveness can only be maintained by long-term, cutting-edge, \nhigh-risk research and development.\n  So I will continue to fight for the space station, both for what it \nrepresents now and what it represents in the future. I will vote no on \nBumpers and yes for America's space program for the 21st century.\n  I yield back such time as I might yet have.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the time allocated to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri and \nthe Senator from Maryland for the leadership that they are providing in\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\nmaking sure that we have NASA and the space program, because they know \nhow much this has done for our country. They have been there with me, \nlooking at what the space station will be able to do. We have walked \nthrough the modules. We have looked at the experiments and how they are \ndone in space and at the unique attributes they have in that space \nstation which will allow them to do things they cannot do on Earth. \nThey cannot duplicate the microgravity conditions on Earth.\n  I just wish the Senator from Arkansas would go with me one day and \nsee what a difference it makes for our country that we have this \ncommitment to space and the future, the essence of what we are debating \ntoday, when we take up funding for the space station yet again. This is \nthe 14th time that there have been attempts to terminate the funding, \nbut fortunately Congress has been farsighted, and the administration \nhas as well, to make sure we do not walk away from the future.\n  What we are talking about today is whether we are going to summon the \nvision to continue this quest in cooperation with other nations. Or \nwould we clip the wings of our civilization and just hunker down here \non Earth?\n  The benefits of NASA research are long proven. Every dollar spent on \nspace results in $2 in direct and indirect economic benefit. \nBreakthroughs in medical technology that we now take for granted are \nrooted in NASA technology. For example, NASA has developed a cool suit \nfor Apollo missions which now helps improve the quality of life of \nmultiple sclerosis victims.\n  NASA technology has provided pacemakers that can be programmed from \noutside the body. NASA has developed instruments to measure bone mass \nand bone density without penetrating the skin. These are now widely \nused to give a test for osteoporosis so that a woman can get a \nbenchmark and then know if she is losing bone loss and needs to add \nextra calcium to her diet.\n  NASA research has led to an implant for delivering insulin to \ndiabetics that is only 3 inches across. It provides more precise \ncontrol of blood sugar levels and frees diabetics from the need for \ndaily insulin injections.\n  The space shuttle has begun to lift the curtain on the enormous \nopportunities that lie ahead in a manned microgravity laboratory. The \nstation will allow scientists to modify their experiments in orbit and \ntake advantage of the unanticipated results. This is the kind of \nflexibility that has historically led to the greatest scientific \nbreakthroughs and will do so again to fight cancer, osteoporosis and \ndiabetes.\n  Despite these benefits, some critics have said that the scientific \nreturns for more than a decade of experiments in weightless conditions \nare not really cost-benefit approved. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the \nchancellor and chairman of the Department of Surgery at Baylor College \nof Medicine said:\n\n       Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only a few hours in the laboratory and then expect them to \n     find cures for cancer. We need much longer missions in space \n     in months and years to obtain research results that may lead \n     to the development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n\n  So, Dr. DeBakey is saying we don't need less time, we don't need less \nemphasis on the space station, we need more. Dr. DeBakey knows what can \nbe done, because he is one of the innovators in this field.\n  Life and work on the station also generates breakthroughs that \nimprove life on the ground. We expect to develop lighter, stronger, \nsuperalloy metals, lower cost heating and cooling systems, longer life \npower converters, safer chemical storage, air and water purification, \nwaste management, and recycling systems.\n  As with the Apollo program before, the space station will be the \nproving ground for advances in communications, computers, and \nelectronics. Research equipment developed for the space station is \nalready paying dividends. Scientists are growing ovarian tumor samples \nin NASA's new cell culturing device so that tumors can be studied \noutside the body without harm to the patient. A similar trial is \nunderway for brain tumors.\n  The question we are asking today is, will we pursue this knowledge? \nScience alone is not the reason that we are reaching into space. As the \nworld redefines itself in the wake of the cold war, the space station \nis a catalyst for international cooperation and a symbol of U.S. \nleadership in a changing world.\n  We now are drawing on the expertise of 13 nations--the United States, \nCanada, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, \nSpain, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Russia. Failure to fund \nthe space station would undermine our partnerships with Europe, Japan, \nand Canada which have expended over half of their $9 billion commitment \nto the $17 billion space station program. It would cause them to \nconclude that they can no longer count on the United States as an ally; \nthat our commitment would not be good. Mr. President, we do not want to \nbe bad partners. That is not the legacy that this Congress would want \nto leave.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the space station and NASA has not \njust been out there in a vacuum as we have been trying to cut the rate \nof growth of spending. They have stepped right up to the line. They \nhave taken their fair share. Dan Goldin has a zero-based review in \nplace that has shaved the cost off NASA and has made it more efficient \nfor the taxpayers of this country.\n  A 1993 redesign of the program resulted in a space station that is $6 \nbillion more cost efficient. I watched this process closely, and I \ncommend Dan Goldin for this approach. If every agency would do this, we \nwould have a 35-percent budget reduction, saving taxpayers $40 billion \nmore and be able to continue with the mission.\n\n  So I do not want us to be the Congress in the last half of the last \ndecade of the 20th century that is remembered for displaying the \nfailure of will. No, Mr. President, we have goodwill in the space \nagency, in the space station and abandoning it would signify, I think, \na myopic view of our country and of the world.\n  America has been the leader in space, and now we have a chance to \ncooperate with our friends around the world and continue to do better \nfor mankind. This is not the time to walk away from the gigantic \ninvestment we have made. Any scientist will tell you that you cannot \npredict what the results are going to be when you go into research, but \nyou can make sure that we have the underpinnings that will keep America \nvibrant and growing so that we can absorb the new people that come into \nour system, so that we will create the new industries that create the \nnew jobs that will keep our country economically strong.\n  Our young people must have a place that they know they can go for \nscientific research and breakthroughs for the future. As we are going \ninto the 21st century, we cannot go back into the 18th century and say, \n``Space is out there, but we're not going to explore it.'' Mr. \nPresident, that is not the American way.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join us for the 15th time and make sure \nthat we send the clear signal that we are committed to this research, \nthat it is right for America and that we will do better things for the \nworld because of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the rest of my time to my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me commend my colleague from Texas for \nan excellent statement. We have debated this issue with our dear friend \nfrom Arkansas on many occasions. I feel confident that the outcome of \nthe vote today will be the same as it has been on the many previous \noccasions that we have voted on this matter. And since my colleague \nfrom Texas has done such a great job of focusing in on the space \nstation, let me take a little bit bigger picture and try to develop \nthat.\n  In 1965, we spent 5.7 percent of the Federal budget on nondefense \nresearch and development. In 1965, we invested 5.7 percent of the \nFederal budget in new science, new technology, new know-how to plant \nthe seeds to generate jobs in the future.\n  Today, under the budget submitted by the President, including the \nfunding level that we have for the space station, we are spending 1.9 \npercent of the\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nFederal budget on nondefense research and development. From 1965 until \ntoday, our investment in science and technology in the future has \ndeclined from 5.7 cents out of every dollar we spend in the Federal \nbudget down to 1.9 cents out of every dollar we spend in the Federal \nbudget.\n  From 1965 to 1997, we have had an explosion in Federal spending, and \nyet in the midst of this explosion in Federal spending, we have \nincreased spending not as an investment in the future, not as an \ninvestment in the next generation, not as an investment in science and \ntechnology, but, by and large, we have spent our money on social \nprograms. And in the process, our Government has become the largest \nconsuming institution in our society and one of the smallest investing \ninstitutions in our society as a percentage of the budget.\n  In 1965 we were plowing back 5.7 cents out of every budget dollar \ninto investments in science, technology, the future, investing in the \nnext generation of Americans. We have seen that fall progressively down \nto the point in this budget where we are investing only 1.9 percent of \nour Federal budget in science, technology and the future. We are \ninvesting increasingly in the next election by spending money on social \nprograms, and we are not investing in the next generation by investing \nin science and technology and the future.\n  If you look at the Bumpers amendment, what it says is: Prohibit \nfunding for the space station except for program termination costs. It \nin no way lowers the annual spending caps. It in no way says these \nsavings have to be applied to deficit reduction. So as we all know, \nsince we are operating under spending caps, every penny that would \nsupposedly be saved, if we kill the space station, would end up being \nspent in other areas of the Federal budget.\n  If we did this, if we kill the space station, we would be going \nfurther in taking money away from investments in the future, in the \nscience and technology on which jobs in the future will be based and we \nwould basically be converting that money into consumption programs \nwhere we would be investing in social programs and investing in the \nnext election and not the next generation. This would be a tragic \nmistake.\n  I am confident we are not going to do it today. Our investment in \nscience and technology is already too low. I would like to have a 5-\nyear program to double investment in science and technology instead of \ncutting it as the Senator from Arkansas proposes.\n  No nation in history has benefited so much from science and \ntechnology as the United States of America. In this century we have \nbeen the principal contributor of all nations in the world to science \nand technology. And we have built a technological base that we have \nused better than any other country in the world. Our global leadership \nis threatened because we are not making the investments that we once \nmade in pure science and technology.\n  No other institution in our society is capable of building the space \nstation. If we do not make this investment, we are again saying we are \ngoing to take money out of investment in the future and we are going to \ninvest it in social programs today. That would be a mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Bumpers amendment as we have on 14 \nprevious occasions. We have already cut the space station. We have \nrefocused it. We have broadened the participation. We have taken on the \nRussians as partners. We have spread the cost of the program. We have \nmade international commitments. We have saved money by paring back on \nthe program. Now is the time to move ahead and build the space station. \nThis is not the time to cut spending for the space station to free up \nfunds to go into social programs. Let us invest in the next generation \nand not the next election by defeating the Bumpers amendment. I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I wish we had a lot more time because there \nare many things to be said. I used a lot of time yesterday and will not \nbe able to repeat all that today. Let me talk for a moment about this \nprotein crystal thing because I think there have been some \nmisconceptions put forth on the floor here. This is not something we \nare just talking about that may be out there some time in the future. \nIt is here now.\n  Private industry is working with the NASA Center for Macromolecular \nCrystallography to produce high-quality protein crystals for new \ndevelopment. Let me tell you the companies that are involved with this: \nSchering-Plough, Eli-Lilly, Upjohn, Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Smith Kline \nBeecham, Biocryst, DuPont Merck, Eastman Kodak, and Vertex. This is not \nsome time in the future they may do this. They are using them now to \nresearch cancer, diabetes, emphysema, and immune system disorders, and \nincluding the HIV virus.\n  There has been such rapid advancements in these particular areas. And \nthis protein structure that can be developed in space promises to \nrevolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. You would not have all these \ncompanies directly involved with NASA if that was not true. Researchers \nseek to define the structure of proteins and design drugs that interact \nwith them.\n  Penicillin is a well known example of a drug that works by blocking a \nprotein's function. Orbital experiments provide researchers with \nsuperior protein crystals for analysis and they also help scientists \nunderstand the fundamental concepts about the crystallization process. \nYou cannot do that on Earth. The information could be used to improve \ncrystallization techniques here on earth however.\n  Rationally designed drugs promise to revolutionize health care. \nOrbital research will feed this revolution with the crucial protein \nstructure data it needs. NASA researchers have already used--not in the \nfuture--but already have used space shuttle missions to produce protein \ncrystals for a variety of clinical conditions, including cancer, \ndiabetes, emphysema, and immune system disorders.\n  What if we broke through with something on HIV or found out from \nsomething from these protein crystal studies that space-grown crystals \nwere in such a way different that we came up with a new approach to HIV \nor something like that? We would think that was well worth anything \nthat we were looking into on the whole space program.\n  Mr. President, one other area--without getting into a lot more of \nthose details--there is one other area I wanted to mention here today. \nYou know, we have a lot of things that occur to astronauts when they \nare up there in space flight. After a few days their bodies start \nchanging. They have a lot of physiologic changes. On the floor here \nyesterday I had the book that NASA has put out on space medicine, space \nphysiology. If you look at that and then you look over into the Merck \nManual on Geriatrics you find some very similar things, you find out \nthat some of the things that occur to astronauts in space in a very \nshort period of time also occur to the elderly in the normal processes \nof aging.\n  I wish we could have those 44 million Americans today that are over \n60, those 44 million Americans listening to this. I am sure we would \nhave every single one of them supporting the space program when they \nrealize that such things as bone density changes that affect the aging \nhere on Earth also affect astronauts. Orthostatic intolerance, the \ndifference in blood pressure when standing, sitting, and so on, \ndecreases during flight and returns to normal, but it is a symptom \nassociated with aging.\n\n  Balance and vestibular problems, dizziness, the inability to maintain \ntheir balance upon returning from a flight, sleep disturbances, muscle \nstrength, immunology. The body in space reduces its immunology. Why the \nimmune system? Why, we do not really know. The elderly have the same \nthing happen. Normally, as people get older, their body's immune system \ngoes down hill. If we could just make some experiments to find out why \nthis occurs and trigger off the body's response, its own immune system \nagainst cancer and AIDS and all the other diseases and all the other \ninfections we have here on Earth, that one area alone would be worth \neverything that we are spending in this area.\n  Reduced absorption of medicine and nutrients in the stomach and gut \nevidenced during space flight and also suspected with many elderly. \nPerhaps\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nsome of the elderly do not get the nutrients, and their drugs are not \nas effective as they otherwise would be.\n  Cardiac electrical activity changes, serum glucose tolerance changes, \nreflexes change, all these things that occur to astronauts in space and \nalso occur to the elderly normally here on Earth.\n  I know I am rapidly going through these things. I wish I had time to \ngo into these things in more detail. But these are areas of research \nfor the future that I think are extremely, extremely valuable.\n  Mr. President, one thing we have not mentioned either is the \ninternational aspects of this. Isn't it nice that we are cooperating in \nspace rather than fighting each other here on Earth? I think that is an \nimportant item. And 13 nations, the United States, Canada, Italy, \nBelgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Germany, the \nUnited Kingdom, Japan, and Russia are joining together in the largest \nscientific cooperative program ever, the biggest single scientific \ncooperative program ever in the history of this country.\n  We are drawing on the history of the world. We are drawing on Russian \nexpertise and long duration space flight and existing Russian \ntechnology and equipment. And the international space station will help \nredirect the focus of Russian technology programs to nonmilitary \npursuits.\n  This service is a symbol of the opportunities available through a \npeaceful international initiative. We will have several laboratories \naboard the space station: the United States lab, one other United \nStates facility, the European space agency Columbus Orbital Facility, a \nJapanese experiment module, and three Russian research modules. Partner \nnations will contribute $9 billion to the U.S. cooperative effort. And \ninternational contributions mean international cooperation bringing \ntogether the best scientific minds worldwide to answer fundamental \nscientific questions in this new laboratory of space.\n  Mr. President, I have used on the floor before the statement by \nDaniel Webster when they were contemplating in the Senate of the United \nStates whether to provide money to buy land beyond the Mississippi. And \nhe said as follows:\n       What do we want with this vast worthless area, this region \n     of savages and wild beasts, of deserts of shifting sands and \n     whirlwinds of dust and cactus and prairie dogs? To what use \n     could we ever hope to put these great deserts or those \n     endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their \n     very base with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with \n     the western coast, a coast of 3,000 miles, rock-bound, \n     cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it? What use have \n     we for this country? Mr. President, I will never vote 1 cent \n     from the Public Treasury to place the Pacific coast 1 inch \n     nearer to Boston than it is now.\n\n  Mr. President, I use that statement again to show how myopic Daniel \nWebster's vision was, learned though he might have been. Certainly, \nthat Western half of the United States, which we were better able to \nexplore than we are going into space, took more than any 25 or 30 years \nto develop to where it was useful and bring back all the benefit of all \nof the money we had spent on it.\n  People have stood here on Earth and looked up for a hundred years, or \nseveral hundred thousand years. We have wanted to travel up there. We \nwanted to go see what it was like. Now we can use that area of space.\n  One other area. It is not only international cooperation but it is \ninspiration for our own youth in this country. I think that is an \nimportant byproduct, or important add-on to the space program that we \nsometimes ignore. It is exciting for our young people to know that we \nare leading the world in science, technology, and research. It is \nexciting enough that a lot more are going into science and math because \nof this. How do we measure those benefits? I don't know. In the future, \nif we can inspire our young people through the space program and the \ncontinuing space station, I think that pays off in benefits for the \nfuture beyond anything we can see at the outset. Just like the history \nof this country has shown, that money spent on basic research, even \nthough we can't quite see the benefits at the outset--if there is one \nthing we have learned, money spent on basic research seems to have a \nway of paying off in the future beyond anything we see at the outset. \nThis is one of the biggest research programs that the whole world has \never undertaken, and I think it has the biggest potential payoff.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have some additional information printed \nin the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Why a Space Station?\n\n       To create a permanent orbiting science institute in space \n     capable of performing long-duration research in the materials \n     and life sciences in a nearly gravity-free environment.\n       To conduct medical research in space.\n       To develop new materials and processes in industry.\n       To accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering \n     that will have immediate, practical applications for life on \n     Earth-- and will create jobs and economic opportunities today \n     and in the decades to come.\n       To maintain U.S. leadership in space and in global \n     competitiveness, and to serve as a driving force for emerging \n     technologies. To forge new partnerships with the nations of \n     the world.\n       To inspire our children, foster the next generation of \n     scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, and satisfy \n     humanity's ancient need to explore and achieve.\n       To invest for today and tomorrow. (Every dollar spent on \n     space programs returns at least $2 in direct and indirect \n     benefits.)\n       To sustain and strengthen the United States' strongest \n     export sector-aerospace technology--which in 1995 exceeded \n     $33 billion.\n\n\n                 medical research and the life sciences\n\n       The early space program and experiments conducted on the \n     Space Shuttle have made remarkable contributions to medical \n     research and the study of life on Earth.\n       The Space Station is the next step: a permanent orbiting \n     laboratory.\n       The Space Station will provide a unique environment for \n     research on the growth of protein crystals, which aid in \n     determining the structure and function of proteins. Such \n     information will greatly enhance drug design and research in \n     the treatment of diseases. Crystals already grown on the \n     Space Shuttle for research into cancer, diabetes, emphysema, \n     parasitic infections, and immune system disorders are far \n     superior to crystals grown on Earth.\n       The almost complete absence of gravity on the Space Station \n     will allow new insights into human health and disease \n     prevention and treatment, including heart, lung, and kidney \n     function, cardiovascular disease, osteoporois (bone calcium \n     loss), hormonal disorders, and immune system function.\n       Space Station research will build on the proven medical \n     research already conducted on the Space Shuttle. The Space \n     Station will enable long-term research with multiple subjects \n     among the six-member crews.\n       Research equipment developed for the Space Station is \n     already paying dividends on the ground. Scientists are \n     growing ovarian tumor samples in NASA's new cell-culturing \n     device so that tumors can be studied outside the body, \n     without harm to the patient. A similar trial is under way for \n     brain tumors.\n       Medical equipment technology and miniaturization techniques \n     developed for the early astronauts are still paying off \n     today, 30 years later. For example:\n       NASA has developed a ``cool suit'' for the Apollo missions, \n     which is now helping to improve the quality of life of \n     multiple sclerosis patients.\n       NASA technology has produced a pacemaker that can be \n     programmed from outside the body.\n       NASA has developed instruments to measure bone loss and \n     bone density, without penetrating the skin, that are now \n     being used by hospitals.\n       NASA research has led to an implant for delivering insulin \n     to diabetics that is only 3 inches across; it provides more \n     precise control of blood sugar levels and frees diabetics \n     from the burden of daily insulin injections.\n\n\n               Technology and Engineering for the Future\n\n       The race to the Moon required great advances in engineering \n     and technology that still fuel our economy today. The Space \n     Station will be a testbed for the technologies of the future, \n     as well as a laboratory for research on new, high-technology \n     industrial materials.\n       Experimental research in the near absence of gravity \n     produces new insights into industrial processes in materials \n     that cannot be replicated on Earth, including an increased \n     understanding of fluid physics and combustion. Space Shuttle \n     experiments that study metal alloy solidification in space \n     could lead to making lighter, stronger superalloys. A better \n     understanding of the combustion process can lead to energy \n     conservation on Earth. A 2-percent increase in burner \n     efficiency for heaters would save the United States $8 \n     billion per year.\n       The Space Station will be an industrial research and \n     development laboratory to test lower-cost heating and cooling \n     systems, long-life power converters, safer chemical storage \n     and transfer processes, air and water purification, waste \n     management, and recycling systems.\n       Telerobotic and robotic systems validated on the Space \n     Station will increase human efficiency in space and result in \n     reliable, low-maintenance robots for industry and commercial \n     purposes on Earth.\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\n       Research on large space vehicles will lead to improved \n     computer software for developing new, lightweight structures, \n     such as antennae and solar collectors with precision-pointing \n     accuracy. Such developments will greatly benefit the \n     communications, utility, and transportation industries.\n       As with the Apollo program before it, the Space Station \n     will be a proving ground for advances in communications, \n     computers, and systems integration. The International Space \n     Station program will use telepresence, telescience, expert \n     systems, and the integration of communications and data on an \n     unparalleled scale.\n       Space Station facilities with the near absence of gravity \n     will permit researchers to study materials that could not \n     exist and processes that could not take place in full Earth \n     gravity. These materials include polymers for everything from \n     paint to contact lenses, semiconductors for high-speed \n     computers and electronics, and high-temperature \n     superconductors for efficiency in electrical devices.\n\n\n                   A New Era of Peaceful Cooperation\n\n       As the world redefines itself in the wake of the Cold War, \n     the Space Station is a catalyst for international cooperation \n     and a powerful symbol of U.S. leadership in a changing world. \n     The Space Station:\n       Continues the largest scientific cooperative program in \n     history, drawing on the resources and scientific expertise of \n     13 nations: the United States, Canada, Italy, Belgium, \n     Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Spain, Germany, the \n     United Kingdom, Japan, and Russia.\n       Will channel the aerospace industry of Russia and other \n     countries into non-military pursuits to reduce the risk of \n     nuclear proliferation and slow the traffic of high-technology \n     weaponry to developing nations.\n       Will provide international commercial opportunities for \n     U.S. companies.\n       Uses existing Russian space technology, capability, \n     expertise, and hardware to build a better Space Station more \n     quickly and cost-effectively.\n       Taps into the Russians' vast experience in long-duration \n     spaceflight to benefit the international partnership.\n       Serves as a symbol of the power of nations to work together \n     on peaceful initiatives and serves as a test case for \n     building mutual trust and shared goals.\n       Demonstrates that former adversaries can join forces in a \n     peaceful pursuit at a fraction of the cost of the arms \n     buildup during the Cold War era.\n       Provides a means to influence policies beyond space \n     cooperation, such as giving Russia and the other countries of \n     the former Soviet Union a greater interest in broader U.S. \n     policy initiatives.\n       Draws significant financial support from the partner \n     nations, which will collectively add more than $9 billion to \n     the U.S. contribution. The partners from the European Space \n     Agency, Canada, and Japan have already expended more than $5 \n     billion on their development programs.\n\n\n                inspiration and investment in the future\n\n       The Space Station will inspire a new generation of \n     Americans to explore and achieve, while pioneering new \n     methods of education to teach and motivate the next \n     generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and \n     explorers.\n       Space science is a catalyst for academic achievement. \n     Enrollment trends of U.S. college students majoring in \n     science and engineering track closely with the funding trends \n     of the U.S. space program.\n       NASA is a leader in the development of virtual reality and \n     telepresence technologies, giving students the same benefits \n     they would get from actual presence on the Space Station and \n     interaction with real astronauts.\n       Astronauts and cosmonauts serve as role models, capturing \n     the imagination of future leaders and encouraging more \n     students to study science and engineering.\n       In addition to lessons from space, students of the future \n     will have experiments on the Space Station and will conduct \n     them from their classrooms on the ground. Students will \n     transmit and receive data, manipulate equipment remotely, and \n     evaluate the experiments through data interpretation.\n       With the new international focus, students will absorb \n     broad lessons in the value of cooperation as we work with \n     partners in Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada.\n       Teachers and communities across the nation are already \n     using Space Station concepts in the classroom. NASA receives \n     unsolicited drawings and models of the Space Station by \n     students of all ages. Communities and states conduct ``Space \n     Week,'' during which students live in a bus outfitted as a \n     Space Station.\n\n\n                      design, management, and cost\n\n       Independent external review teams have confirmed that the \n     management structure of the International Space Station \n     program has been greatly improved. Now the Space Station will \n     have more laboratory space, more electric power, and a larger \n     crew. It will cost $5 billion less than the cost projected \n     for Space Station Freedom. Greater international \n     participation will be present.\n       Dr. Charles M. Vest, chair of an independent review \n     committee and President of MIT, stated: ``NASA has performed \n     a remarkable management turnaround.''\n       Instead of four NASA offices overseeing four prime \n     contractors, the Space Station program is now managed by a \n     single NASA office through a single prime contractor, the \n     Boeing Company, which is known for its innovative management.\n       This program is affordable. The Space Station constitutes \n     only \\1/7\\ of 1 percent of the federal budget and less than \n     15 percent of the total NASA budget. It will cost each \n     American $9 a year--about the same as a night at the movies.\n       NASA has met all of its external and internal deadlines in \n     redesigning the Space Station.\n       Fully 75 percent of Space Station Freedom's elements will \n     be used on the International Space Station.\n       The Space Station program has successfully managed its $2.1 \n     billion average annual expenditure since redesign. The \n     program's budget is $11 billion from the present through \n     completion in 2002, for a total of $17.4 billion.\n       Our international partners have endorsed the design of the \n     International Space Station and the new management structure. \n     Their commitments will total more than $9 billion on the \n     Space Station, of which more than $5 billion has already been \n     expended or placed on contract.\n\n\n                facts on life and microgravity research\n\n     Statistics\n       There were 627 total lead investigators in 1995.\n       Investigators represent more than 100 institutions of \n     higher learning and more than 40 laboratories and other \n     institutions in 40 states and the District of Columbia.\n       More than 900 graduate students were supported through NASA \n     research in 1995.\n       Life and microgravity researchers published more than 1,000 \n     journal articles in 1995.\n       There were more than 1,000 new research proposals received \n     in 1995.\n     Background\n       Life and microgravity science research is solicited through \n     an open, highly competitive, peer-review process to ensure \n     that the most meritorious science gains access to orbit.\n       Historically, NASA's resources have allowed the agency to \n     accept only about the top fifth of the proposals it receives \n     for life and microgravity research. This level of selectivity \n     is comparable to that of other major U.S. science funding \n     sources, such as the National Institutes of Health and the \n     National Science Foundation. Only 10 to 20 percent of these \n     accepted proposals lead to flight experiments, so selection \n     for flight is even more competitive.\n       Because of the great demand for limited orbital research \n     opportunities, NASA selects research for flight opportunities \n     only if it cannot be conducted on Earth. Flight research is \n     selected from and supported by a larger research effort on \n     the ground.\n       NASA is fully committed to its close working relationship \n     with the scientific community and to full access to NASA \n     facilities for the most meritorious scientific research. NASA \n     works with the scientific community through its advisory \n     committees and subcommittees, the National Research Council, \n     and working groups of distinguished scientists.\n\n\n           facts on insperation and investment in the future\n\n     Astronauts\n       Astronauts make thousands of appearances each year all over \n     the world.\n       Eighteen percent of the active members of the astronaut \n     corps are women.\n       Col.

Mr. President, I wish we had several more hours to discuss \nthis. I hope my colleagues will take time to look at the more complete \nstatement I had in the Record yesterday because it went into a lot of \nthese areas in greater detail.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 55 minutes. The \nSenator from Missouri has 15 minutes. The Senator from Maryland has 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I invite my colleague from Arkansas, since \nwe are about out of time, to utilize what time he wishes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have listened to the speakers who \noppose this amendment. I have listened very carefully. I have not heard \nanybody make any claims of any beneficial research, mechanical, \nmedical, physical, or any other successful research being accomplished \nby the Russians and the former Soviet Union after 25 years in space. \nThat is right. The Russians have had a space station orbiting the Earth \nfor 25 years. The only reason in God's world we are putting one up \nthere is because they have one. If you don't like that explanation, \nthere is another one that is probably about as good, which is to figure \nout how we are going to get to Mars, because it is going to take at \nleast 24 months to get there and back, and we want to know, can man \nsurvive that long in space. If you want that to be the justification \nfor the space station, for Pete's sake, be honest about it and let us \ndebate that. Carl Sagan is not rhapsodic about all these arguments \nabout curing cancer, but he is about the exploration of space. Even \nDaniel Goldin said that we not only need to go to Mars, we need to have \nan outpost there on a permanent basis. He as much as said that is the \nreason for the space station. If you want to buy that as a rationale \nfor building a space station, I won't vote for it because we don't have \nthe money. Bear in mind that every dime you put into this space station \nis borrowed money.\n  Now, just as soon as we get through with this debate and I lose and \nwe continue inexorably, irreversibly toward spending $94 billion we \ndon't have, the same people will come over and you hear all these \npompous speeches about balancing the budget. Senator Hutchison, a \nmoment ago, talked about all the magnificent accomplishments so far of \nthe space program. One was a remotely programmable heart pacemaker. And \nshe mentioned other products and inventions. But I say to Senator \nHutchison, those things could have been accomplished for peanuts right \nhere on Earth. You don't have to go into space to develop a remotely \nprogrammable heart pacemaker. I also say that those things were \ndiscovered and developed by NASA, not the space station. The space \nstation had absolutely zilch to do with those accomplishments.\n  If you want to do research in the space program on the shuttle, \nthat's fine. I talked earlier about how many times I had gotten teary-\neyed watching the shuttle take off. I want you to know that once I got \ninvolved in the space program--and I went on the space committee when I \nfirst came here and, believe you me, it was a spacey committee--I quit \nshedding tears when I found out it cost $400 million to send one of \nthose things up. Think of that--$400 million. My good friend, Senator \nGlenn, said that I misspoke when I said we had only built\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n17 percent of the hardware of the space station. He suggested we had \ndone 45 percent. Let me clarify that. We have built 165,000 pounds of \nthe station's total 950,000 pounds of hardware. That is about 17 \npercent. However, NASA says Boeing has accomplished 45 percent of the \nprime contract. But of the $17 billion the space station is going to \ncost in the bill, the prime contract is now only $6 billion of it. It \nis true, we have done 45 percent of the prime contract, but we have \nactually only built 17 percent space station's hardware. And we are, \naccording to the General Accounting Office, using up those reserves he \ntalked about at a much faster pace than the program can sustain. I \nmight also point out that Boeing is indeed at least 4 months behind, \nand the Russians are 6 to 8 months behind, and the press is reporting \nthat the space station is already $500 million over its construction \nbudget--$500 million.\n  If you ask any Senator how he would like to have $500 million for \nsome of his favorite programs, he will start salivating.\n  I have not heard one single claim that one single case of influenza \nhas been cured by anything we found in space. I have not heard one \nsingle claim anyone plans to commercially grow gallium arsenide \ncrystals in space. They can be made there but nobody argues that you \ncan do it economically. On the contrary, everybody says it is totally \nuneconomical. It is always what we are going to do. We have been at \nthis business 35 years headed for a $94 billion project, and we are \nsaying look what we are going to do.\n  Look at this chart. The cost is all broken down for you neat as a \npin; $94 billion. I can hardly wait for us to get through with this so \nwe can listen to all of the speeches about balancing the budget again.\n  Where is the cost going? We have already spent $18 billion since \nRonald Reagan made that famous speech about how we are going to build \nthis whole thing for $8 billion. We have spent $18 billion since then--\n$10 billion more than President Reagan suggested. That is just for \nbuilding the station. That does not include the $51 billion we are \ngoing to spend on shuttle launches to keep the space station supplied \nwith water, food, and whatever else they may need for 10 years, which \nis supposed to be the life of the space station. So it is all right \nthere--shuttle launches, construction, operations, and $1 billion in \nadditional costs. You still have $76 billion to spend. You can vote \n``aye'' on this amendment and save the taxpayers of this country $76 \nbillion. Give it to the National Institutes of Health and you might \ncure cancer. You might make a greater impact on AIDS, arthritis, and a \nhost of other diseases which make life miserable for so many millions \nof people. You are not going to accomplish anything by putting it into \nthe space station except maybe a good, warm, fuzzy glow occasionally.\n  This whole thing, $94 billion, works out to a total cost of $25 \nmillion for each day the space station will be in operation. You think \nof that. This thing is going to cost $25 million a day every 24 hours. \nWhat is it worth in gold? Twenty-five times its weight in gold. Isn't \nthat something? You think about something costing 25 times its weight \nin gold for no tangible benefit.\n  Jobs--each job on this thing of the 15,000 jobs costs $140,000. I can \ntell you one thing. If I were from Texas, Alabama, or California, I \nwould probably be on the other side of this issue. If I had 15,000 \njobs, or any portion of those 15,000 jobs at $140,000 apiece, I would \nprobably think the space station was the greatest thing since sliced \nbread.\n  It is going to cost us $12,880 to transport one pound of water or \nbread or anything else to the space station. Each astronaut is going to \nuse how many pounds of water a day? They are allocated for all purposes \nI believe 9.5 liters per day. It all comes to $319,000 a day I believe \nfor each astronaut, just for bottled water. That is $1.9 million in \nwater per day for a crew of six astronauts.\n  Mr. President, I want to read a portion of a letter which I consider \nto be extremely important in this debate. The testimony by Prof. Robert \nL. Park before the Commerce Committee, the Subcommittee on Science, \nTechnology, and Space, which he delivered on July 1, 1993. I am not \ngoing to attempt to read the whole letter. But I am going to read the \nsalient parts of it. I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to \nthis.\n  Dr. Park represents the American Physical Society with 40,000 \nphysicists including astrophysicists. About the only physicists who \nsupport the space station are the ones that are on NASA's payroll. Here \nis what Dr. Park said:\n\n       It is the view of the American Physical Society that \n     scientific justification is lacking for a permanent manned \n     space station in Earth orbit. We are concerned that the \n     potential contribution of a manned space station to the \n     physical sciences has been greatly overstated, and many of \n     the scientific objectives currently planned for the space \n     station could be accomplished more effectively and at a \n     much lower cost on Earth by unmanned robotic platforms, or \n     the Shuttle.\n\n  You have two groups of experts on the space station. You have \nphysicists and you have medical science. Here is what the physicists \nsay. He goes on to say:\n\n       The only unique property of a space station environment is \n     microgravity. It is not surprising, therefore, that much has \n     been made of this environment in attempts to sell the space \n     station, but many years of research on shuttle flights and in \n     continuous operation of the Russian space station Mir have \n     produced absolutely no evidence that this environment offers \n     any advantage for processing materials or drugs. Indeed, \n     there are sound reasons for doubting that it could. \n     Gravitational forces are simply too weak to significantly \n     affect most processes.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       A possible exception was thought to be the growth of \n     molecular crystals, specifically protein crystals. In \n     November, however, a team of the Americans that collaborated \n     in protein crystal growth experiments on Mir and on the U.S. \n     space shuttle reporting in Nature magazine that 10 years of \n     work at stupendous cost has produced no significant \n     breakthrough in protein crystal growth. Microgravity has no \n     effect on crystallization of most proteins, they report, and, \n     if it does, crystals are as likely to be worse as better. No \n     protein has been observed to crystallize in microgravity that \n     does not crystallize on Earth.\n\n  In short, you can do it on Earth. You do not have to spend $100 \nbillion to go into space.\n  He goes on to say, in quoting Dr. Blumberg at Harvard, a Nobel \nlaureate and physicist, and he summed it up bluntly in testimony before \na Senate committee. Microgravity, he says, is of ``microimportance.''\n  Then he goes on to the spinoff, what you are going to get out of the \nspinoff. ``It is both false and demeaning for NASA to claim''--listen \nto this. He says:\n\n       It is both false and demeaning for NASA to claim that \n     products, from magnetic resonance imaging to synthetic pig \n     teats, are spinoffs of the space program. Any program that \n     spends $15 billion per year is bound to produce something \n     that society can use, but few of NASA's claims stand up. \n     Indeed, an internal NASA study of technology transfer \n     which became public in January acknowledged that NASA's \n     spinoff claims were exaggerated, including such famous \n     examples as Velcro, Tang and Teflon. Contrary to popular \n     belief, the study found NASA created none of these.\n\n  I have heard that old Teflon, Velcro, Tang argument for 5 years. NASA \nhad nothing to do with it except publicize it.\n  Let me just close this segment by saying the opportunities for saving \nmoney are very limited around here. This year, the deficit is going to \nbe $116 billion. If Bill Clinton had not acted when he did in 1993, it \nwould be $290 billion this year. I do not care whether you like Bill \nClinton or not. A lot of people here do not. But he did something that \nwas very unpopular in 1993--he raised taxes. But he raised taxes on the \nwealthiest 1.2 percent of the people of this country; 28 million people \nactually got their taxes lowered. But we are today looking at the most \ndramatic reduction in the deficit any of us ever dreamed would happen. \nIt is a gratifying thing to see that deficit reduced so dramatically \nover a 4-year period. But I can tell you, while that was not easy, it \nis easy compared to how you are going to find that other $116 billion \ntoward a balanced budget. You are not going to balance the budget by \nspending this $76 billion. You keep spending money like this and all \nyou can do is make those great speeches about balancing the budget but \nyou will never balance it. You may convince the chamber of commerce \nback home that your heart is in a balanced budget, but you just cannot \nfind it in your heart to vote for the things that bring about a \nbalanced budget.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to show the kind of spine and spunk \nthat\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nyour constituents have a right to expect of you. Oh, it is an easy \nvote; 99 percent of the people in this country really do not care \nwhether you vote ``aye'' or ``nay'' on this. That is the reason you \ncannot win it. That is the reason I have not won it in 5 years; it is \ntoo easy to vote ``aye.''\n  So, as I said, I have no illusions about what the vote is going to \nbe, but I am just like the turtle. A man was riding the turtle across \nthe creek. The turtle got out in the middle of the creek and he went \nunder after he promised he would not. And the man who was on the \nturtle's back said, ``You promised me you wouldn't do that. Why on \nEarth did you do it?'' And the old turtle said, ``I guess it is just my \nnature.'' That is the way it is around here. It is just our nature to \nvote for big spending projects like this and make speeches about \nbalancing the budget.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas. I \nunderstand that there may not be additional speakers on his side. Is \nthat correct? We have, I believe, under my control only about 15 \nminutes left. There are five people who have asked for that 15 minutes, \nincluding myself, Senator Bennett, Senator Shelby, Senator Heflin, and \nSenator Burns. I urge those who want to share in that largess to come \njoin us very quickly because we may--and I want to put all Senators on \nnotice--be able to go to a vote earlier than 10 minutes of 6.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may say to the Senator from \nMissouri, I recognize I have been in that position too many times when \nSenators want to speak but do not come to the floor. But in the \ninterest of accommodating him, if the Senator would like to put in a \nquorum call without the time being charged to either side, that would \nbe satisfactory until the speakers get here.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, as much as we wish to \naccommodate speakers, we also have to accommodate the leadership, which \nwants us to move forward on the bill. We do have a Senator who is ready \nto go, and I am pleased to allocate 3 minutes to the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.\n  I will not give all the arguments for the space station. I have given \nthem in times past and Congresses past in debate with my friend from \nArkansas. He says it is his nature to bring it up. It is my nature to \nbe for it. I will, however, return to a previous quote that I have used \nin past debates that I think summarizes why it is we go ahead with it. \nSamuel Eliot Morison, the great historian, wrote this about this \ncountry. He said:\n\n       America was discovered accidentally by a great seaman who \n     was looking for something else. When discovered, it was not \n     wanted and most of the exploration for the next 50 years was \n     done in the name of getting through or around it. America was \n     named after a man who discovered no part of it. History is \n     like that, very chancy.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why we are going into space. No, we do not \nknow with exactness what we are going to find. We cannot predict it any \nmore than the people who discovered this continent from the European \nside could predict what would happen, and indeed what we find there may \nnot be wanted just as this country was not wanted for a long period of \ntime. But I will share with the Senate this experience.\n  Every year, I sponsor in the State of Utah an activity called Space \nTalk, where we get together and talk about space and what can be done \nin space and what the prospects of space are. Last year, as part of \nSpace Talk, NASA agreed to allow the shuttle on its way from Cape \nCanaveral to Edwards Air Force Base to stop in Salt Lake City to refuel \nand stay overnight. As it turned out, the 747 carrying the shuttle \nbanked in over the Salt Lake Valley just about at the end of the day, \njust about at sunset it came over. There were approximately 100,000 \npeople who stopped in their cars on the freeway, who came out of their \nhouses and stood in their front yards and who waved and acknowledged \nthat as it made a pass down the valley, then turned, came back in low \nover the valley and finally landing at the Salt Lake airport. I still \nhave people who will come up to me on the street corner literally with \ntears in their eyes and say, ``Senator, that was one of the most \nemotional experiences of my life. How proud I am to be an American,'' \ndemonstrating their support for the space program. America has not lost \nthe sense of exploration that it had all the way back to Columbus' \ntime, and we should not lose it again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and ask that I be \nnotified when that 3 minutes has expired.\n  I do wish to urge my colleagues who had wanted time to come over, \nthose in support. The time is running out.\n  I did want to answer the legitimate question asked by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas: What do you expect to get out of this? What good is \ngoing to come from it?\n  Just a small sample, Mr. President. The National Depressive and \nManic-Depressive Association in a letter of July 27, 1995, to \nAdministrator Goldin, the executive director, expresses ``our support \nfor the human brain and neurological research that is part of NASA's \ninternational space station program.''\n  We have a similar letter from the Multiple Sclerosis Association of \nAmerica, saying:\n\n       We are especially optimistic about a project on the station \n     called Neurolab, dedicated to neurological research. This \n     research could be essential to MS patients. Because MS is a \n     neurological disease, the more we know about the brain, the \n     closer we are to understanding and overcoming this illness.\n\n  The American Medical Women's Association has written that:\n\n       The space station will provide important research \n     opportunities in the following areas:\n       Diseases predominantly affecting women, including breast, \n     ovarian and cervical cancers and endometriosis;\n       Diseases more prevalent in women, such as osteoporosis, \n     diabetes and other autoimmune diseases;\n       Areas in which women are particularly vulnerable, such as \n     biological rhythms, cyclic hormonal changes and balance \n     disorders . . ..\n\n  I ask unanimous consent all these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Planetary Society,\n\n                                                    July 24, 1995.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Rep. Gingrich: In the past few weeks you have received \n     mail and calls from some of your constituents who are among \n     the over 100,000 members of The Planetary Society. We are \n     urging you to support the President's proposed budget for \n     NASA. Although that budget calls for significant cuts--about \n     four percent per year for the rest of the decade--it \n     preserves important NASA missions and programs to explore \n     other worlds and to understand our own.\n       This week, the House will vote on the NASA Appropriation as \n     part of the HUD-VA-Independent Agencies bill. There will an \n     amendment offered to cancel the space station. We oppose that \n     amendment.\n       The Appropriations bill gives NASA $600 million less in FY \n     1996 than in the President's proposed budget. We believe that \n     cut, on top of the Administration reductions, is too deep and \n     threatens the vitality of the American enterprise in space.\n       The recent shuttle-Mir success; the stirring results from \n     the Hubble Space Telescope; and the new cheaper, faster, \n     better missions of Mars Surveyor, Discovery and New \n     Millennium bode well for the future. The great interest in \n     the movie Apollo 13 is a reminder of how much these successes \n     mean to the American public, and how important the NASA \n     ``can-do'' philosophy is to our nation.\n       The building of the space station is an important global \n     effort. It is the largest and greatest international \n     engineering project in history. Many European nations, Japan, \n     Russia, and Ukraine have investments commensurate with that \n     of the United States. The international space station, like \n     Project Apollo, is serving a greater national interest \n     besides that of space development. Like Apollo, it is playing \n     on a world stage.\n       Several years ago, Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis \n     Freidman--the officers of The Planetary Society--testified to \n     Congress with a statement called ``A Space Station Worth the \n     Cost.'' We opposed the then-space station plan as serving no \n     national purpose, as being unrealistic and counter-productive \n     in its budgeting, and as not contributing to the goals of \n     human exploration beyond Earth orbit.\n       Those defects have now been remedied. The present plan is \n     working on a fixed budget with meaningful cost-savings from \n     Russia's participation. It is serving national and \n     international interests. And, in perhaps the\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\n     biggest difference from the previous plan, it has put \n     Americans back in space, making progress toward understanding \n     the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight. Norm \n     Thagard just broke the American endurance record in space--\n     five years earlier than anyone would have under the previous \n     space station plan.\n       For Congress to cancel the space station now would cause \n     huge disruptions in many local and regional economies, and \n     worse yet, it would scar our national psyche. It would end \n     the rationale for America's manned space program, and with it \n     would die some of the spirit of a great nation bold enough to \n     seek great achievements.\n       We ask your support now for the entire NASA program; Manned \n     Spaceflight, Science, Mission to Planet Earth, Technology and \n     Aeronautics. All have been cut this year as well as in the \n     past several years. There is a delicate balance among them \n     now, important to preserving each enterprise, and important \n     to preserving the whole.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Sagan.\n     Louis Friedman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Multiple Sclerosis\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                                    June 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert S. Walker,\n     Chairman, House Subcommittee on Science, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Walker: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) to express \n     our support for the International Space Station and the \n     medical research that is an integral part of the project. \n     MSAA is a national organization in its 25th year of service \n     in improving the lives of the 300,000 people diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and an \n     additional 200,000 as yet not diagnosed.\n       The MSAA is hopeful, as new findings continue to emerge \n     from space-based research and the possibilities that the \n     International Space Station holds. We are especially \n     optimistic about a project on the station called Neurolab, \n     dedicated to neurological research. This research could be \n     essential to MS patients. Because MS is a neurological \n     disease, the more we know about the brain, the closer we are \n     to understanding and overcoming this illness.\n       The MS community has benefited from NASA technology to date \n     by utilizing microclimate cooling systems to control MS \n     patients' exacerbations, which are brought on or worsened by \n     heat. Controlling body temperature is crucial to MS patients' \n     health since overheating can cause painful and debilitating \n     symptoms. The MSAA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding \n     (MOU) with NASA to provide information on liquid cooled \n     garments (``cool suits'') as well as helping to make the \n     present technology widely available to patients and utilizing \n     other spinoff technology.\n       The MSAA urges Congress to appropriate funding for this \n     important research project. NASA's ``cool suit'' literally \n     has changed the lives of some of those suffering from MS. If \n     space-based research continues, perhaps MS patients will have \n     more options and more information in understanding this \n     elusive and incurable disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John G. Hodson, Sr.,\n     President and Chairman of the Board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    National Depressive and Manic-\n\n\n                                       Depressive Association,\n\n                                                    July 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel S. Goldin,\n     Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Goldin: On behalf of the 275 chapters of \n     the National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Association \n     (National DMDA), I want to express to you our support for the \n     human brain and neurological research that is part of NASA's \n     International Space Station program. As an organization \n     representing patients affected with depressive disorders, we \n     are strong advocates for improving treatments for diseases of \n     the brain.\n       Founded in 1986, by and for patients and their families, \n     National DMDA's mission is to educate patients, families, \n     professionals, and the public about the nature of depressive \n     (unipolar) and manic-depressive (bi-polar) illness as medical \n     disease. As the only illness-specific, patient-run \n     organization in the nation, National DMDA seeks to foster \n     self-help for patients and families, eliminate discrimination \n     and stigma, improve access to care and advocate for research \n     toward the elimination of these illnesses.\n       We believe the International Space Station will augment and \n     complement ground-based brain research and add to the \n     nation's arsenal of research facilities. NASA's cooperative \n     agreements with the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) \n     National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and National \n     Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stoke (NINDS) ensure \n     that human brain research efforts are carefully coordinated \n     and contribute to significant progress in the understanding \n     and treatments of brain and neurological disorders. We are \n     also encouraged by the potential for medical breakthroughs \n     offered by NASA's Neurolab, which involves six Institutes of \n     the NIH and several nations in joint spaceflight research \n     ventures dedicated to research in neurological and behavioral \n     sciences.\n       The Space Station program and related cooperative \n     agreements with NIH are providing needed medical research \n     into brain disorders that will improve the quality of life \n     for millions of Americans. Therefore, we support full and \n     continued funding of the human brain research programs of \n     NASA's International Space Station.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Susan Dime-Meenan,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  American Medical\n\n\n                                          Women's Association,\n\n                                                    June 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Linda Smith,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congresswoman Smith: The American Medical Women's \n     Association (AMWA), a professional organization of 13,000 \n     women physicians, has been committed to improving the state \n     of women's health for 80 years. Of primary concern to AMWA is \n     the need for increased research in women's health. As such, \n     AMWA supports the continuation of funding for NASA's \n     International Space Station because it provides one of the \n     most promising new visions for medical research on diseases \n     that strike women and have unknown causes or cures.\n       Traditional research approaches have not been sufficient to \n     unravel the complex mechanisms underlying diseases that \n     afflict millions of women. The microgravity environment of \n     space allows researchers to carry out experiments that cannot \n     be performed on earth, potentially loading to medical \n     breakthroughs. The Space Station will provide important \n     research opportunities in the following areas: diseases \n     predominantly affecting women, including breast, ovarian and \n     cervical cancers and endometriosis; diseases more prevalent \n     in women, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and other autoimmune \n     diseases; area in which women are particularly vulnerable, \n     such as biological rhythms, cyclic hormonal changes and \n     balance disorders; diseases with different risk factors or \n     interventions for women, such as cardiovascular disease, \n     blood pressure control, lung cancer and AIDS.\n       NASA research has already benefitted women's health \n     research. Since 1992, NASA entered into 18 different \n     cooperative agreements with the National Institutes of Health \n     to ensure that NASA biomedical research activities contribute \n     to significant progress in the understanding and treatment of \n     diseases and other medical conditions that affect women.\n       NASA is also a model for the inclusion of women in medical \n     research, having performed and supported research related to \n     the physiological function of healthy women (25 percent of \n     NASA astronauts are women). This has included research in \n     cardiovascular, neurological, endocrinological and \n     musculoskeletal function; in biological rhythms, in behavior \n     and performance; and in the effects of exercise and \n     inactivities. These studies together represent a valuable and \n     perhaps unique data base on the physiology of healthy women.\n       AMWA strongly urges Congress to consider the important \n     biological research benefits of longer duration space-based \n     research and maintain full funding of the International Space \n     Station.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Dianna L. Dell, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I just conclude these brief remarks by saying that Carl \nSagan who, in the past, along with the Planetary Society, raised great \nquestions about the space station serving no national purpose has, now, \nwritten saying that the defects in the space program ``have been \nremedied'' and it is meaningful. ``We ask your support now for the \nentire NASA program.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Heflin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers \namendment. I have supported the space station from the very beginning. \nIn fact, I made a speech and have been told by people at NASA that I \nwas the first Senator to call for the building of the space station, \nmore than 15 years ago.\n  I think the space station is coming along in an excellent manner. I \nhappen to have had the opportunity to visit Boeing during the recess \nand saw the progress that is being made on the space station. It is up \nto schedule and is moving in a manner that will mean it will be \nlaunched on time and it will move forward in a proper manner.\n  The space station has many benefits for mankind. People sometimes \nquestion the byproducts that have occurred as a result of the space \nprogram. There are many, many byproducts that have\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\ncome about as a result of the space program. Many of them were not \nanticipated, but they developed as you develop the program for the \nspace station. For example, digital watches came out of the space \nprogram.\n  I happen to be sort of a walking example of the various benefits that \nthe space program has provided in the field of medical services. I have \na pacemaker. The pacemaker idea came as a result of activities involved \nin the space station.\n  I also have what is known as a stent. A stent is sort of a metal pipe \nthat is placed in my coronary artery, that holds open an area that \nbecame occluded. Therefore, this program with the idea of having a \nstent originated out of the space program, in regard to the use of \nmetal and how metal could tie into tissue. So I am sort of a walking \nexample of what the space program has done. There are many other \nbenefits that have occurred as a result of the space program. There are \nvolumes, actually, that have been developed, outlining the various \nprograms.\n  So, I am fully supportive of the space program and of the space \nstation. I think there are several things that are very important. \nSenator Glenn has gone into this in detail. But the crystallography, by \nwhich you grow crystals in microgravity, has been exceptionally \nbeneficial to working toward finding a cure for disease. There is \nanother program known as the electrophoresis program, which is the \nability to separate a cell down to the smallest integral parts. To be \nable to someday use the ability to grow crystals and to grow cells to a \nmuch higher degree than they exist on Earth in microgravity, and then \nuse the process of electrophoresis to separate those cells, into the \nsmallest integral parts, has a great potential relative to finding \ncures for diseases.\n  So I am fully supportive of this.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I rise today in firm opposition to the \namendment before us which seeks to terminate funding for the \ninternational space station. I have been, and will continue to be, a \nstrong and vocal supporter of the international space station. I first \nrose on this floor over 15 years ago as one of the first proponents of \na manned laboratory in space. I share with many in this Nation and this \nCongress a vision of maintaining and expanding the human experience in \nspace. The space station is an investment in the future, an investment \nfully consistent with NASA's mission. The first words appearing in the \n1958 act which created NASA state that the ``Congress declares it is \nthe policy of the United States that activities in space should be \ndevoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.'' This \nproject, more so than many others, is true to that charter.\n  The space station is the largest international peacetime cooperative \neffort ever undertaken. It will provide a platform for scientific \nresearch which could never be duplicated in any laboratory on the \nground. The rhetoric surrounding this celebrated program seems to have \ntaken on a life of its own. Old complaints, long since recognized and \naddressed, resurfaced with every budget debate. From the moment \nPresident Reagan proposed the space station in 1984, however, the \nproject has been engulfed in controversy. Skeptics are not shy about \ndecrying the space station as a flagrant misuse of tax dollars in a \ntime of fiscal restraint. Social critics have argued that the money \nwould be better spent at home, shoring up fractured urban areas and \ninvesting in better schools.\n  Congress has repeatedly voted by substantial bipartisan margins to \ncontinue our space exploration projects. But in a time of tight \nbudgets, more attempts to kill sound investments in our future are \nexpected. It seems to me, however, that we cannot back away from a \nstrong investment in public interest and research, any more so than \nparents can decide not to fund their children's college education just \nbecause they might still have a mortgage on their home or a large \nbalance on their credit card accounts. At the same time, we cannot \nignore our fiscal dilemma. I have long been in the forefront of efforts \nto inject responsibility and discipline into the Federal budget \nprocess. Any public investment must be cost effective. I believe it is \ntime to review the results of efforts to date and recognize the \nbenefits of the project.\n  The vision of the Congress was to construct in orbit a permanently-\nmanned space station. The purpose of the project was to exploit and \nenhance the technological superiority of our scientific, engineering, \nand aerospace industries. While much of the hard science and technology \nnecessary to construct such a facility did exist, the scope of the \nproject extended into hundreds of areas where the existing technology \nand knowledge base were not fully developed.\n  The need to create an environment in space which would support a \npermanent manned presence led us through years of life sciences \nexperiments which have added to our understanding of the human body and \nproduced countless biomedical breakthroughs which are saving or \nimproving the quality of life for people everywhere. I have personally \nbenefited from one such technology breakthrough when I have experienced \nheart problems in the recent past. The technique used to treat my \ncondition came from the space station's life sciences developments. Our \ndefense systems have also benefited from space exploration. Composite \nmaterials needed to endure the harsh environment of space have enhanced \nour competitive advantage in the engineering and aerospace industries.\n\n  Our international relations were enhanced and our construction and \noperations costs were reduced when we extended participation in this \nproject to our international partners in Europe, Canada, and Japan. \nEach makes a contribution to the overall design in return for access to \nthe completed station. And an unprecedented cooperative effort was \nforged when we extended our hand in friendship to the Russian people to \njoin in this truly international space station.\n  Over the last few years, an enormous number of technological, \norganizational, and managerial difficulties have been resolved. A \ndiffused and decentralized program structure suitable to the early \ndesign stages has been replaced by a lean, integrated, and responsive \nmanagement structure where communication and accountability are clear. \nA single host center and a single prime contractor now coordinate and \nintegrate the hardware which support the program.\n  Just a few days ago, the first U.S. space station module, node 1, \npassed a critical pressure test. This module features six docking ports \nand will serve as a gate-way connecting other station modules. The \nspace station is expected to begin assembly in November 1997 with the \nlaunch of the Russian-built core vehicle, the functional cargo block. \nNode 1 is expected to be launched into space 1 month after this core-\nvehicle.\n  Now is not the time to pull the collective rug out from under this \neffort. We have made commitments to our international partners which we \nmust not breach. We have sought the intellectual and capital investment \nof countless scientists, engineers, and program managers who have \nlabored long and hard to support our ever elusive vision of this \nproject. We gave these groups the vision of an international space \nstation. We gave them the mission of constructing an orbiting \nlaboratory in space. We have held the reins tight and offered \nconsiderable course correction at every turn in the development and \ndesign stages. Just as we are about to realize the results of this long \nlabor, there are calls to squander our investment, terminate the work, \nand redirect the funding.\n  Such calls are short-sighted and ill-conceived, and should not be \nsupported. This Nation enjoys a technological competitive advantage in \naeronautics and space issues because of its tradition in investing in \nthe future. Continued construction and operation of the space station \nwill further our advantage. It will provide a laboratory in \nmicrogravity which will enhance our understanding of crystallography. \nIt will give us advancements in biomedical research which will improve \nour health and welfare. It will provide a platform for environmental \nstudy of our fragile planet by allowing us to monitor and measure \nglobal changes both above and below the atmosphere.\n\n  When I hear some of my colleagues rail against the space station and \nother projects designed to propel us into the future, I cannot help but \nwonder what they would have said had they been around in 1492. \nCertainly had these political pundits been in Spain, the news\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\nheadlines would have read: ``Columbus voyage disaster, ship lost, India \nnot found.''\n  We never know what benefits research and development will ultimately \nyield. Some of the most important discoveries in medicine and other \nfield have been accidental in nature, just as Columbus' arrival in the \nNew World was 500 years ago. Could any of us argue, with a straight \nface, that the cost of that long-ago voyage, which at that time was \nastronomical, has not been outweighed many, many times over by the \nbenefits that were bestowed upon mankind?\n  As we reflect upon that journey during 1996, it would serve us well \nto think of and focus on the miraculous technological advances and \ndiscoveries--many of which have benefitted the human race \nimmeasurably--that would never have been possible had the naysayers \ncarried the day.\n  In his inaugural address to the Nation over 30 years ago, President \nKennedy told Americans that they stood ``on the edge of a New \nFrontier.'' In describing the phrase that has become synonymous with \nhis short administration, he inspired an entire generation by saying, \n``Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its \nterrors. Together let us explore the starts, conquer the deserts, \neradicate disease, tape the ocean-depths  * * *''.\n  Those words are no less profound today that they were in Kennedy's \ntime, for as long as man is on this Earth, and as long as we are able \nto move forward with scientific and technological advances, we will \nalways be on the brink of a new frontier.\n  As this will probably be my last opportunity to champion the \ninternational manned space laboratory, I remain fully committed to our \nvision. I ask my fellow colleagues to join with me today in defeating \nthis unreasonable amendment and signaling our collective resolve to \nsupport the continued construction and operation of the international \nspace station.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 3 minutes and 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, does Senator Mikulski \nhave additional time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. There is 4 minutes for Senator Mikulski and 3 minutes on \nthis side. I believe other speakers have now indicated they will submit \ntheir statements and will not give them directly. At this point I will \njust wrap up. If Senator Mikulski wishes to make any further comments, \nI will be happy to have her comments. Otherwise, I propose to offer a \ntabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Does the Senator from Arkansas wish further time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was just going to yield myself 2 or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to clarify the record on one \nthing, before Senator Heflin leaves the floor. As he knows, he and I \ntalked about it, I also have a stent in my heart. We are getting \nconflicting information. My doctor told me he was part of the team that \ndeveloped stents out at the National Institutes of Health. He never did \nmention the space station or any part of space. So we will have to \nreconcile that little difference about who developed stents.\n  In any event, I am grateful to whoever did it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Amen.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to add one point about the cost of \nkeeping the astronauts supplied with in water in space. As I said \nbefore, it will cost $12,880 per pound to ship water to the space \nstation. With each astronaut allocated 9.5 liters of water per day, \nthat comes to $1.9 million per day just to keep a crew of six supplied \nwith water. I've done some more calculations and that comes out to \nabout $700 million per year.\n\n  Let me say that again, because I think that is sliding over \neverybody's head. We are talking about almost three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars a year to send water to six people on the space \nstation. Now, you talk about balancing the budget, that is a great way \nto do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has approximately 31 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the distinguished manager of the bill short on time? \nI will be glad to yield some time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have all the time we need on this \nside. The Senator from Maryland has 4 minutes, if she wants to use it. \nI can conclude in the little time I have. If the Senator from Arkansas \nis ready to yield back, I will offer a tabling motion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I understand I have yet 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding the Senator \nfrom Maryland has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I claim those 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I conclude in my opposition to the \nBumpers amendment by talking about the impact, what it would mean to \nboth taxpayers' jobs and scientific innovation.\n  Cost to terminate the station would erode any fiscal 1997 savings \ngained from cancelling the program. Termination costs are estimated at \n$700 million. The U.S. Government has invested $6.4 billion in the \nredesigned station and, for the most part, what the Bumpers amendment \nwould do is essentially lose what we have already put in.\n  Let's go to mission and employment. Termination of the space station \nwould result in the loss of 15,000 highly skilled engineering and \nproduction jobs currently under contract, Mr. President, 15,000 jobs in \nTexas, in Alabama, and in other parts of our great country. In \naddition, 1,300 civil service positions directly supporting the space \nstation would become expendable. A conservative multiplier effect in \nCalifornia, Texas, Alabama, and Florida estimates 40,000 jobs.\n  We could talk about science impact, international impact, and the \nintangibles. Since its inception, the U.S. space program has driven \nscience and technology. It has also motivated our young people to enter \ncareers in space research, engineering, and has inspired the Nation.\n  We all went to see ``Apollo 13.'' Apollo 13 was more than a movie. It \nwas the whole Apollo program, the space station program. The Hubble \ntelescope is inspiring young people to move in to study science and \nengineering, and whether they come or go in the space program, they are \ngoing to be fit for duty in the 21st century and inventing products we \ndo not begin to think of.\n  The long-term cutting edge, high-risk R is exactly what the United \nStates of America needs. The investment NASA is making in breakthroughs \nin science and technology will make long-term economic growth possible. \nIt is exactly this type of activity that we need in the United States \nof America.\n  Right now in Desert Strike, we are using smart new weapons of war to \nbring a dictator under heel. I also want to see in the civilian area \nthese new smart technologies that will generate jobs and keep our \neconomy a 21st century economy. Therefore, we cannot approach it with a \n19th century attitude or framework.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, does my colleague from Arkansas wish any \nfurther time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not think so. Is the Senator from Missouri prepared \nto yield back?\n  Mr. BOND. I am going to conclude with my 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute thirty seconds for the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be held at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. With the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I claim a minute of that time just to follow \nup on the comments I made earlier. There were questions raised about \nwhat we can learn from the space station. We have not learned anything \nyet. Well, we have not had the space station up yet.\n  Here is a letter that I thought particularly compelling. This letter \nbegins:\n\n       On Earth, we are prisoners of gravity. Gravity influences \n     all life on Earth . . .\n       In orbit, there is very little gravity--\n\n  Or zero-g.\n\n       The microgravity environment of space allows researchers to \n     unmask gravity and to see, in many cases for the first time, \n     deeply into physical, chemical, and biological processes \n     which were previously obscured by gravity. . . .

DeBakey.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Baylor College of Medicine,\n\n                                       Houston, TX, July 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Walker,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Walker. On Earth, we are prisoners of \n     gravity. Gravity influences all life on Earth. Gravity \n     influences the behavior of everything--from single-celled \n     organisms to rocks, plants, and ships at sea--on the surface \n     of this small blue planet. When we fall, we fall down. We \n     stay attached to the chairs in our offices because of the \n     constant pull of gravity. In the plant world, roots grow \n     down. Even in our own bodies, our hearts have to work harder \n     when we stand than when we're lying down. Try as hard as I \n     might, I can't even begin to imagine what life would be like \n     on Earth without gravity.\n       In orbit, there is very little gravity. This radically \n     different environment is sometimes referred to as ``zero-g,'' \n     or, more accurately, microgravity. The microgravity \n     environment of space allows researchers to unmask gravity and \n     to see, in many cases for the first time, deeply into \n     physical, chemical, and biological processes which were \n     previously obscured by gravity. Thus, thanks to our space \n     program, for the first time in the history of humankind, \n     scientists can manipulate gravity by decreasing its force as \n     well as increasing it. This allow us to manipulate a primary \n     force of nature in a way that promises to lead to radical new \n     scientific discoveries about life on Earth.\n       Fundamental insights from international Space Station \n     research will produce broad-ranging benefits for humanity for \n     generations to come. Indeed, we are already seeing \n     significant benefits from the limited research we can conduct \n     on the Space Shuttle. One example is in the field of \n     telemedicine.\n       Telemedicine is the practice of medicine through the \n     exchange of information, data, images, and video across \n     distances using telecommunications networks such as telephone \n     lines, satellites, microwaves, and the Internet. Today's \n     telecommunications technology, which provides international \n     accessibility in real-time, greatly enhances the delivery of \n     medical care.\n       The available technologies can link remote sites to larger \n     medical centers, which can provide an opportunity for \n     specialty consultations that might not otherwise be possible. \n     The application of telemedicine offers advantages of cost-\n     effectiveness as well as improved care to remote areas, \n     disaster sites, and undeserved populations.\n       NASA has been a pioneer in telemedicine since the early \n     1960s, when it was faced with the challenge of monitoring the \n     health of astronauts in spacecraft orbiting the Earth. NASA's \n     continued use and development of telemedicine to enhance the \n     delivery of medical care in space for future long-duration \n     platforms, such as a space station, will help to support the \n     rapidly expanding application of this technology to health \n     care here on Earth.\n       In addition to its contributions to the study of basic \n     human physiology, the international Space Station will \n     support a vigorous program of research in biotechnology. The \n     potential of biotechnology to change human society is at \n     least as great as that of the microelectronics revolution. \n     Everyone knows that NASA technologies have been instrumental \n     in microelectronics, but few realize that NASA supported \n     research and the resulting technologies are also driving \n     whole new endeavors in biotechnology.\n       These new technologies, such as tissue culturing, allow the \n     growth of human tissues for the possible treatment of \n     diseases, such as arthritis and diabetes, and the growth of \n     cancerous tumors, allowing researches to address the \n     development and treatment of colon, breast, and ovarian \n     cancers. This new NASA technology has broad applications in \n     medical research and in the treatment of diseases.\n       Millions of Americans suffer tissue or organ loss from \n     diseases and accidents every year; the annual cost of \n     treating these patients exceeds $400 billion. At present, the \n     only treatment for these losses is transplantation of tissues \n     and organs; however, these procedures are severely limited by \n     donor shortages. The shortage of replacement tissue and \n     organs has generated a substantial research effort for the \n     development of alternative sources for transplantations.\n       A major advance would be the ability to grow functional \n     human tissues like those found in the human body, thereby \n     providing the necessary tissues for transplantations and \n     biomedical research. However, medical researchers have been \n     frustrated in their inability to grow human tissues outside \n     the body. Most present-day tissue growth systems do not \n     provide the conditions needed to form the complex structure \n     of tissue in the human body. However, NASA tissue-growth \n     technologies hold the promise of someday alleviating the \n     suffering caused by tissue and organ loss, a major \n     breakthrough for biomedical research.\n       NASA technology has played an important role in my own work \n     on the development of a mechanical artificial heart using \n     elements of NASA turbopump technology. The use of these new \n     artificial heart pumps is nearing reality.\n       I don't have space here to catalog all the potential \n     contributions that the international Space Station could make \n     to the world's biomedical research efforts. I hope the \n     examples I have provided will serve to illustrate this basic \n     point; NASA technology and Space Station research will \n     support the broader fight against human disease and make \n     tremendous contributions to the quality of life here on \n     Earth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Michael E. DeBakey, M.D.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time and vote now, if it is agreeable with the managers. The \nunanimous-consent agreement a moment ago was to vote at 5:30. We can \njust go ahead and vote now.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, might I suggest we can handle one or two \nother matters while we are waiting for that. They are procedural \nmatters. We had set earlier in the day, immediately following the vote \non the space station amendment, a vote for an amendment offered by \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham. We have on both sides worked with \nthem.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senator from \nMissouri that Senator McCain has changed the original amendment to \nactually improve it, I think substantially, and Senator Harkin of Iowa \nwishes to be sure it has no negative impact in terms of his State. We \ncannot agree to the UC until we get a signoff from Senator Harkin. So \nwe cannot get consent to modify it.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, then I will not make the unanimous-consent \nrequest. We think during the course of this next vote that we can bring \neverybody together and point out that the modification has moved in the \ndirection that would be very beneficial to the interest that Senator \nHarkin has raised.\n  With that, the time of 5:30 has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not yet, but it is approximately 5:30.\n  Mr. BOND. Close enough for Government work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is close enough to 5:30 for the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  Mr. BOND. Under that scenario, I move to table the Bumpers amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 5178. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], \nthe Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] are necessarily absent.\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5177, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5177), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, below line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 421. (a) Plan.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall develop a plan for the allocation of health care \n     resources (including personnel and funds) of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs among the health care Networks of the \n     Department so as to ensure that veterans who have similar \n     economic status and eligibility priority and who are eligible \n     for medical care have similar access to such care regardless \n     of the region of the United States in which such veterans \n     reside.\n       (2) The plan shall--\n       (1) reflect, to the maximum extent possible, the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Network developed by the Department to \n     account for forecasts in expected workload and to ensure \n     fairness to facilities that provide cost-efficient health \n     care; and\n       (2) include--\n       (A) procedures to identify reasons for variations in \n     operating costs among similar facilities where network \n     allocations are based on similar unit costs for similar \n     services and workload; and\n       (B) ways to improve the allocation of resources so as to \n     promote efficient use of resources and provision of quality \n     health care.\n       (C) adjustments to unit costs in subsection (a) to reflect \n     factors which directly influence the cost of health care \n     delivery within each Network and where such factors are not \n     under the control of Network or Department management, and\n       (D) include forecasts in expected workload and \n     consideration of the demand for VA health care that may not \n     be reflected in current workload projections.\n       (3) The Secretary shall prepare the plan in consultation \n     with the Under Secretary of Health of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (b) Plan Elements.--The plan under section (a) shall set \n     forth--\n       (1) milestones for achieving the goal referred to in \n     paragraph (1) of that subsection; and\n       (2) a means of evaluating the success of the Secretary in \n     meeting the goal.\n       (c) Submittal to Congress.--The Secretary shall submit to \n     Congress the plan developed under subsection (a) not later \n     than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the plan \n     developed under subsection (a) not alter than 60 days after \n     submitting the plan to Congress under subsection (c), unless \n     within that time the Secretary notifies Congress that the \n     plan will not be implemented in that time and includes with \n     the notification an explanation why the plan will not be \n     implemented in that time.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, for all of his efforts on behalf of this amendment. It has been \nmodified. We have worked with the administration.\n  Mr. President, since this amendment was accepted in the three \nprevious years and then dropped in conference, the Senator from Florida \nand I felt that we should have a rollcall vote on this although I think \nthat vote will be nearly unanimous since it is basically the same. It \nwas accepted 3 years before.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona, as modified. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], \nthe Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

So Senators should be aware, this agreement will allow for \ntwo consecutive rollcall votes in the morning, Thursday, at 10 a.m. We \nwill\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\ncome in session at 9:30, and then we will have the votes, two \nconsecutive votes, at 10 o'clock.\n  The two votes we just had will be the last votes of tonight, provided \nwe can get agreement on a list of amendments that will be brought up \ntomorrow. I have the commitment of cooperation of the Democratic leader \nto work with us to identify the amendments, get a finite list of \namendments, so we will have that list we can proceed on tomorrow. If we \ncannot, you know, get this list of amendments worked out, we will have \nto consider other options, but I am assuming we are going to have good-\nfaith cooperation, we are going to get these amendments, get them \nidentified so we can complete action on the VA-HUD appropriations bill \ntomorrow. We had hoped to have more votes tonight and get it completed \ntonight, but there has been a good-faith effort made, certainly by the \nchairman and ranking Senator. And there have been other circumstances \nthat have intervened that caused us to see if we could get the \namendments agreed to and get the votes in the morning at 10 o'clock, \nback to back, and be prepared to complete the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill.\n  For the information of all Senators, there are two other things they \nneed to be aware of. We are working on a bipartisan basis to see if we \ncan come up with a resolution with regard to the situation in Iraq. \nThere is going to be a meeting at 10 o'clock in the morning, bipartisan \nmeeting, to see if some language can be agreed to.\n  In addition to that, with regard to the Defense of Marriage Act, you \nwill recall there was a unanimous consent agreement entered into before \nwe left for the August recess that provided a procedure to get that \nissue up for consideration beginning at 10 o'clock on Thursday. It \nprovided that by 5 o'clock on Tuesday, up to four amendments could be \noffered on each side that would be voted on before we would get to \nfinal passage on the Defense of Marriage Act. But, also, after those \nfour amendments on each side were filed as of 5 o'clock on \nWednesday, the agreement could be vitiated and we would move on to \nother issues and decide on another way to handle the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n\n  That has happened. After the amendments were filed there was a \nfeeling, I presume on both sides, that the amendments were going to be \na distraction. They were going to contribute to an atmosphere that \nwould not be helpful in our trying to get agreements and passage on \nappropriations bills that we simply must get done during this month. So \nthe minority leader and I talked about it and we understand each other. \nWe are not going to go with that unanimous consent agreement.\n  I do want to emphasize we are going to have this issue brought up at \nsome point. Unless we reach some other agreement, it would be my intent \nto bring it up and lay down the cloture motion on the motion to \nproceed. I have not made a decision exactly how we will do that or when \nwe will do that. Part of it will depend on the cooperation we get on \nother issues, and whether or not we are making progress. But we would \nexpect a vote or votes will occur on that issue sometime, probably next \nweek, but without any final decision having been made as yet. Certainly \nI will consult with the Democratic leader before we take any action in \nthat regard.\n  There is a lot more that could be said, a lot more accusations, \ncharges or countercharges. Can we dispense with that and just get on \nwith the business? I would like to proceed that way. I hope that is the \nway we will approach this appropriations bill and other appropriations \nbills.\n  I do have some additional unanimous consent requests here. I see the \nleader is on his feet. Would you like to comment at this point? I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just confirm the agreement that \nwas anticipated, I think, by the majority leader's comments. He and I \nhave been talking throughout the day in attempts to find some \nresolution to the problems we are facing with regard to finalizing the \nlist on amendments to the HUD-VA bill. I have committed to the majority \nleader that it would be our hope that we could come up with a finite \nlist tonight. I think we are pretty close to having that finite list \navailable. I will share that with the majority leader later on.\n  It is my expectation the majority leader, as he has indicated, will \nwork with us to finalize the language on the resolution relating to \nIraq. The meeting, as he indicated, will be in his office tomorrow at \n10. It will be my hope we could have the vote tomorrow on that \nresolution, and find a way in which to resolve the outstanding issues \non the HUD-VA bill.\n  It is not our desire to preclude a vote, or to hold up a vote on the \nDefense of Marriage Act. Obviously, we had hoped we could come up with \nan agreement that would allow us a couple of amendments. As the \nmajority leader indicated, there was concern on both sides and that was \nnot possible. We want to work with the majority leader in finding a way \nto schedule that legislation and I am sure we can work through that as \nwell.\n  So we hope we can get everyone's cooperation. As it relates to the \npending bill, I have committed our best effort to see if we can come to \nclosure on it. I know there are a number of amendments that will be \noffered. Hopefully, if we have the list, at least we can confine \nourselves to that list and I pledge our best efforts to make that \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9820-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9821-S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have a unanimous consent request that \nwould list the amendments that have been identified on both sides at \nthis point. I assume there is a little padding going on, on both sides. \nBut at least, if we could get this list agreed to, we would have then a \nfinite list we could work from. I believe, as the night proceeds and \nthe day proceeds tomorrow, we will not have to do all these amendments, \nbut I would like to go ahead, if I could, and get agreement on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent during the remaining consideration of H.R. \n3666, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, the following be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order and they be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments, and no motions to refer be in order, \nand following the disposition of the listed amendments, the bill be \nadvanced to third reading. The amendments are as follows:\n  An amendment by Senator Bond regarding multifamily housing; a \nFaircloth amendment on HUD fair housing; Senator Bennett, GAO review; \nanother one by Senator Bennett, reimburse State housing finance \nagencies; Senator Shelby, land transfer; Senator Thomas, antilobbying \ngeneral provision; Senator Thomas, decrease funding for Council on \nEnvironmental Quality; Senator Helms, law enforcement in housing; \nSenator McCain, two amendments, one on FHA mortgages, one on FEMA \ndisaster relief; one by Senator Bond regarding HUD grant and loan \nprograms; a technical amendment by Senator Bond; two amendments by \nSenator Nickles, one on union dues, one on runaway plants; Senator \nBond, a managers' amendment; Senator Hatfield, relevant; Senator \nCoverdell, relevant; Senator Lott, two relevant amendments; Senator \nLott, one on Iraq; Senator Nickles, an amendment on 48-hour hospital \nstay.\n\n  Democratic amendments identified: Senator Bingaman on United States-\nJapan commission; Senator Bradley, one amendment regarding hospital \nstay for newborns; Senator Byrd, two relevant amendments; Senator \nDaschle, or his designee, one on runaway plants and one on Iraq; \nSenator Feingold, one on NASA; one by Senator Feinstein dealing with \nDowny land transfer, one on biotech, one identified as relevant; \nSenator Graham, veterans resource allocation; Senator Harkin, funding \nvets health care; Senator Kennedy, an amendment on employment \ndiscrimination; Senator Mikulski, four relevant amendments; Senator \nMoseley-Braun, an amendment on mortgage registration; Senator Sarbanes, \nan amendment on\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\nNASA; Senator Wellstone, an amendment on mental health; Senator Levin, \nan amendment on lobbying; and Senator Baucus, an amendment on \nenvironmental quality.\n  It seems that any amendments that did not make it before the August \nrecess, or the heart may desire to be considered any time soon, is on \nthis list. I hope we will consider those that really do contribute to \ndevelopment of legislation that we can pass for VA-HUD, and we will \nwork together and try to get that done. I so ask unanimous consent.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object, my staff has advised me \nthat the majority leader's list did not include a Fritz Hollings \namendment on HUD.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask that be included in the list of \namendments identified for consideration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might \njust address the distinguished leader, Senator Sarbanes and I are the \ncosponsors of the amendment designated ``Sarbanes, NASA.'' I believe it \nis my understanding that the managers have accepted that; is that \ncorrect?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished managers.\n  Mr. LOTT. So that amendment has already been accepted; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BOND. It will be accepted. It has not yet been accepted.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is the Sarbanes-Warner amendment dealing with NASA.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished leader and managers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I obviously failed to \nlist as one of our amendments the amendment relating to spina bifida. \nThat was supposed to have been listed. It was left off. I think \neverybody just understood it was going to be here.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought that was one of the two or three really serious \namendments we had for consideration that related to the bill itself. I \ncannot believe we left that off. We will have an amendment by Senator \nDaschle relating to veterans' program for children with spina bifida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nagreement?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nexpect to object, I think I understood the distinguished majority \nleader correctly in that debate is not prohibited after third reading \nin his request.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct, that the bill be advanced to third reading \nand then stopped. I believe the Senator from West Virginia has made \nclear his desire that we have a few moments to look at this legislation \nwhen we reach that point, and we intend to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished majority leader. I remove my \nreservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The request is agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I hope the managers of \nthe legislation will continue to work to see if they can reduce this \nlist. I hope tomorrow that a number of these amendments will, in fact, \nbe withdrawn and will be considered in some other forum another day. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I inquire what is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5167\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the Bond amendment, No. \n5167.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we raised this issue and filed this \namendment yesterday. We had a good discussion on it. We had it printed. \nWe wanted everybody to have an opportunity to look at it. As I advised \nyesterday, this is an attempt to deal with a very complex problem that \nhas some real consequences.\n  HUD has given us estimates that if we don't do something with the \noversubsidized section 8 contracts for multifamily housing, we are \ngoing to do one of two things: No. 1, if we continue to renew the \ncontracts at existing rates, these are multifamily units where \nsubsidies were granted in the form of section 8 rental payments to get \npeople to develop housing for the elderly in rural areas, needed \nhousing in urban areas, these overmarket rent section 8 contracts would \nhave an exploding cost.\n  The appropriations for this year would be about $4.3 billion; for \n1998, $10 billion; $16 billion by fiscal year 2000. The actual cost \neach year would grow from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $4 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000 and to $8 billion in 10 years. Those are \nthe costs. If we just refuse to renew the contracts, we could have tens \nof thousands of people who depend upon these section 8 subsidized \ncontracts thrown out on the street. These could be elderly people in \nrural areas. These are people in many parts of the country where there \nare no readily available alternatives for which vouchers could get them \nhousing.\n  So we have proposed a system that sounds complex, but, basically, we \nwould write down a portion of the debt on the project and the \nGovernment would take back a second mortgage that would be paid back at \nthe end of the first mortgage, writing these contracts down to fair \nmarket rentals.\n  That is a very brief and overly simplistic discussion of the \namendment. We have worked on this on a bipartisan basis not only in the \nAppropriations Committee but, more important, with the authorizing \ncommittee, with Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Mack and \nSenator Kerry. We appreciate very much their assistance on it.\n  This is a demonstration project for 1 year on the way to getting a \npermanent resolution of these exploding contract costs. I hope that we \ncan adopt this amendment by voice vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond amendment. \nI do it because it is the right thing to do at this time.\n  It starts to address a serious problem with our public housing. A \nlarge number of section 8 multifamily housing projects are subsidized \nby rents that far exceed the fair-market rent in the area. In fiscal \nyear 1997 alone, HUD estimates there are 40,000 units whose contracts \nwill expire at rents over 120 percent of the fair-market rent.\n  But Mr. President, this is not just an issue of numbers and \nstatistics. This is an issue about real Americans and real lives. If we \ntake the do-nothing approach, American taxpayers will continue to have \ntheir hard-earned tax money wasted by paying excessive rents. The \nGovernment can't afford to pay these excessive rents indefinitely.\n  If we take a strong-arm approach and try to force owners to lower the \nrents and we reduce subsidies, we risk massive defaults. In addition to \nthe massive multibillion-dollar costs to HUD and the administrative \nburden it would cause the Agency, it could lead to massive resident \ndisplacement.\n  Mr. President, we're talking about real people in real communities \npotentially being out on the streets. None of us wants to be a part of \nputting people on the streets and increasing the homeless problem in \nour Nation. We as a nation are better than that. The residents deserve \nbetter and so do their communities.\n  I support the effort to begin addressing the problem. We must ensure \nthat while we do so, we don't create hollow opportunities, don't create \na generation of slum landlords, and don't create a new liability for \nthe taxpayers. We don't want to just address the problem, we want to \nsolve it--with creative and effective approaches.\n  This amendment is not a perfect solution, but it is a start. It \nallows HUD to negotiate with landlords of oversubsidized projects with \ncontracts expiring in fiscal year 1997. HUD will seek to bring the \nrents of units over 120 percent of fair-market rent in line with the \nmarket rate where the units are located.\n  This amendment begins a process that we must continue to work on \nduring the coming year. Some will voice concerns that this amendment \ngoes too far, others will say it doesn't go far enough.\n  Mr. President, we must not make the perfect the enemy of the good. A \nmodest beginning is better than no beginning. We can't afford to ignore \nthe fact that over 750,000 units with subsidy problems are in the \npipeline. The time to act is now. We can't afford to delay any longer. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to say this. This is not just an issue of \nnumbers and statistics, this is an issue about real Americans and real \nlives. If we do nothing, the American taxpayer will continue to pay \nexcessive rents. If we take a strong-arm approach, we could risk \nmassive defaults.\n  I support this effort, because it absolutely begins to address the \nproblem. We must ensure that in doing so we do not create a hollow \nopportunity for the poor, that Federal assistance does not generate a \nnew class of sublandlords and new liability for the taxpayers.\n  I believe the Bond amendment is the right approach that talks about \nreal opportunities for the poor, provides a safety net so that these \nprojects do not collapse, but we begin to bring this into discipline \nand really focus on a market-based approach.\n  So, Mr. President, I support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5167) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am most grateful for the assistance of my \nranking member in dealing with that very difficult question. We may \nhave to address this again in conference. But we think this is the \nstart on the right path.\n  We have a number of amendments that I believe have been cleared on \nboth sides. I propose that we proceed to those.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5181\n\n (Purpose: Prohibit HUD from removing regulatory requirements that HUD \n              issue public notice and comment rulemaking.)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5181.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place at the end of the section \n     on HUD:\n\n     SEC. . REQUIREMENT FOR HUD TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC NOTICE AND \n                   COMMENT RULEMAKING.\n\n       The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall \n     maintain all current requirements under Part 10 of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development's regulations (24 \n     CFR part 10) with respect to the Department's policies and \n     procedures for the promulgation and issuance of rules, \n     including the use of public participation in the rulemaking \n     process.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a prohibition on a HUD rulemaking \neffort to eliminate HUD public notice and comment. The HUD recently \nissued a proposed rule that would, as a practical matter, remove any \nrequirement for HUD to issue public notice and comments. This amendment \nwould prohibit HUD from doing that. The Administrative Procedures Act \ndoes not require agencies to issue public notice and comment rulemaking \nfor grant loan programs, but HUD has traditionally deferred to \ncongressional and public interest that HUD programs be developed in an \nopen manner to ensure that the implementation of programs are \nconsistent with congressional intent and receive the benefit of public \ninput and scrutiny.\n  Basically, the requirement for HUD to issue the public notice and \ncomment rulemaking is not an accident. Because of the program abuses at \nHUD in the late 1960's, HUD chose public notice, this public airing, to \nget them out of a real crack, to convince people that a change HUD was \noperating on the up and up. It is critical that they do this because, \nwithout public notice and comment rulemaking, HUD can and has designed \nprograms in the past that are inconsistent with congressional intent, \nnot in the best interest of beneficiaries, and, frankly, smell.\n  Last year the inspector general raised some very real questions about \nthe way that empowerment zones had been selected. A lot of compelling \nquestions were raised in that report. I think it is necessary to keep \nthe spotlight on HUD so that we can be sure that we know what they are \ndoing, that Congress and the media and the public have a right to see \nwhat they are doing, so that there will be less temptation to abuse the \nprocess.\n  The most recent example of HUD's disregard of the congressional \nintent is one that is particularly galling to many of us who fought for \nthe provision for a long time. There was a provision in S. 1494, the \nHousing Opportunity Programs Extension Act, which provided public \nhousing authorities with broad authority to designate public housing as \n``elderly only,'' ``disabled only,'' or a combination thereof. HUD \nproceeded to issue a proposed rule that would require extensive \nmicromanagement by HUD and place an unreasonable burden on public \nhousing authorities that want to designate the public housing as \n``elderly only'' or ``disabled only'' housing. It is finding out that \nkind of activity before it occurs that should save us a great deal of \nheartburn and avoid a lot of heartburn for HUD.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the Bond amendment, even \nthough my State, my city of Baltimore got an empowerment zone. We think \nwe met the test. I still support the amendment. We believe that there \nshould be public notice. It was part of a reform. We believe that \npublic notices act in the public interest. It is as straightforward and \nas simple as that. I urge the adoption of the Bond amendment and the \ncontinuation of existing policy.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I have previously discussed, I remain \nvery concerned about HUD's ability and capacity to administer its \nprograms effectively, and in some cases, fairly.\n  In early 1995, Senator Mack and I requested the HUD IG to review the \nHUD's procedures and decisionmaking in selecting and designating six \nurban empowerment zones. As you know, the use of empowerment zones to \nrevitalize decaying urban centers has a long history, with perhaps its \ngreatest proponent in Jack Kemp, when he was Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development. Secretary Kemp never had an opportunity to implement \nhis vision of empowerment zones.\n  Empowerment zone legislation was finally enacted as part of the \nOmnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 on August 10, 1993. This \nlegislation proposed the establishment of nine empowerment zones, six \nurban and three rural zones, in distressed communities. Empowerment \nzones received some funding of $100 million as well as significant tax \nbenefits designed to encourage employment in the empowerment zone. On \nDecember 21, 1994, President Clinton announced the designation of six \nurban empowerment zones and three rural empowerment zones. Another 66 \nurban communities and 30 rural communities were designated as \nenterprise communities with reduced benefits. The urban zones were New \nYork City, Camden/Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, and \nDetroit.\n  Nevertheless, no program, however well intended and designed, will \nwork if the wrong people and the wrong communities are selected to \nimplement and carry through the program. Much to my concern, the HUD IG \nconfirmed my worst fears that HUD's designation of the empowerment \nzones did not likely include those communities that had put together \nthe best partnerships and plans for implementing the empowerment zones.\n  The HUD IG report--pages 2, 6, and 7--indicates that the entire \nselection process was handled as a discretionary process, with all \nfinal decisions made by the Secretary. The report raises major issues \nas to whether HUD used a competitive or meritorious process in \ndesignating zones. The report is clear that if a competitive process \nwas used, there is no record of the decisionmaking.\n  This is no way to run a program. Cities and localities exerted \ntremendous energy to forge partnerships and leverage local funding to \nput the best empowerment zone plan forward. These cities and localities \nbelieved that their applications would be considered on a level playing \nfield.\n  I have heard reports that many of the designated empowerment zones \nhave not performed well, that projected partnerships have faded and \nthat\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\ngroups in some cities are having a food fight over the funding and the \nbenefits. I know that major concerns have been raised with respect to \nthe empowerment zones in Camden/Phillie and New York City. I think that \nit is time that we revisit and audit the current status of empowerment \nzones. If Federal dollars are being misused or abused, we need to find \nout, and we need to ensure that HUD is doing its job in preventing \nabuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I note that Kansas City got an empowerment \nzone as well. But there were many questions raised in it. I have no \nfurther debate on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5181) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5182\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to convey \n       certain real property to the City of Tuscaloosa, Alabama)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration. This amendment is offered on behalf of \nSenator Shelby. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for Mr. Shelby, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5182.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 108. (a) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may convey, \n     without consideration, to the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama (in \n     this section referred to as the ``City''), all right, title, \n     and interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real \n     property, including any improvements thereon, in the \n     northwest quarter of section 28 township 21 south, range 9 \n     west, of Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, comprising a portion of \n     the grounds of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical \n     center, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and consisting of approximately \n     9.42 acres, more or less.\n       (b) The conveyance under subsection (a) shall be subject to \n     the condition that the City use the real property conveyed \n     under that subsection in perpetuity solely for public park or \n     recreational purposes.\n       (c) The exact acreage and legal description of the real \n     property to be conveyed pursuant to this section shall be \n     determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs. The cost of such survey shall be borne by \n     the City.\n       (d) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may require such \n     additional terms and conditions in connection with the \n     conveyance under this section as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I do not believe this is controversial. It provides \npermissive authority to the Veterans' Administration to transfer lands \nto the city of Tuscaloosa, AL, for a recreational facility.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we consulted with the Veterans' \nAdministration, and they have advised us they also concur with the \namendment. I do so and therefore urge that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 5182) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5176, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask that the pending business be amendment \nNo. 5176, the McCain amendment on the Federal Emergency Management Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, I send to the \ndesk a modification. This modification makes one small change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 75, line 10, after the word ``expended'' insert the \n     following: ``Provided, That no money appropriated for the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency may be expended for the \n     repair of yacht harbors or golf courses except for debris \n     removal; Provided further, That no money appropriated for the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency may be expended for tree \n     or shrub replacement except in public parks; Provided \n     further, That any funds used for repair of any recreational \n     facilities shall be limited to debris removal and the repair \n     of recreational buildings only.''\n\n  Mr. BOND. This change, after much intensive work, and extensive staff \ndiscussion and thought, changes the word ``marinas'' to ``yacht \nharbors,'' which I think satisfies the concerns that were raised in the \ndiscussion of the McCain amendment. I believe it is agreeable on both \nsides.\n  As I stated in the discussion of it, this is just the beginning of \nwhat needs to be a major review of the limitations on disaster relief \nfor recreational and landscape facilities, a part of the process that \nthe FEMA IG has said must be undertaken. FEMA has agreed to undertake \nit, and we may be revisiting this in conference. Certainly we will work \nwith the authorizing committees afterward to get a much better control \nover the expenditures of disaster relief money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, Mr. President, the modification was made \nat my request. As the Senator knows, marinas in many instances are \nsmall businesses and are the equivalent in my State of family farms or \nsmall ranches. So we thank Senator McCain for his courtesy in modifying \nit. We do support the amendment because it is based on an IG report. We \nthink it really brings an important discipline to the FEMA program. We \ncan fund disasters but we cannot create a budget disaster for \nourselves. Therefore, I urge the adoption of the McCain amendment as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5176), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5183\n\n   (Purpose: Deletes EPA language relating to funds appropriated for \n   drinking water state revolving funds. This language is no longer \n necessary given the enactment of drinking water state revolving fund \n                              legislation)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send to the desk a technical amendment and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5183.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 72, beginning on line 11, strike the phrase \n     beginning with ``, but if no drinking water'' and ending with \n     ``as amended'' on line 15.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment is a technical amendment. It \nis cleared on both sides. It simply deletes a provision that we carried \nin the bill when it was reported out of the Appropriations Committee at \nthat time. The drinking water legislation had not been enacted. It \nobviously has now been enacted and signed into law. So we delete the \nprovision, and with the enactment of the drinking water legislation, \nthis language is no longer necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with Senator Bond's amendment \nand urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5183) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GAO AUDIT ON STAFFING AND CONTRACTING.\n\n       The Comptroller General shall audit the operations of the \n     Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight concerning \n     staff organization, expertise, capacity, and contracting \n     authority to ensure that the office resources and contract \n     authority are adequate and that they are being used \n     appropriately to ensure that the Federal National Mortgage \n     Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \n     are adequately capitalized and operating safely.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to add an amendment to H.R. \n3666 which will emphasize my concern about the multiyear delay of a \nscheduled GAO audit of the OFHEO, Office of Federal Housing Enterprise \nOversight. OFHEO is required by statute to create an effective review \nprocess to, in effect, ensure the fiscal safety and soundness of \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Quite frankly, it concerned me when I was \ninformed that OFHEO was, in turn, several years behind schedule in \nproducing a model to oversee these two important housing enterprises.\n  I continue to be concerned that mission creep may take hold of this \nregulator. Trips abroad to consult with other countries on how to \nregulate their housing enterprises should be curtailed until our own \nregulator is up and running. Therefore, it is my intent to refocus the \nGAO report to make sure OFHEO is still on track, and that it continues \nto focus all of its efforts on completing its very important mission. \nIt is my intent to make sure that before OFHEO grows any larger, it is \non track with a clear vision of its goals and responsibilities.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Senator Bennett has been a leader in this \narea in attempting to develop adequate oversight of the Office of \nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight.\n  He directs that the Comptroller General audit the operations to \nensure that the office resource's contract authority are adequate, they \nare being used appropriately to ensure that the Federal National \nMortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac are adequately capitalized and operating safely.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the amendment as offered by \nthe Senator from Utah. He raised this very important issue during our \nhearings and was concerned very much about mission creep in this Office \nof Federal Housing and Enterprise Oversight. It was his intent, as it \nis ours, that it focus on ensuring that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \nfiscal safety and soundness. It was not meant to take foreign trips and \nsee how the world is doing this. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been \naround. It is our job to make sure that they are not only around, but \nare safe and sound and ready to do the job. We want to make sure they \nare fit for duty.\n  I support the Bennett amendment as offered by Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5184) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5185\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the consolidation of NASA aircraft at Dryden \n                  Flight Research Center, California)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Sarbanes, Senator Warner, Senator Feinstein and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Sarbanes, \n     for himself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Mikulski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5185.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, below line 24, add the following:\n       Sec. 421. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration by this Act, or any other Act enacted before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, may be used by the \n     Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration to relocate aircraft of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration to Dryden Flight \n     Research Center, California, for purposes of the \n     consolidation of such aircraft.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This is a very straightforward amendment, Mr. \nPresident. What it does is preclude that no Federal funds be spent in \nconsolidating NASA aeronautics facilities at Dryden Air Force Base. We \nfeel NASA's proposal to do this is premature. Questions have been \nraised about the NASA proposal by the inspector general. We have been \nconsulting with NASA about this and have lacked clarity from NASA in \nterms of what its future intent is.\n  It is one thing, I think, to talk about consolidation, but the IG \nraises many yellow flashing lights. So for now we wish to prohibit the \nconsolidation until NASA comes forward with justification that then \nmeets the requirements established by Senator Sarbanes, myself, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Feinstein.\n  We hope this can be resolved before conference. In the meantime, we \nsupport the fact that none of the funds be used by the Administrator to \nrelocate aircraft of NASA to Dryden.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland has been concerned \nand has been very active in bringing these matters to our attention. I \ndo agree we will look at this very carefully prior to conference. We \nwant to work with NASA to make sure that steps they are taking are, \nindeed, efficient, effective and could not cause any unnecessary \ndislocation or hardship.\n  Since there are a number of colleagues who have expressed great \ninterest in this, we will attempt to learn more about it prior to the \nconference. We strongly support the amendment in the current form, and \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5185) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5179\n\n  (Purpose: To amend provision appropriating monies to the Council on \n       Environmental Quality to the level approved by the House)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 5179.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5179.\n       In title III, at the end of the subchapter entitled: \n     Council on Environmental Quality and Office of Environmental \n     Quality, strike ``$2,436,000.'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$2,250,000.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an amendment, obviously, that \ndecreases the funding level for the Council of Environmental Quality in \nthe amount of funding that was passed by the House, and I rise to \ndiscuss this.\n  This amendment is offered largely because of what I think is the \nunfortunate changes that have taken place in CEQ during the Clinton \nadministration. Congress established this council, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, to facilitate the implementation of NEPA and \nto coordinate the environmental activities of the executive branch.\n  Congress envisioned CEQ as a technical resource for Federal agencies \nthat were confronted with questions about NEPA. Unfortunately, the \nintention and reality have diverged under the Clinton administration. \nCEQ has\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\nnot fulfilled the statutory mandates of NEPA, nor many of the promises \nwhich the chairman made to this Congress. I happened to be involved \nwith the committee hearings last year on the confirmation of this \nchairman, and we talked a lot about how we were going to work together.\n  Instead, CEQ has been actively engaged in partisan kinds of things \nwith respect to those issues before the Congress. CEQ has not done many \nof the things that have been prescribed under the law. NEPA requires \nCEQ to provide an annual quarterly report--annual. The last report \nprepared was completed 3 years ago, in 1993, and that report remains \nthe only report CEQ has prepared under the Clinton administration \ndespite the statutory mandate.\n  In that report, CEQ promised a handbook to facilitate Agency \ncompliance of NEPA. This handbook still has not been drafted, let alone \npublished for Agency use. CEQ promised the Congress a comprehensive \nstudy of NEPA's effectiveness at the end of 1995. CEQ's effectiveness \nstudy has still not been finalized despite repeated assurances that it \nwould be. They promised Congress it would assist the Forest Service in \nstreamlining the Agency's issuance of grazing permits. After some \ninitial progress, there has not been a meeting between the Forest \nService and CEQ in 6 months.\n  Last November, Senator Craig and I sent a detailed letter to Ms. \nMcGinty, the chairman, suggesting reform to NEPA, compliance at the \nForest Service. Other than an initial ``thank you'' for the letter, we \nhave not heard anything about those suggestions.\n  This lack of followup is all too common at the CEQ and indicative of \nan Agency which apparently has lost its way. Things CEQ has been doing \nunder the administration, CEQ has been involved in every timber sale \nwhich has occurred in national forests, been involved in the northern \nspotted owl debate in the Pacific Northwest, and now injected itself \ninto the California spotted owl.\n  Ms. McGinty has taken up a number of things that are basically \npolitical, propaganda, including grazing, and has characterized the \nPublic Rangeland Management Act, passed by this Senate, as a special \ninterest give-away; lambasted the Republican platform as full of \n``anti-environmental language,'' such as private property rights and \nstreamlining regulations, despite the fact that in the hearings she \nindicated that is what we ought to do, make it simpler and streamline.\n  On timber salvage legislation, House Members have written to the \nPresident complaining about mischaracterization of the law.\n  Mr. President, I guess I use this opportunity to talk a little bit \nabout something that bothers me a great deal.\n  I am very much interested in the kinds of things that go on in the \nenvironment and very much interested in the kinds of things that go on \nin the West. I am very much interested in trying to simplify and make \nmore effective NEPA and some of the other activities that relate to \nthat. I think that this has not been done. I think it should be done. \nThere needs to be a wake-up call to that committee. Perhaps this will \nbe that.\n  Rather than pursue it, however, in view of the time and things we are \ndoing, I will withdraw my amendment. But I do want to have this \nopportunity to say that I think we need to do something differently. \nThere are great opportunities for this committee to be effective and to \nbring about less rhetoric and more action.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill for this \nopportunity. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn, \nand I will continue to work with it in the conference committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5179) was withdrawn.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to comment before the Senator \nfrom Wyoming leaves the floor. I thank him for withdrawing the \namendment rather than embroiling us in controversy. I want to \nacknowledge the concerns that he has raised, and I respect them. As we \nmove toward conference, perhaps there is report language or something \nthat prods EPA in the direction to be more responsive to Members' \ninquiries and that the focus of the agency is to review environmental \nlegislation and comment on it from that perspective and not be a \npropaganda machine. I acknowledge the validity of that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Maryland, and I look forward to \nfurther discussion.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me add my thanks, also, to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for allowing us to move past that particular amendment. We \nhave worked very hard to avoid some of the controversies. We are not \ngoing to avoid all of them. But we did understand what he said and the \nconcerns he has. We have heard others raise those concerns. We will \nwork with him and other Members to try to resolve those concerns. We \nvery much appreciate his consideration in withdrawing the amendment.\n\n\n                       fema audit of kauai county\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I wish to raise an issue of concern with the managers of \nthe bill. It relates to the direction of an audit conducted by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency's [FEMA] inspector general on the \ncounty of Kauai and the State of Hawaii on the damages caused by \nHurricane Iniki. It looks to undo insurance settlements, sanctioned by \nFEMA and agreed upon 4 years ago. In doing so, the inspector general \nwould renege on funding commitments FEMA previously made, thereby \nleaving the county with outstanding obligations and in debt. The State \nof Hawaii voluntarily purchased insurance over that which was required \nafter Hurricane Iwa hit in 1981. To now second guess the county's \nsettlement with its insurance carriers, and then use it as the basis \nfor denying previously approved damage survey reports [DSR's] is \nwithout precedent. It is a disincentive for States and cities to insure \nthemselves against natural disasters. FEMA is wrongly penalizing a \nState for its good faith effort to minimize future losses and reduce \nthe expenditure of Federal funds. There are currently no clear \nguidelines in the Stafford Act.\n  Mr. BOND. As the Senator from Hawaii knows, I support efforts to \nimprove controls on disaster relief expenditures. However, I am \nsympathetic to the concerns raised by the Senator. I understand that \nthe county of Kauai and the State of Hawaii are concerned with a FEMA \nIG's audit report regarding damages caused by Hurricane Iniki, and I \nencourage FEMA to reach a resolution in which FEMA ensures that the \ncounty and State are reimbursed for all eligible costs resulting from \nthe 1992 event. The committee also directs FEMA to provide its policy \njustifications and recommendations regarding this matter. Finally, I \nbelieve that FEMA's policies should do everything to encourage, not \ndiscourage, States for efforts to minimize future losses and reduce the \nexpenditure of Federal funds, such as strong insurance requirements.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I join Chairman Bond in encouraging FEMA to reach a \nresolution in which FEMA ensures that the county of Kauai and the State \nof Hawaii are reimbursed for all eligible costs resulting from \nHurricane Iniki. I also support the chairman's effort in directing FEMA \nto provide its policy justifications and recommendations on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the managers of the bill for your assistance in \nthis matter.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI: Mr. President, I am here today because the people of \nAlaska face a very serious problem. But, unlike other times when we \nface problems and find solutions, in this case the solution may be even \nworse. I'm referring to the use of oxygenated fuels to reduce the \nemissions of carbon monoxide. These alternative fuels are required by \nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Alaska has two areas where carbon \nmonoxide levels are above those required by the law. But when we tried \nusing gasoline treated with ether-based oxygenates, the people of \nAlaska became ill. Headaches, coughs, nausea, as well as other \nailments, all resulted from exposure to these fuel additives.\n  Additionally, study after scientific study shows, oxygenated fuel \ndoesn't reduce carbon monoxide levels in the extreme cold of Alaska. \nThis finding was recently reinforced by a report of the National \nResearch Council [NRC].\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\nThe NRC recognized that oxygenated fuels decrease carbon monoxide \nemissions under Federal test procedure conditions using fuel-control \nsystems, but also stated that ``* * * the data presented do not \nestablish the existence of this benefit under winter driving \nconditions.'' And oxygenates increase the costs of gasoline for the \naverage working Alaskan. In sum, Mr. President, no environmental \nbenefit, adverse health effects, and higher fuel costs. This is not the \nsolution the Clean Air Act intended.\n  I am pleased to be here with my friend Senator Bond from Missouri and \nmy friend Senator Faircloth from North Carolina to discuss this issue \ntoday. In previous years, the VA/HUD Appropriation Act has included \nlanguage that prohibited implementation of an oxygenated fuel program \nin States where the winter temperature is below 0 degree. That language \nwas designed to allow time for additional studies to be conducted on \nusing ethanol-treated fuel in our cold weather, and to keep Alaskans \nfrom suffering adverse health effects with no environmental improvement \nin the quality of our air. I had hoped to see that amendment included \nin this year's bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the situation facing the Senator from Alaska. \nI know he also appreciates the situation of our committee. We in \nCongress have tried very hard this year to address difficult issues \nthat arise over implementation of our environmental laws. America has \nmade significant progress in improving environmental quality, but \nsometimes our efforts to protect health and the environment have the \nopposite effect. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult \nand unwieldy to address each of these instances in appropriations \nlegislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Missouri, and I understand that \nhis appropriations legislation cannot be turned into the Senate's \nversion of the Corrections Day Calendar such as we have in the House. \nIt is my intention to refrain from offering my amendment at this time, \nbut I will need the able assistance of the chairman of the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee, and my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in addressing this problem. I believe the people of \nFairbanks want to take the appropriate steps to address their carbon \nmonoxide problem. I also think that the administration of region 10 of \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is willing to work with them \nin a cooperative, flexible manner. But the science is clear that \noxygenated fuel may not be the answer in very cold weather. I would ask \nthe assistance of the subcommittee chairmen in two areas. First, will \nthey aid us in working with the EPA to craft emission reduction \nprograms for Alaskans that are flexible and workable? And second, will \nthey work with the Alaska delegation to fix the provisions in the \nstatute that may be driving Alaska toward remedies for air pollution \nthat don't work?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I will be happy to assist the Senator from Alaska in \nany way I can regarding the possible misapplication of Clean Air Act \nrequirements. The citizens of Alaska should not be forced to accede to \na regulatory scheme which imposes significant additional costs, has no \ndiscernable health or environmental benefit, and may actually be \ncreating harmful health effects. Together with the EPA, we can work to \nfix this situation for the people of Alaska and those similarly \nsituated in other parts of the country.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Alaska can count on any assistance I may \nbe able to provide as he seeks a solution of this problem for his \naffected constituents.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleagues and I thank the Chair.\n\n\n               Clean Lakes Program Funding in EPA Budget\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Clean Lakes Program, administered by \nEPA under Section 314 of the Clean Water Act, is in serious jeopardy. \nFor many years, this valuable program helped define the causes and \nextent of pollution problems in our Nation's lakes. States used program \ngrants to implement effective treatments to restore environmentally \ndegraded lakes, and to guard against future damage.\n  Nearly 90 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a \nlake, with a combined economic impact of billions of dollars. The Clean \nLakes Program has provided targeted assistance to these lakes resulting \nin renewed recreational opportunities, increased wildlife, and enhanced \nproperty values that improved water quality brings.\n  Despite this track record however, EPA is in the process of combining \nthe Clean Lakes Program with the much larger Nonpoint Source Pollution \nControl Program, Section 319 of the Clean Water Act. Section 319 is \ndesigned to address polluted runoff from cities, farms, and other \nsources. The needs of lake managers and lake users are too easily lost \nwhen forced to compete with projects affecting entire watersheds. \nIronically, some of the most visible and immediate problems facing lake \nusers, such as controlling non-native nuisance aquatic weeds like \nEurasian water milfoil and hydrilla, are not even eligible for funding \nunder the 319 program. These weeds, introduced from Asia and other \nlocations, are threatening aquatic habitat, recreation, navigation, \nflood control efforts, and waterfront property values. When Vermont \nfound a beetle that appeared to be controlling milfoil, the Clean Lakes \nProgram provided funds to investigate further to determine whether the \nbeetle could be used for weed control. Vermont's investigations have \nnow ended, but numerous other States around the country, including \nMinnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Washington, have \nrecently taken up the effort and are carrying on the work. Together, \nthis work may result in a cost-effective control method for Eurasian \nmilfoil. Without the Clean Lakes Program, Vermont would not have been \nable to initiate the studies, and other States would not have been able \nto expand on Vermont's efforts to solve a national problem.\n  The Clean Lakes Program has been highly successful in helping \nindividual States restore lakes with severe problems, and then using \nthe lessons learned in the process to help other States restore their \nlakes as well. Each State needs the information and experience gained \nby other States to cost-effectively restore their own lakes.\n  The Appropriations Committee recognized the importance of preserving \nthe important qualities of the Clean Lakes Program in the fiscal year \n1996 Appropriations bill, as the House has done in its fiscal year 1997 \nreport, by including language specifically requiring EPA to continue \nfunding the activities of the Clean Lakes Program through section 319. \nSenator Bond, do you support the language included in the House \nAppropriation bill specifying that activities like aquatic plant \ncontrol, previously eligible for funding under the Clean Lakes Program, \nqualify for funding under the section 319 program?\n  Mr. BOND. Senator Leahy, I know you have been a long time supporter \nof the Clean Lakes Program, and that the program has funded valuable \nlake inventory and restoration activities in Vermont and around the \ncountry. While this bill does not fund a separate Clean Lakes Program I \ndo continue to support the language included in the fiscal year 1996 \nAppropriations bill and again in the House appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1997, clarifying that activities funded under the Clean \nLakes Program should continue to be funded under the 319 program.\n\n\n            robert s. kerr environmental research laboratory\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank my colleagues for including language in last year's report that \naccompanied the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill, \nencouraging the ground-water quality and remediation procedure research \nat the Kerr Environmental Research Laboratory in Ada, OK. I would like \nto particularly thank Subcommittee Chairman Bond and ranking member \nSenator Mikulski. I would also like to thank my colleagues for \nincluding the reauthorization of the Kerr Laboratory and University \nConsortium in the Senate-passed Safe Drinking Water Act. The Kerr \nEnvironmental Research Laboratory is a vital component of our country's \nenvironmental research. The laboratory is the premier ground water \nresearch facility in the United States and the world. The work \naccomplished at\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\nthis facility is vital to both the Drinking Water and Superfund \nprograms.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for raising the \nimportance of this research facility. The legislation under \nconsideration does not specifically reference the Kerr laboratory \nalthough the importance of its research is fundamental to many of the \nprograms at the Environmental Protection Agency. It is my understanding \nthat the purpose of the Kerr Laboratory is to develop the knowledge and \ntechnology needed to protect the United States' ground water supplies \nand conduct research to develop better ways to clean up existing ground \nwater contamination. This research is important for the recently \nreauthorized Safe Drinking Water Act and the Superfund Program.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my colleague from Missouri. As members of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee we share a concern that \nthe programs at the EPA should be grounded in sound science and that \nthe Agency must continue to produce sound scientific research to be \nused in the regulatory process. Continuing and encouraging the ground \nwater research at the Kerr Laboratory will not only help protect the \nenvironment but will ensure that newly developed knowledge and \ntechnology for ground water remediation at contaminated sites to be \nmade available to the remediation industry in a usable and timely \nmanner. This research facility is essential in continuing to protect \nour country's ground water resources and I urge the EPA to continue to \nsupport the Kerr Laboratory.\n\n\n            epa funding for the sokaogon chippewa community\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to engage the chairman of the subcommittee, \nthe Senator from Missouri, in a colloquy regarding EPA funding for the \nSokaogon Chippewa community in Wisconsin to assess the environmental \nimpacts of a proposed sulfide mine.\n  In the fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996 VA, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations Acts, funding has been provided to assist the \nSokaogon Chippewa community in Crandon, WI, in their efforts to gather \nthe baseline data needed to adequately assess the effects of a large \nsulfide mine proposed adjacent to their reservation. As a result of the \nproposed mine, concerns have been raised about the possible degradation \nof the ground and surface water in the area, as well as possible \nnegative effects on the wild rice production activities within the \nreservation.\n  I believe that the efforts undertaken by the Sokaogon Chippewa \ncommunity are very worthwhile, and have been helpful in allowing the \ntribe to contribute accurate and up-to-date data to the Federal \nagencies reviewing the mine proposal. Would the Senator from Missouri \nagree that this project is very worthwhile?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for raising the ongoing \nconcerns of the Sokaogon Chippewa community, and I concur with the \nSenator that their efforts to be proactive in assessing the potential \nefforts of mining on their lands are worthwhile and laudable.\n  Mr. KOHL. While funding has not been provided specifically for the \nSokaogon Chippewa in the Senate version of this year's bill, it is my \nunderstanding that there are many other opportunities for securing \nFederal funding for this project. First and foremost, I would like to \nrequest the chairman's strong consideration for this project during \nconference with the House. In the past 2 fiscal years, the conference \ncommittee has included funding for this project, and the same arguments \nfor its inclusion continue this year as well.\n  Mr. BOND. I assure the Senator from Wisconsin that I will certainly \ngive this project every consideration in conference. Further, there are \nmany additional options available for funding important projects such \nas this. For example, it is not unusual for EPA to fund projects \nthrough the reprogramming of funds from other programs or lower \npriority projects.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for his comments, and look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him on this matter.\n\n\n         west central florida alternative water source project\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the subcommittee has generously funded \nseveral alternative water source projects in west central Florida in \nthe last two EPA budgets. These funds have provided critical support to \nassist with the development of new technologies and applications to \nhelp ensure that the fastest growing State in the country will be able \nto keep up with the ever-increasing demand for water for potable, \nagricultural, commercial, and industrial uses. The subcommittee's \nsupport for these programs has been greatly appreciated as Senator \nGraham and I have been working with our colleagues in both the Senate \nand the House to establish an authorized program for Florida and other \nEastern States to assist with the development of alternative water \nsources similar to those currently available to most of the Western \nStates through the Bureau of Reclamation. Although the subcommittee was \nnot able to make any funds available during fiscal year 1997 for the \nprojects in Florida, I want to thank the chairman for his past support \nand look forward to working with him to address this important concern \nin next year's appropriations bill for EPA.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Florida and \ncommend him and others working on this to responsibly plan for our \nNation's future water supply needs. I share his concerns and look \nforward to working with him. I would note that the VA/HUD bill provides \n$1.275 billion for drinking water State revolving funds, providing much \nneeded assistance to every State for such meritorious projects as those \nraised by the Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                  upper midwest aeronautics consortium\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor including language in the report to accompany the fiscal year 1997 \nVA-HUD appropriations bill concerning the Upper Midwest Aeronautics \nConsortium [UMAC], a group of universities and businesses which are \nworking with NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. I would simply like to \nclarify one point about the report language.\n  Mr. BOND. We would be happy to engage in a colloquy with the Senator \non this matter.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The report language accompanying the bill states that \nUMAC has successfully completed an initial study of the concept of \nconverting Mission to Planet Earth [MTPE] data into practical \ninformation for use by the public and that NASA should give every \nconsideration to funding UMAC under a solicitation program for the \nexpanded use of MTPE data in the areas of agriculture, education and \nnatural resources. I would just like to clarify that UMAC is not \nlimited by the report language solely to funding under this grant \nprogram but can seek additional assistance from other NASA sources as \nwell.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. UMAC can seek \nfunding from any available sources within NASA, and is not limited to \nthe grant solicitation program mentioned in the Committee report.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is my understanding as well. I am very pleased \nwith the work accomplished by UMAC to date in making data from MTPE \navailable to the public. This kind of practical application of \nscientific data is exactly the type of public private partnership that \nwe should be encouraging. It has the potential for reaching thousands \nof our citizens, providing them with a broader base of understanding \nand support for the important work of Mission to Planet Earth.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to thank both Chairman Bond and Senator \nMikulski for this clarification.\n\n\n       DIABETES INSTITUTES AT THE EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Would the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee be willing to enter into a colloquy with this Senator \nconcerning some language included in the conference report to the House \npassed VA/HUD appropriations bill?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Missouri and I would be pleased to \nenter into a colloquy with the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my colleague and I say to my friends, we have in \nNorfolk, Virginia, a medical center--the Diabetes Institutes at the \nEastern Virginia Medical School--which is distinguished for its work in \ndiabetes research, education, and clinical care. The Diabetes\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\nInstitutes is interested in establishing a research program with the \nVeterans' Administration to reduce the cost of care to veterans with \ndiabetes. The House of Representatives included report language in \nsupport of the diabetes Institutes in this regard, and I wondered if \nthe Chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee here in the Senate \nwould be willing to work to retain the House language in conference.\n  Mr. BOND. I have no objection to the House report language.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be pleased to do what I can to retain the House \nlanguage in support of the Diabetes Institutes in the final conference \nreport.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my friends from Missouri and Maryland for their \nkind assistance with this matter.\n\n\n                  ONONDAGA LAKE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland about funding for the Onondaga Lake Management Conference. As \nthey both know, the conference was authorized in 1990 to develop a plan \nfor the cleanup of Onondaga Lake, the most polluted lake in the \ncountry. The commission is composed of the State and local officials \ninvolved in the cleanup effort, as well as representatives from the \nArmy Corps of Engineers and the EPA.\n  In addition to the ongoing planning effort, the Commission helps \nsupport pilot programs to restore plants and fish to the lake, \ndemonstration projects to measure oxygenation of the lake, remediation \nprojects to address combined sewer overflow problems, and other \nimportant initiatives.\n  Ongoing funding is necessary to complete the work of the conference, \nincluding these projects. I ask my colleagues to consider an allocation \nof $500,000 for the management conference when this bill goes to \nconference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am aware of the work being done by the management \nconference, and that we have funded it each year since fiscal year \n1990. I too hope we will be able to set aside funds for the operations \nof the conference.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree that we should try to identify funds to keep the \nmanagement conference in operation.\n\n\n                 sarasota bay national estuary program\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for the \nchairman's support of my efforts in coordination with Senators Graham, \nLieberman, and Dodd to clarify the EPA's authority to obligate funds to \nassist State and local governments in implementing comprehensive \nconservation and management plans prepared through the National Estuary \nProgram. It is important that we do this so that the knowledge we have \ngained since the program's inception is not lost for lack of the \nFederal Government being able to contribute its fair share for \nimplementation activities. On that point, Mr. Chairman, I would like to \ncall to your attention the committee report which expresses its support \nfor the administration's request for, among other EPA programs, the \nNational Estuary Program, and of particular interest to me, ``full \nfunding of the Sarasota Bay project.'' As the Chairman knows, the \nadministration's request for the NEP is not adequate to support a full \nimplementation effort and I would ask for your confirmation of the \nsubcommittee's intent that EPA make every effort to make funds \navailable from other programs to supplement its budget request for the \nNEP to support CCMP implementation efforts such as the Sarasota Bay \nproject.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Florida for bringing this \nimportant issue to the subcommittee's attention and appreciate his kind \nwords. We are glad to be able to help with this in cooperation with \nSenator Chafee and the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I \nconcur that EPA should provide adequate support to the NEP, and request \na reprogramming if necessary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I might ask the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations about \nthe EPA review of the national ambient air quality standard for \nparticulate matter. I understand that there are recent epidemiological \nstudies that indicate a correlation between exposure to air polluted \nwith particulates and adverse human health effects, and that EPA is \nstudying this matter as a high priority.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Idaho for raising this important \npoint. The EPA has indicated to our committee that it is highly \nconcerned about the health effects of particulates. We have met the \nEPA's request for funding for this program, and included $18.8 million. \nThese funds are for health effects research, exposure research, \nimproving monitoring technologies, modeling studies, and other key \nrequirements.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am pleased to learn that the committee has directed this \nlevel of funding to EPA for this important research. This comprehensive \nresearch program is very much needed. At present, there appears to be \ninsufficient data available for the agency to decide what changes, if \nany, should be made to the current standard. There is no scientific \nconsensus on whether it is necessary to change the current ambient air \nquality standards for particulate matter to protect human and \nenvironmental health. It has come to my attention that in a letter to \nEPA on June 13, 1996, EPA's own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee \nconcluded that ``our understanding of the health effects of \n[particulates] is far from complete,'' and these scientific \nuncertainties prevented the committee from agreeing on the agency's \nsuggested new particulate standards. In addition, the former chairman \nof this advisory committee who is now a consultant to the advisory \ncommittee, Roger McClellan, wrote the current chairman in May to advise \nhim that ``the current staff document does not provide a scientifically \nadequate basis for making regulatory decisions for setting of National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards and related control of particulate matter \nas specified in the Clean Air Act.'' Finally, in a peer-reviewed \narticle just published in the Journal of the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, scientists John Gamble and Jeffery Lewis \nconclude that the recent epidemiology studies that show statistically \nsignificant acute health effects of particulate air pollution do not \nmeet the criteria for causality. They suggest that the weak statistical \ncorrelations of increased mortality are as likely due to confounding by \nweather, copollutants, or exposure misclassification as they are by \nambient particulate matter.\n\n  As the chairman is aware, EPA is under a Federal court order to make \na final decision on whether to revise the current clean air rule \nregarding particulate matter. Under the court order, EPA must make a \nproposed decision on or before November 29, 1996, and a final decision \non or before June 28, 1997. Can the Chairman inform me whether the \ncourt order allows the agency to decide not to revise the particulate \nstandard until there is sufficient scientific basis for doing so?\n  Mr. BOND. It is my understanding that the court order only requires \nthe agency to make a final decision on whether to revise the current \nambient air standard for particulates, but the order does not require \nthe agency to promulgate a new standard.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If I might interject, the fact that EPA has found \nseveral studies that indicate a correlation between loading of \nparticulates in the air and premature mortality is important. This \nsuggested link to human health problems needs to be promptly and \nthoroughly investigated. My objective is to provide protection of \npublic health and the environment by designing control strategies that \nreduce harmful particulates and other pollutants form the air people \nbreathe. However, I am concerned that EPA may be rushed to judgment by \nthe Federal courts before real science has been developed to inform the \nagency about which particulates, in which geographic locations, and in \nwhich concentrations are harming people and the environment. There are \nmany questions that need to be answered about particulate matter, as \nEPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, referred to as ``CASC,'' \nmade clear in its June 13, 1996, letter to EPA--to which the Senator \nfrom Idaho just referred. For example, we do not know the mechanisms by \nwhich particulates might affect public health. Since 1988, particulate \nmatter concentrations have declined by more than 20 percent, with \nsubstantial future declines in particulates expected to result from \ncompliance with existing clean air standards. Moving forward with the \ntargeted research program recommended by the\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\nCASAC is essential to understand the health problems associated with \nparticulates. That better understanding of the health effects caused by \nparticulates is needed before we can design an effective control \nstrategy. I would note for my colleagues that this EPA advisory \ncommittee is meeting again in early September to design this \nparticulate research program.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If the chairman would yield, I would ask whether any \nof the money in the fiscal year 1997 funding for particulate research \nwill go to implementing an ambient air quality and emissions monitoring \nprogram, and will EPA be placing the monitors, or simply telling the \nStates to do it? We want to know not just whether this expense will \nbring any health benefits, but also whether it will create serious \nunfunded mandates problems. I would ask the chairman if he would join \nme in requesting that the EPA send the appropriate committees of \nCongress, within 90 days, a description of the monitoring program they \nwill be implementing and to what extent EPA will fund the cost of that \nprogram, and whether they intend to ask for additional funding in \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes; the agency has informed me that it will be using the \n1997 appropriation for both increased health effects research and, in \naddition, more than $2 million will be for initiating an emissions \nmonitoring program. In addition, it is my understanding EPA will be \nrequesting additional funds for monitoring in its fiscal year 1998 \nbudget submission. It is my expectation that the agency will request \nthe funds necessary to establish a thorough and scientifically \ndefensible monitoring program. I concur that EPA should send us a \ndescription of their proposed comprehensive monitoring program and a \nbudget proposal.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I agree with my colleagues that EPA should \nseriously consider a no change option as part of its proposed decision \ndue by November 29. However, I would add that in view of the potential \nfor harm to the public from particulates, a prudent option for the \nNovember deadline would be to reaffirm the current ambient air \nstandard--and thus not disrupt ongoing programs--while moving \nexpeditiously to implement a sound research agenda upon which to base \nfuture decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that EPA must pay closer attention \nto the potential adverse impacts of changes to the particulates \nstandard on small businesses. I am aware that EPA is taking the \nposition that changes to the particulates standard do not impact small \nbusiness in terms of implicating the Regulatory Flexibility Act, \nbecause the EPA's standards do not create burdens on small business, it \nis the State implementation plan. As a primary author of the 1996 \namendments to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I strongly disagree with \nthe agency's interpretation, and believe that EPA agency should fully \ncomply with the requirements imposed on Federal agencies by that act.\n\n\n                  nasa work force restructuring report\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to discuss an important issue with the \ndistinguished Chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee regarding \nNASA's civil servant work force and their collective future. Last month \nthe General Accounting Office [GAO] provided me with an assessment of \nNASA's efforts and plans to decrease its staffing levels. As ranking \nmember of the Governmental Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over the \nFederal civil service laws, I was keenly interested in learning how \nNASA was meeting its aggressive work force restructuring goals.\n  As my friends know, in the early 1990's, NASA was projecting its \ncivil service work force to be about 25,500; however, budget levels \nhave drastically changed that projection. Currently NASA's work force \nstands at about 21,500, and plans to reduce it to 17,500 by fiscal year \n2000. The GAO report, entitled ``NASA Personnel: Challenges to \nAchieving Workforce Reductions,'' discusses various steps NASA has \ntaken to reduce its work force to current levels. The GAO report \nsuggests that NASA should provide to Congress a work force \nrestructuring plan which lays out in detail how NASA intends to meet \nits work force goals. I would note that I have heard from employees at \nNASA's Lewis Research Center outside the Cleveland who are very \nconcerned about their future, and the future of NASA-Lewis. I will \ncontinue to do everything I can to make sure that Lewis remains a top \nflight research facility.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The subcommittee is deeply concerned about the \ntimetable and process which NASA intends to follow to achieve its \nstated goal of reducing the NASA work force from the current level to \n17,500 by the year 2000. Notwithstanding its civil service goals, the \nsubcommittee believes that NASA should maintain the institutional \ncapability to accomplish our national aerospace objectives.\n  In part due to the severe budget constraints the agency faces, \nvarious NASA initiatives have called for the following: One, shifting \nprogram management from headquarters to field centers; two, \ntransitioning to a single prime contractor for space flight operations; \nand three, privatization initiatives such as the science institute \nconcept. It is unclear how each of these proposals will contribute to \nthe future FTE goals.\n  Many employees at Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA's Wallops island \nfacility and headquarters are my constituents, and have expressed \nconcerns similar to those my friend from Ohio has heard from NASA \nLewis. I will stand sentry to ensure that as many jobs as possible are \nprotected. I have asked NASA headquarters to explain why their current \napproach is necessary.\n  Mr. BOND. I would add my recommendation that NASA develop a work \nforce restructuring plan to be submitted with the agency's fiscal year \n1998 budget. This document should provide NASA's current plan for \nreaching the fiscal year 2000 FTE figure. In developing this plan, the \nAdministrator shall consult with the Secretary of Labor, appropriate \nrepresentatives of local and national collective bargaining units of \nindividuals employed at NASA, appropriate representatives of agencies \nof State and local government, appropriate representatives of State and \nlocal institutions of higher education, and appropriate representatives \nof community groups affected by the restructuring plan.\n  Mr. GLENN. I strongly support that such a plan be submitted to the \nCongress. Further, I believe that for NASA headquarters and each field \ncenter, the plan should clearly establish the annual FTE targets by job \ndescription. The plan should also discuss what process and any \nassistance that will be provided to those employees whose jobs will be \neliminated or transferred. To the extent possible the plan should be \ndeveloped so as to minimize social and economic impact.\n  I would note that the Department of Energy has a legislative mandate \nto prepare a work force restructuring plan prior to any significant \nchange in the work force at any of DOE's facilities. I was a primary \nauthor of this legislative provision--Public Law 102-484, section 3161. \nI believe that NASA should take a careful look at how DOE has developed \ntheir work force restructuring plans as it prepares the plan which we \nare requesting.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree with the Senator from Ohio. In addition, the \nPresident has indicated the need for a national space summit to \nelucidate our national space goals. I have been calling for such a \nsummit for several months, and am pleased to see the President take \nthis necessary step. Clearly the results of the space summit should \nalso be incorporated into this work force restructuring plan.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend from Missouri and my friend from \nMaryland for their courtesy, and I would strongly encourage them to \nadopt language in the statement of the conference managers which would \nimplement the work force restructuring plan we have discussed today.\n  Mr. BOND. The subcommittee will seriously consider the Senator's \nsuggestion, and will work to implement it during the conference on our \nbill.\n\n\n Improvement and Reform of the Federal Aboveground Storage Tank Program\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as the Senate considers fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency, it is only \nfitting that we highlight the need for reform in the manner in which \nEPA, in conjunction with the Department of Transportation and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, regulates aboveground\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\npetroleum storage tanks [AST's]. Under current Federal law, no less \nthan five Federal offices are tasked with jurisdiction over these \ntanks. The myriad of Federal and State statutes coupled with the number \nof Federal offices administering the various regulations results in a \nsituation which is at best confusing for aboveground storage tank \nowners, costly to taxpayers, and harmful to the environment.\n  Twice, once in 1989 and again in 1995, GAO has issued reports which \ndetail how EPA should strengthen its program to improve the safety of \naboveground oil storage tanks. While it is true that EPA has taken \nsteps to implement some of the recommendations, EPA has yet to take \nsubstantive action on many others.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We are certainly committed to protecting and improving \nour environment. I would like to thank the distinguished Senator for \nhighlighting this issue. I know that his State experienced a serious \nleak at an aboveground storage tank farm in Fairfax County, VA. I am \ninterested in knowing how serious is the problem nationwide?\n  Mr. ROBB. In addition to the confusion created by the patchwork of \nlaws regulating these aboveground petroleum tanks, a far graver problem \nexists with respect to the frequency with which these tanks and their \npipes are currently leaking, releasing petroleum into the environment. \nTwo GAO studies, one in 1989 and the other in 1995, found a significant \nnumber of tanks were leaking between 43 and 54 million gallons of oil \nper year.\n  More recently, there have been countless news reports on tank \nreleases, leaks, failures and fires. Unfortunately, current Federal law \nonly requires tank owners to report releases that contaminate surface \nwater. There is no similar reporting requirement for underground leaks, \nand EPA does not have the authority to respond to leaks that \ncontaminate ground water. Just last month, lightening struck an AST at \na Shell gasoline facility in Woodbridge, NJ, igniting a fire that \nseriously injured 2 people and forced the evacuation of 200 nearby \nresidents.\n  Although this fire was started by an act of nature, it's instructive \nbecause it highlights the serious dangers associated with AST fires, \nwhich pose complex challenges to firefighters, jeopardize nearby \ncommunities, and threaten ground water contamination. From Anchorage, \nAK, to the Everglades in Florida, damage from leaking tanks has been \nincurred, and some areas permanently spoiled from millions of gallons \nof leaked oil. This problem poses a critical threat to our country's \nground, surface, and drinking water. With approximately half a million \nabove-ground storage tanks located throughout this Nation, this is \nsimply a matter we cannot continue to ignore. The tank fire in New \nJersey serves to further demonstrate the need for improvement of AST \nsafety and operation. The future safety of our families and homes \ndepends upon meaningful reform in this area.\n\n  I think my colleague from South Dakota can also shed some light on \nthis problem. Mr. President, would the Democratic leader please share \nhis State's experience with an AST release that occurred 6 years ago in \nSioux Falls.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Certainly, but first I want to take a moment to thank \nthe Senator from Virginia for his long-standing dedication and \nleadership on this issue. We have worked together on AST legislation \nsince the 102d Congress, and again I appreciate this opportunity to \nwork with him.\n  Senator Mikulski may remember that 6 years ago Sioux Falls suffered \nan AST leak of great magnitude. I can tell my colleague from personal \nobservation that the environmental and public health effects of the \nspill were devastating, not to mention the costly cleanup expenses \nincurred. We now have the means to prevent similar incidents in my \nState and throughout the Nation.\n  My colleague from Virginia indicated the two GAO reports confirm that \nAST leakage is a prevalent problem across the country.\n  Mr. ROBB. I want to add that the underground storage tank program at \nEPA has enjoyed a wide measure of success. It is both comprehensive and \nunderstandable. Certainly, the regulation of above-ground petroleum \ntanks warrants similar consideration. Also, EPA has established an \neffective response program to surface water oil-spills. EPA should now \nplace a focus on improving the safety of AST operations and on leaks to \nground water. This could only bolster EPA's spill prevention and \nresponse program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In the opinion of the Senator, what would be the most \neffective means of addressing the issue?\n  Mr. ROBB. First, a commonsense approach is necessary. We can improve \nthe Federal program so that it complements industry's efforts to \nimprove voluntary AST standards. Some say that industry and \nenvironmental groups cannot work together to improve the environment. I \nsimply do not believe this has to be the case.\n  In January, Senator Daschle, Senator Simpson, and I introduced a bill \non AST's that is the product of a coalition of several industry and \nenvironmental groups. Our bill seeks not only to improve the \nenvironment with respect to above-ground tanks, but also seeks to \nreduce the regulatory requirements on industry.\n  We need Federal legislation to improve and reform the Federal program \nregulating AST's. This will provide more clear, concise guidelines to \ntank owners and operators, and enable EPA to deal swiftly and \neffectively with threats to human health and the environment.\n  Specifically, the bill would require EPA to consolidate its \naboveground storage tank offices into one office on storage tanks. In \nconjunction with this restructuring, the bill requires EPA to work with \nthe Department of Transportation and the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration to streamline and simplify the current regulatory \nstructure affecting aboveground petroleum storage tanks and their \nowners.\n  To improve the safety of large AST's that store oil, the bill also \nrequires EPA to review current regulations to determine if gaps may \nexist, specifically with reference to secondary containment, overfill \nprevention, testing, inspection, compatibility, installation, corrosion \nprotection, and structural integrity of these large petroleum tanks. \nWhere current industry standards do not address those deficiencies \nidentified, the EPA would be responsible for promulgating rules in the \nmost cost-effective manner to alleviate those gaps.\n  Lastly, the bill would impose new reporting requirements for \npetroleum leaks so that EPA will know when they occur underground. EPA \nshould not have to wait until leaks are too large to ignore or until \nthey have contaminated an important ground water source.\n  I believe EPA has worked hard to implement a strong AST program. But \nI also know that more could be done. It is my hope that our bill will \nnot only compliment EPA's efforts, but also allow EPA to place a higher \npriority on this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would also like to emphasize one final point about our \nAST bill. We are more than aware of the frustration felt by many over \nthe development and enforcement of Federal regulations and the lack of \nsensitivity exhibited by Federal agencies, particularly in regard to \nenvironmental statutes.\n  The bill does not exacerbate this problem. Rather, Senator Robb, \nSenator Simpson, and I have worked together to ensure that our bill \ncreates workable and streamlined regulations to ensure proper \nprecautions are taken to prevent AST leakage and spills. This bill's \nsimplicity is its elegance. I thank the Senator for her attention to \nthis matter.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank my colleagues for bringing this important issue \nto the Senate's attention. I look forward to working with them to help \nreach some meaningful resolution to the problem at hand.\n  Mr. ROBB. I want to thank our distinguished ranking member for the \nopportunity to highlight the need for this type of reform and also look \nforward to working with her in the future.\n\n\n                                  NCAR\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. As the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee \nis aware, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is in \nthe process of procuring a supercomputer to conduct complex weather \nsimulation analyses. NCAR is a major grantee of the National Science \nFoundation, NSF.\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\n  NCAR published a request for proposals to provide the most capable \nsupercomputer for a fixed price of $35 million. Three companies made \nproposals--Fujitsu, NEC, and Cray Research.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am aware of the proposed procurement. NCAR initially \nselected NEC, but NSF announced last week that it is halting action on \nthe proposed procurement until the completion of an investigation into \nillegal dumping.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very concerned by the possibility of dumping in this \ncase. An internal analysis conducted by Cray Research estimated that \nNEC's costs exceed its sales price to NCAR by over 400 percent. \nAccording to Cray's analysis, NEC proposed selling a supercomputer \nfairly valued at almost $100 million for only $35 million.\n  The day after the selection of NEC was announced, Paul Joffe, Acting \nAssistant Secretary of the Department of Commerce for Import \nAdministration, advised Dr. Neal Lane, Director of the National Science \nFoundation, of the strong possibility of dumping in this case. In the \nletter, Secretary Joffe states:\n\n       Using standard methodology prescribed by the antidumping \n     law, we estimate that the cost of production of one of the \n     foreign bidders is substantially greater than the funding \n     levels projected by NCAR's request for proposals. In \n     antidumping law terms, this means that the ``dumping \n     margin,'' that is, the amount by which the fair value of the \n     merchandise to be supplied exceeds the export price, is \n     likely to be very high.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. On July 29, Cray Research filed a formal petition for \ninvestigation with the Department of Commerce and the International \nTrade Commission. Under the antidumping law, the Department of Commerce \nwas required to decide whether or not to initiate a formal \ninvestigation within 20 days. The ITC has 45 days to reach a \npreliminary determination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. On August 19, the Department of Commerce announced that \nit would initiate a formal antidumping investigation. The following \nday, Dr. Neal Lane, Director of the National Science Foundation \nannounced that the NSF was halting action on the supercomputer \nprocurement. Dr. Lane said in a written statement, ``It would be \ninappropriate for NSF to approve this procurement until the dumping \nissue has been resolved.'' I would ask the distinguished ranking member \nof the subcommittee if she agrees with Dr. Lane's view.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I do agree. I especially agree with Dr. Lane's \nstatement that ``Acting now on this procurement would be inconsistent \nwith the responsible stewardship of taxpayer money.'' It is critical, \nboth from an economic and national security perspective, that the \nUnited States maintain its leading role in supercomputing technology. \nBecause the supercomputer industry survives on relatively few sales, \neach procurement project plays an important role in maintaining the \nsupercomputer industrial and technology base. I therefore strongly \nconcur with the NSF's recent action.\n  Mr. KOHL. The committee report, which was filed on July 17, notes \nthat no official determination of dumping, preliminary or otherwise, \nhas been made in this case. Would the Senator agree that this statement \nis no longer accurate?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The decision by the Department of Commerce to initiate \na formal investigation is an official determination that illegal \ndumping may have occurred. Furthermore, the letter written earlier by \nSecretary Joffe strongly suggests the possibility of dumping.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the distinguished ranking member for sharing her \nviews on this important subject. I know that she shares my view that \nthe NSF is a very important agency and that this procurement is very \nimportant both for NCAR and the U.S. supercomputer industry.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will continue to monitor this situation and will do \nall I can to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly by the NSF \nand its grantees.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I ask unanimous consent that the \nstatement by NSF Director Neal Lane and the letter to Dr. Lane from \nSecretary Paul Joffe be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by Dr. Neal Lane, Director, National Science Foundation, on \n                       Supercomputer Acquisition\n\n       The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it is \n     initiating an investigation to determine whether Japanese \n     vector supercomputers were being dumped in the United States \n     and whether these imports were injuring the U.S. industry. \n     The investigation includes a bid submitted in a supercomputer \n     procurement being conducted by the University Corporation for \n     Atmospheric Research (UCAR)--an awardee of the National \n     Science Foundation. In my view, it would be inappropriate for \n     NSF to approve this procurement until the dumping issue has \n     been resolved.\n       In light of the numerous questions raised about and \n     interest expressed in this procurement, I am pleased that the \n     issue of dumping is being properly addressed by the \n     appropriate federal agencies. The Department of Commerce and \n     the International Trade Commission have the statutory \n     authority, the expertise, and the established procedures to \n     determine whether this offer is being made at less than fair \n     value, and whether it would be injurious to America industry.\n       I am acutely aware that the National Center for Atmospheric \n     Research (NCAR), which is operated by UCAR, needs state-of-\n     the-art computational equipment to maintain U.S. world \n     leadership in climate modeling research. I feel, however, \n     that acting now on this procurement would be inconsistent \n     with the responsible stewardship of taxpayer monies.\n       I hope the investigations will proceed expeditiously and \n     bring a prompt resolution to this matter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n\n                           International Trade Administration,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 1996.\n     Dr. Neal Lane,\n     Director, National Science Foundation,\n     Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Dr. Lane: The Department of Commerce is responsible \n     for administering the U.S. antidumping law, which guards \n     against unfair international pricing practices that harm U.S. \n     industries. Injurious dumping, which is condemned by the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, can have serious \n     adverse consequences for domestic producers and future \n     consumers.\n       As you requested, we have examined the proposed procurement \n     of a supercomputer system by the National Center for \n     Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which is funded in part by the \n     National Science Foundation and other federal agencies \n     through the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, \n     to determine if it involves dumping. We have evaluated the \n     NCAR procurement, and have information that we believe is \n     relevant.\n       Using standard methodology prescribed by the antidumping \n     law, we estimate that the cost of production of one of the \n     foreign bidders is substantially greater than the funding \n     levels projected by NCAR's request for proposals. In \n     antidumping law terms, this means that the ``dumping \n     margin,'' that is, the amount by which the fair value of the \n     merchandise to be supplied exceeds the export price, is \n     likely to be very high.\n       We have significant concerns that importation of the NCAR \n     supercomputer system would threaten the U.S. supercomputer \n     industry with material injury within the meaning of the \n     antidumping law, because the imports are likely to have a \n     significant suppressing or depressing effect on domestic \n     prices and because these imports could have a serious adverse \n     impact on the domestic industry's efforts to develop a more \n     advanced version of the supercomputer system to be supplied.\n       Antidumping investigations can be initiated either at the \n     request of the domestic industry or on the initiative of the \n     Department of Commerce. If the Department finds dumping \n     margins and the U.S. International Trade Commission finds \n     injury, the Department will issue an antidumping order and \n     will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to collect from the \n     importer of the dumped merchandise an antidumping duty in the \n     amount of the dumping margin.\n       Please let us know if we may answer any questions you may \n     have. I may be reached at (202) 482-1780.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul L. Joffe,\n\n                                        Acting Assistant Secretary\n                                        for Import Administration.\n\n\n                            lihprha funding\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate adopted an amendment to H.R. \n3666, which was included in a package of managers' amendments, and \nwhich originally was offered by the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. \nKerry], myself, and others. This amendment will restore some certainty \nto the Senate's appropriation for assistance under the Low Income \nHousing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act, or LIHPRHA. I \nappreciate the managers accepting this amendment.\n  Senators Moseley-Braun, Kemp- thorne, Kerry, and I had written \nChairman Bond earlier to express our support for appropriating at least \n$500 million for LIHPRHA this year, and to note that, within a tight \nand fiscally\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\nresponsible budget, this program remains a reasonable priority.\n  Mr. President, as always, I want to reiterate my commitment to \nbalancing the Federal budget and keeping it balanced. Balancing the \nbudget is all about setting priorities. This Congress, the bravest in \n40 years, has passed balanced budgets and I have supported them. I have \nno trouble finding room within those budgets for reasonable \nappropriations for LIHPRHA.\n  I have spoken with Idahoans--tenants and owners alike--who have \nturned to LIHPRHA as a cost-effective way to maintain private ownership \nof low-income housing, to preserve that housing stock, and to keep it \nin good repair. Just last month, such a transfer was concluded in \nMoscow, ID, involving a seller and buyer who care about tenants of \nmodest means and wanted to see their affordable housing maintained.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill, as reported, had stated its hope and \nintent that $500 million is available for LIHPRHA in fiscal year 1997.\n  But, because $150 million of that appropriation would have been \nconditioned on recapturing interest savings when some owners sell what \nwe call section 236 projects and pre-pay their mortgages, the timing of \nthat funding stream would have been highly uncertain.\n  Such uncertainty would hamper effective decisionmaking in HUD's \nregional offices and would discourage the very buyers and sellers who \nwant to keep low-income housing available to those who need it. This \npreservation has noble, beneficial goals. But the current process \nalready takes too long and involves too much redtape. We don't need to \nmake things worse by making the timing its funding still more \nunpredictable.\n  Also, it would have mixed apples and oranges to rely on money \ngenerated when housing loses its status as low-income housing to pay \nfor a program intended to preserve low-income housing.\n  Our amendment offers the best of both worlds. The funding stream for \nLIHPRHA would be more certain. Any unexpected surplus section 236 \nsavings would go to deficit reduction. This creates a win-win \nsituation.\n  Our amendment is budget-neutral because LIHPRHA simply would be de-\ncoupled from the section 236 recaptured interest savings. These savings \nwould continue, as they do under current law, to go into the Treasury, \ninstead of being made directly available to LIHPRHA. This makes more \nsense.\n  Chairman Bond and I have visited about this program last year and I \nappreciate his continued willingness to support this program. I know \nthe committee has been looking for the best means of continuing the \nprogram. I hope and believe that our amendment has been helpful to the \nchairman and the committee in this regard.\n  Once this bill goes to conference, I urge the committee to do \neverything possible to safeguard LIHPRHA funding. It is my hope that, \nif possible, the conference committee on this bill could provide more \nfor this program.\n  The $500 million in this bill represents a 20 percent cut from fiscal \nyear 1996 dollars. Even at this level, there is much more low-income \nhousing ready for sale that can be accommodated by fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations for preservation. These are projects for which most of \nthe work on the part of the sellers and buyers has been completed, and \nfor which HUD has approved plans of action. Obviously, some sellers \nwill not be able to postpone selling until fiscal year 1998--if there \nare appropriations then--and will have to sell sooner, without the \nguarantee of preserving the low-income status of the housing.\n  I understand there are concerns that the results of this program may \nnot be as favorable and economical in every case as has been our \nexperience in Idaho. Some reforms can and should be made that would \nmake the program more cost-effective. Chairman Bond and Senator Kerry \nare both members of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, \nand I look forward to their leadership in this area.\n  I thank Senator Kerry for his leadership on this amendment, I commend \nChairman Bond for his helpfulness in this process, and I thank the \nmanagers and the Senate for accepting our amendment.\n\n\n   The President's Executive Order to bring Federal surplus computer \n                      equipment to public schools\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Earlier this year President Clinton signed Executive Order \n1299 to aid in the process of transferring Federal surplus computer \nequipment to our public schools. This is equipment that in the past has \nsat on palettes in Federal warehouses gathering dust and becoming \nobsolete while schools all around the country try to scrape together \nthe funds to buy computer technology equipment for their students.\n  I applaud the administration's effort to put this unused equipment to \nwork in our classrooms. To help support that initiative I offered an \namendment to the Treasury, Postal Service, and general Government \nappropriations bill with Senator Murray which reiterates the importance \nof this initiative and urges Federal Agencies to work with the Federal \nExecutive Boards to implement it. I also strongly supported Senator \nMurray's language in the legislative branch appropriations bill \nbringing the Senate into compliance with the Executive order. We in \nCongress should be leading the effort to bring computer technology to \nour public schools.\n  Making unused computer equipment available to schools is too \nimportant to let fall between the cracks of the many bureaucracies \ninvolved in this initiative. A report to Congress at the end of the \nyear is needed to ensure that the Executive order is carried out and to \nmonitor its progress in bringing Federal surplus computers to our \neducators. The Office of Science and Technology Policy has been deeply \ninvolved in coordinating the implementation of the Executive order. I \nbelieve that the office is the appropriate one to carry out such a \nreport.\n  I have written to John Gibbons, Director of OSTP requesting that his \noffice provide such a report to Congress by January 30, 1997. He \nresponded by concurring that such a report is needed and offering the \nservices of his office to carry it out within available resources. I \nask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1996.\n     Mr. John H. Gibbons,\n     Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Old \n         Executive Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Gibbons: I would like to congratulate you on the \n     work your office has done to implement the President's \n     Executive order to bring Federal surplus computer equipment \n     to schools. This initiative is sorely needed to transfer \n     serviceable computer equipment no longer needed by Federal \n     Agencies to our public schools where the need for this \n     technology is great.\n       Senator Murray and I offered an amendment to the Fiscal \n     Year 1997 Appropriations report for Treasury, Postal Service, \n     and General Government which reinforces the importance of the \n     Executive Order and urges governmentwide cooperation in \n     speeding its implementation. I also strongly supported \n     Senator Murray's language in the Legislative Appropriations \n     bill bringing the United States Senate into compliance with \n     the Executive Order. Congress should be leading the charge to \n     bring surplus and excess computer equipment to our schools--\n     Senator Murray's language will put the Senate in the race. \n     For your information, I have included a copy of the report \n     language in the Treasury and Legislative Appropriation bills.\n       I believe that the steps Federal Agencies are taking to \n     conform with the Executive Order will be effective in \n     bringing more surplus equipment to schools at less cost to \n     the government and the schools themselves. A timely analysis \n     of the progress that has been made and the problems \n     Departments and the Federal Executive Boards may have run \n     into would be very helpful in evaluating the success of the \n     initiative. Because of the central role your office has \n     played in this important effort to bring computers to \n     schools, I think the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     (OSTP) is the most appropriate body to carry out such an \n     evaluation.\n       Specifically, I request that OSTP report to Congress by \n     January 30, 1997 on the implementation of the Federal \n     Executive Order. This report should include information on \n     the progress of Federal Agencies and Congress in making \n     surplus computer equipment available to schools, and on the \n     effectiveness of the Federal Executive Boards in channeling \n     this equipment through the regions.\n       I look forward to working with your office to make sure \n     that unused Federal computer equipment is made available to \n     schools around the country. If you have any questions about \n     the requested report please contact Amy Rainone in my office \n     at 224-4242.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  \n\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and \n           Technology Policy,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As you know the President has worked \n     hard to ensure that education technology is used effectively \n     to prepare our children for the 21st century. I want to thank \n     you for the leadership you have provided in helping America's \n     schools make effective use of new technology. Your leadership \n     in the Senate Education Technology Working group is very much \n     appreciated.\n       I strongly concur with your recommendation that a study be \n     conducted to determine how effectively the executive order to \n     improve the transfer of excess federal computer equipment to \n     schools and nonprofit organizations is being implemented. \n     Within the limits of OSTP's resources, we will survey the way \n     federal agencies are responding to the order and provide an \n     estimate of the kinds of equipment that is being made \n     available to schools. The study will be provided to the \n     Congress by January 30, 1997 together with recommendations \n     about any administrative or legislative actions that may be \n     needed to improve the operation of the federal program and \n     advice about the need for further reviews and oversight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John H. Gibbons,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Maryland support the \nuse of OSTP funds to cover the expenses of preparing this important \nreport for Congress?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree that this is an important initiative and one \nwhich Congress should support. Maryland schools are also trying very \nhard to ramp up to the information highway by providing Internet links \nand computer technology for students. I do think that producing such a \nreport is an appropriate use of the funds provided in this bill and I \njoin the Senator in urging OSTP to carry out the report by January 30, \n1997.\n\n\n            Corporation for National Service, AmeriCorps USA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to talk about the Senate's \nappropriation for the Corporation for National Service. In particular, \nI want to talk about the appropriation for AmeriCorps. The program is \nnot yet out of the woods. Though the program may be funded, the Senate \nshould do so only with continued and close scrutiny.\n  I have been one of the most outspoken critics of the President's \nAmeriCorps Program. It has begun reform, but still needs more time to \nsucceed. AmeriCorps has former Senator Harris Wofford as its new chief \nexecutive officer. He has approached me for assistance in helping the \nprogram to succeed.\n  Senator Wofford has assured me that he is attempting to reform the \nprogram. I think that the program deserves that chance. It is a high \npriority for the President, and I believe that a President should have \nthe benefit of the doubt on his highest priorities. However, this \nprogram still needs to meet the tough standards that the President set. \nFrankly, AmeriCorps has not yet met those standards.\n  I want to praise the appropriators. In their subcommittee, Senators \nBond and Mikulski have funded the National Service Corporation for \nfiscal 1997 at last year's levels. Because of my involvement, I am \nparticularly proud of one new initiative to be funded in the AmeriCorps \nProgram.\n\n\n                       Awards for Education Only\n\n  I want to draw attention to this new cost saving initiative that I \nhelped to develop. Of the entire appropriation for the National Service \nTrust, $9.5 million will be set aside to award true education \nscholarships for service. AmeriCorps has announced that it is awarding \nthe first of 2,000 separate volunteers with scholarships, and only \nscholarships.\n  In other words, for volunteerism there shall be a reward of \neducation. Gone will be the living allowances, recruitment costs, and \nmuch of the administrative overhead. These education-only awards will \nhelp true students go to college. The taxpayers will be rewarded with a \ngreater value for their dollar. I believe that this pilot project may \nbecome so successful that it could become the future of AmeriCorps.\n\n\n                         Matching Requirements\n\n  Senator Wofford has told me he has increased the program matching \nrequirement for all grantees. This requirement was 25 percent and has \nbecome 33 percent. This means that 67 percent of the program subsidy \nfor AmeriCorps volunteers should come directly from the Federal \ntaxpayer. This might seem attractive to some, but I have reservations.\n  I am reserved because, if there is an immediate problem with this \ntarget, then the problem could be in the sources of the 33 percent \nmatching funds. It seems that a sizable portion of these matching funds \nwill come from coffers of State governments. Because State taxpayers \nare also Federal taxpayers, I think that the State taxpayers reasonably \nexpect that we in the Federal Government will do careful oversight of \ntheir tax dollars. That is why I hope that AmeriCorps will quantify and \nreach an acceptable goal for true private sector contributions. I \nemphasize the words private sector, and I hope that AmeriCorps will \nadopt a similar emphasis.\n\n\n                            A New GAO Study\n\n  In its brief history, AmeriCorps has developed an infamous past. The \ninspector general of the Corporation for National Service attempted to \naudit the AmeriCorps' books and determined that the books were \nunauditable. There has been a lack of financial controls. It seems that \nsome people who were in charge of writing checks were also in charge of \naccounting for receipts.\n  Last year, the General Accounting Office found that the AmeriCorps \ncost per participant was $27,000 instead of the $18,000 promised by the \nPresident.\n  This year, Senator Bond and I have asked the General Accounting \nOffice to conduct another study. The GAO will go out to study the \nAmeriCorps programs at the State level.\n  The GAO will audit matching funds gathered by the State programs. The \nGAO will also look into the feasibility of giving more responsibility \nto the State commissions under the AmeriCorps Program. Greater autonomy \nfor the State programs is a criterion that was reached in my agreement \nwith Senator Wofford.\n\n\n        The President's New AmeriCorps Initiative, Read America\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I want to briefly discuss something \nregarding AmeriCorps that the President mentioned at his political \nconvention. He mentioned that he would like to employ AmeriCorps \nsubsidized workers to help teach some children to read. Although \nteaching children to read is a worthy cause, I will say two things \nabout using AmeriCorps to do it.\n  First, as far as I am concerned, AmeriCorps is still on probation \nuntil it solves all of its current and continuing troubles. I question \nthe wisdom of sending more money and increased responsibility to \nAmeriCorps until it has proven to the taxpayers that it is out of the \nwoods.\n  The President has called for a massive increase in a program that has \nonly had trouble. That plays into the claims of many that the President \nhas no real interest in seeing AmeriCorps succeed. To them it shows \nthat the President is only interested in seeing it used for campaign \npromises and political commercials.\n  Second, I think that if the President wants to help kids to learn to \nread, then he should allow parents to help their own kids to learn to \nread. He could do this by delivering on the middle class-tax cut that \nhe promised. With fewer taxes, maybe both parents in a family will not \nhave to work full time as they currently do. I think that many parents \nwould enjoy teaching their own children to read if they only had the \ntime. In short, families do not need more government spending, they \nneed less government spending and fewer taxes.\n  Mr. President, AmeriCorps has reported that it is attempting to mend \nits programs. I think that the program deserves that chance. I \nconservatively support this appropriation with the reservations that I \nhave spoken of.\n\n\n                safe drinking water revolving loan fund\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the managers of this \nbill, Senators Bond and Mikulski, for providing the first-time \ncapitalization grant for the long awaited safe drinking water revolving \nloan fund. The much needed $725 million for the recently established \ndrinking water loan fund will provide assistance to those drinking \nwater suppliers who are trying to comply with the Federal law.\n  There are so many communities, especially small communities, that \nneed\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\nthe funding and have been counting on Congress to act. Small \ncommunities lack the economies of scale to spread the cost of \ncompliance among their customers, even though they have to comply with \nthe same regulations as large systems. The bill signed into law last \nmonth recognizes these differences by, among other things, providing a \nfunding source.\n  I appreciate the manager's recognition of this need and look forward \nto working with them in the future to ensure that this new loan fund \nmeets the needs of the Nation's drinking water suppliers.\n\n\n               YOUTHBUILD BUILDS FOUNDATIONS FOR SUCCESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank and congratulate my \ncolleagues on the VA, HUD, Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for their wisdom in \nproviding $40 million for the Youthbuild program for fiscal year 1997. \nThis amount is the same approved by the Senate last year for the \ncurrent fiscal year, which was cut in half in negotiations with the \nHouse.\n  The Youthbuild Program gives young adults in our inner cities a \nchance. This program offers young adults ages 16 to 24 the opportunity \nto rehabilitate housing for the homeless or low-income people while \nattending academic and vocational training classes half time. \nParticipants typically alternate a week on a construction site with a \nweek in the Youthbuild classroom, where they work toward their GED's or \nhigh school diplomas. Youthbuild programs usually run for 12 months, \nafter which graduates are placed in jobs or college. The programs are \nable to provide another 12 months of followup to assist these graduates \nto successfully complete their transitions from school to work.\n  The design of Youthbuild makes it unique among job training and \ncommunity development programs. Youthbuild places a major emphasis on \nleadership development, with leadership defined as taking \nresponsibility to make things go right for yourself, your family, and \nyour community. Intensive counseling and a positive peer group provide \npersonal support and an affirmative set of values to assist young \npeople to make a dramatic change in their relationship to their \ncommunities and their own families. Thus, through Youthbuild's \nlearning, construction, and personal components, students \nsimultaneously gain the educational skills, work training, and sense of \nself they need to go on to productive, responsible futures.\n  In 1995 alone, Youthbuild programs helped more than 3,000 young \npeople to become positive leaders and peer models in their communities. \nThere are now 90 HUD-funded Youthbuild programs in operation in 38 \nStates, and 56 organizations are planning to establish Youthbuild \nprograms in their own cities and rural communities. Over 540 community \norganizations in 49 States and the District of Columbia applied to HUD \nlast year for Youthbuild funding.\n  Despite the program's success, fiscal 1996 funding for this program \nwas cut from $40 to $20 million at the behest of the House of \nRepresentatives. The Senate bill had contained a $40 million earmark. A \nreturn to the 1995 funding level is necessary if we are to maintain the \nachievements and realize the promise of this valuable movement. This \nprogram and the young people it serves--who also are the young people \nwho do much of its work--need our help. They are some of the best that \nwe have in this country and I am proud of their achievements and their \ndrive to help themselves and to help others around them. They are a \nclass act and the work they do is truly inspiring.\n\n  The $40 million for Youthbuild for fiscal year 1997 will allow \nYouthbuild to enroll 2,000 more young people nationwide, directly \nhelping at-risk youth and furthering the development of affordable \nhousing for the communities in which they live. It will preserve the \ninfrastructure of local programs upon which we can then build and \nexpand while steadily leveraging increased local support. I want to \nthank the 38 other Senators signing a letter to Senators Bond and \nMikulski requesting the $40 million figure and I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to insist on this amount in conference.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to offer my sincere congratulations \nto Ms. Dorothy Stoneman, the founder and president of Youthbuild USA, \nfor her tireless and selfless contributions to the Youthbuild Program \nand to youth across the United States. She was recently awarded the \nprestigious MacArthur Foundation Award in recognition of her long fight \nto uplift the lives of youths on the margins of poor communities. She \nis a wonderful example of how individuals can really do good for others \nin this world and I want to make known my great admiration and praise \nfor her efforts. This award is a testament to her hard work, and to the \nyouth that are making our cities and towns better places to live every \nday. Her vision is inspiring and her enthusiasm contagious.\n  When people say that nothing works, when people say that poverty is \ninevitable, and when people say that there is no way to change \ninjustice, Ms. Dorothy Stoneman is there to demonstrate that futility \nis not inevitable. She is a real life hero and I would like to thank \nher for her commitment to excellence. But what Dorothy Stoneman wants \nmore than anyone's words of praise is the ability to offer to more \nyoung people Youthbuild's demonstrated ability to help young people \ntake responsibility for themselves and their communities--to rescue \ndown and out youths for lives of fulfillment and contribution. We help \nour country when we help these young people via Youthbuild.\n\n\n rouge river national wetweather demonstration project and the clinton \n                            river watershed\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers have made \nchanges to the House-passed bill to allow the expenditure of $725 \nmillion in already appropriated funds for the new drinking water State \nrevolving fund in fiscal year 1996. I encourage the conferees to retain \nthis change so that money can flow to the States and local governments \nas soon as possible.\n  As my colleagues may know, the Rouge River National Wetweather \nDemonstration Project serves as a model for watershed-basin management, \nbut on a very large, very urban scale. It combines all the key \ncomponents affecting water quality in the Rouge watershed, which feeds \ninto the Detroit River and then into Lake Erie. Cleaning up the Rouge \nRiver basin will have a beneficial effect on water quality from Detroit \nto the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and beyond. The House bill \nprovides $20 million in fiscal year 1997 for this important project and \nI strongly urge the managers and the conferees to maintain that amount, \nif the final conference report includes project level recommendations.\n  Also, I would like to urge inclusion of approximately $500,000 for \nthe Clinton River watershed Council in the conference report. The \nClinton River Watershed feeds into Lake St. Clair, which experienced \nsevere pollution in the summer of 1994 that closed beaches and \nthreatened the local economy. Nutrient loadings, sewage overflows, and \nzebra mussel infestation contributed to a very unpleasant, if not \npublic health-threatening situation. Clearly, something needs to be \ndone in this dynamic part of Michigan to ensure that growth is \nsustainable. I encourage the managers and the conferees to include the \nabove requested funds so that an integrated and comprehensive watershed \nmanagement plan can be developed and executed. Some of the methods and \nexperiences of the Rouge watershed will be very useful in the Clinton \nwatershed.\n  I look forward to working with the conferees on these items.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe that concludes the work on the VA-\nHUD bill for the evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9821-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Statutory Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     Congressional employees and employing offices.\n       Section 220 of the CAA address the application of chapter \n     71 of title 5, United States Code (``chapter 71''), relating \n     to Federal Service Labor-Management Relations. Section 220(a) \n     of the CAA applies the rights, protections, and \n     responsibilities established under sections 7102, 7106, 7111 \n     through 7117, 7119 through 7122, and 7131 of chapter 71 to \n     employing offices, covered employees, and representatives of \n     covered employees.\n       Section 220(d) of the Act requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance (``Board'') to issue regulations \n     to implement section 220 and further states that, except as \n     provided in subsection (e), such regulations ``shall be the \n     same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority (``FLRA'') to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except--\n       (A) to the extent that the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown and stated together with the regulations, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section; or\n       (B) as the Board deems necessary to avoid a conflict of \n     interest or appearance of conflict of interest.''\n\n     The Board adopted final regulations under section 220(d), and \n     submitted them to Congress for approval on July 9, 1996.\n       Section 220(e)(1) of the CAA requires that the Board issue \n     regulations ``on the manner and extent to which the \n     requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 . . . should apply \n     to covered employees who are employed in the offices listed \n     in'' section 220(e)(2). The offices listed in section \n     220(e)(2) are:\n       (A) the personal office of any member of the House of \n     Representatives or any Senator;\n       (B) a standing select, special, permanent, temporary, or \n     other committee of the Senate or House of Representatives, or \n     a joint committee of Congress;\n       (C) the Office of the Vice President (as President of the \n     Senate), the Office of the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Office of \n     the Majority Whip of the Senate, the Office of the Minority \n     Whip of the Senate, the Conference of the Majority of the \n     Senate, the Conference of the Minority of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Secretary of the Conference of the Majority of \n     the Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the Conference of \n     the Minority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for \n     the Majority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for \n     the Minority of the Senate, the Majority Policy Committee of \n     the Senate, the Minority Policy Committee of the Senate, and \n     the following offices within the Office of the Secretary of \n     the Senate: Offices of the Parliamentarian, Bill Clerk, \n     Legislative Clerk, Journal Clerk, Executive Clerk, Enrolling \n     Clerk, Official Reporters of Debate, Daily Digest, Printing \n     Services, Captioning Services, and Senate Chief Counsel for \n     Employment;\n       (D) the Office of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Majority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, the Office of the Minority Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, the Offices of the Chief \n     Deputy Majority Whips, the Offices of the Chief Deputy \n     Minority Whips, and the following offices within the Office \n     of the Clerk of the House of Representatives: Offices of \n     Legislative Operations, Official Reporters of Debate, \n     Official Reporters to Committees, Printing Services, and \n     Legislative Information;\n       (E) the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate, \n     the Office of the Senate Legal Counsel, the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives, the \n     Office of the General Counsel of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Parliamentarian of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Office of the Law Revision \n     Counsel;\n       (F) the offices of any caucus or party organization;\n       (G) the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of \n     Technology Assessment, and the Office of Compliance; and,\n       (H) such other offices that perform comparable functions \n     which are identified under regulations of the Board.\n\n     These offices shall be collectively referred to as the \n     ``section 220(e)(2) offices.''\n       Section 220(e)(1) provides that the regulations which the \n     Board issues to apply chapter 71 to covered employees in \n     section 220(e)(2) offices ``shall, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, be consistent with the provisions and purposes \n     of chapter 71 and of [the CAA] . . '' To this end, section \n     220(e)(1) mandates that such regulations ``shall be the same \n     as substantive regulations issued by the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority under such chapter,'' with two separate \n     and distinct provisos:\n       First, section 220(e)(1)(A) authorizes the Board to modify \n     the FLRA's regulations ``to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n       Second, section 220(e)(1)(B) directs the Board to issue \n     regulations that ``exclude from coverage under this section \n     any covered employees who are employed in offices listed in \n     [section 220(e)(2)] if the Board determines that such \n     exclusion is required because of (i) a conflict of interest \n     or appearance of a conflict of interest; or (ii) Congress' \n     constitutional responsibilities.''\n       The provisions of section 220 are effective October 1, \n     1996, except that, ``[w]ith respect to the offices listed in \n     subsection (e)(2), to the covered employees of such offices, \n     and to representatives of such employees, [section 220] shall \n     be effective on the effective date of regulations under \n     subsection (e).''\n\n               II. Advance notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       In an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') \n     published on March 16, 1996, the Board provided interested \n     parties and persons with the opportunity to submit comments, \n     with supporting data, authorities and argument, concerning \n     the content of and bases for any proposed regulations under \n     section 220. Additionally, the Board sought comment on two \n     specific issues related to section 220(e)(1)(A): (1)Whether \n     and to what extent the Board should modify the regulations \n     promulgated by the FLRA for application to employees in \n     section 220(e)(2) offices? and (2) Whether the Board should \n     issue additional regulations concerning the manner and extent \n     to which the requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 apply \n     to employees in section 220(e)(2) offices? The Board also \n     sought comment on four issues related to section \n     220(e)(1)(B): (1) What are the constitutional \n     responsibilities and/or conflicts of interest (real or \n     apparent) that would require exclusion of employees in \n     section 220(e) offices from coverage? (2) Whether \n     determinations as to such exclusions should be made on an \n     office-wide basis or on the basis of job duties and \n     functions? (3) Which job duties and functions in section \n     220(e) offices, if any, should be excluded from coverage, and \n     what is the legal and factual basis for any such exclusion? \n     and (4) Are there any offices not listed in section 220(e)(2) \n     that are candidates for the application of the section \n     220(e)(1)(B) exclusion and, if so, why? In seeking comment on \n     these issues, the Board emphasized the need for detailed \n     legal and factual support for any proposed modifications in \n     the FLRA's regulations and for any additional proposed \n     regulations implementing sections 220(e)(1)(A) and (B).\n       The Board received two comments in response to the ANPR. \n     These comments addressed only the issue of whether the Board \n     should grant a blanket exclusion for all covered employees in \n     certain section 220(e)(2) offices. Neither commenter \n     addressed issues arising under section 220(e)(1)(A) or any \n     other issues arising under 220(e)(1)(B).\n\n                 III. The notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       On May 23, 1996, the Board published a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``NPR'') (142 Cong. R. S5552-56, H5563-68 (daily \n     ed., May 23, 1996)) in the Congressional Record. Pursuant to \n     section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, the NPR set forth the \n     recommendations of the Executive Director and the Deputy \n     Executive Directors for the House and the Senate.\n\n                        A. Section 220(e)(1)(A)\n\n       In its proposed regulations, the Board noted that, under \n     section 220(e)(1)(A), the Board is authorized to modify the \n     FLRA's regulations only ``to the extent that Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\n     rights and protections under [section 220(e)].'' The Board \n     further noted that no commenter had taken the position that \n     there was good cause to modify the FLRA's regulations for \n     more effective implementation of section 220(e). Nor did the \n     Board independently find any basis to exercise its authority \n     to modify the FLRA regulations for more effective \n     implementation of section 220(e). Thus, the Board proposed \n     that, except as to employees whose exclusion from coverage \n     was found to be required under section 220(e), the \n     regulations adopted under section 220(d) would apply to \n     employing offices, covered employees, and their \n     representatives under section 220(e).\n\n                        B. Section 220(e)(1)(B)\n\n       With regard to section 220(e)(1)(B), the Board concluded \n     that the requested blanket exclusion of all of the employees \n     in certain section 220(e)(2) offices was not required under \n     the stated statutory criteria. However, the Board did propose \n     a regulation that would have allowed the exclusion issue to \n     be raised with respect to any particular employee in any \n     particular case. In addition, the Board again urged \n     commenters who supported any categorical exclusions, in \n     commenting on the proposed regulations, to explain why \n     particular jobs or job duties require exclusion of particular \n     employees so that the Board could exclude them by regulation, \n     where appropriate.\n\n                        C. Section 220(e)(2)(H)\n\n       Finally, in response to a commenter's assertion and \n     supporting information, the Board found that employees in \n     four offices identified by the commenter performed functions \n     ``comparable'' to those performed by employees in the other \n     section 220(e)(2) offices. Accordingly, the Board proposed, \n     pursuant to section 220(e)(2)(H), to identify those offices \n     in its regulations as section 220(e)(2) offices.\n\n             IV. Analysis of comments and final regulations\n\n       The Board received six comments on the NPR, five from \n     congressional offices and one from a labor organization. Five \n     commenters objected to the proposed regulations because all \n     covered employees in the section 220(e)(2) offices were not \n     excluded from coverage. These commenters further suggested \n     that the Board has good cause, pursuant to section \n     220(e)(1)(A), to modify the FLRA's regulations by \n     promulgating certain additional regulations. One of the \n     commenters stated its approval of the proposed regulations.\n       The Board has carefully reexamined the statutory \n     requirements embodied in 220(e), and evaluated the comments \n     received, as well as the recommendations of the Office's \n     statutory appointees. Additionally, the Board has looked to \n     ``the principles and procedures'' set forth in the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553 (``APA''), \n     which sections 220(e) and 304 of the CAA require the Board \n     to follow its rulemakings. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384(b). \n     Finally, the Board has carefully considered the \n     constitutional provisions and historical practices that \n     make Congress a distinct institution in American \n     government.\n       Based on its analysis of the foregoing, on the present \n     rulemaking record, the Board has determined that:\n\n       under the terms of the CAA, the requirements and exemptions \n     of chapter 71 shall apply to covered employees who are \n     employed in section 220(e)(2) offices in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as those requirements and exemptions are \n     applied to covered employees in all other employing offices;\n       no additional exclusions from coverage of any covered \n     employees of section 220(e) offices because of (i) a conflict \n     of interest or appearance of conflict of interest or (ii) \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities are required; and\n       in accord with section 220(e)(2)(H) of the CAA, eight \n     additional offices beyond those identified in the Board's NPR \n     perform ``comparable functions'' to those offices identified \n     in section 220(e)(2).\n\n       The Board is adopting final regulations that effectuate \n     these conclusions. The Board's reasoning for its \n     determinations, together with its analysis of the comments \n     received, is as follows:\n\n                 A. Section 220(e)(1)(A) Modifications\n\n       Section 220(e)(1) provides that the Board ``shall issue \n     regulations pursuant to section 304 on the manner and extent \n     to which the requirements and exemptions of chapter 71 should \n     apply to covered employees'' in section 220(e)(2) offices. In \n     response to the Board's ANPR, no commenter suggested that the \n     Board's regulations should apply differently to section \n     220(e)(2) employees and employing offices than to other \n     covered employees and employing offices. Several commenters \n     have now suggested that the regulations should be modified in \n     various respects for section 220(e)(2) employees who are not \n     excluded pursuant to section 220(e)(1)(B). The Board, \n     however, is not persuaded by any of these suggestions.\n       First, contrary to one suggestion, the Board is neither \n     required nor permitted ``to issue regulations specifying in \n     greater detail the application of [Chapter 71] to the \n     specific offices listed in section 220(e)(2).'' Section \n     220(e)(1) provides that the Board's ``regulations shall, to \n     the greatest extent practicable, be consistent with the \n     provisions and purposes of chapter 71 and of the Act.'' \n     Section 220(e)(1) further specifically states that the \n     Board's ``regulations shall be the same as substantive \n     regulations issued by the Federal Labor Relations Authority \n     under'' chapter 71. (Emphasis added.) While section \n     220(e)(1)(B) makes an ``except[ion]'' to these statutory \n     restrictions ``to the extent that the Board may determine, \n     for good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section,'' this exception neither \n     authorizes nor compels the requested regulations.\n       As the Board has explained in other rulemakings, it is not \n     possible to clarify by regulation the application of the \n     pertinent statutory provisions and/or the pertinent executive \n     branch agency's regulations (here, the FLRA's regulations) \n     while at the same time complying with the statutory \n     requirement that the Board's regulations be ``the same as \n     substantive regulations'' of the pertinent executive branch \n     agency. Moreover, modification of substantive law is legally \n     distinct from clarification of it. In this context, to \n     conclude otherwise would improperly defeat the CAA's \n     intention that, except where strictly necessary, employing \n     offices in the legislative branch should live with and under \n     the same regulatory regime--with all of its attendant burdens \n     and uncertainties--that private employers and/or executive \n     branch agency employers live with and under. Much as the \n     Chairman of the House Committee on Economic and Educational \n     Opportunities stated at the time of passage of the CAA: ``The \n     Congress should not be allowed to escape the problems created \n     by its own failure to draft laws properly and, perhaps, \n     through this approach [it] will be forced to revisit and \n     clarify existing laws which, because of a lack of clarity, \n     are creating confusion and litigation.'' 141 Cong. Rec. H264 \n     (Jan. 17, 1995) (remarks of Rep. Goodling).\n       Indeed, in the Board's judgment, adding new regulatory \n     language of the type requested here (e.g., references to job \n     titles) would be contrary to the effective implementation of \n     the rights and protections of the CAA. Such new regulatory \n     language would itself have to be interpreted, would not be \n     the subject of prior interpretations by the FLRA, and would \n     needlessly create new ground for litigation about additional \n     interpretive differences.\n       Second, the Board cannot accede to the request that it \n     issue regulations providing that all employees of personal, \n     committee, Leadership, General Counsel, and Employment \n     Counsel offices are ``confidential employees,'' within the \n     meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7103(13). As noted above, to the \n     extent that this commenter seeks a declaratory statement that \n     clarifies the appropriate application of 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7103(13), the board is not legally free to provide such \n     clarifications through its statutorily limited remaking \n     powers. Moreover, contrary to the proposal of a commenter, \n     the Supreme Court has approved, and the NLRB and the FLRA \n     have applied, a definition of confidential employee'' that is \n     narrowly framed and that applies only to employees who, in \n     the normal course of their specific job duties, properly and \n     necessarily obtain in advance or have regular access to \n     confidential information about management's positions \n     concerning pending contract negotiations, the disposition of \n     grievances, and other labor relations matters. See NLRB v. \n     Hendricks County, et al., 454 U.S. 170, 184 (1981); In re \n     Dept. Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office \n     and AFGE Local 12, 37 F.L.R.A. 1371, 1381-1383 (1990). In \n     fact, in both the private and public sectors, it has been \n     held that ``bargaining unit eligibility determinations [must \n     be based] on testimony as to an employee's actual duties at \n     the time of the hearing rather than on duties that may exist \n     in the future;'' ``[b]argaining unit eligibility \n     determinations are not based on evidence such as written \n     position descriptions or testimony as to what duties had been \n     or would be performed by an employee occupying a certain \n     position, because such evidence might not reflect the \n     employee's actual duties.'' Id at 1377 (emphasis added). \n     Since these rulings have not been addressed or distinguished \n     by the commenter, the Board must conclude that the requisite \n     ``good cause'' to modify the FLRA's regulations has not been \n     established.\n       Third, the Board similarly must decline the request that it \n     promulgate regulations: (a) excluding from bargaining units \n     all employees of the Office of Compliance as employees \n     ``engaged in administering the provisions of this chapter,'' \n     within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7112(b)(4); and (b) \n     excluding from bargaining units all employees of the Office \n     of Inspector General as employees ``primarily engaged in \n     investigation or audit functions relating to the work of \n     individuals employed by an agency whose duties directly \n     affect the internal security of the agency,'' within the \n     meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7112(b)(7). To the extent that these \n     requests seek clarification concerning the application of \n     existing statutory provisions, the Board is foreclosed by \n     statute from providing such regulatory clarifications \n     (especially for the Office of Inspector General, which does \n     not appear to be a section 220(e)(2) office and which, in \n     contrast to inspector general offices in the executive \n     branch, appears primarily to audit or investigate \n     employees of other employing offices, as opposed to \n     auditing employees of its own agency). Moreover, to the \n     extent that these requests seek to have the Board make \n     eligibility determinations in advance of a specific unit \n     determination and without a developed factual record, the \n     commenters again seek a modification in the substantive \n     law for which no ``good cause'' justification has been \n     established.\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n       Fourth, the Board similarly must decline the suggestion \n     that it promulgate regulations: (a) limiting representation \n     of employees of section 220(e)(2) offices to unions \n     unaffiliated with noncongressional unions; (b) clarifying \n     that a Member's legislative positions are not properly the \n     subject of collective bargaining; (c) clarifying the ability \n     of a Member to discharge or discipline an employee for \n     disclosing confidential information or for taking legislative \n     positions inconsistent with the Member's positions; and (d) \n     authorizing section 220(e)(2) offices to forbid their \n     employees from acting as representatives of the views of \n     unions before Congress or from engaging in any other lobbying \n     activity on behalf of unions. The issues raised by the \n     suggested regulations are of significant public interest. \n     But, to the extent that the suggested regulations are \n     requested merely to clarify the application of existing \n     statutory or regulatory provisions, the Board may not \n     properly use its limited rulemaking authority to promulgate \n     such regulatory clarifications. Moreover, there is not ``good \n     cause'' to so ``modify'' the FLRA's regulations, as section \n     220(e) does not itself provide the Board with authority to \n     modify statutory requirements such as those found in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7112(c) (specifying limitations on whom a labor \n     organizations may represent), 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7703(a)(12), \n     7106, 7117 (specifying subjects that are not negotiable), 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7116(a) (specifying prohibited employment \n     actions), and 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7102 (specifying scope of \n     protected employee rights).\n       Finally, for similar reasons, the Board must reject the \n     request that it place regulatory limitations and prohibitions \n     on the proper uses of union dues. Again, the Board cannot \n     properly use its statutorily-limited regulatory powers either \n     to clarify what commenters find ambiguous or to codify what \n     commenters find unambiguous. Moreover, nothing in chapter 71 \n     (or the CAA) authorizes a labor organization and an employing \n     office to establish a closed shop, union shop, or even an \n     agency shop; accordingly, under chapter 71 (and the CAA), \n     employees cannot be compelled by their employers to join \n     unions against their free will and, concomitantly, employees \n     can resign from union membership and cease paying dues at any \n     time without risk to the security of their employment. In \n     these circumstances, there is no evident basis--legal or \n     factual--for the Board to seek to regulate the proper uses of \n     voluntarily-paid union dues.\n       In sum, the proposed modifications of the FLRA's \n     regulations are not a proper exercise of the Board's section \n     220(e) and section 304 rulemaking powers. Accordingly, the \n     Board may not adopt them.\n\n                   B. Section 220(e)(1)(B) Exclusions\n\n       Section 220(e)(1)(B) provides that, in devising its \n     regulations, the Board ``shall exclude from coverage under \n     [section 220] any covered employees [in section 220(e)(2) \n     offices] if the Board determines that such exclusion is \n     required because of (i) a conflict of interest or appearance \n     of a conflict of interest; or (ii) Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities.''\n       Accordingly, the Board has, with the assistance of the \n     Office's Executive Director and two Deputy Executive \n     Directors, carefully examined the comments received, other \n     publicly available materials about the workforces of the \n     section 220(e)(2) offices, and the likely constitutional, \n     ethical, and labor law issues that could arise from \n     application of chapter 71 to these workforces. The Board has \n     also carefully examined the adequacy of the requirements and \n     exemptions of chapter 71 and section 220(d) of the CAA for: \n     (a) addressing any actual or reasonably perceived conflicts \n     of interests that may arise in the context of collective \n     organization of employees of section 220(e)(2) offices; and \n     (b) accommodating Congress' constitutional responsibilities. \n     Having done so, on the present rulemaking record the Board \n     concludes that additional exclusions from coverage beyond \n     those contained in chapter 71 and section 220(d) are not \n     required by either Congress' constitutional responsibilities \n     or a real or apparent conflict of interest; and the Board now \n     further concludes that an additional regulation specifically \n     authorizing consideration of these issues in any particular \n     case is unnecessary in light of the authority available to \n     the Board under chapter 71's implementing provisions and \n     precedents and the Board's regulations under section 220(d).\n\n  1. Additional exclusions from coverage are justified under section \n      220(1)(B) only where necessary to the conduct of Congress' \n   constitutional responsibilities or to the resolution of a real or \n                     apparent conflict or interest\n\n       In the preamble to its NPR, the Board expressed its view \n     that additional exclusions of employees from coverage are \n     justified under section 220(e)(1)(B) only where necessary to \n     the conduct of Congress' constitutional responsibilities or \n     to the resolution of a real or apparent conflict or interest. \n     Although several commenters have objected to the Board's \n     construction of the statute, the Board is not persuaded by \n     these objections.\n       First, the Board finds no basis for the suggestion that \n     ``Board has been instructed by the statute to exclude offices \n     from coverage based on any of the specified'' statutory \n     criteria. (Emphasis added.) What is mandated is an inquiry by \n     the Board concerning whether exclusion of an employee is \n     justified by the statutory criteria; specifically, an \n     exclusion of a covered employee is mandated only ``if[as a \n     result of the Board's inquiry] the Board determines such \n     exclusion is required.'' (Emphasis added). Thus, the \n     exclusion provision is only conditional, and the exclusion \n     inquiry is to be addressed on an employee-by-employee basis, \n     not on an office-by-office basis, as the commenter \n     erroneously suggests.\n       Second, contrary to another commenter's suggestion, the \n     statutory language does not require exclusion of employees \n     where such exclusions would merely be ``suitable'' or \n     ``appropriate'' to the conduct of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities or to the resolution of a real or apparent \n     conflict of interest. The statutory language cannot properly \n     be read in this fashion.\n       The statute expressly states that an exclusion of an \n     employee is appropriate only ``if the Board determines that \n     such exclusion is required because of'' the stated-statutory \n     criteria. (Emphasis added.) The term ``[r]equired implies \n     something mandatory, not something permitted . . . .'' \n     Mississippi River Fuel Corporation v. Slayton, 359 F.2d 106, \n     119 (8th Cir. 1966) (Blackburn, J.). Moreover, while the term \n     ``required'' is capable of different usages, the usage \n     equating with ``necessity'' or ``indispensability'' is the \n     most common one. See Webster's Third New International \n     Dictionary 1929 (1986). And, as part of an ``except[ion]'' to \n     a statutory requirement that the Board's regulations be ``the \n     same'' as the FLRA's regulations and be consistent with \n     the ``provisions and purposes'' of chapter 71 to the \n     ``greatest extent practicable,'' it is highly unlikely \n     that Congress would mandate ``exclusion from coverage''--\n     with loss of not only organization rights, but also rights \n     against discipline or discharge because of engagement in \n     otherwise protected activities--when less restrictive \n     alternatives (e.g., exclusion from a bargaining unit; \n     limitation on the union that may represent the employee) \n     would adequately safeguard Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities and resolve any real or apparent \n     conflicts of interest.\n       In these circumstances, the term ``required'' cannot \n     properly be read to require additional exclusions from \n     coverage merely because they would be ``suitable'' or \n     ``appropriate'' to the conduct of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities or to the resolution of a real or apparent \n     conflict of interest. Such an interpretation would not be, \n     ``to the greatest extent practicable,'' ``consistent with the \n     provisions and purposes of chapter 71,'' as section 220(e) \n     requires. Moreover, such an interpretation would be contrary \n     to the CAA's promise that, except where strictly necessary, \n     Congress will be subject to the same employment laws to which \n     the private sector and the executive branch are subject. \n     Indeed, contrary to the CAA's purpose, such an interpretation \n     would rob Members of direct experience with traditional labor \n     laws such as chapter 71, and leave them without the first-\n     hand observations that would help them decide whether and to \n     what extent labor law reform is needed and appropriate.\n       Third, for these reasons, the Board also rejects one \n     commenter's suggestion that the omission of a ``good cause'' \n     requirement from section 220(e)(1)(B) suggests that a lesser \n     standard for exclusion from coverage was intended. The \n     omission of a ``good cause'' requirement in section \n     220(e)(1)(B) is more naturally explained: The term \n     ``required'' sets the statutory standard in section \n     220(e)(1)(B), and the ``good cause'' standard is simply not \n     needed.\n       Finally, contrary to the objections, the legislative \n     history does not support the commenters' view that additional \n     exclusions from coverage are mandated even if not strictly \n     necessary to the conduct of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities or to the resolution of a real or apparent \n     conflict of interest. It appears that, at one point in the \n     preceding Congress, some Members expressed: ``concern that, \n     if legislative staff belonged to a union, that union might be \n     able to exert undue influence over legislative activities or \n     decisions. Even if such a conflict of interest between \n     employees' official duties and union membership did not \n     occur, the mere appearance of undue influence or access might \n     be very troubling. Furthermore, there is a concern that labor \n     actions could delay or disrupt vital legislative activities. \n     S. Rep. No. 397, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1994).''\n       But the legislative sponsors did not respond to these \n     concerns by excluding all legislative staff from coverage or \n     by requiring exclusion of any section 220(e)(2) office's \n     employees wherever it would be ``suitable'' or \n     ``appropriate.''\n       Rather, the legislative sponsors responded by applying \n     chapter 71 (rather than the NLRA) to the legislative branch. \n     Senators John Glenn and Charles Grassley urged this course on \n     the ground that chapter 71 ``includes provisions and \n     precedents that address problems of conflict of interest in \n     the governmental context and that prohibit strikes and \n     slowdowns.'' Id. at 8; 141 cong. rec. S444-45 (daily ed., \n     Jan. 5, 1995) (statement of Sen. Grassley).\n       To be sure, the legislative sponsors further provided that, \n     ``as an extra measure of precaution, the reported bill would \n     not apply labor-management law to Members' personal or \n     committee offices or other political offices until the Board \n     has conducted a special rulemaking to consider such problems \n     as conflict of interest.'' Id. However, the legislative \n     sponsors made clear that an appropriate solution to a real or \n     apparent conflict of interest would include, for example, \n     precluding certain classes of employees ``from being \n     represented by unions affiliated with noncongressional or \n     non-Federal unions.'' Contrary to the commenter's argument, \n     exclusion of section 220(e)(2) office employees\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\n     from coverage was not viewed as inevitably required, even \n     where a conflict of interest is found to exist. 141 Cong. \n     Rec. S626 (daily ed., Jan. 9, 1995). Moreover, the \n     legislative sponsors expressly stated that the rulemaking so \n     authorized ``is not a standardless license to roam far afield \n     from such executive branch regulations. The Board cannot \n     determine unilaterally that an insupportably broad view of \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities means that no \n     unions of any kind can work in Congress.'' Id. That, of \n     course, would be precisely the result of the commenters' \n     proposed standard.\n\n 2. No additional exclusion from coverage of any covered employee of a \n   section 220(e)(2) office is necessary to the conduct of Congress' \n   constitutional responsibilities or to the resolution of a real or \n                     apparent conflict of interest\n\n       The question for the Board, then, is whether, on the \n     present rulemaking record, the additional exclusion from \n     coverage of any covered employee of a section 220(e)(2) \n     office is necessary to the conduct of Congress' \n     constitutional responsibilities or to the resolution of a \n     real or apparent conflict of interest. The Board concludes \n     that no such additional exclusions from coverage are \n     required.\n     a. No additional exclusion from coverage is necessitated by \n         Congress' constitutional responsibilities\n       The CAA does not expressly define the ``constitutional \n     responsibilities'' with which section 220(e)(1)(B) is \n     concerned. But, as one commenter has suggested, it may safely \n     be presumed that this statutory phrase encompasses at least \n     the responsibility to exercise the legislative authority of \n     the United States; to advise and consent to treaties and \n     certain presidential nominations; and to try matters of \n     impeachment. Even so defined, however, the Board has no \n     factual or legal basis for concluding that any additional \n     employees of the section 220(e)(2) offices must be excluded \n     from coverage in order for Congress to be able to carry out \n     these constitutional responsibilities or any others assigned \n     to Congress by the Constitution.\n       Chapter 71 was itself ``designed to meet the special \n     requirements and needs of the Government.'' 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7101(b). Thus, chapter 71 authorizes the exclusion of \n     any agency or subdivision thereof where necessary to the \n     ``national security,'' and completely excludes from coverage \n     aliens and noncitizens who occupy positions outside of the \n     United States, members of the uniformed services, and \n     ``supervisors'' and ``management officials.'' Id. at \n     Sec. Sec. 7103(a)(2), 7103(b). In addition, chapter 71 \n     requires that bargaining units not include ``confidential'' \n     employees, employees ``engaged in personnel work,'' employees \n     ``engaged in administering'' chapter 71, both ``professional \n     employees and other employees,'' employees whose work \n     ``directly affects national security,'' and employees \n     ``primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions \n     relating to the work of individuals'' whose duties ``affect \n     the internal security of the agency.'' Id. at Sec. 7112(b). \n     Likewise, chapter 71 provides that a labor organization that \n     represents (or is affiliated with a union that represents) \n     employees to whom ``any provision of law relating to labor-\n     management relations'' applies may not represent any \n     employee who administers any such provision of law; and, \n     chapter 71 prohibits according exclusive recognition to \n     any labor organization that ``is subject to corrupt \n     influences or influences opposed to democratic \n     principles,'' id. at Sec. Sec. 7112(c), 7111(f), and \n     precludes an employee from acting in the management of (or \n     as a representative for) a labor organization where doing \n     so would ``result in a conflict or apparent conflict of \n     interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or \n     with the official duties of the employee.'' Id. at \n     Sec. 7120(e). Furthermore, chapter 71 broadly preserves \n     ``Management rights,'' limits collective bargaining to \n     ``conditions of employment,'' and, in that regard, among \n     other things, specifically excludes matters that ``are \n     specifically provided for by Federal statute.'' Id. at \n     7106, 7103(12)(a), (14). Finally, chapter 71 makes it \n     unlawful for employees and their labor organizations to \n     engage in strikes, slowdowns, or picketing that interferes \n     with the work of the agency. Id. at 7116(b)(7).\n       Just as the provisions and precedents of chapter 71 are \n     sufficient to allow the Executive Branch to carry out its \n     constitutional responsibilities, the provisions and \n     precedents of chapter 71 are fully sufficient to allow the \n     Legislative Branch to carry out its constitutional \n     responsibilities. Congress is, of course, a constitutionally \n     separate branch of government with distinct functions and \n     responsibilities. But, by completely excluding \n     ``supervisors'' and ``management officials'' from coverage, \n     and by preserving ``Management rights,'' chapter 71 ensures \n     that Congress is not limited in the exercise of its \n     constitutional powers. Furthermore, by denying ``exclusive \n     recognition'' to any labor organization that ``is subject to \n     corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic \n     principles,'' chapter 71 ensures that labor organizations \n     will not become a foothold for those who might seek to \n     undermine or overthrow our nation's republican form of \n     government. In addition, by outlawing strikes and other work \n     stoppages, chapter 71 ensures that employee rights to \n     collective organization and bargaining may not be used \n     improperly to interfere with Congress' lawmaking and other \n     functions. Indeed, by specifying that its provisions ``should \n     be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of \n     an effective and efficient Government,'' 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7101(b), chapter 71 makes certain that its provisions \n     will expand and contract to accommodate the legitimate needs \n     of Government, which no doubt in this context include the \n     fulfillment of Congress' constitutional responsibilities.\n       The Board cannot legally accept the suggestion of some \n     commenters that collective organization and bargaining rights \n     for section 220(e)(2) office employees are ``inherently \n     inconsistent'' with the conduct of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities. These commenters' position may be \n     understood in political and administrative terms. But, under \n     the CAA, such a claim must legally be viewed with great \n     skepticism, for the CAA adopts the premise of our nation's \n     Founders, as reflected in the Federalist papers and other \n     contemporary writings, that government works better and is \n     more responsible when it is accountable to the same laws as \n     are the people and is not above those laws. Such interpretive \n     skepticism is particularly warranted in this context, for the \n     claim that collective bargaining and organization rights for \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees are ``inherently \n     inconsistent'' with Congress' constitutional responsibilities \n     is in considerable tension with the CAA's express requirement \n     that the Board examine the exclusion issue on an employee-by-\n     employee basis. Indeed, section 220(e) of the CAA expressly \n     requires the Board to accept, ``to the greatest extent \n     practicable,'' the findings of Congress in chapter 71 that \n     ``statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, \n     bargain collectively, and participate through labor \n     organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect \n     them--(A) safeguards the public interest, (B) contributes to \n     the effective conduct of public business, and (C) facilitates \n     and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between \n     employees and their employers involving conditions of \n     employment.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101(a). The statutory \n     instruction to honor these findings to ``the greatest extent \n     practicable'' is directly at odds with the commenters' \n     ``inherent inconsistency'' argument.\n       Moreover, contrary to the commenters' suggestion, neither \n     the allegedly close working relationships between the \n     principles of section 220(e)(2) offices and their staffs nor \n     the allegedly close physical quarters in which section \n     220(e)(2) office employees work can legally justify the \n     additional exclusions from coverage that the commenters seek. \n     Chapter 71 already excludes from coverage all ``management \n     officials'' and ``supervisors''--i.e., those employees who \n     are in positions ``to formulate, determine, or influence the \n     policies of the agency,'' and those employees who have the \n     authority to hire, fire, and direct the work of the office. \n     Moreover, chapter 71 excludes from bargaining units \n     ``confidential employees,'' ``employees engaged in personnel \n     work,'' and various other categories of employees who, by the \n     nature of their job duties, might actually have or might \n     reasonably be perceived as having irreconcilably divided \n     loyalties and interests if they were to organize. Beyond \n     these carefully crafted exclusions, however, chapter 71 \n     rejects both the notion that ``unionized employees would be \n     more disposed than unrepresented employees to breach their \n     obligation of confidentiality,'' and the notion that \n     representation by a labor organization or ``membership in a \n     labor organization is in itself incompatible with the \n     obligations of fidelity owed to an employer by its \n     employee.'' In re Dept. of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, \n     Arlington Field Office and AFGE Local 12, 37 F.L.R.A. at 1380 \n     (citations omitted; internal quotations omitted), Rather at \n     the Supreme Court recently reiterated, the law in the private \n     and public sectors requires that acts of disloyality or \n     misuse of confidential information be dealt with by the \n     employer through, e.g., non-discriminatory work rules, \n     discharge and/or discipline. See NLRB v. Town & Country \n     Electric, Inc., 116 S. Ct. 450, 457 (1995). These rulings are \n     especially applicable and appropriate in the context of \n     politically appointed employees in political offices of the \n     Legislative Branch, since such employees generally are likely \n     to be uniquely loyal and faithful to their employing offices.\n       In this same vein, the Board cannot legally accept the \n     suggestion that additional exclusions from coverage of \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees are justified by reference \n     to Members' understandable interest in hiring and firing on \n     the basis of ``political compatibility.'' While a long and \n     forceful tradition in this country, hiring and firing on the \n     basis of ``political compatibility'' is not a constitutional \n     right, much less a constitutional responsibility, of the \n     Congress or its Members. Moreover, while section 502 of the \n     CAA provides that it ``shall not be a violation of any \n     provision of section 201 to consider the . . . political \n     compatibility with the employing office of an employee, ``2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1432, section 502 noticeably omits section 220 \n     from its reach. Thus, the Board has no legal basis for \n     construing section 220(e)(1)(B) to require additional \n     exclusions from coverage in order to protect the interest of \n     Members in ensuring the ``political compatibility'' of \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees.\n       Furthermore, the Board cannot legally accept the suggestion \n     that exclusion of all employees in personal, committee, \n     leadership or legislative support offices is justified to \n     prevent labor organizations from obtaining undue influence \n     over Members' legislative activities. The issue of organized \n     labor's influence on the nation's political and legislative \n     processes is one of substantial public interest. But \n     commenters have not explained\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\n     how organized labor's effort to advance its political and \n     legislative agenda legally may be found to constitute an \n     interference with Congress' constitutional responsibilities. \n     Moreover, chapter 71 only authorizes a labor organization to \n     compel a meeting concerning employees' ``conditions of \n     employment'' that are not specifically provided for by \n     Federal statute. Thus, a labor organization may not lawfully \n     use chapter 71 either to demand a meeting about a Member's \n     legislative positions or to seek to negotiate with the Member \n     about those legislative positions.\n       Finally, the Board cannot legally accept the suggestion \n     that additional exclusions from coverage of section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees are necessary to ensure that Members are \n     neither inhibited in nor distracted from the performance of \n     their constitutional duties. The Board does not doubt that, \n     if employees choose to organize, compliance with section 220 \n     may impose substantial administrative burdens on Members \n     (just as compliance with the other laws made applicable by \n     the CAA surely does). Such administrative burdens might have \n     been a ground for Congress to elect in the CAA to exempt \n     Members and their immediate offices from the scope of section \n     220 (just as the Executive Office of the President is exempt \n     from chapter 71 and from many of the other employment laws \n     incorporated in the CAA). But Congress did not do so. \n     Instead, Congress imposed section 220 on all employing \n     offices and provided an ``except[ion]'' for employees of \n     section 220(e)(2) offices only where exclusion from coverage \n     is required by Congress' constitutional responsibilities (or \n     a real or apparent conflict of interest). The Board cannot \n     now lawfully find that the administrative burdens of \n     compliance with section 220 are the constitutional grounds \n     that justify the additional exclusion from coverage of any \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees; on the contrary, the \n     Board is bound to apply the CAA's premise that Members of \n     Congress will better and more responsibly carry out their \n     constitutional responsibilities if they are in fact subject \n     to the same administrative burdens as the laws impose upon \n     our nation's people.\n     b. No additional exclusion is necessitated by any real or \n         apparent conflict of interest\n       Nor can the Board lawfully find on this rulemaking record \n     that additional exclusions from coverage of employees of \n     section 220(e)(2) offices are required by a real or apparent \n     conflict of interest. Since the phrase ``conflict of interest \n     or appearance of conflict of interest'' is not defined in the \n     CAA, it must be construed ``in accordance with its ordinary \n     and natural meaning.'' FDIC v. Meyer, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1001 \n     (1994). The ``ordinary and natural meaning'' of ``conflict of \n     interest or appearance of conflict of interest'' is a real or \n     reasonably apparent improper or unethical ``conflict between \n     the private interest and the official responsibilities of a \n     person in a position of trust (such as a government \n     official).'' Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 276 \n     (1990). Accord, Black's Law Dictionary 271 (5th ed. 1979). \n     Specifically, as Senate and House ethics rules make clear, \n     under Federal law the phrase ``conflict of interest or \n     appearance of conflict of interest'' refers to ``a situation \n     in which an official's conduct of his office conflicts with \n     his private economic affairs.'' House Ethics Manual 87 \n     (1992); Senate Rule XXXVII. After thorough examination of the \n     matter, the Board has found no tenable legal basis for \n     concluding that additional exclusions from coverage of any \n     employees of section 220(e)(2) offices are necessary to \n     address any real or reasonably perceived incompatibility \n     between employees' private financial interests and their \n     public job responsibilities.\n       As noted above, by excluding ``management officials'' and \n     ``supervisors'' from coverage, and by requiring that \n     bargaining units not include ``confidential employees'' and \n     ``employees engaged in personal work,'' chapter 71 already \n     categorically resolves the real or apparent conflicts of \n     interest that may be faced by employees whose jobs involve \n     setting, administering or representing their employer in \n     connection with labor-management policy or practices. \n     Similarly, by require that bargaining units not include \n     employees ``engaged in administering'' chapter 71, chapter 71 \n     already resolves real or apparent conflicts of interest that \n     might arise for employees of, for example, the Office of \n     Compliance. Furthermore, by precluding an employee from \n     acting in the management of (or as a representative for) a \n     labor organization, where doing so would ``result in a \n     conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest or \n     would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official \n     duties of the employee,'' chapter 71 already directly \n     precludes an employee from assuming a position with the union \n     (or from acting on behalf of the union) where he or she could \n     confer a personal economic benefit on him or herself. And, as \n     an added precaution, the Board has adopted a regulation under \n     section 220(d) that authorizes adjustment of the substantive \n     requirements of section 220 where ``necessary to avoid a \n     conflict of interest or appearance of conflict of interest.'' \n     Therefore, all conceivable real and apparent conflicts of \n     interests are resolvable without the need for additional \n     exclusions from coverage.\n       The Board finds legally untenable the suggestion of several \n     commenters that, by directing the Board to consider these \n     real or apparent conflict of interest issues in its \n     rulemaking process, section 220(e)(1)(B) entirely displaces \n     and supersedes the conflict of interest provisions and \n     precedents of chapter 71 and section 220(d) where employees \n     of section 220(e)(2) offices are concerned. Section 220(e) \n     specifically provides that the Board's regulations for \n     section 220(e)(2) offices ``shall, to the greatest extent \n     practicable, be consistent with the provisions and purposes \n     of chapter 71'' and ``shall be the same as substantive \n     regulations issued by'' the FLRA. As pertinent here, it makes \n     an ``except[ion]'' only ``if the Board determines that * * * \n     exclusion [of a section 220(e)(2) office employee] is \n     required because of * * * a conflict of interest or \n     appearance of a conflict interest.'' This conditional \n     exception--applicable only ``if'' the Board determines that \n     an exclusion from coverage is ``required'' by a real or \n     apparent conflict of interest--plainly does not displace or \n     supersede the provisions and precedents of chapter 71 and \n     section 220(d) that section 220(e) expressly applies to \n     section 220(e)(2) offices. Indeed, as the statutory language \n     and legislative history discussed above confirm, section \n     220(e)(1)(B) requires this rulemaking merely as a ``special \n     precaution'' to ensure that chapter 71 and section 220(d) \n     appropriately and adequately deal with conflict of interest \n     issues in this context.\n       The Board similarly cannot legally accept the suggestion \n     that exclusion of employees in personal, committee, \n     leadership and party caucus offices is necessary to address \n     ``the most important legislative conflict of interest issue--\n     the appearance or reality of influencing legislation.'' While \n     understandable in political terms, this suggestion has no \n     foundation in the law which the Board is bound to apply.\n       To begin with, the Board has no basis for concluding that \n     the provisions and precedents of chapter 71 and section \n     220(d) are inadequate to resolve any such conflict of \n     interest issues. Although commenters correctly point out that \n     the Executive Office of the President is not covered by \n     Chapter 71, they provide no evidence that this exclusion \n     resulted from conflict of interest concerns. Moreover, though \n     commenters suggest that employees of the Executive Branch \n     engage in only administrative functions, the Executive Branch \n     in fact has substantial political functions relating to the \n     legislative process--including, e.g. recommending bills for \n     consideration, providing Congress with information about the \n     state of the Union, and vetoing bills that pass the Congress \n     over the President's objection. Furthermore, almost every \n     executive agency covered by chapter 71 has legislative \n     offices with both appointed and career employees who, like \n     section 220(e)(2) office employees, are responsible for \n     meeting with special interest groups, evaluating and \n     developing potential legislation, and making recommendations \n     to their employees about whether to sponsor, support or \n     oppose that or other legislation. Chapter 71 does not exclude \n     from its coverage Executive Branch employees performing such \n     policy and legislation-related functions (much less the \n     secretaries and clerical personnel in their offices); and, \n     contrary to one commenter's suggestion, chapter 71 does not \n     exclude from its coverage schedule ``C'' employees who are \n     outside of the civil service and who are appointed to perform \n     policy-related functions and to work closely with the heads \n     of Executive Branch departments. See U.S. Dept of HUD and \n     AFGE Local 476, 41 F.L.R.A. 1226, 1236-37 (1991). Since the \n     Board has no evidence that the conflict of interest issues \n     for section 220(e)(2) office employees materially differ from \n     the conflict of interest issues that these Executive Branch \n     employee face, the Board has no proper basis for finding that \n     additional section 220(e)(2) office employees must be \n     excluded from coverage simply because they too are outside of \n     the civil service and perform legislative-related functions.\n       Second, the Board is not persuaded that the concern \n     expressed by the commenters--i.e. that labor organizations \n     will attempt to influence the legislative activities of \n     employees who they are seeking to organize and represent--\n     even constitutes a ``conflict of interest or appearance of \n     conflict of interest'' within the meaning of that statutory \n     term. As noted above, under both common usage and House and \n     Senate ethics rules (as well as under federal civil service \n     rules and other federal laws), the statutory phrase \n     ``conflict of interest of appearance of conflict of \n     interest'' refers to a situation in which an official's \n     conduct of his office actually or reasonably appears \n     unethically to provide him or her with a private economic \n     benefit. While the Board understands that accepting gifts \n     from labor organizations might actually or apparently \n     constitute receipt of such an improper pecuniary benefit, the \n     board fails to see how working with labor organizations \n     concerning their legislative interests confers or appears to \n     confer any improper private economic benefit or legislative \n     branch employees--just as the board does not see how working \n     on legislative matters with other interest groups to which \n     the employee might belong (such as the American Tax Reduction \n     Movement, the Sierra Club, the National Rifle Association, \n     the National Right to Work Foundation, the NAACP, and/or the \n     National Organization or Women) would do so. On the contrary, \n     it is the employees' job to meet with special interest groups \n     of this type, to communicate the preferences and demands of \n     these special interest groups to the Members or communities \n     for which they work, and, where allowed or instructed to do \n     so, to assist or oppose these special interest groups in \n     pursuing their legislative interests.\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\n       It is true, as one commenter notes, that, in contrast to \n     other interest groups, a labor organization could, in \n     addition, to its legislative activities, seek to negotiate \n     with an employing office about the employees' ``condition of \n     employment.'' But each of the employees would have to \n     negotiate individually with the employing office if the union \n     did not do so collectively for them. Moreover, since those \n     who negotiate for the employing office and decide whether or \n     not to provide or modify any such ``conditions of \n     employment'' may by law not be part of the unit that the \n     union represents, section 220(e)(2) office employees could \n     not through the collective negotiations of their ``conditions \n     of employment'' unethically provide themselves or appear to \n     provide themselves with an improper pecuniary benefit for the \n     way that they perform their official duties for the employing \n     office. Thus, collective organization of section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees would not create a real or apparent conflict \n     of interest--just as it does not for appointed and career \n     employees in the Executive Branch who perform comparable \n     policy or legislative-related functions.\n       To be sure, because of an employee's sympathy with or \n     support for the union (or any other interest group), the \n     employee could urge the Member or office for which he or she \n     works to take a course that is not in that employer's \n     ultimate best political or legislative interest. Indeed, it \n     is even conceivable that, because of the employee's sympathy \n     with or support for a particular interest group such as \n     organized labor, the employee could act disloyally and \n     purposefully betray the Member's or the employing office's \n     interests. But employees could have such misguided \n     sympathies, provide such inadequate support, and/or act \n     disloyally whether or not they are members of or represented \n     by a union. Thus, just as was true in the context of \n     Congress' constitutional responsibilities (and as is true for \n     Executive Branch employees), the legally relevant issues in \n     such circumstances are ones of acceptable job performance and \n     appropriate bargaining units, work rules, and discipline--not \n     issues of real or apparent conflicts of interest. See NLRB v. \n     Town and Country Electric, Inc., 116 S. Ct. at 456-57.\n       It is also true that organized labor has a particular \n     interest in legislative issues relating to employment and \n     that, if enacted, some of the resulting laws could work to \n     the personal economic benefit of employees in section \n     220(e)(2) offices and, indeed, sometimes even to the economic \n     benefit of Members (e.g., federal pay statutes). But whenever \n     Members or their staffs work on legislation there is reason \n     for concern that they will seek to promote causes that will \n     personally benefit themselves or groups to which they \n     belong--whether it be with respect to e.g. their income tax \n     rates, their statutory pay and benefits, the grounds upon \n     which they can be denied consumer credit, or the ease with \n     which they can obtain air transportation to their home \n     states. These concerns, however, will arise whether or not \n     employees in section 220(e)(2) offices are allowed to \n     organize and bargain collectively concerning their \n     ``conditions of employment,'' and cannot conceivably \n     ``require'' the exclusion of additional section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees from coverage under section 220. As a \n     Bipartisan Task Force on Ethics has so well stated: ``A \n     conflict of interest is generally defined as a situation in \n     which an official's private financial interests conflict or \n     appear to conflict with the public interest. Some conflicts \n     or interest are inherent in a representative system of \n     government, and are not in themselves necessarily improper or \n     unethical. Members of Congress frequently maintain economic \n     interests that merge or correspond with the interests of \n     their constituents. This community of interests is in the \n     nature of representative government, and is therefore \n     inevitable and unavoidable. House Bipartisan Task Force on \n     Ethics, Report on H.R. 3660, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 \n     (Comm. Print, Comm. on Rules 1989), reprinted in 135 Cong. \n     Rec. H9253, H9259 (daily ed. Nov. 21, 1989).\n       The Board does not mean to suggest that the public does not \n     have a legitimate interest in knowing about the efforts that \n     interest groups (such as organized labor) make to influence \n     Members and their legislative staffs or the financial \n     benefits that Members and their legislative staffs receive. \n     But, as the recently enacted Lobbying Disclosure Act \n     evidences, and as the Bipartisan Task Force on Ethics long \n     ago concluded, lobbying contact disclosure and ``public \n     financial disclosure, coupled with the discipline of the \n     electoral process, remain[s] the best safeguard[s] and the \n     most appropriate method[s] to deter and monitor potential \n     conflicts of interest in the legislative branch.'' House \n     Bipartisan Task Force on Ethics, 135 Cong. Rec. at H9259.\n       For these reasons, the Board also declines to adopt the \n     suggestion that it exclude from coverage by regulation, on \n     the ground of ``conflict of interest or appearance of \n     conflict or interest,'' all employees of section 220(e)(2) \n     offices who are shown in an appropriate case to be ``exempt'' \n     employees within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (``FLSA''). This suggestion would improperly allow unions \n     and/or the General Counsel to challenge an employing office's \n     compliance with section 203 of the CAA in the context of a \n     section 220 proceeding. Moreover, under both private sector \n     law and chapter 71, employees are not uniformly excluded from \n     coverage by virtue of their ``exempt'' status, even though \n     such employees may exercise considerable discretion and \n     independent judgment in performing their duties, serve in \n     sensitive positions requiring unquestionable loyalty to their \n     employers, and/or have access to privileged information. \n     Thus, doctors who are responsible for the counseling and care \n     of millions of ill person are allowed to organize; engineers \n     who are responsible for ensuring the safety of nuclear power \n     plants are allowed to organize; lawyers who are responsible \n     for providing privileged advice and for prosecuting actions \n     on behalf of the Government (such as attorneys at the \n     Department of Labor and at the NLRB) are allowed to organize; \n     and schedule ``C'' employees who are outside of the civil \n     service, work closely with the heads of Executive Branch \n     departments, and assist in the formulation of Executive \n     Branch policy are not excluded from coverage under chapter \n     71. Nothing about those employees' ``exempt'' status itself \n     establishes a real or apparent incompatibility between an \n     employee's conduct of his office and his private economic \n     affairs. No tenable legal basis has been offered for reaching \n     a different conclusion about the ``exempt'' employees of \n     section 220(e)(2) offices.\n       For similar reasons, the Board declines to adopt the \n     suggestion that it exclude from coverage by regulation, on \n     the ground of ``conflict of interest or appearance of \n     conflict of interest,'' all employees in section 220(e)(2) \n     offices who hold particular job titles--e.g., Administrative \n     Assistants, Staff Directors, and Legislative Directors. The \n     Board has no doubt that many section 220(e)(2) office \n     employees in such job classifications will, because of the \n     actual duties that these employees perform, be excluded from \n     coverage as ``management officials'' or ``supervisors.'' And \n     the Board similarly has no doubt that many section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees in these or other job classifications will, \n     because of the actual duties that these employees perform, be \n     excluded from particular bargaining units as ``confidential \n     employees,'' ``employees engaged in personnel work,'' \n     ``professional employees,'' etc. But, as decades of \n     experience in myriad areas of employment law have taught, \n     these legal judgments must turn on the actual job duties that \n     the employees individually perform, and not on their job \n     titles or job classifications. It is the actual job duties of \n     the employees that dictate whether the concern of the \n     particular law in issue is actually implicated (e.g., whether \n     there is a real or apparent conflict of interest); and the \n     use of job titles in a regulation would unwisely have legal \n     conclusions turn on formalisms that are easily subject to \n     manipulation and error (e.g.,different employing offices may \n     assign the same job title or job classification to employees \n     who perform quite distinct job responsibilities and \n     functions).\n       In sum, in the six month period during which the job titles \n     and job classifications applicable to section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees have been thoroughly investigated and \n     studied by the Board, neither the statutory appointees nor \n     the Board--or, for that matter, any commenter--has identified \n     any job duty or job function that, in the context of \n     collective organization, would categorically create a real or \n     apparent conflict of interest that is not adequately \n     addressed by the provisions and precedents of chapter 71 and \n     the Board's section 220(d) regulations. Accordingly, on this \n     record, the Board has no legal basis for excluding any \n     additional section 220(e)(2) office employees from coverage \n     by regulation; and, for the reasons here stated, it would be \n     contrary to the effective implementation of the CAA for the \n     Board to reframe existing regulatory exclusions in terms of \n     the job titles or job classifications presently used by \n     certain section 220(e)(2) offices.\n\n            3. Final regulations under section 220(e)(1)(B)\n\n       For these reasons, the Board will not exclude any \n     additional section 220(e)(2) office employees from coverage \n     in its final section 220(e) regulations. Moreover, the Board \n     will not adopt a regulation that specially authorized \n     consideration of these exclusion issues in any particular \n     case. Although the Board proposed to do so in its NPR (as a \n     precautionary measure to ensure that employing offices were \n     not prejudiced by the paucity of comments provided in \n     response to the ANPR), commenters have vigorously objected to \n     any such regulation. Having carefully considered this matter \n     and determined both that no exclusions are required on this \n     rulemaking record and that all foreseeable constitutional \n     responsibility and conflict of interest issues may be \n     appropriately accommodated under section 220(d) and chapter \n     71, the Board now concludes that no such regulation is \n     necessary.\n       We now turn to the partial dissent. With all due respect to \n     our colleagues, we strongly disagree that the CAA envisions a \n     different rulemaking process for the Board's section \n     220(e)(1)(B) inquiry than the one that the Board has followed \n     in this rulemaking and in all of its other substantive \n     rulemakings. The section 220(e)(1)(B) inquiry is unique only \n     in terms of the substantive criteria which the statute \n     directs the Board to apply and the effective date of its \n     provisions. In terms of the Board's process, section 220(e) \n     expressly requires--just as the other substantive sections of \n     the CAA expressly require--the Board to adopt its \n     implementing regulations ``pursuant to section 304'' of the \n     CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1351(e), which in turn requires that the \n     Board conduct its rulemakings ``in accordance with the \n     principles and procedures set forth'' in the APA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384(b). The partial dissent's arguments that a \n     different\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\n     and distinct process is required under section 220(e)(1)(B) \n     is at odds with these express statutory requirements.\n       Nor is there any basis for the partial dissent's charge \n     that the Board's section 220(e)(1)(B) inquiry was \n     ``passive,'' ``constrained solely by written submissions,'' \n     and undertaken without ``sufficient knowledge of \n     Congressional staff functions, responsibilities \n     and relationships. . . .'' In the ANPR and the NPR, the \n     Board afforded all interested parties two opportunities to \n     address these issues. The Board carefully considered the \n     comments received from employing offices and their \n     administrative aids--i.e., those who are most \n     knowledgeable about the job duties and functions of \n     congressional staff and who should have had the most \n     interest in informing the Board about the relevant issues \n     in this rulemaking. Moreover, over the past six months, \n     the Board has received extensive recommendations from the \n     Executive Director and the Deputy Executive Directors of \n     the House and Senate--recommendations that were based upon \n     the statutory appointees' own legislative branch \n     experiences, their substantial knowledge of these laws, \n     their appropriate discussions with involved parties and \n     those knowledgeable about job duties and responsibilities \n     in section 220(e)(2) offices, and their own independent \n     investigation of the pertinent factual and legal issues. \n     In addition, the General Counsel has provided interested \n     Board members with extensive legal advice about these \n     issues. Indeed, during the past six months, members of the \n     Board were able to review vast quantities of publicly \n     available materials that, among other things, describe in \n     detail the job functions, job responsibilities, and office \n     work requirements and restrictions for employees of the \n     section 220(e)(2) offices. The claim of the partial \n     dissent that this material still needs to be found is thus \n     completely mystifying to the Board; and, since neither the \n     dissenters nor the commenters have pointed to any other \n     information that would be of assistance in deciding the \n     section 220(e)(1)(B) issues, it seems clear that the \n     dissenting members' objection is not with the sufficiency \n     of the information available to themselves or to the \n     Board, but rather is with the result that the Board has \n     reached.\n       In advocating a different result about the appropriateness \n     of additional exclusions from coverage, however, the partial \n     dissent simply ignores the statutory language and legislative \n     history of section 220 of the CAA. For all of its repeated \n     exhortations about the need to implement the will of \n     Congress, the partial dissent does not identify the \n     constitutional responsibilities or conflicts of interests \n     that supposedly require the additional exclusions from \n     coverage that the dissenters raise for consideration. Indeed, \n     the partial dissent does not even conclude which of its \n     various suggested possible exclusions from coverage are \n     ``required'' by section 220(e)(1)(B) or why.\n       The partial dissent's critique of the Board's analysis is \n     similarly bereft of legal authority. While criticizing the \n     Board for relying on precedents under chapter 71, the partial \n     dissent ignores section 220(e)'s express command that the \n     Board's implementing regulations under section 220(e)(1)(B) \n     be consistent ``to the greatest extent practicable'' with the \n     ``provisions and purposes'' of chapter 71. Moreover, while \n     noting that legislative branch employees of state governments \n     have not been granted the legal right to organize, the \n     partial dissent fails to acknowledge that this gap in state \n     law coverage results from state laws having generally been \n     modelled after federal sector law (which, until the CAA's \n     enactment, did not cover congressional employees); and, in \n     all events, the partial dissent fails to acknowledge that \n     section 220 itself rejects this state law experience by \n     covering without qualification non-section 220(e)(2) office \n     employees and by allowing exclusion of section 220(e)(2) \n     office employees only if required by the stated statutory \n     criteria. Finally, while asserting that employees in the \n     section 220(e)(2) offices perform functions that are not \n     comparable to functions employed by any covered employees in \n     the Executive Branch, the partial dissent never specifically \n     identifies these supposedly unique job duties and functions \n     and, even more importantly, never explains why the provisions \n     of chapter 71 and section 220(d) are inadequate to address \n     constitutional responsibility or conflict of interest issues \n     arising from them. In short, with all respect, the partial \n     dissent does not provide any acceptable legal basis for \n     concluding that additional regulatory exclusions from \n     coverage are required to address any constitutional \n     responsibility or conflict of interest issues.\n       The partial dissent similarly errs in suggesting that the \n     Board has ``apparent reluctance or disdain'' for regulatory \n     resolutions and instead prefers adjudicative resolutions. \n     Like our dissenting colleagues, the Board applauds the NLRB's \n     innovative effort--undertaken under the leadership of then-\n     NLRB Chairman Jim Stephens, who is now Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House--to use rulemaking to address certain \n     bargaining unit issues that have arisen in the health care \n     industry. But the issue here is not whether the NLRB should \n     be praised for having done so or, for that matter, whether \n     regulatory resolutions are generally or even sometimes \n     superior to adjudicative resolutions in that or other \n     contexts. Nor is the issue whether Congress has stated a \n     preference for regulatory resolutions in the CAA. Rather, the \n     issue here is whether additional exclusions from coverage are \n     required to address any constitutional responsibility or \n     conflict of interest issues that may arise in connection with \n     collective organization of section 220(e)(2) office \n     employees. For the reasons earlier stated, the Board has \n     concluded that no such additional exclusions from coverage \n     are required to do so. Thus, to the extent that any \n     constitutional responsibility or conflict of interest issue \n     is left to be resolved adjudicatively, it is only because, \n     where complete exclusion from coverage is not required, the \n     CAA instructs the Board to follow chapter 71's preference for \n     addressing matters of this type in the context of a \n     particular case, and because any constitutional \n     responsibility or conflict of interest issue may be \n     satisfactorily addressed by approaches that are less \n     restrictive than complete exclusion from coverage of section \n     220(e)(2) office employees. The Board regrets that the \n     partial dissent confuses the Board's respect for the commands \n     of the CAA with a ``disdain'' for rulemaking that the Board \n     does not have.\n       With all respect to our colleagues, the partial dissent's \n     own lack of attention to the commands of the CAA is \n     strikingly revealed by its discussion of the uncertainty and \n     delay that allegedly will result from not resolving all \n     constitutional responsibility and conflict of interest issues \n     through additional exclusions from coverage. Regulatory \n     uncertainty and delay should be reduced where legally \n     possible and appropriate. But inclusion of the constitutional \n     responsibility and conflict of interest issues in the mix of \n     issues that inevitably must be addressed in a unit \n     determination will not have the unique practical significance \n     that the dissent claims, since employment in the legislative \n     branch is in fact not substantially more transient than is \n     employment in many parts of the private and federal sectors \n     (e.g., construction, retail sales, canneries in Alaska), \n     since private and Executive Branch employers also work under \n     ``time pressures'' that ``are intense and uneven,'' and since \n     the Board has designed its section 220(d) procedures to deal \n     with all unit determination issues as promptly as or more \n     promptly than comparable issues are dealt with in the private \n     and federal sectors. And, in all events, it is clear that \n     administrative burdens of the type discussed by the partial \n     dissent cannot legally justify additional exclusions from \n     coverage, because these administrative burdens legally have \n     nothing to do with the constitutional responsibility and \n     conflict of interests inquiries to which the Board is limited \n     under the statute; indeed, as noted above, the premise of the \n     CAA is that Congress will better exercise its constitutional \n     responsibilities if it is subject to the same kinds of \n     administrative burdens as private sector and Executive \n     Branch employers are subject to under these laws.\n       The Board appreciates its dissenting colleagues' concern \n     that, if employees of section 220(e)(2) offices should choose \n     to organize, elected officials in Congress may have to \n     negotiate about their employees' conditions of employment'' \n     with political friends or foes. But the Board cannot agree \n     that these political concerns require or allow the additional \n     possible exclusions from coverage that are mentioned in the \n     partial dissent. Such political concerns do not legally \n     establish an interference with Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities or a real or apparent conflict of interest; \n     and the CAA by its express terms only allows additional \n     exclusions from coverage that are required by such \n     constitutional responsibilities or conflicts of interest. If \n     the CAA is to achieve its objectives and the Board is to \n     fulfill its responsibilities, the Board must adhere to the \n     terms of the law that the Congress enacted and that the \n     President signed; the Board may not properly relax the law so \n     as to address non-statutory concerns of this type.\n\n                    C. Section 220(e)(2)(H) Offices\n\n       Section 220(e)(2)(H) of the CAA authorizes the Board to \n     issue regulations identifying ``other offices that perform \n     comparable functions'' to those employing offices \n     specifically listed in paragraphs (A) through (G) of section \n     220. In response to a comment on the ANPR, the Board proposed \n     in the NPR to so identify four offices--the Executive Office \n     of the Secretary of the Senate, the Office of Senate \n     Security, the Senate Disbursing Office, and the \n     Administrative Office of the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. \n     No comments were received regarding this proposal, and the \n     final regulation will specifically identify these offices, \n     pursuant to section 220(e)(2)(H), as section 220(e)(2) \n     offices.\n       In response to comments received by the Board, the final \n     regulation will also identify and include the following \n     employing offices in the House of Representatives as \n     performing ``comparable functions'' to those offices \n     specified in section 220(e)(2) of the CAA: the House Majority \n     Whip; the House Minority Whip; the Office of House Employment \n     Counsel; the Immediate Office of the Clerk; the Office of \n     Legislative Computer Systems; the Immediate Office of the \n     Chief Administrative Officer; the Immediate Office of the \n     Sergeant at Arms; and the Office of Finance.\n       As explained by one of the commenters, these offices have \n     responsibilities and perform functions that are commensurate \n     with those offices specifically listed in section 220(e)(2) \n     or those offices identified in the proposed regulations. \n     Thus, the duties and functions of the House Majority and \n     Minority Whips are similar to the Offices of the Chief Deputy \n     Majority Whips and the Offices of the Chief Deputy Minority \n     Whips, which are expressly included in section 220(e)(2)(D). \n     The\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\n     Office of House Employment Counsel was created, following the \n     enactment of the CAA, to provide legal advice and \n     representation to House employing offices on labor and \n     employment matters; this office performs functions similar to \n     those of the Office of the House General Counsel, which is \n     included in section 220(e)(2)(E), and those of the Senate \n     Chief Counsel for Employment, which is identified in section \n     220(e)(2)(C).\n       Similarly, the Immediate Office of the Clerk of the House \n     performs functions parallel to those performed by the \n     Executive Office of the Secretary of the Senate, which is \n     treated as a section 220(e)(2) office under these final \n     regulations. Both offices are responsible for supervising \n     activities that have a direct connection to the legislative \n     process. Likewise, the Immediate Office of the House Sergeant \n     at Arms has duties that correspond to those of the \n     Administrative Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms. Both \n     offices are charged with maintaining security and decorum in \n     each legislative chamber.\n       The House Office of Legislative Computer Systems runs the \n     electronic voting system and handles the electronic \n     transcription of official hearings and of various legislative \n     documents; these functions are similar to those functions \n     performed by the Office of Legislative Operations and \n     Official Reporters, both of which are listed in section \n     220(e)(2)(D).\n       The Immediate Office of the Chief Administrative Officer \n     has responsibilities and performs functions that are \n     comparable to those performed by the Executive Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate and the Administrative Office of the \n     Senate Sergeant at Arms, which are treated as section \n     220(e)(2) offices under these final regulations. Similarly, \n     the House Office of Finance, like the Senate Disbursing \n     Office, is responsible for the disbursement of payrolls and \n     other funds, together with related budget and appropriation \n     activities, and therefore will be treated, pursuant to \n     section 220(e)(2)(H), as a section 220(e)(2) office.\n\n                         VI. Method of approval\n\n       The Board received no comments on the method of approval \n     for these regulations. Therefore, the Board continues to \n     recommend that (1) the version of the regulations that shall \n     apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate should be \n     approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the version of the \n     regulations that shall apply to the House of Representatives \n     and employees of the House of Representatives should be \n     approved by the House of Representatives by resolution; and \n     (3) the version of the regulations that apply to other \n     covered employees and employing offices should be approved by \n     concurrent resolution.\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby adopts and submits for approval by the \n     Congress the following regulations.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 19th day of August, \n     1996.\n\n                                                Glen D. Nager,\n\n                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n       Member Seitz, concurring: In section 220 of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'' or ``Act''), \n     Congress instructed the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance (``the Board'') to issue regulations that provide \n     Congressional employees with certain rights and protections \n     of chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code. Most \n     significantly, Congress commanded that the regulations issued \n     be ``the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority'' unless the Board \n     determines either that modified regulations would more \n     effectively implement the rights and protections of chapter \n     71 (section 220(e)(1)(A)) or that exclusion from coverage of \n     employees in the so-called political offices is ``required'' \n     because of a conflict of interest or appearance of conflict \n     of interest or because of Congress' constitutional \n     responsibilities (220(e)(1)(B)). The Board faithfully \n     fulfilled its statutory duty: We conducted the rulemaking \n     required under section 304 of the Act, adhering to the \n     principles and procedures embodied in the Administrative \n     Procedure Act, as Congress instructed us to do. We examined \n     and carefully considered the comments received and--with the \n     assistance of the experienced and knowledgeable Executive \n     Director and Deputy Executive Directors of the Office--we \n     independently collected and analyzed the relevant factual and \n     legal materials. Ultimately, the Board determined that there \n     was no legal or factual justification for deviation from \n     Congress' principal command--that the regulations issued to \n     implement chapter 71 be the same as the regulations issued by \n     the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The regulations we \n     issue today reflect that considered determination.\n       The dissent unfairly attacks both the Board's processes and \n     its conclusion.\n       The dissent attacks the Board's processes by stating both \n     that section 220(e)(1)(B) of the Act requires some kind of a \n     different ``proactive'' rulemaking process and that ``the \n     Board did not undertake to make an independent inquiry'' \n     regarding the regulatory issues. As the preamble details, \n     this attack is baseless. The Board conducted the statutorily-\n     required rulemaking, a process which included substantial \n     supplementation of the comments received with independent \n     inquiry and investigation and the application of its own--and \n     its appointees'--expertise.\n       The dissent's suggestion that the Board majority and the \n     Board's appointees did not, in fact, do the spadework \n     necessary to make the judgments made is both ungenerous and \n     untrue, as it impugns the hard work and careful thought \n     devoted to a sensitive issue by all concerned. And, indeed, \n     the dissenters, like the Board majority, had access both to \n     the publicly available materials that might have been \n     relevant to the Board inquiry--such as job descriptions for \n     various positions in Congress--and to legal and factual \n     analyses generated by Board appointees.\n       To be sure, the Board would not approve ex parte \n     factfinding contacts between Board members and interested \n     persons in Congress during the rulemaking period in order to \n     preserve the integrity of its rulemaking process. But neither \n     the commenters nor the dissenting Board members have \n     suggested even one additional fact that should have been \n     considered by the Board. Accordingly, the dissent's attack on \n     the Board's processes merely reflects the dissent's \n     unhappiness with the Board's substantive determination. But, \n     it is both wrong and unjust to accuse the Board of failing to \n     engage in an appropriate process simply because the Board \n     ultimately disagreed with those advocating substantial \n     exclusions from coverage under section 220(e)(1)(B).\n       The dissent's attack on the substance of the Board's \n     conclusion is similarly misguided. It makes no attempt to \n     ground itself in law, and, in fact, ignores fundamental \n     principles of statutory interpretation: First, in \n     interpreting a statute one looks initially and principally to \n     its language; here the statute authorizes exclusions from \n     coverage only when ``required'' by the statutory criteria. \n     Second, in interpreting a statute, the most relevant \n     legislative history is that addressing the particular \n     provision at issue; here what legislative history there is \n     acknowledges that the substitution of chapter 71 for the \n     National Labor Relations Act ensured the elimination of \n     perceived problems with permitting employee organization in \n     Congress and reveals that section 220(e)(1)(B) was inserted \n     only to make that assurance doubly sure and not as a \n     ``standardless license to roam far afield from . . . \n     executive branch regulations.'' Third, in interpreting a \n     statute, the broad purposes of legislation illuminate the \n     meaning of particular provisions; here the Act in question \n     was designed to bring Congress under the same laws that it \n     has imposed upon private citizens. That purpose has already \n     been diluted by Congress' application to itself of only the \n     limited rights and protections of chapter 71, rather than the \n     broader provisions of the National Labor Relations Act; it \n     would be eviscerated altogether by broad exclusions from \n     coverage of the sort the dissent would endorse.\n       Nothing in the comments received or in the independent \n     investigation done by the Board suggests that broad \n     exclusions of employees from the coverage of chapter 71 are \n     ``required'' by conflicts of interest (real or apparent) or \n     by Congress' constitutional responsibilities. As noted in the \n     preamble, chapter 71, by application through the Act, broadly \n     excludes numerous employees from coverage, narrowly confines \n     the permissible arena of collective bargaining, and \n     eliminates most of labor's leverage by barring strikes and \n     slowdowns. There is nothing to fear here, unless one fears \n     the (minimal) requirement that a Congressional employer and \n     its employees communicate about terms and conditions of \n     employment (or, at least those not set by statute) before the \n     employer sets them. And the substantial limits that chapter \n     71 places on employee organization and collective bargaining \n     fully protect Congress' ability to carry out its \n     constitutional responsibilities and entirely prevent any \n     employee conflicts of interest (real or apparent). While we \n     agree with the dissent that Congress is an exceptional \n     institution, that exceptionalism does not warrant a broad \n     exception from the coverage of chapter 71; neither the \n     dissent nor the Board has identified any constitutional \n     reasonability or conflict of interest that chapter 71's \n     provisions do not adequately address.\n       The Board's determination that no further regulations are \n     ``required'' under section 220(e)(1)(B) does not render that \n     section a nullity, as the dissent states. Nor does it \n     indicate a ``disdain'' for regulatory resolutions. Section \n     220(e)(1)(B) does not require either regulations or \n     exclusions; it requires a Board inquiry into whether any such \n     exclusions by regulation are necessary. The Board has \n     conducted such an inquiry and has made the statutorily-\n     required determination. That determination is the result of \n     principled statutory interpretation, factual investigation, \n     and legal analysis.\n       It is, in fact, the dissent's position that would render a \n     portion of the CAA a nullity, because it would insulate \n     Members of Congress from direct experience with employees \n     dignified by labor-relations rights and protections. The \n     Board's position keeps the promise of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. If the language, legislative history, and \n     fundamental purpose of that Act are to be directly \n     contradicted, that decision is for Congress alone. Such a \n     result cannot lawfully be achieved by Board regulation.\n       Member Lorber, joined by Member Hunter, dissenting in part:\n       ``The Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') is one of \n     the most significant legislative achievements of the Congress \n     in many years. While its reach is peculiarly insular, \n     covering only the employees of the Congress and designated \n     instrumentalities of the Congress, its import is global. As \n     the bipartisan\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\n     leadership of the Congress stated upon the CAA's enactment, \n     this law brings home the promise first offered by Madison in \n     the Federalist Papers that the Congress would experience \n     itself the impact of the [employment] laws it passes and \n     requires of all [employers].''\n       The CAA established an Office of Compliance within the \n     Congress to operationally carry out the functions of the CAA. \n     The CAA established an independent Board of Directors \n     appointed by the Bi-Partisan Congressional leadership to \n     supervise the operation of the Office, prepare regulations \n     for Congressional approval and act in an appellate capacity \n     for cases adjudicated within the Office of Compliance \n     procedures. As noted by Senator Byrd when the CAA was \n     debated, this tri-partite responsibility of the Board is \n     somewhat unique. In the present rulemaking, the Board is \n     acting in its role as regulator, not adjudicator.\n       Pursuant to the CAA, the Board was charged with conducting \n     a detailed review of all existing Executive Branch \n     regulations implementing eight labor laws, deciding which of \n     those regulations were appropriate to be adapted for \n     implementation under the CAA and then drafting them to \n     conform with the requirements of the CAA. For the regulations \n     issued and adopted to date and for most future regulations, \n     the Board engaged or will engage in a notice and comment \n     process which was modeled after similar procedures followed \n     by the Executive Branch. For the regulations adopted prior to \n     the current rulemaking, after the conclusion of the comment \n     period and after its analysis of the comments, the Board \n     promulgated final regulations formally recommended by its \n     statutory appointees and submitted them for the consideration \n     of Congress.\n       We believe that this background discussion is appropriate \n     since we are here publishing our dissenting opinion regarding \n     the preamble and recommendation regarding regulations to \n     implement section 220(e)(1)(B) of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. We note that these proposed regulations \n     also address the statutory inquiry required by section \n     220(e)(1)(A) of the Act which require the Board to modify \n     applicable regulations issued by the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority for good cause shown, to determine whether the \n     regulations adopted pursuant to section 220(d) will apply to \n     the political offices listed in section 220(e) and \n     regulations required by section 220(e)(2)(H) of the Act which \n     requires the Board to determine if there are other offices \n     which meet the standards of section 220(e)(2) so as to be \n     included in the consideration required by section \n     220(e)(1)(B). We do not dissent from the Board's final \n     resolution of these regulatory issues.\n       We do not undertake to issue this first dissent in the \n     Board's regulatory function lightly. At the outset, the Board \n     appropriately decided that it would endeavor to avoid \n     dissents on regulatory matters. We felt then, and indeed do \n     so now, that the public interest and the Congressional \n     interest in a responsible implementation of the CAA required \n     that the Board work out, in its own deliberative process, \n     differences in policy or procedure. While the issues there \n     addressed were and are some of the most contentious \n     employment issues in the public debates, the Board and staff \n     worked through the issues with a remarkable degree of unity \n     and comity.\n       However, in enacting the Congressional Accountability Act, \n     the Congress included one section that differs from all \n     others in its requirements of the Board and in its process of \n     adoption. Indeed, unlike any other substantive provision of \n     the CAA, this section finds no parallel in the published \n     regulations of the Executive Branch. Section 220 of the CAA, \n     which adopts for Congressional application the relevant \n     sections of the Federal Labor Relations Act contains within \n     its subsections 220(e)(1)(B) and (e)(2), which deal with the \n     application of the FLRA to the staff of Congressional \n     personal offices, committee offices and the other offices \n     listed in section 220(e)(2), (``the political offices'').\n       Section 220(e)(1)(B) of the Act requires the Board to \n     undertake its own study and investigation of the impact of \n     covering the employees in the political offices and determine \n     itself, as a matter of first impression and after its own \n     inquiry, whether such coverage of some or all of those \n     employees would create either a constitutional impediment or \n     a real or apparent conflict of interest such as to require \n     the Board to exempt from coverage, by regulation, some or all \n     of those employees or some or all of the positions employed \n     in the political offices. Due to the speed of enactment, and \n     apparently because the CAA culminated a protracted period of \n     prior debate by previous Congresses on this issue, neither \n     the statute nor any accompanying explanations provided \n     specific guidance as to the method and procedure the Board \n     was to follow in reaching its 220(e)(1)(B) recommendations.\n       The section in question contains two separate requirements \n     for the Board. Section 220(e)(1)(A) repeats the standard for \n     all other Executive Branch Regulations that the Board may, \n     for good cause shown, amend the applicable FLRA regulations \n     as applied to the Congress. As previously noted, we join the \n     Board's resolution of this section. However, unique to the \n     CAA, section 220(e)(1)(B) requires of the Board that it \n     independently review the coverage question for the political \n     offices enumerated in section 220(e)(2) in order to determine \n     if the Board should, by regulation, recommend that some or \n     all of the employees of those offices be excluded from \n     coverage. This exclusion from coverage merely means that the \n     Board has determined that certain positions be exempted from \n     inclusion in bargaining units for the statutory reasons set \n     forth in section 220(e)(1)(B). The other applicable \n     exemptions found in the FLRA and noted by the majority are \n     unaffected by section 220(e)(1)(B). Thus, reference to the \n     applicability of those exemptions may have been necessary to \n     respond to certain commenters but are irrelevant for these \n     purposes. Again, unlike any other regulation proposed by the \n     Board, the 220(e) regulations will not take effect until \n     affirmatively voted on by each House of Congress. It should \n     be noted that the 220(d) regulations governing application of \n     the FLRA to Congressional employees not working in the \n     220(e)(2) political offices are not affected by this \n     enactment requirement. This requirement was necessary in part \n     because there are no comparable Executive Branch regulations \n     which will come into effect in the absence of Congressional \n     action. Thus, the Congress must exercise greater oversight in \n     reviewing these regulations because there is no preexisting \n     regulatory model against which to compare the Board's \n     decision. By requiring this independent analysis, the \n     Congress clearly intended for the Board to investigate these \n     issues in a manner different from the passive or limited \n     review as defined by the majority.\n       Faced with this novel requirement, the Board attempted to \n     fashion a means of addressing this issue which would continue \n     its practice of ensuring fair, prompt and informed \n     consideration of regulatory issues. The majority adopted as \n     its guide the process heretofore followed by the Board in its \n     previous regulatory actions in the standard notice and \n     comment manner. Its methodology was apparently modeled after \n     its belief that the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') is \n     either directly incorporated into the CAA or that the \n     reference to the APA in section 304 binds the Board in a way \n     so as to preclude it functioning in a normal and accepted \n     regulatory manner. Of course, if the majority does not now \n     assert that its analysis is constrained by its restrictive \n     interpretation of the APA, then we are in some doubt about \n     the majority's stated reason for its passive review of \n     written comments and failure to undertake any examination \n     on its own of the issues here before us.\n       The Board attempted to frame the 220(e)(1)(B) issue broadly \n     enough to encourage informed comment by the regulated groups. \n     It responded to the comments received by proposing a \n     regulatory scheme (in this case a decision not to issue any \n     220(e)(1)(B) regulations), and it elicited comments on the \n     proposed regulations after which it reached the decision \n     published today. The undersigned members believe, however, \n     that section 220(e)(1)(B) charged the Board with a different \n     role. We believe that the Board had the obligation to direct \n     its staff and that the staff itself with independent \n     obligations to each respective House of Congress had to \n     undertake a more involved role. We believe that the \n     uniqueness of this statutory provision required the Board to \n     be proactive in its approach and analysis. Indeed by its very \n     inclusion in the statute, and the requirement that the \n     Congress affirmatively approve of its resolution, section \n     220(e)(1)(B) indicated a concern on behalf of the entire \n     Congress that potential unionization of the political \n     employees of the political offices in the Congress might pose \n     a constitutional or operational burden (as defined by a \n     conflict or apparent conflict of interest) on the effective \n     operations of the legislative branch. Whatever the individual \n     views of any Board member regarding this section, we believe \n     that our responsibility is to effectuate the intent of the \n     Congress as reflected in the Statute.\n       Response to the Board's initial invitation for informed \n     input was not substantial. However, after the Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking was published, substantial comments were \n     received. In fact, the Board made special efforts to elicit \n     comments and even briefly extended the comment period to \n     accommodate interested parties who could offer assistance. By \n     the end of the process, the Board did receive comments from \n     most of the interested Congressional organizations. It \n     received only one comment from a labor organization during \n     the ANPR period and a separate letter during the NPR period \n     in which the labor organization indicated that it reaffirmed \n     its opposition to a total exemption of the political offices \n     employees. The quality and informative content of the \n     comments received are subject to differing views. The \n     majority of the Board apparently believes that the comments \n     were not particularly helpful or informative. We can only \n     reach this conclusion by noting that the Board took pains to \n     disclaim the substance and import of the comments received \n     except apparently to credit substantive weight to the sole \n     comment urging that the Board refuse to exercise its \n     authority under 220(e)(1)(B). We believe, on the other hand, \n     that the substantive comments did articulate a cogently \n     expressed concern about the coverage of the employees in \n     question and the disruptive effect a case by case \n     adjudicatory process would have on the activities of the \n     Congress. In any event, the section of the statute here in \n     question requires the Board to move its inquiry beyond the \n     written submissions.\n       Unfortunately, the Board did not undertake to make \n     independent inquiry regarding these questions or to engage in \n     inquiry of Congressional employees or informed outside\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\n     experts. Rather, the Board continued its nearly judicial \n     practice by which it analyzed the comments as submitted and \n     neither requested follow up submissions nor conducted any \n     independent review. Contrary to the majority's opinion, the \n     undersigned believed that the submitted comments were helpful \n     in indicating areas of concern and setting forth possible \n     methods of addressing this issue. And in any event, under the \n     majority's own standards, the lack of any substantive \n     comments supporting the majority's ultimate conclusion is \n     telling.\n       In the type of insulated analysis undertaken by the Board, \n     where it relies so heavily upon submitted comments, we find \n     it curious that the majority apparently adopted a position \n     that it was only the obligation of those supporting a full or \n     partial exclusion under section 220(e)(1)(B) to persuade the \n     Board and that those opposing such exclusion can rely upon \n     the Board's own analysis. We believe that the Board was \n     charged with a different task and that it had to reach its \n     own conclusions unanchored to the quality or inclusiveness of \n     the comments. The undersigned relied, in addition, on our own \n     understanding of the responsibilities of the Congress and the \n     various offices designated for consideration, the criteria \n     set forth for decision in the Statute, and our own \n     experience. We believe that the Board's deliberations were \n     hampered by its constricted view of its role and by not \n     undertaking its own investigative process so as to better \n     understand the tasks generic to the various Congressional job \n     titles in the political offices.\n       The Board's discussions were detailed and frank. They were \n     carried out in a professional and collegial manner. Various \n     formulations of resolution were put forth by various \n     commenters and the dissenters, including regulatory exemption \n     of all employees, regulatory exemption of employees with \n     designated job titles, regulatory exemption of all employees \n     deemed to be exempt as professional employees under section \n     203 of the Act (the FLSA) and other regulatory formulations. \n     We believed that the statute did not give the Board the \n     discretion to set its analytical standards so high as to make \n     a nullity of section 220(e)(1)(B). Indeed, we believe that \n     the statute legally compelled the Board to undertake efforts \n     to give meaning to the exemptions. The majority has been \n     resistant to any formulation which would apply the \n     220(e)(1)(B) regulatory exemption. The result of the Board's \n     deliberations are found in the proposed 220(e)(1)(B) \n     regulations (or lack thereof) and the explanatory preamble.\n       We dissent from this resolution for several reasons. As set \n     forth above, we believe that the Board was charged with a \n     different and unique role. In this case, the credibility of \n     the Board's response to section 220(e)(1)(B) demanded a \n     proactive, investigatory effort under the authority of the \n     Board which we believe simply did not occur. The majority, as \n     expressed in the preamble, relied instead upon past \n     precedents and concepts which we believe inapplicable or at \n     least not determinative of the complex issue raised by \n     220(e)(1)(B). Indeed, as discussed below, its limited view of \n     the leeway regulators have to interpret their statutes so as \n     to give meaning and substance to Congressional enactment mars \n     this entire process. We note, for example, the majority's \n     reliance on In re Department of Labor, Office of the \n     Solicitor and AFGE Local 12, 37 F.L.R.A. 1371 (1990), for its \n     discussion of ``confidential employees'' and for other \n     purposes. While this case may be pertinent if that issue \n     comes before the Board in an adjudicatory context, we fail to \n     see its relevance when the statute commands the Board to view \n     the issue of unionization of politically appointed employees \n     who work in political offices in the legislative body under \n     separate and novel standards. Indeed, as we noted above, the \n     standard statutory exemptions for professional or \n     confidential employees are simply irrelevant to this \n     discussion. Thus, in the case relied upon so heavily by the \n     majority, we would simply note that Labor Department \n     attorneys are, like the vast majority of federal employees \n     covered by the FLRA, career civil servants who must conduct \n     their professional activities in a nonpartisan environment. \n     We believe that the conflict or apparent conflict of interest \n     implicated by each workplace environment and type of employee \n     is different. Politically appointed employees in political \n     offices are under different constraints.\n       We note as well that the majority looked to private \n     precedent decided under the National Labor Relations Act for \n     guidance. If the majority believes that NLRB precedent is of \n     assistance to our deliberations, we too would look to \n     applicable NLRB precedent for guidance. Apparently faced with \n     a growing caseload and inconsistent decisions by the \n     appellate courts, the NLRB undertook in 1989 to decide by \n     formal rulemaking the appropriate number of bargaining units \n     for covered health care institutions. At the conclusion of \n     this rulemaking process, the NLRB decided that in the absence \n     of exceptional circumstances defined in the regulation, see \n     29 CFR Sec. 130.30 (1990), eight bargaining units would be \n     appropriate. This rulemaking was challenged on several \n     grounds including citation to Sec. 159(b) of the NLRA which \n     appears to state that the NLRB should establish appropriate \n     bargaining units in each case (emphasis added). However, in \n     American Hospital Association v NLRB  499 US 606 (1991), a \n     unanimous Supreme Court rejected the view that the NLRB was \n     constrained from deciding any matter on the basis of \n     rulemaking and was compelled to decide every matter on a case \n     by case basis. The Court cited its precedents in other \n     statutory cases for the proposition that a regulatory \n     decision maker ``has the authority to rely on rulemaking to \n     resolve certain issues of general applicability unless \n     Congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that \n     authority.'' 499 US 606, 612. (citations omitted.) In our \n     statute, the Congress has clearly stated its preference for a \n     regulatory resolution. Indeed, the Court cited with approval \n     the following from Kenneth C. Davis, described by the Court \n     as ``a noted scholar'' on administrative law: ``[T]he mandate \n     to decide `in each case' does not prevent the Board from \n     supplanting the original discretional chaos with some degree \n     of order, and the principal instruments for regularizing the \n     system of deciding `in each case' are classifications, rules, \n     principles, and precedents. Sensible men could not refuse to \n     use such instruments and a sensible Congress would not expect \n     them to.'' (emphasis added.) 499 US at 612.\n       We see absolutely nothing in the CAA which nullifies this \n     observation. The majority finds statutory constraints where \n     we find statutory encouragement to act in the manner of ``the \n     sensible man'' as defined by Davis and relied upon by the \n     Supreme Court. To the extent other similar experience is \n     relevant, we would look to the fact that the Board was \n     informed that no state legislative employees are included in \n     unions even in states which otherwise encourage full union \n     participation for their own public employees. Unfortunately, \n     the majority neglected to analyze the relevance of this fact.\n       The preamble reflects the majority's belief that it was \n     constrained to act only upon the public rulemaking record. We \n     believe that this analytical model is flawed. The Board cites \n     the reference to the Administrative Procedure Act in section \n     304 of the Act as implicitly signaling that the Congress \n     somehow incorporated that Act's procedural requirements into \n     the CAA. The majority's view overstates the statutory \n     reality. Most simply, the statutory reference does not \n     command slavish adherence to a formalistic APA inquiry. While \n     APA procedures are certainly good starting points for any \n     rulemaking process, its intricacies and judicial \n     interpretations cannot be deemed binding on the CAA process. \n     Indeed, with respect to most of our regulatory activities, \n     the statute places additional limitations on the Board's \n     discretion and inquiry far more limited than that permitted \n     by the APA. Particularly with regard to section 220(e)(1)(B), \n     the statute clearly places different responsibilities and \n     procedural requirements on the Board. The majority erred in \n     adopting its passive analytical role.\n       But perhaps more importantly, we believe that the Board's \n     understanding of the appropriate response by regulators to \n     Rulemaking obligations is seriously constricted. Rulemaking \n     never required a hermetically sealed process in which the \n     decision makers sit in a judicial like cocoon responding only \n     to the documents and case before them. Since this Board has \n     disparate functions, it must adapt itself to the specific \n     role rather than bind itself to a singular method of \n     operation, particularly when the issue in question calls for \n     a unified decision and guidance rather than the laborious and \n     time consuming process inherent in case by case resolution. \n     And in any event, as it has evolved, modern rulemaking \n     encourages active participation by regulatory decision makers \n     in the regulatory process, including staff fact finding and \n     recommendation, contacts with involved parties so that all \n     information is obtained and other independent means of \n     acquiring the information necessary to reach the best policy \n     decision. There is no requirement that regulatory decision \n     makers be constrained solely by written submissions which are \n     subject to the expository ability of the commenters rather \n     than the actual facts and ideas they wish to convey. Indeed, \n     while every other regulatory responsibility of this Board is \n     limited to merely reviewing existing federal regulations, in \n     this one area the statute demands that the Board act \n     proactively on a clean slate. This the Board did not do.\n       We note as well the majority's equation of the Executive \n     Branch functions with the legislative process of the Congress \n     in its citations to past FLRA cases and in its general \n     analysis. We frankly find this comparison to be without any \n     legal or constitutional support. The two branches have wholly \n     different functions. While the Executive Branch has officials \n     who obviously interact with the Congress, their role is not \n     the same as legislative employees who directly support the \n     legislative process in the political offices and institutions \n     of the Congress. Perhaps it should be noted with some \n     emphasis that advocacy before the Congress is not the same as \n     working in the Congress. Thus, it is simply wrong to suggest, \n     as the majority does, that Executive Branch employees perform \n     legislative functions. Or that the Board is somehow bound, in \n     this instance, to mutely follow the holding of one FLRA case \n     which addressed the bargaining unit status of government \n     attorneys employed to interpret and enforce a host of laws \n     directed at employment issues, the vast majority of which \n     have absolutely nothing to do with labor management issues. \n     The issue before us requires a sufficient knowledge of \n     Congressional staff functions, responsibilities and \n     relationship so that the statutorily required determination \n     will be meaningful.\n       We wish to comment on the majority's apparent reluctance or \n     disdain for at least a partial regulatory resolution of this \n     issue.\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n\n     Case by case adjudication of individual factual issues may \n     well be the best means of assuring procedural due process as \n     well as fundamental fairness to the parties involved. The \n     history (until recently) of labor management enforcement had \n     shown a reluctance for regulatory resolution of labor \n     management issues and opted instead for case by case \n     resolution. However, the decisions by the NLRB and the \n     Supreme Court in the American Hospital Association case and \n     more recent efforts by the NLRB to engage in more extensive \n     rulemaking indicates that even in the labor-management arena, \n     in which we find ourselves, there is a recognition that \n     regulatory resolution of global issue requiring resolution is \n     often preferable to time consuming and expensive case by case \n     litigation. We share the concern of some of the commenters \n     that a process of adjudicatory resolution, regardless of the \n     efficient manner in which it may be conducted by the Office \n     of Compliance, is time consuming and subject to delay. To add \n     to this, we note that the Board is a part time body whose \n     members must pursue their professional activities as well as \n     serve in the capacity of Board Member. The Board has \n     justified its refusal to issue advisory opinions on other \n     interpretative matters in part on its resource \n     limitations. We agreed with that decision. We merely think \n     it appropriate that the implications and rationale of that \n     decision be applied to the matter before us.\n       Cognizance must also be taken of the fact that the offices \n     and employees at issue here are transient. In some instances, \n     the entire composition of an employing office may change \n     every two years. We understand that employment in the \n     positions at issue is often not considered a career \n     opportunity but rather represents a period in the \n     professional life of such an employee where they devote their \n     energy and ability to a public pursuit before embarking on \n     their private careers. We point out that case by case \n     adjudication of the eligibility of various employees of \n     various employing offices to be included within collective \n     bargaining units may not be resolved until the employee or \n     the office itself is no longer part of Congress. Thus, while \n     the coverage issue is litigated on a case-by-case, employee-\n     by-employee basis, final resolution of the underlying \n     representational issue is delayed. In a body such as Congress \n     where time pressures are intense and uneven, the inherent \n     disruption and confusion attendant to such uncertainty is \n     highly unfortunate. We believe that the Congress recognized \n     this dilemma by including section 220(e)(1)(B) in the \n     statute. In addition, we look to the impact on employees in \n     those offices who may nevertheless be eligible to join a \n     union if their positions are otherwise not deemed exempt \n     under whatever formulation and note that their statutory \n     rights will be denied because of the insistence on treating \n     this issue as merely another adjudication.\n       We finally must address one argument put forward by the \n     Board that suggests that since Congressional employees are \n     apparently free to join, in their private capacity, whatever \n     organizations they wish such as the Sierra Club, the National \n     Right to Work Committee, or NOW, (but see section 502(a) of \n     the CAA), distinguishing between these activities and union \n     membership or ceding authority to the collective bargaining \n     representative represents an unfair discrimination against \n     unions in violation of the FLRA. While of some obvious \n     surface appeal, this argument is entirely frivolous. We must \n     observe that there is one salient difference between those \n     organizations and the labor representation we are here \n     discussing. The organizations cited by the majority do not \n     represent the employees for the purpose of their employment \n     and working conditions. They have no official status \n     regarding the working relationships and responsibilities of \n     their members. In contrast, the major purpose of labor \n     organizations, aside from their historical and active \n     participation in the political process, is to represent \n     bargaining unit employees with respect to the terms and \n     conditions of their employment as permitted by law. In the \n     case of the FLRA, once a union is the certified bargaining \n     representative, it represents the employee regardless of \n     whether the employee is a member of the union or not. Thus, \n     the reference to other organizations is of absolutely no \n     relevance to issues being decided today and, in fact, raises \n     issues not before us now and not even within the scope of the \n     CAA.\n       For at least the reasons set forth above, we must dissent \n     from the Board's decision regarding Section 220(e)(1)(B) \n     regulations and the explanation for that decision set forth \n     in the Preamble to the final regulation. We emphasize that \n     this dissent should not be deemed as precedent for future \n     divisions of the Board. We cannot emphasize enough the unique \n     requirements of section 220(e)(1)(B). Indeed, the statute \n     itself recognizes this distinction by treating employees of \n     the instrumentalities in a wholly different manner than \n     employees of the 220(e)(2) offices. The Board has spent \n     extensive time reviewing this issue. The majority comes to \n     its conclusions backed by its view of the historical \n     treatment of labor management issues and its belief that its \n     scope of review is limited. In short, the Board adopted an \n     unjustified stance regarding its legal authority and self-\n     perceived constraints in the statute. We believe, however, \n     that precedent and our statute command a different treatment. \n     We also believe that the majority ignores the modern \n     developments in regulatory issues. Thus, in view of the \n     explanations offered in the preamble and the decisions \n     reached by the majority, we regretfully believe those \n     decisions to be wrongly considered and wrongly decided.\n       We add a brief coda to our dissent to simply respond to our \n     colleagues who apparently feel that their lengthy preamble \n     insufficiently set forth their views. We begin by apologizing \n     to the Congress by burdening it at this extraordinary time in \n     the second session of the 104th Congress with these arcane \n     arguments regarding the meaning of the CAA, or PL 104-1. \n     Indeed it is precisely this time constraint which partially \n     drives our concern over the majority's action. We have no \n     doubt that cannery workers, construction workers or sales \n     persons have time constraints. So do health care workers. The \n     Congress will have less than thirty days to complete this \n     session. Critical public business must be completed. These \n     are the time pressures inherent in the Congress which find \n     little parallel in other workplace environments. We \n     respectfully question whether section 220(e)(2) employees are \n     the same as the aforementioned employees, or indeed Executive \n     Branch employees who must perform their critical public \n     business of administering or enforcing the laws Congress \n     passes over a normal full year time span. To underscore our \n     comments in the dissent, our colleagues surely understand the \n     constitutional difference between Article I employees and \n     Article II employees and the constitutionally different \n     responsibilities assigned to each.\n       Our colleagues suggest that we did not read or \n     misunderstood the wealth of materials gathered during the six \n     month period this issue has been before us. While we applaud \n     the majority's acknowledgement now expressed that it must go \n     beyond the submitted comments, we confess not having had the \n     privilege of knowing that these materials existed. But of \n     much more importance, if these materials existed and were of \n     such weight in the majority's consideration, then its own \n     articulately stated view of the statutory obligations of \n     notice and comment should have required that this information \n     be described and listed in the various notices so that the \n     commenters could fairly respond and argue how this \n     information impacted their comments. It wasn't.\n       We respectfully submit that our colleagues misconstrue the \n     discussion regarding the American Hospital Association case. \n     Our point was not to laud the NLRB or even our Deputy \n     Executive Director, which we surely do. Rather it was to \n     suggest that the Supreme Court precedent involving both \n     labor-management laws and regulatory flexibility did provide \n     the guidance and legal authority we understand our colleagues \n     to be searching for. We particularly note that the Court \n     there apparently considered the observations of an \n     administrative law scholar regarding the need to impute into \n     every statute establishing regulatory authority the \n     obligation of sensible interpretation as being as of much or \n     even more precedential weight as the prior decisions of that \n     Court.\n       Too much has been written on this issue. We hope that the \n     Congress does devote some time to considering the \n     recommendation being sent to it by the Board of the Office of \n     Compliance. If this dissent has some resonance, perhaps the \n     Congress might consider returning it to the Board with some \n     guidance as to its intentions regarding the factors to be \n     considered and methodology to be followed by the Board in \n     reaching its recommendations.\n\n\n                          adopted regulations\n\n     Sec. 2472  Specific regulations regarding certain offices of \n         Congress\n     Sec. 2472.1  Purpose and scope\n       The regulations contained in this section implement the \n     provisions of chapter 71 as applied by section 220 of the CAA \n     to covered employees in the following employing offices:\n       (A) the personal office of any Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of any Senator;\n       (B) a standing select, special, permanent, temporary, or \n     other committee of the Senate or House of Representatives, or \n     a joint committee of Congress;\n       (C) the Office of the Vice President (as President of the \n     Senate), the Office of the President pro tempore of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Office of the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Office of \n     the Majority Whip of the Senate, the Office of the Minority \n     Whip of the Senate, the Conference of the Majority of the \n     Senate, the Conference of the Minority of the Senate, the \n     Office of Secretary of the Conference of the Majority of the \n     Senate, the Office of the Secretary of the Conference of the \n     Minority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for the \n     Majority of the Senate, the Office of the Secretary for the \n     Minority of the Senate, the Majority Policy Committee of the \n     Senate, the Minority Policy Committee of the Senate, and the \n     following offices within the Office of the Secretary of the \n     Senate: Offices of the Parliamentarian, Bill Clerk, \n     Legislative Clerk, Journal Clerk, Executive Clerk, Enrolling \n     Clerk, Official Reporters of Debate, Daily Digest, Printing \n     Services, Captioning Services, and Senate Chief Counsel for \n     Employment;\n       (D) the Office of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Majority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives, the Office of the Minority Leader \n     of the House of Representatives, the Offices of the Chief \n     Deputy Majority Whips, the Offices of the Chief Deputy \n     Minority Whips, and the following offices within the Office \n     of the\n\n[[Page S9847]]\n\n     Clerk of the House of Representatives: Offices of Legislative \n     Operations, Official Reporters of Debate, Official Reporters \n     to Committees, Printing Services, and Legislative \n     Information;\n       (E) the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate, \n     the Office of the Senate Legal Counsel, the Office of the \n     Legislative Counsel of the House of Representatives, the \n     Office of the General Counsel of the House of \n     Representatives, the Office of the Parliamentarian of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Office of the Law Revision \n     Counsel;\n       (F) the offices of any caucus or party organization;\n       (G) the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of \n     Technology Assessment, and the Office of Compliance;

CORDREY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are moments in the history of every \nlegislative body when the members, and the public, are forcefully \nreminded that the achievements of the body as a whole have depended \nsignificantly upon the skills and the leadership of a single \nindividual. One of those moments has arrived for the Delaware State \nSenate with the decision of State Senator Richard S. Cordrey not to \nseek reelection in 1996, after 30 years of public service.\n  That his colleagues have long recognized his outstanding personal \nqualities is made clear by the fact that for 24 of those 30 years, \nSenator Cordrey has served as president pro tempore of the Delaware \nSenate--an exceptional tenure in that office that is unrivaled in \nDelaware's history or among his counterparts in other States. As no one \nknows better than those of us who serve in the U.S. Senate, such \nextended recognition of legislative leadership is a certain sign of a \nrare and enduring trust, and Senator Cordrey's legislative record \ndemonstrates why he has been for so long accorded that trust--fully 80 \npercent of the bills he has introduced in the Delaware Senate have been \npassed by both houses of the Delaware General Assembly and signed into \nlaw by one of the five Delaware Governors who have held office since \nSenator Cordrey first entered the Delaware Senate. I doubt that any of \nus here, or any of our predecessors in this Senate could claim \nequivalent legislative success.\n  A major legacy of that success is Delaware's Rainy Day Fund that sets \naside 2 percent of the state's revenues in a fund that can be called \nupon in the event of a devastating economic recession. Delaware's \nthriving economy and its solid reputation on Wall Street can be largely \nattributed to that Cordrey-led initiative in fiscal responsibility. He \ndemonstrated similar economic insight and leadership in shepherding \nthrough the general assembly in the 1980's Delaware's landmark \nFinancial Center Development Act and related legislation which has \nexpanded Delaware's thriving financial-services sector and given the \nState's economy a major boost.\n  But the hallmark of Richard Cordrey's leadership of the Delaware \nState Senate has been his character and personality--an honest and \naffable man with a set of well-defined personal values and an adamant \nintegrity who could nevertheless create bipartisan consensus out of \nlegislative chaos. A Republican colleague, State Senator Myrna Bair, \nhas said of Cordrey, a Democrat, ``He had a way of promoting what he \nbelieved while allowing others to vote their way with no hard \nfeelings;'' and a Democratic colleague, State Senator Thurman Adams, \nhas said, ``He always spoke what he thought was the truth. He took time \nwith people, and they developed tremendous trust in him. His word was \nhis bond.''\n  Mr. President, no legislature would willingly say good-by to a leader \nwho consistently demonstrated such qualities over a quarter-century, \nand the Delaware State Senate will miss the steady hand of Richard \nCordrey at the helm, as will the people of Delaware--but he has chosen \nto retire from office with the same firmness that characterized him in \noffice and, knowing Delaware will benefit far into the future from the \nbody of law and the style of leadership he has created, we Delawareans \nall wish him well as he returns to private life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9847-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9847-S9848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RETIREMENT OF THOMAS R. VOKES FROM THE U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on August 31, 1996, while the Senate was \nin recess, Thomas R. Vokes retired from the U.S. Marshals Service after \na distinguished law enforcement career of 33 years, including 26 years \nwith the Marshals Service.\n  Mr. Vokes was born and raised in Clearfield, PA. He attended the \npublic schools there through high school. In 1963, he embarked on what \nproved to be a most distinguished career in law enforcement when he \njoined the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department as a police \nofficer.\n  In 1966, Mr. Vokes joined the Federal service by becoming a White \nHouse police officer, a predecessor to today's Uniformed Division of \nthe Secret Service. Four years later, Mr. Vokes joined the U.S. \nMarshals Service, the agency from which he just retired.\n  Upon joining the Marshals Service, Mr. Vokes returned to Pennsylvania \nas a deputy U.S. marshal for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Five \nyears later, in 1975, Mr. Vokes became a supervisory deputy marshal in \nthe Middle District. In 1980, Mr. Vokes was promoted and moved to \nCalifornia to become a court security inspector. He received a court \nappointment to serve as the U.S. marshal for the Central District of \nCalifornia, one of the Nation's largest Federal judicial districts, in \nJanuary 1981 and served until March 1982.\n  Upon completing his term as U.S. marshal in Los Angeles, Mr. Vokes \nreturned to Pennsylvania and served as chief deputy U.S. marshal, the \nsenior career position, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania for 2 \nyears. After additional service as chief deputy U.S. marshal in North \nDakota, Mr. Vokes returned once again to Pennsylvania in 1991, having \nbeen appointed by the Attorney General to serve as the U.S. marshal for \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania, based in Philadelphia.\n  It was in this capacity that I came to know Mr. Vokes. As the U.S. \nmarshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Mr. Vokes was widely \nrecognized and esteemed by Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies and by the Federal courts for his effective leadership and \nmanagement of the functions of the Marshals Service in the district. I \nknew the security of the Federal courts in Philadelphia was in good \nhands when Marshal Vokes was at the helm.\n  In March 1994, Marshal Vokes left Philadelphia and returned to \nWashington, where he had started his law enforcement career, to serve \nas the chief of the Marshal Service's Prisoner Operations Division, \nmanaging the agency that ensures that Federal prisoners awaiting trial \nshow up in court at the appointed time. It was from this position that \nMarshal Vokes just retired.\n  If the measure of the man is the trust reposed in him, Marshal Vokes \nhas been highly respected throughout his career. Twice he was selected \nto serve as chief deputy U.S. marshal, the senior career position in \nthe Marshals Service. And twice he was selected to serve as the U.S. \nmarshal in two of the Nation's largest and busiest judicial districts, \nLos Angeles and Philadelphia. Finally, he ended his career in charge of \none of the operational divisions of the entire Marshals Service.\n\n[[Page S9848]]\n\n  Too often we in Congress fail to recognize publicly the thousands of \ndedicated civil servants like Marshal Vokes who carry out the laws that \nwe adopt. I am pleased to honor Marshal Vokes for his dedication to our \nNation and its people. He is one of Pennsylvania's finest, and we have \nbeen honored to share his talents with the rest of the Nation. I know \nall my colleagues join me in wishing Marshal Thomas R. Vokes all the \nbest in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9847-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9848-S9851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF CONGRESSMAN PETE PETERSON TO BE AMBASSADOR TO VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the chairman \nof the Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to outline for my colleagues a decision that I and \nthe distinguished full committee chairman Mr. Helms have made to \npostpone the nomination hearing of Congressman Douglas ``Pete'' \nPeterson to be Ambassador to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV).\n  At the outset let me say, as I did to Congressman Peterson yesterday, \nthat the reason for the postponement--and I will address this in \ngreater detail in a moment--is the White House's failure to meet the \nconstitutional requirements for the nomination; it has nothing to do \nwith Pete Peterson as a nominee. If the White House had avoided this \noversight, we could have moved ahead with this nomination--a nomination \nI believe most of the committee would support--without all the fits and \nstarts and delays.\n  The President nominated Congressman Peterson for the position of \nAmbassador to the SRV on May 23, 1996. His file was received by the \nfull committee in June and was finally complete and ready for \nconsideration by the committee on June 25. The full committee scheduled \na confirmation hearing on the Peterson nomination and three others for \nJuly 23, which I was to chair in my capacity as chairman of the \nsubcommittee of jurisdiction. However, because of a series of conflicts \nwith the Senate schedule, the hearing had to be postponed twice; first \nto July 29 and then to September 5, after the August recess.\n  But at the same time this series of postponements was taking place, \nthe distinguished Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] and I were \ngrowing concerned over a legal issue which had come to our attention \nregarding to the nomination. On July 17, our legal staffs informed us \nthat a provision of the Constitution might preclude Congressman \nPeterson from serving as Ambassador. We contacted the White House, and \nasked for a detailed clarification of the issue from them. At the same \ntime, we asked the Office of Senate Legal Counsel [SLC] to provide us \nwith their opinion. Mr. Jack Quinn, Counsel to the President, provided \nus with a letter outlining the administration position on July 22; \ntheir legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel [OLC] at the \nDepartment of Justice followed after the close of business on July 26. \nThe SLC opinion was delivered to us the same day.\n  After carefully reviewing the opinions of the OLC and the SLC over \nthe August recess, and the legal authorities cited in them, we have \nconcluded that the constitutional issue requires us to postpone \nCongressman Peterson's nomination hearing until January next year in \norder to meet the requirements of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, article I, section 6, clause 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution provides in part:\n\n  No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was \nelected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the \nUnited States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof \nshall have been increased during such time. . . .\n\n  In other words, this provision of the Constitution--called the \nineligibility clause--prohibits a Member of Congress from being \nappointed to a civil position in the Government which was created, or \nfor which there was a salary increase, during that Member's term of \noffice.\n  The first time the ineligibility clause arose as an issue was during \nthe Presidency of George Washington; the second was during the \nadministration of President Arthur. In both cases, the President's \ninterpreted the provision literally and it was concluded that the \nConstitution prohibited even the nomination of a Member of Congress to \nan office created during his term--thus equating nomination with \nappointment. As President Arthur's Attorney General stated:\n\n       It is unnecessary to consider the question of the policy \n     which occasioned this constitutional prohibition. I must be \n     controlled exclusively by the positive terms of the \n     provision of the Constitution. The language is precise and \n     clear, and, in my opinion, disables him from receiving the \n     appointment. The rule is absolute, as expressed in the \n     terms of the Constitution, and behind that I can not go, \n     but must accept it as it is presented regarding its \n     application in this case.\n\n  Under a literal reading, then, Congressman Peterson cannot be even \nconsidered for the nomination until after January 3, 1997--the \nexpiration of his present term. It would seem to me that if President \nWashington found a nomination similar to Congressman Peterson's void \nfrom the outset because of the ineligibility clause, that reasoning \nshould be good enough for the Clinton administration.\n  Even if we assume for the sake of argument that a literal \nconstruction of the clause is not warranted here--and that we have to \ndetermine exactly which act or series of acts constitutes an \nappointment under the clause--an examination of the facts in \nCongressman Peterson's case yields the same conclusion. It has been \nargued that some precedent exists to support the conclusion that \nappointment requires both the acts of nomination and of confirmation by \nthe Senate. For example, in Marbury versus Madison, Chief Justice \nMarshall wrote:\n\n       These . . . clauses of the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States which affect this part of the case [governing \n     the appointment of U.S. marshals] . . . seem to contemplate \n     three distinct operations:\n       1. The nomination. This is the sole act of the President, \n     and is completely voluntary.\n       2. The appointment. This is also the act of the President, \n     and is also a voluntary act, though it can only be performed \n     by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       3. The commission. To grant a commission to a person \n     appointed might, perhaps, be deemed a duty enjoined by the \n     Constitution. ``He shall,'' says that instrument, \n     ``commission all the officers of the United States.''\n       The acts appointing to office, and commissioning the person \n     appointed, can scarcely be considered as one and the same; \n     since the power to perform them is given in two separate and \n     distinct sections of the Constitution.\n\n  Although that case is not controlling in the Peterson situation \nbecause it did not involve the ineligibility clause, assuming that it \ngoverned here would still preclude our taking up the Congressman's \nnomination before the expiration of his present term. Under the \nreasoning of Marbury, Congressman Peterson would be appointed within \nthe meaning of the ineligibility clause at the time the Senate were to \ngive its advice and consent. Given the facts of his case, it would be \nunconstitutional for this body to confirm the Congressman by a floor \nvote prior to the next Congress.\n  Moreover, Chairman Helms and I consider the nomination hearing to be \nan integral part of the process of advice and consent. It is, after \nall, the only time that the Senate as a body--through its Foreign \nRelations Committee--has a chance to personally examine and question \nthe nominee and his qualifications for office. The committee then \nprepares a written report urging the full Senate to a particular course \nof action in voting for or against the nomination. We would, therefore, \nconsider it constitutionally inadvisable to proceed with a hearing on a \nconstitutionally ineligible nominee such as in this case until January \nnext year--when the constitutional issue is no longer a problem.\n  Next, Mr. President, we must consider whether the office of \nambassador is a ``civil office of the United States'' and thus is \ngoverned by the clause. The OLC opinion contends that ``there is a \ndifficult and substantial question'' whether it is a civil office, and \nthat the only precedent it could find ``assum[ed] (without discussion) \nthat it should be considered to be such an office. In accordance with \nthat precedence [sic], we shall assume here, without deciding, that the \nAmbassadorship to Vietnam would be a `civil Office' within the meaning \nof the ineligibility clause.'' While the OLC opinion thus concedes\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\nthe point for purposes of this particular argument, I believe that an \nexamination of the history of the ineligibility clause, as well as the \nnature of the office itself, clearly establishes that it is a civil \noffice contemplated by the provision.\n  The early drafts of what became the ineligibility clause did not \nlimit the prohibition to civil office, but encompassed all offices of \nthe United States. During the debates at the Constitutional \nConventions, however, the Framers came to realize the danger in having \nthe clause prohibit what might be some of the most able military men in \nthe country from serving in the Armed Forces in time of war. Many \nofficers from the Continental Army had become Members of Congress; if a \nwar had broken out, the fledgling country would have been deprived of \nmuch of its officer corps because the then-proposed ineligibility \nclause would have prevented their joining until the expiration of their \nrespective terms of office. So the adjective ``civil'' was added, to \ndistinguish it from the military. This is in line with the dictionary \ndefinition of civil: ``of ordinary citizen or ordinary community life \nas distinguished from the military or ecclesiastical.'' So as \ncontemplated by the Framers, an ambassadorship is clearly ``civil'' in \nnature.\n  Similarly, an ambassadorship is clearly a Federal office, as that \nterm is defined both in law and practice. For example, in United States \nversus Hartwell, the Supreme Court stated that ``a[] [Federal] office \nis a public station, or employment, conferred by the appointment of \ngovernment. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, \nand duties.'' Ambassadors are appointed by the President, and serve for \nthe duration of a President's term or until they retire or are \nreassigned; they are paid from the Treasury; and they have a well-\ndefined and customary series of duties they perform--all the criteria \nof a Federal office.\n  I would also note that article II, section 2 of the Constitution \ndeclares that ``the President shall nominate, and . . . shall appoint \nambassadors . . . and all other officers of the United States.'' Note, \nMr. President, the use of the term ``all other.'' This infers that \nambassadors are part of the class of ``officers of the United States.'' \nIn view of these facts, it can hardly be argued that an ambassadorship \nis not a civil office of the United States, and thus falls within the \nclause's prohibition.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the ineligibility clause requires us to \ndetermine whether the office of Ambassador to the SRV is one which was \ncreated during the Congressman's term of office. As I previously \nmentioned, Representative Peterson was most recently elected on \nNovember 8, 1994, for a term that began on January 4, 1995, and that \nwill end at noon on January 3, 1997. The President formally extended \nfull diplomatic recognition to the SRV for the very first time in \nAugust 1995 and nominated Mr. Peterson to be Ambassador to the SRV on \nMay 23, 1996.\n  The White House has taken the creative position that:\n\n       ...based on the facts and circumstances of this case, the \n     office of Ambassador to Vietnam has not yet been created. If \n     the Senate confirms Mr. Peterson, the President will not \n     create the position of Ambassador to Vietnam until after noon \n     on January 3, 1997. Therefore, so long as the Office is \n     created at a time after Mr. Peterson's term of office . . . \n     has expired, he can be appointed to the Office of Ambassador \n     [without running into constitutional problems].\n\n  Rather than paraphrase the OLC argument, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent the relevant portions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Excerpt From Office of Legal Counsel Opinion\n\n\n                                  iii.\n\n       We think it fair to say that the patterns of constitutional \n     practice that we have described do not conclusively answer \n     the question when the office of an ambassadorship is created. \n     Nonetheless, we think that the legal and historical materials \n     strongly point towards a particular answer, and we find that \n     answer to be considerably more persuasive than any of the \n     alternatives. Based on our survey of the materials, including \n     the 1814 debate, we believe that the following tests are \n     appropriate in determining when, for purposes of the \n     Ineligibility Clause, the President has created the office of \n     ambassador to a particular foreign State, in cases when such \n     an ambassadorship has not existed before or (as in the case \n     of Vietnam) has lapsed or been terminated:\n       1. In the usual course, the office is created at the time \n     of appointment of the first ambassador to a foreign State \n     once the President establishes diplomatic relations with that \n     State. All that precedes the appointment--offering to \n     establish normal diplomatic relations, receiving the foreign \n     State's agreement to receive a particular person as the \n     United States' ambassador, nominating and confirming that \n     individual as ambassador--are all steps preparatory to the \n     creation of the office. If the President ultimately declines \n     to appoint an ambassador, the ``office'' is never created.\n       2. The President, nonetheless, retains the power to alter \n     the ordinary course of events, and to create the office at \n     some other time--or not at all. The act of creating the \n     office must be distinguished from the preparatory steps \n     leading to its creation. The preparatory acts indicate that \n     the President intends to create the office; they do not in \n     themselves constitute its creation. Indeed, in the ordinary \n     course, the President should be understood to intend to \n     create the office of ambassador upon the appointment of the \n     individual as the first ambassador to the receiving State.\n       We turn now to the application of these tests to the \n     ambassadorship to Vietnam.\n\n\n                                  IV.\n\n       The process by which the United States have been \n     normalizing its relations with Vietnam has been underway for \n     several years. The Republic of Vietnam (``RVN'') was \n     constituted as an independent State within the French Union \n     in 1950, and the United States sent a Minister to that State. \n     (The United States did not recognize the Democratic Republic \n     of Vietnam (``DRVN''), which had earlier declared itself to \n     be an independent State.) Thereafter, on June 25, 1952, the \n     United States appointed an Ambassador to the RVN, and \n     upgraded the United States Legation in Saigon to Embassy \n     status. In 1954, Vietnam was partitioned into what came \n     commonly to be called ``North'' and ``South'' Vietnam. \n     Despite an international agreement calling for the \n     reunification of Vietnam, that did not occur; instead, the \n     RVN, functionally, became South Vietnam, and the DRVN, \n     functionally, North Vietnam. The United States maintained an \n     ambassadorial post in the RVN from 1952 onwards. The last \n     United States Ambassador left his post in Saigon on April 29, \n     1975.\n       After the Communist victory over South Vietnam in April, \n     1975, it became the position of the United States that \n     ``[t]he Government of South Vietnam has ceased to exist and \n     therefore the United States no longer recognizes it as the \n     sovereign authority in the territory of South Vietnam. The \n     United States has not recognized any other government as \n     constituting such authority.'' Republic of Vietnam v. Pfizer, \n     Inc., 556 F.2d 892, 895 n.4 (8th Cir. 1977) (quoting letter \n     from State Department).\n       During the present Administration, several successive and \n     carefully measured steps were taken with a view to improving, \n     and perhaps normalizing, relations between the United States \n     and Vietnam. On July 2, 1993, President Clinton announced \n     that the United States would no longer oppose the resumption \n     of aid to Vietnam by international financial institutions. On \n     February 3, 1994, the President announced the lifting of the \n     United States' embargo against Vietnam. He also announced an \n     intent to open a liaison office in Hanoi in order to promote \n     further progress on issues of concern to both countries, \n     including the status of American prisoners of war and \n     Americans missing in action. His statement emphasized, \n     however, that ``[t]hese actions do not constitute a \n     normalization of our relationships. Before that happens, we \n     must have more progress, more cooperation and more answers.'' \n     On May 26, 1994, the United States and Vietnam formally \n     entered into consular relations within the framework of the \n     1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which both \n     States were party. The United States, however, continued to \n     condition diplomatic relations on progress in areas of \n     concern to it. On January 28, 1995, the United States and \n     Vietnam signed an agreement relating to the restoration of \n     diplomatic properties and another agreement relating to the \n     settlement of private claims. On July 11, 1995, the President \n     announced an offer to establish diplomatic relations with \n     Vietnam under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations--\n     an offer that Vietnam accepted on the following day. In \n     announcing that offer, the President stated that from the \n     beginning of his Administration, ``any improvement in \n     relationships between America and Vietnam has depended \n     upon making progress on the issue of Americans who were \n     missing in action or held as prisoners of war.'' Soon \n     thereafter, the United States Liaison Office in Hanoi was \n     upgraded to a Diplomatic Post.\n       On May 8, 1996, the Government of Vietnam gave its \n     agreement (``agreement'') to the United States' proposal that \n     Representative Peterson be Ambassador Extraordinary and \n     Plenipotentiary of the United States to Vietnam. On May 23, \n     1996, the President submitted Mr. Peterson's name to the \n     United States Senate for its advice and consent to that \n     appointment.\n       In our judgment, while this pattern of activity \n     demonstrates that the President fully intends and expects to \n     create the office of ambassador to Vietnam, it does not \n     establish\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\n     that he has, in fact, yet done so. The establishment of \n     diplomatic relations does not entail the establishment of a \n     diplomatic mission or the creation of the office of an \n     ambassador. See Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, \n     art. 2. Moreover, the existence of diplomatic relations with \n     Vietnam does not require (although it may normally assume) an \n     exchange of ambassadors, since relations may be conducted at \n     a lower diplomatic level. Further, we do not think that \n     Vietnam's agreement to receive Mr. Peterson as ambassador \n     establishes that that office exists for constitutional \n     purposes. Nor (although the question is closer) does the \n     President's decision to submit Mr. Peterson's name to the \n     Senate for confirmation. Even if Mr. Peterson is confirmed, \n     the President would retain the discretion not to send an \n     ambassador to Vietnam, or otherwise not to create that \n     office. In view of the facts that the United States has not \n     had an ambassador to Vietnam since 1975 (and has never had an \n     ambassador to the present government), that the process of \n     normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam \n     has been a complex and protracted one, and that \n     contingencies, however unlikely, may yet arise that would \n     lead the President to conclude that it was not in the United \n     States' best interests to appoint and send an ambassador, we \n     do not think that the office of ambassador to Vietnam can be \n     said to exist unless and until the President actually \n     completes the process by appointing an officer to that \n     position. Accordingly, if the President decides not to \n     appoint Mr. Peterson to that office until after the \n     expiration of the present term of Congress on January 3, \n     1997, we do not think that Mr. Peterson is constitutionally \n     ineligible for that appointment.\n       In the interests of clarity, we repeat that we are not \n     maintaining that an ``appointment'' within the meaning of the \n     Ineligibility Clause does not occur until the appointee is \n     actually commissioned by the President. Whatever the merits \n     of that view as an original proposition (and they are \n     substantial),\\31\\ we are not writing on a clean slate. \n     Accordingly, we follow the centuries-old teaching and \n     practice of the Executive branch in assuming that the \n     nomination of an ineligible individual is itself a \n     constitutional nullity, even if the commissioning of that \n     individual were to occur after the term of his or her \n     ineligibility. Our position is that, in the singular \n     circumstances of this case, the relevant office--the \n     Ambassadorship to Vietnam--has not yet been ``created,'' so \n     that no ineligibility exists. Thus, both the President's act \n     of nominating Mr. Peterson, and the Senate's act of \n     confirming him (if it does), are constitutionally valid.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I must say that this is one of the least \nstraightforward legal arguments that I have seen. In effect, the \nadministration is saying ``go ahead and hold a hearing on the fitness \nof this nominee to occupy and conduct the duties of an office which we \nhave not yet created but will create at some time in the future.'' I \nbelieve that the clear and serious problems with that argument are \nself-evident.\n  Mr. President, what the OLC proposes raises a serious constitutional \nseparation of powers issue in my mind. The Senate's advice and consent \nfunction requires a review not simply of the nominee, but of his or her \nqualifications and fitness to fill a particular office. To call for \nSenate confirmation of a nominee before the creation of the office that \nhe would fill would deprive the Senate of that complete inquiry.\n  The OLC has sought to brush aside the problems created by asking us \nto hold a hearing on an uncreated office by stating that ``[e]ven if \nthat particular ambassadorship has yet to be created, the duties and \nresponsibilities of an ambassador are of course perfectly familiar to \nthe Senate.'' But hypothetically, Mr. President, if we were to confirm \nan ambassador for an as-yet uncreated office, what is there to assure \nus that a President could not simply change the nature or duties of the \noffice at his whim after the fact, leaving us--having given our \nconsent--with no constitutional recourse? The Framers of the \nConstitution did not envision a carte blanche for the State Department \nin circumstances such as these.\n  To hold a hearing under these circumstances would set an unadvisable \nprecedent for the Senate. Although the OLC states that there is \nprecedent for our confirming a nominee for which the office did not yet \nexist, their two examples are not applicable to the facts in the \nPeterson case. First and foremost, none involved the position of \nambassador. Second, both involved executive-branch bodies that were \nlegislatively created--the Occupational Safety and Health Review \nCommission, and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The \nlegislation creating each office had already become law, but provided \nthat the particular respective offices and their holders --in these \ncases OSHRC Commissioner and Secretary of HEW--were to become effective \nat a later specific date. So OLC overlooks the fact that the offices \nhad therefore already been created, but they were just not yet \nfunctional at the time the nominees were confirmed. An unfilled office \nis hardly the same thing as an uncreated office.\n  Given all this, Mr. President, I feel that the Constitution presently \nprecludes our giving our advice and consent regarding the Peterson \nnomination. Moreover, I believe that it is inadvisable--in view of the \nSenate's constitutional role in the nomination process--to move ahead \nwith the nomination hearing. If we accept for the sake of argument the \nWhite House position that, as the State Department spokesman put it, \nthe office of ambassador is not created until the nominee actually \ntakes up that office, we would be holding a hearing on confirming an \nindividual for a position that does not yet exist. I have just \nmentioned the problems I have with that conclusion. How then would we \nexercise what is basically our constitutionally mandated oversight \nfunction? How would we determine whether the nominee is fit for the \noffice to which he has been nominated if that office--and consequently \nits constituent functions and duties --has not come into being?\n  Given all these substantial problems, I and the chairman have \nconcluded that it would be better to postpone the hearing on \nRepresentative Peterson's nomination until after January 3, 1997, when \nhis term--and the constitutional issue--expire. I pledge to my \ncolleagues, and more importantly to Congressman Peterson, that if I am \nchairman of the East Asia Subcommittee in the next Congress my very \nfirst hearing will be on this nomination. And I will, in any case, do \neverything I can to expedite the nomination process for him.\n  Mr. President, in closing let me stress what our decision to postpone \nthe hearing is not about. First, as I mentioned at the beginning of my \nstatement today it is not about Pete Peterson. I have never heard any \nMember, regardless of their position on normalization of relations with \nthe SRV, have anything but praise for the Congressman. He has an \nexemplary record of service to his country spanning several decades of \nwhich I believe all my colleagues are aware. As an Air Force captain, \nhe was flying a combat mission in September 1966 when a North \nVietnamese surface-to-air missile struck his Phantom jet fighter. He \nejected free of the plane, but parachuted into a tree in the dark \nbreaking an arm, leg, and shoulder. He was captured by the Vietnamese \nand spent 6\\1/2\\ years as a POW. He first came to Congress in 1991. \nWhen his nomination comes before the committee and the full Senate, I \nintend to vote in favor of it.\n  It is unfortunate, frankly, that Congressman Peterson has become the \nvictim of what I would charitably characterize as administration \nbungling. The administration completely failed to address this issue \nuntil our staffs brought it to their attention in mid-July. But it \nshould not have come as a surprise to them, Mr. President--the issue \nhas come up several times in previous administrations and even once in \nthis administration with the nomination of Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be \nTreasury Secretary. Sadly, the only mention of the issue in the \nAdministration prior to our raising the issue was the following one-\npage memo dated May 17, 1996, which somewhat ironically only addresses \nthe emoluments portion of the clause--the only portion of the clause \nnot applicable in Congressman Peterson's case. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the memo be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1996.\n     Memo for the file.\n     Subject: Nomination of Congressman Pete Peterson to be \n         Ambassador to Vietnam.\n       In response to a question from the Executive Clerk at the \n     White House, Mary Beth West, L/LM, and her staff researched \n     the possible impact on Congressman Peterson's ambassadorial \n     nomination of Article 1, Section 6, of the Constitution which \n     states:\n       ``No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for \n     which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under \n     the Authority of the United States, which shall have\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\n     been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been \n     increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office \n     under the United States, shall be a Member of either House \n     during his Continuance in Office.''\n       In consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel at the \n     Justice Department and the White House Counsel's Office, it \n     was determined that this constitutional requirement only \n     prohibits the appointment of a Senator or Representative to a \n     civil office if an act of Congress has created, or increased, \n     the emoluments of that office during that Senator's or \n     Representative's current term of office. In Congressman \n     Peterson's case, there have been no salary increases covering \n     ambassadors during his current term of office.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Had the administration done its job, Congressman Peterson \nwould have been spared the surprise and awkwardness of having his \nhearing postponed for several months. It is unfortunate that he has \nbecome a victim of this administration's unfortunate tendency to be \nreactive, rather than proactive, in its foreign policy decisions.\n  In some other circumstances, Mr. President, I might worry about a \ndelay in sending an ambassador to a particular country and the effect \nsuch a delay might have on our foreign policy. Since May the State \nDepartment has been strongly urging the Senate to take up the Peterson \nnomination at the earliest possible date because ``it is vital to U.S. \ninterests that we have an Ambassador in place there.'' With that sense \nof urgency, the Department was continually requesting that the \nnomination be placed on a fast track. That sense of urgency is \nunabated, but the White House has terminally undercut its own argument \nby stating that even if the Senate gave its advice and consent in this \nsession to avoid a constitutional problem it would not officially \ncommission and send him to Hanoi until after the expiration of his \npresent term--in other words not until next January--to avoid \nconstitutional complications. It seems to make little sense to hold a \nhearing now on a nominee who all sides agree is constitutionally barred \nfrom taking office until the next Congress convenes. Thankfully for \nCongressman Peterson, our delay will not appreciably add to the time he \nwill now be kept from his new position.\n  Second, the postponement it is not about what I view as the \nadministration's hurried move to normalize relations with the SRV. It \nwill not come as a surprise to anyone that as a Senator I have opposed \nnormalization in the past. My opposition was not based on my dislike of \nthat country's communist dictatorship, or even its brutal repression of \nits own people--although in this administration's somewhat hypocritical \nview these two bases seem sufficient to deny diplomatic recognition to \nother countries such as Cuba, North Korea, and Burma. Rather, I did not \nbelieve that we should reward Hanoi with normalization when, in my \nopinion and the opinion of many other Members of this and the other \nbody, Hanoi had not been sufficiently forthcoming with information \nabout our country's missing and dead servicemen.\n  I acknowledge that the President has wide latitude in the conduct of \nforeign policy, he has made the decision to normalize relations, and \nthe Congress has more or less decided to go along with that decision. I \nhave repeatedly stated that I will not stand in the way of that process \nsimply because I disagree with the original decision.\n  Third, the decision to postpone is decidedly not--I repeat not--about \npolitics. While it has become somewhat ``normal'' in the Senate for a \ncommittee controlled by one party to hold up action on the nominees \nproposed by a President from the opposing party at the close of an \nelection year, such is not the case in this committee this year. The \ndistinguished full committee chairman, Mr. Helms, made it clear several \nmonths ago that it is his intention to move all matters pending before \nthe committee--whether nominations, legislation, or treaties--out to \nthe full Senate in time for them to be acted upon before the Senate \nadjourns sine die sometime in October; I fully support that position.\n  In addition, I have never managed issues within the jurisdiction of \nmy subcommittee in anything less than a fully bipartisan spirit. I \nfirmly believe that to be effective, U.S. foreign policy is an issue \nthat should be insulated from the currents and eddies of partisan \npolitics. Toward that end, I have never raised objections to an \nambassadorial nominee solely because he or she was a Democrat, or a \npolitical, as opposed to a career, nominee. First, I would not have \nscheduled, and then rescheduled, this nomination hearing if I had not \nhad every intention of moving forward with it. Nor would I go on record \nas publicly committing myself to make the Peterson nomination my first \nof 1997.\n  Fourth, this is not a question of the committee making a mountain out \nof a molehill. It is not some arcane issue to which we can turn a blind \neye. It exists in black and white in the Constitution, the very \ndocument that many Members of this body carry with them daily and which \nall of us have sworn to uphold.\n  Some might ask, ``What would it harm to simply overlook the \nproblem?'' What would it harm, Mr. President? Simply put, I believe \nstrongly that it would harm the Constitution and the Senate. There is \nan enormous temptation to chisel at the margins of the Constitution. \nThe temptation becomes almost irresistible when the corner chiseled at \nis deemed a nuisance and the likelihood is very remote that anyone \nwould bring a lawsuit against those holding the chisel. The \nineligibility clause would seem to fall into this category.\n  But a constitutional violation is no less a constitutional violation \nsimply because the offended provision is perceived to be a minor one, \nor because of the absence of a judicial ruling to that effect. The \nPresident has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution; so have I, and \nI take that oath very seriously. The duty extends to every part of that \ndocument, not just to those portions that are considered convenient or \nmore expedient than others. We should not turn our backs on the \nConstitution simply because we agree Congressman Peterson is a good \ncandidate or because the State Department would rather that he have his \nhearing now as opposed to later. Given the Constitution or the \nadministration's convenience, the choice is clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9848-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9851-S9852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INNOVATIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES AT NORFOLK NAVAL BASE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, in an article entitled ``An Admiral Turns \nBig Guns on Waste at Norfolk, VA, Base'' last month, Wall Street \nJournal reporter John Fialka described some of the new business \npractices that the Navy is employing to improve the efficiency of its \nbase operations. I will ask unanimous consent that this article be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks for the benefit \nof my colleagues who may have missed it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. This article documents a number of innovative initiatives \nundertaken by the Navy at Norfolk Naval Base--energy audits; joint \nagreements with civilian port terminals to increase the Navy's railroad \naccess and terminal capacity; and lease arrangements with private real \nestate developers to increase the quality and quantity of housing for \nNavy members and their families. Mr. President, this kind of aggressive \nand innovative approach to reducing infrastructure costs is essential \nif our military services are going to have the funds to invest in the \nnew systems and equipment need to modernize our forces.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the individual most responsible \nfor these efforts at Norfolk Naval Base is Adm. William J. ``Bud'' \nFlanagan, the Commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Many of my colleagues \nremember Admiral Flanagan from his tour as head of the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs in the late 1980's. Following that assignment, \nAdmiral Flanagan commanded the Navy's Second Fleet before taking over \nas Commander of the Atlantic Fleet.\n  Mr. President, I have known and worked with Admiral Flanagan for many \nyears. He is an extremely capable naval officer, and I am not at all \nsurprised to see that he is also an energetic and creative business \nmanager who is bringing innovative practices to the Navy's base \noperations. I hope that he keeps up the good work, and that others \nthroughout the military services follow his good example.\n\n[[Page S9852]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 19, 1996]\n\n        An Admiral Turns Big Guns on Waste at Norfolk, VA., Base\n\n\n Facing a Sea of Business Deals, Flanagan Charts a Course That Changes \n                               U.S. Navy\n\n                          (By John J. Fialka)\n\n       Norfolk, VA.--Not long ago, a private company wanted to \n     rent one of the Navy's sagging, ``temporary'' buildings here. \n     It offered $400,000 a year for a Cold War relic that was \n     sitting empty.\n       ``We can't do that! Tear it down,'' ordered Adm. William J. \n     ``Bud'' Flanagan Jr., commander of the Atlantic Fleet and the \n     short, stocky czar of the sprawling Norfolk Naval Base.\n       The admiral, who now oversees an $11 billion budget but \n     spent many of his 29 years in the Navy hunting for Soviet \n     submarines, had reason to torpedo the deal. He had hired an \n     outside research firm to analyze the base's $100 million \n     energy bill--a first--and found that heating and cooling the \n     70,000-square-foot, uninsulated structure would cost nearly \n     $1 million a year. So the rental would lose money. Now, the \n     building is the 84th the admiral has ordered destroyed, and \n     he has targeted 80 more.\n       Not that Adm. Flanagan hates business deals. In fact, he \n     views this 55-square-mile naval base as awash in \n     entrepreneurial possibilities. He will welcome tourists to \n     what will be, in effect, a theme park with aircraft carriers. \n     He will let a neighboring cargo terminal store cocoa beans on \n     the base--if it helps load Navy ships. He will let developers \n     build fancy townhouses and offices on a slummy-looking \n     peninsula.\n       For decades, the Navy played a cat and mouse with the \n     Soviet Union at sea, but on shore it operated much like its \n     old adversary. Nobody itemized costs. Electricity wasn't \n     metered. Submarine, aircraft and surface-ship commanders \n     built redundant fiefs and, Adm. Flanagan complains, ``didn't \n     talk to each other.'' As with many federal bureaucracies, \n     leftover funds reverted to the Treasury at year end; so they \n     were spent--on almost anything. ``The old tradition was if \n     the Navy can spend some money, it will,'' he recently noted \n     to a group of naval auditors.\n\n\n                             changed rules\n\n       Last year, however, the Navy changed the rules--after hard \n     lobbying by Adm. Flanagan. He did so partly because, as one \n     of a Cape Cod, Mass., policeman's eight children, he admired \n     his mother's gentle but firm grasp on the family budget. But \n     he also was strongly influenced by four mid-career months at \n     Harvard Business School, where he became acquainted with \n     marketing concepts. ``It opened up a whole new avenue of \n     thought,'' he recalls.\n       Under the Navy's new rules, a commander who saves money or \n     generates outside income can use the funds to buy new ships, \n     planes or other equipment. Now Adm. Flanagan, perhaps with \n     more determination than most senior officers, is trying to \n     get his subordinates on board. His reasoning: The Navy's job \n     remains ``to fight and win.'' he says, but, in an era of \n     shrinking budgets, it can't win ``unless we learn to look \n     more like GE than USN.''\n       When he found the Norfolk base renting several hundred vans \n     it didn't need and its overstaffed golf course losing vast \n     sums, he didn't ``shoot anybody'' but got the problems \n     corrected, he says. ``If you start assessing fear and \n     blame,'' he adds, waste simply goes ``underground.'' Instead, \n     he praises managers who improve matters.\n       Meanwhile, the first new business was peering through the \n     front gate. Lured by hulking carriers moored at the docks, \n     some 350,000 visitors showed up at base entrances every year, \n     but most couldn't get past the guards. So in October, the \n     admiral removed the guards from the gates. ``It took some old \n     salts here some time to get used to it,'' recalls Norfolk's \n     mayor, Paul Fraim.\n       Before long, tour buses will call at a new, privately owned \n     marina and restaurant, which will share any profits with the \n     base, and a ``Welcome Center'' complete with souvenir shops. \n     Naval Number-crunchers--more use to counting munitions--\n     expect 500,000 tourists this year, causing one naval officer \n     to exult: ``When they each buy a baseball cap at $6 a pop, \n     we've just made $3 million!''\n       Nearbly Norfolk International Terminals is also pleased. \n     Cramped for space, it finds itself inundated by two million \n     bags of cocoa beans after a market upheaval. For years, \n     Robert Bray, executive director of the Virginia Port \n     Authority, which runs it, had sought access to empty Navy \n     warehouses just across the fence but found ``the answer was \n     always no.''\n\n\n                          Barter Deal Proposed\n\n       Adm. Flanagan said yes. But he wants a billion-dollar \n     barter deal; if the terminal will load cargo onto Navy ships, \n     it can build storage facilities on unused naval property. \n     Under the projected agreement, the railroad serving the \n     terminal could use Navy land, allowing it to operate longer \n     freight trains. Both the terminal and the base would gain \n     cargo capacity.\n       Another possible deal that interests Adm. Flanagan involves \n     Willoughby spit, a landfill area with 440 somewhat-shabby \n     Navy apartments--each needing $70,000 of renovation. Two \n     local developers see opportunity--prime waterfront land for a \n     hotel-office-marina complex and townhouses. Monica R. \n     Shephard, the Navy's negotiator, hopes to lease out the site \n     on a long-term basis and use the revenue to finance better \n     naval housing elsewhere. However, civilian tenants would \n     be warned they could be temporarily locked off the base in \n     a national emergency.\n       In addition, many other tacky, prefab buildings are coming \n     down. Adm. Flanagan, who first came here as a freighter \n     crewman in 1964, remembers even then wondering why so many \n     ``temporaries'' were still around. As the landlord, he found \n     132 Navy tenants, some with no direct connection to his \n     base's mission, and told them to pay rent or ship out. ``The \n     goal is to make people aware that this stuff isn't free. . . \n     . We are in a limited-resources game,'' he explains.\n\n\n                     repair facilities consolidated\n\n       His staffers also have consolidated 13 electric-motor \n     repair facilities into one and have cut some 30 instrument-\n     calibration shops to five. The savings so far: about $39 \n     million. And Rear Adm. Art Clark, the Atlantic fleet's chief \n     maintenance officer, says he can cut more.\n       Not all this pleases private repair yards. They invested \n     heavily in drydocks and piers when President Reagan wanted a \n     600-ship Navy, and now they fear that the Navy will do more \n     of its own work.\n       J. Douglas Forrest, vice president of Collona's Shipyard \n     Inc., a family business operating here since 1875, grumbles \n     about naval officers going to ``90-to-120-day whiz-bang \n     programs at Harvard, so then they can deal in the financial \n     world.'' Nothing personal, he adds quickly. ``People like Bud \n     Flanagan broke the Red Navy. . . . They're great guys. . . . \n     But the Navy never prepared them for making all the decisions \n     that have been forced upon them by a government that is \n     downsizing.''\n       Adm. Flanagan, too, sometimes longs for the days when ``win \n     the war'' was the Navy's bottom line: ``that was easy. You \n     just got up in the morning and followed the plan.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9851-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATIONS TO CAPT. JOHN ``TAL'' MANVEL, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize Navy Capt. John ``Tal'' Manvel who has been named the Navy's \nprogram manager for the next generation aircraft carrier. Until this \nassignment, Captain Manvel had been serving as the Executive Assistant \nto Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and \nAcquisition John Douglass, where he established an outstanding record \nof service. Navy acquisition has benefited greatly from Captain \nManvel's professional advice to the Assistant Secretary Douglass.\n  Captain Manvel's next assignment carries a very important \nresponsibility. The aircraft carrier is the backbone of our Navy. With \na 50-year expected life cycle--greater than any other weapon platform \nin the Navy--over 80,000 men and women will serve aboard each of these \nnew ships during their life as well as several generations of Naval \naircraft. As the program manager for the next generation aircraft \ncarrier, Captain Manvel's influence on our Navy will be evident for \nmore than a half century.\n  Captain Manvel has broad experience as both an acquisition \nprofessional and as a naval engineer with experience onboard aircraft \ncarriers, including duty as chief engineer onboard the U.S.S. America \n(CV 66). He is superbly suited to lead this project. I know my \ncolleagues join me in congratulating Captain Manvel on his new \nassignment and in wishing him continued success in his career of \nservice to the Navy and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9852-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide for disposal of certain public lands in \nsupport of the\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\nManzanar National Historic Site in the State of California, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would allow the Federal Government to obtain \nexpeditiously the lands designated as the Manzanar National Historic \nSite.\n  As we look back in United States history, we see many triumphs, as \nwell as many failures. We must be humble about our successes and \napologetic for our errors. One of those mistakes was committed during \nWorld War II when 11,000 Japanese-Americans were held at the Manzanar \nInternment Camp. These individuals were some of the over 120,000 \nJapanese-Americans interned at 10 sites throughout the United States.\n  While we revel in the victory of World War II, we also make redress \nfor the suffering that Japanese-Americans endured as a result of the \ninternment. Legislation passed in 1988 directed an official apology by \nthe Federal Government and symbolic payments to Japanese Americans that \nwere interned. This legislation also included efforts to educate \nAmericans about the internment.\n  The National Park Service determined in the 1980's that, of the 10 \nformer internment camps, Manzanar was best suited to be preserved as a \nreminder to Americans of the blatant violation of civil rights that the \ninternment represented. As a result, Congress passed legislation in \n1992 to establish a national historic site at Manzanar.\n  My legislation will allow us to finish the process of creating the \nManzanar national historic site and complete a necessary acknowledgment \nof mistaken practices. The bill will make it possible for the Federal \nGovernment to obtain the Manzanar site through a land exchange with the \nLos Angeles Department of Water and Power [LADWP], which currently owns \nthe property. The LADWP, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, and Inyo County have agreed to a land exchange that can \noccur rapidly once our legislation is passed. I commend these parties, \nas well as the Manzanar National Historic Site Advisory Commission and \nthe Japanese-American community, for their work in bringing us to this \nstage in the process. I also deeply appreciate the commitment of my \ncolleagues in the House, Congressman Bob Matsui and Congressman Jerry \nLewis.\n  In addition to the cultural significance of this legislation, the \nland transfer will allow for the completion of a necessary \nenvironmental restoration project. Through an agreement between the \nLADWP and Inyo County, 60 miles of the Owens River Valley will be \nrevived--wetlands will be restored, riparian areas will be renewed, and \nwildlife will again thrive.\n  The injustice that occurred at Manzanar should not be forgotten. \nManzanar should be preserved as a reminder of a terrible mistake--one \nwhich should never have been committed and one we should never repeat. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill, so that we can quickly make \nthe Manzanar national historic site a reality and instill in our \ncitizens a high level of public awareness about the internment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 2053. A bill to strengthen narcotics reporting requirements and to \nrequire the imposition of certain sanctions on countries that fail to \ntake effective action against the production of and trafficking in \nillicit narcotics and psychotropic drugs and other controlled \nsubstances, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n                   NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nrevise the annual certification process for drugs. It is called the \nInternational Narcotics Control Act of 1996.\n  Ten years ago, Congress passed bipartisan legislation in the Foreign \nAssistance Act that requires the President to report annually on \ninternational illegal drug production. That legislation also requires \nhim to certify annually to the American public what major drug \nproducing and transiting countries are doing to cooperate with \ninternational efforts to stop the production and transit of illegal \ndrugs.\n  Virtually all the illegal drugs that come to the United States reach \nour shores from overseas. These drugs--particularly heroin and \ncocaine--are illegal to grow and produce in their countries of origin. \nIn addition, these same major producers of illegal drugs are also \nsignatories to various international agreements that commit them to \nstop this terrible trade. The certification legislation has the \npractical goal of giving us a realistic gage by which to determine \nwhether others are doing their fair share in stopping illegal drugs.\n  The legislation of 10 years ago also encourages U.S. administrations \nto make stopping illegal drugs a foreign policy priority. It has also \nbeen instrumental in encouraging greater cooperation by other countries \nin taking meaningful steps to deal with illegal drug production and \ntransportation.\n  We and others in the international community expect each nation--\nproducer or consumer--to take serious measures to stop the flow or use \nof illegal drugs. Unfortunately, not all countries have undertaken such \nefforts.\n  When these countries fall short of reasonable standards, the \ncertification legislation requires the President to take note of this. \nIn serious cases, it requires him to decertify a country if that \ncountry's efforts fall short of meaningful, credible cooperation.\n  It also requires the imposition of sanctions on countries that fail \nto take effective action against the production and trafficking of \nillegal drugs. These sanctions, however, have no real teeth. They are \nmainly an embarrassment.\n  Although there are tough sanctions available, in the Narcotics \nControl Trade Act, these are optional and have never been used. This is \ntrue even though some of the decertified countries, like Burma, have \nbeen on the list almost since the list was started. To many decertified \ncountries, then, embarrassment is hardly a serious concern. For others, \nonce they learn how limited the practical effects are, embarrassment \nsoon disappears. It is time, therefore, to update the present \nlegislation and to give it more realistic measures to encourage serious \ncooperation. This is even more important at a time when illegal drug \nproduction is growing overseas and teenage use in this country is on \nthe rise.\n  The legislation I am proposing today puts more force behind our \npolicy. It introduces serious sanctions for noncooperation. These \nsanctions would not take effect until the third year of \ndecertification. They are, therefore, not arbitrary. It allows ample \ntime for a country to improve its record. In addition, the proposed \nsanctions are more flexible than the present ones, which means they are \nmore realistic. They give the President greater ability to use \nmeaningful sanctions against countries that he determines are not \nliving up to reasonable standards. If the administration has seen fit \nto decertify a country for 3 consecutive years, it is fitting that we \ntake steps to support that judgment. This legislation does that.\n  In an effort to strengthen the reporting and certification process, \nthis legislation would require the President to include information on \nthe bilateral trade relationship between the United States and each \ncountry. This information will be necessary to evaluate the potential \neffect of various sanctions. Trade sanctions are perhaps one of the \nmost powerful tools we have to put pressure on foreign governments, and \nalso one of the least used. This legislation, however, gives us an \neffective tool for the future.\n  In addition, this legislation will require an update from the \npresident on the status of cooperation of any country that did not \nreceive full certification. As this information is already gathered \nthroughout the year, and would only apply to a small number of \ncountries--nine from 1996--this should not be a significant additional \nburden for the State Department.\n  This legislation also would codify additional items that should be \ntaken into consideration regarding cooperation.\n  These cover changes in the drug trafficking industry that have \noccurred since certification was enacted in 1986. It also considers \nadditional cooperation benchmarks that were unnecessary 10 years ago: \nsuch as, the better inspection of loaned or leased U.S. equipment; \ncertification of the destruction of confiscated illegal drugs; and,\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\nenforcement of adequate confinement so that narco-traffickers cannot \ncontinue their activities from inside prisons.\n  The present legislation also contains a provision for reporting on \nextraditions. Congress has had considerable difficulty in getting \ninformation from the State Department or the Justice Department on \npending extraditions. Often, the first notice that an extradition has \nbeen agreed to is discovered in the morning paper, weeks after the \nextradition occurred. In an effort to shed more light on extraditions, \nthis legislation would require a notice to Congress of any extradition \nagreement that has been reached. It has very simple requirements. And \nit will increase information on what the United States is giving up in \norder to reach these extradition agreements.\n  This legislation also expands the trade sanctions that are available \nfor the President to choose from to penalize countries that do not \nadequately participate in drug efforts. Presently, there are five \nsanctions which the President may implement. This legislation adds five \nmore sanctions to this list, both more and less severe than those \npresently available.\n  These sanctions include withdrawal of U.S. personnel and resources \nfrom participation in any Customs preclearance; denial of trade \nbenefits under any existing free-trade area agreements; refusal to \nbegin or continue negotiations on the establishment of a free trade \narea; denial or restriction of applications for immigrant or \nnonimmigrant visas; increased inspection standards to at least 35 \npercent for goods coming in; and denial of export of U.S. products or \nimportation from that country.\n  Implementation of these sanctions are at the President's discretion \nfor the first 2 years that a country is decertified. If a country is \nfully decertified or receives a national interest waiver for 3 \nconsecutive years, then the President must choose and implement at \nleast one of the listed sanctions. These sanctions will remain in \neffect until a country receives full certification.\n  The third change to the certification process that this legislation \nwould make are changes in the international narcotics control strategy \nreport.\n  These added reporting requirements identify what action the United \nStates has taken under section 487--official corruption--of the Foreign \nAssistance Act and how the country has been affected by its \nimplementation. Also, the report should indicate how a country has been \naffected economically by the production and trafficking in illegal \ndrugs, and how and where U.S. equipment are being used. And finally, \nany country that is defined as a major money laundering country will be \ntreated as a major drug transit or drug producing country.\n  These proposed changes enhance the ability of the United States to \nencourage full international cooperation in dealing with the illegal \ndrug trade. The provisions are fully in keeping with reasonable \nstandards of international conduct. They are a serious part of making \nthe stopping illegal drugs an important part of our foreign policy. \nThere are fewer more direct and dangerous threats to our citizens today \nthan that posed by illegal drugs. It is time to take the next step in \nensuring that we are taking the responsible measures to control \ninternational drug trafficking.\n  That's why I am introducing this legislation today. I urge my \ncolleagues to review this legislation and support this change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 2054. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to exempt \ncertain small lenders from the audit requirements of the guaranteed \nstudent loan program; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 AMENDMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto provide regulatory relief to small-and medium-sized financial \ninstitutions and protect the availability of student loans.\n  In the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Congress required \nfinancial institutions participating in the Federal Family Education \nLoan [EFEL] Program to audit their student loan portfolios.\n  Unfortunately, this change did not take into account the impact this \naudit requirement would have on lenders with small student loan \nportfolios. These small lending institutions earn only a few thousand \ndollars annually, while the audit costs as much or more.\n  As a result of this prohibitively expensive and unnecessary audit \nrequirement, many lenders are selling off their portfolios and leaving \nthe FFEL Program altogether.\n  The Department of Education has indicated they do not have the \nauthority to waive the audit requirement. Further, the Department has \ninformed those with loan portfolios of less than $10 million that, \nwhile they must perform the audits annually, the audit results shall be \nsubmitted to the Department only upon request. Thus, much of the time \nand money spent on these audits will be wasted.\n  The inspector general indicated in its semiannual report that they \nwere concerned that the costs of legislatively required annual audits \nmay outweigh the benefits. The inspector general has recommended that \nthe Department take steps to establish in legislation a threshold for \nrequiring these audits.\n  My legislation would eliminate the lender audit on institutions with \nportfolios equaling $10 million or less. Without the change in current \nlaw lending institutions will continue to sell off their portfolios, \nleave the FFEL Program, and reduce the opportunities for our Nations' \nstudents.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this much needed reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

However, I will say a few words in support of certain \nprovisions of H.R. 3448, which do, in fact, benefit the public \ninterest.\n  The bill includes provisions that will contribute to increased \nsavings, higher wages, and improved economic growth. These are three of \nour most important economic challenges, and, Mr. President, I wish to \nexpress my belief that provisions of this bill begin to address these \nissues.\n  I am a strong supporter of the expansion of tax-deferred individual \nretirement accounts [IRA's] to permit non-working spouses to establish \nan account and thus defer taxes on a maximum of $2,000 per year. This \nhomemaker IRA provision, which I have cosponsored as a separate bill, \nis an important tool for families and their efforts to plan for \nretirement. In fact, over 30 years at a 6 percent rate of return, the \nhomemaker IRA can add close to $150,000 to retirement savings.\n  The previous law limited a nonworking spouse to a $250 maximum IRA \ncontribution, and, as women often leave the work force to raise their \nfamilies, the homemaker IRA will help to offset the effects of their \nsmaller pensions. The homemaker IRA thus offers significant assistance \nto these spouses in their efforts toward a secure retirement.\n\n[[Page S9858]]\n\n  The pension simplification provisions are an important contribution \nto the long-term financial security of our citizens. These measures are \ndesigned for the benefit of working Americans and will permit small \nbusinesses to establish pension plans for their employees. Further, \nthese measures encourage savings and bring additional safeguards to \npension plans, which will ensure the financial independence of millions \nof Americans in their retirement. The bill also includes a provision to \nclear up longstanding problems that plague church pension plans and \nwill ensure that clergymen will not face unanticipated additional taxes \non their modest pensions.\n  The extension of the tax exclusion for educational assistance is \nanother important aspect of this legislation. This provision will \nextend the exclusion for those who benefit from employer-provided \ntuition assistance. There is no reason to penalize workers for the \ngenerosity of their employers. The Tax Code cannot ignore the national \ninterest in a well-educated and highly skilled work force.\n  This bill also includes numerous commonsense tax provisions. The \nlimited extension of the orphan drug tax credit will renew credits to \ndefray the costs of clinical tests for drugs designed to treat rare \ndiseases. The bill also extends the research and experimentation tax \ncredit to encourage investment in innovative approaches and new \ntechnologies.\n  I believe that economic growth is one of our most important \nconcerns--growth has been anemic since President Clinton pushed through \nhis record tax increases of 1993 without a single Republican vote--and \nthe growth provisions will begin to address this issue. The bill boosts \nthe allowance for small business equipment expensing and extends the \nwork opportunity tax credit that brings low-skill people into the work \nforce. Unfortunately, however, the minimum wage increase will erect \nadditional hurdles for those in search of job opportunities.\n  The minimum wage increase is good politics, but, Mr. President, it is \nbad economics. It will result in job losses for hundreds of thousands \nof people in low-skill jobs. It will become prohibitively expensive to \nhire these workers at increased wages. Further, the increased minimum \nwage will result in inflationary ripples through the economy as wage \ncosts drive up prices. I also believe that the minimum wage increase \nis, in effect, an unfunded mandate that will increase labor costs for \nState and local governments and thus boost tax rates.\n  If we are serious about growth and the expansion of opportunity, Mr. \nPresident, this Congress will focus its attention on small business \nincentives and pension reforms, not minimum wage increases. We will \nbring economic opportunities to millions of Americans through \nelimination of the barriers to entry-level jobs rather than \ncongressional efforts to set wages. After all, the typical worker earns \nthe minimum wage for just a brief period, and the minimum wage is a \nway-station rather than a destination in American careers.\n  I wish that the Congress passed a bill that I could support, and, \nyet, I believe that our obligation is to the Americans of the next \ngeneration rather than the political imperatives of the next election. \nThere are some good provisions in this bill, but there are provisions \nto which I cannot lend my support, and I thus voted against the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9857-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF EAST SHORE REGIONAL ADULT DAY CENTER\n\n   Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the East \nShore Regional Adult Day Center on the occasion of their 15th \nanniversary.\n  For the past 15 years, the Adult Day Center has been serving the \nneeds of the elderly and the disabled with loving care. The center has \nprovided medical monitoring, recreational therapeutic treatment, and \ninnovative programs to the mentally and physically challenged adults of \nthe Connecticut community. Over 600 families from the Greater New Haven \narea have been granted respite from the Adult Day Center and both the \nState and the Nation have recognized the center with awards for service \nand humanitarianism.\n  The East Shore Regional Adult Day Center's dedication and commitment \nto the citizens of Connecticut can be seen not only through its \ncontinued efforts to provide clients and families with comfort and \nsupport, but also in its Intergenerational Program, a program designed \nto involve children from various local schools in the area in \nactivities at the center.\n  I am confident that I speak for all of the citizens of Connecticut in \nexpressing pride and gratitude for the East Shore Regional Adult Day \nCenter as it celebrates its 15th anniversary. The executive director, \nThomas Russell Romano, and his staff have committed themselves to \nproviding much needed care and treatment for the people of \nConnecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9858-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9858-S9860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough August 2, 1996. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget--House \nConcurrent Resolution 67, show that current level spending is above the \nbudget resolution by $15.6 billion in budget authority and by $14.3 \nbillion in outlays. Current level is $45 million below the revenue \nfloor in 1996 and $7.8 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 \nyears, 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes of \ncalculating the maximum deficit amount is $259.9 billion, $14.2 billion \nabove the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.7 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 29, 1996, Congress has cleared and \nthe President has signed the 1997 Agriculture appropriations bill \n(Public Law 104-180, which includes a 1996 supplemental, the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act--Public Law 104-188, the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996--Public Law 104-191, and the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996--Public Law 104-193. These actions have changed the current level \nof budget authority, outlays, and revenues.\n  This submission also includes my first report for fiscal year 1997, \nreflecting congressional action through August 2, 1996.

The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of the 1996 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con.

Res. 178). \n     This report is submitted under Section 308(b) and in aid of \n     Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

Mr. President, Southern Maryland is rich in \nhistory--a history that has helped make our State and our Nation great. \nSouthern Maryland is also the fastest growing part of the State of \nMaryland with thousands of jobs coming into the area as a result of the \nfavorable recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission.\n  On September 8 in Charles County, the region pauses from the hustle \nand bustle in the area to mark a milestone in Southern Maryland's \nhistory with the 100th anniversary celebration of the Charles County \nCourthouse in the Town of LaPlata.\n  The Maryland Independent on September 4 included a supplement to its \nnewspaper on the history of the Charles County Courthouse and its \ninitiation through construction and subsequent additions.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Maryland Independent, Sept. 4, 1996]\n\n                One Hundred Years of Courthouse History\n\n       The 1896 courthouse is the last of four structures the \n     county judicial and administrative bodies have occupied in \n     the county's 338 years. In 1674, a building was erected at \n     Moore's Lodge about one mile from La Plata. This building was \n     abandoned in 1728, and the Charles County Court moved to Port \n     Tobacco where the Maryland State Assembly authorized the \n     building of a jail and a new courthouse.\n       Over time, the 1727-30 building became old and inadequate \n     and a new courthouse was occupied by September 1821. It is \n     this building that was destroyed by fire in 1892 in the midst \n     of a bitter controversy over moving the courthouse to La \n     Plata, and in 1896 a brick Victorian Gothic edifice was built \n     on the present site.\n       The front facade was renovated in 1954 as it is seen today. \n     In the middle 1970s, the rear of the building was extended in \n     a typical 18th-century style, completely enclosing the 1896 \n     structure.\n\n\n                          the first courthouse\n\n       Charles County, named for Lord Baltimore's son and heir \n     apparent, Charles Calvert, was formally established in 1658. \n     The court sat for the first time on May 25, 1658, and it is \n     believed its first meetings were held at what is now Port \n     Tobacco; however, there is no indication in the earliest \n     records that this was the case. The first two volumes of the \n     court records covering the period 1658-66 mention the exact \n     meeting place only twice: ``At A Counties Court Held at \n     Humpherie Atwikses the 4th of June A 1658,'' and ``The Court \n     is Adiourned until the 12th of March A 1660 & appoynted to \n     bee held at Clement Theobals hows.''\n       According to the plaque in the 1954 addition to the present \n     courthouse, the first Charles County Courthouse was built in \n     1658 and it is described as ``One room built of logs, located \n     on the western shore of Port Tobacco Creek.''\n\n\n                      Courthouse at Moore's Lodge\n\n       It was not until 1674 that a permanent location for a \n     courthouse and prison was decided on. In the late fall of \n     1674, the county entered into a contract with John Allen to \n     purchase Moore's Lodge, a one-acre tract of land on which \n     Allen was then building a house. For a consideration of \n     20,000 pounds of tobacco, Allen contracted to have both the \n     prison, a simple building, and the courthouse, which was of \n     the cross style, ready for use by May 1675.\n       The clapboard-sheathed, timber-framed structure built in \n     1674 was located a mile south of La Plata and eventually \n     abandoned in 1728. The courthouse, a one-story, one-room \n     building with two small shed rooms at the rear, a two-story \n     porch tower centered on the front and a brick outside chimney \n     at one end, was initially intended for use as a dwelling.\n       Apparently Allen found himself unable to fulfill his \n     agreement for at the January term, 1677, Thomas Hussey was \n     given 20,000 pounds of tobacco for finishing the courthouse \n     and the two rooms in the shed behind, ``all of this to be \n     done by September court following.''\n       In 1682, after eight years of service, the courthouse was \n     lengthened by 10 feet to provide for a ``seat of \n     Judicature.'' In September 1692, it was noted that the 1682 \n     addition ``wherein ye seat of judicature is, is very leaky.''\n       In 1699, 25 years after its initial construction, the \n     courthouse had to be almost entirely rebuilt. Work included \n     extensive repairs to the supporting frame and replacement of \n     the original chimney, exterior sheathing, floors, stairs, \n     doors and windows. The rear shed rooms were removed and a 20-\n     foot square room ``with an Outside Chimney & Closett'' was \n     erected in their place Despite this extensive renovation, the \n     courthouse required further substantial repairs by 1715.\n       About 10 years after the repairs, the building was again \n     ``impaired, ruined and decayed.'' After deciding they had \n     spent more than enough money and effort to keep the building \n     standing, the commissioners petitioned the Assembly to build \n     a new courthouse and prison on a site adjacent to the port \n     settlement known as Chandler Town, then Charles Town and \n     later as Port Tobacco. In 1731, the courthouse at Moore's \n     Lodge was demolished and sold for salvage.\n\n\n        Courthouse at Chandler Town--Charles Town--Port Tobacco\n\n       In 1727, permission was granted to build a new courthouse . \n     . .\n       ``That the Justices of Charles County-court...are hereby \n     authorized . . . to go to such Place commonly known by the \n     name of Chandler-Town, on the East Side of Port-Tobacco Creek \n     . . .''\n       Once the site had been chosen and the courthouse was under \n     construction, the Assembly passed another act permitting the\n\n[[Page S9861]]\n\n     laying out of land and erecting a town adjacent to the new \n     courthouse and the name was to be changed from Chandler Town \n     to Charles Town.\n       There perhaps has been a settlement at Chandler Town as \n     early as 1686, but by 1727 the buildings were in ruin or gone \n     and titles uncertain. A commission was chosen to select three \n     acres within the town to be surveyed for the new courthouse \n     and to fix a fair price. The survey was completed on Dec. 20, \n     1727, and the price was 2,000 pounds of tobacco. The \n     commission then contracted with Robert Hanson and Joshua \n     Doyne to build a courthouse and prison, stocks and pillory \n     for 122,000 pounds of tobacco. Since the specifications for \n     the building were lost, there is no information available on \n     the structure other than it was probably brick because of the \n     cost.\n       The date it was completed is confirmed by a note in the \n     court proceedings of Aug. 11, 1730:\n       ``The Court adjourns til tomorrow morning Eight o'clock to \n     meet at the new Court house in Charles Town.''\n\n\n            second courthouse at charles town--port tobacco\n\n       The 1727-30 building became old and inadequate, and the \n     effort to replace it began with the demand for a new jail. In \n     1811, an act was passed to permit the Levy Court of Charles \n     County to raise $2,000 for this purpose.\n       Four years later, the commissioners, who had been appointed \n     to build the jail, were authorized to levy an additional \n     $3,000 in the same manner and to devote the entire sum to the \n     building of a new courthouse at Charles Town, and nothing \n     more is mentioned about the jail. The courthouse could not be \n     finished for the amount estimated, and the General Assembly \n     had to be petitioned for a revision upward. in 1818, the \n     Assembly authorized the levying of an additional sum not to \n     exceed $15,000.\n       The new courthouse was occupied by the county in September \n     1821 and is generally associated with Port Tobacco, since it \n     is the only one of which there is any type of pictorial \n     representation. It was often confused as the first courthouse \n     of the county. Also about this time, public sentiment \n     succeeded in having the name Charles Town changed officially \n     to Port Tobacco.\n       This courthouse continued in service until the fire of Aug. \n     3, 1892, when it was completely destroyed.\n       The circumstances surrounding the fire are curious. The \n     town of La Plata, three miles north of Port Tobacco, began \n     around 1873. Soon thereafter, the Popes Creek Railroad \n     established a line of communication (railroad and telegraph \n     station) between the village and the rest of the state. As a \n     result it grew, and Port Tobacco declined. Sentiment grew to \n     remove the county seat to La Plata, and a bill was passed in \n     the General Assembly in 1882 for this purpose. The move was \n     defeated by referendum and no further action was attempted \n     until 1890 when a similar bill was introduced. The bill was \n     passed, but was vetoed by the governor.\n       At the next session, a bill was introduced and approved by \n     the governor which provided for a special referendum to be \n     held May 7, 1892, to decide the issue between the two towns. \n     The proposal was defeated by a vote of 995-1,329. During the \n     night of Aug. 3 the courthouse burned. The cause of the fire \n     was undetermined, but fortunately all the records had been \n     carefully removed before the fire. No one was ever prosecuted \n     and no one ever admitted to knowledge of the deed.\n       Whatever the cause, the fire did settle the issue for Port \n     Tobacco. Feelings ran high that it was impractical to rebuild \n     the courthouse at Port Tobacco since it had long since lost \n     its entrance to the sea because of silting and had been \n     bypassed by the railroad.\n       When the question was brought before the General Assembly \n     in 1894, the rivals for the county seat were La Plata and \n     Chapel Point. Subsequently, a special election was held, and \n     at midnight on June 4, 1895, La Plata became the county seat. \n     Provision was also made for a $20,000 bond issue for a new \n     courthouse and jail.\n\n\n                      first courthouse at la plata\n\n       The same law empowered the building commissioners to sell \n     the old courthouse and jail lots and to apply the proceeds to \n     the cost of the new buildings. This was done, and Port \n     Tobacco rapidly declined. It was taken in hand again 50 years \n     later by the Society for the Restoration of Port Tobacco with \n     little left but the memory of the public buildings.\n       The courthouse in La Plata was built of red brick in a \n     rather imposing, but unattractive Victorian style. The \n     architect of the building, completed in 1896; was Joseph C. \n     Johnson, and the contractor was James Haislip. They worked \n     under the supervision of a building committee including Dr. \n     James J. Smoot, William Wolfe, J. Hubert Roberts, John H. \n     Mitchell, John W. Waring, Adrian Posey and George W. Gray.\n       The general style of architecture was Romanesque and was \n     finished in pressed brick with slate roofing. It was 90 feet \n     long, 52 feet wide and 30 feet high with a 70-foot tower in \n     the front.\n       There were five offices on the first floor. The county \n     commissioners shared a large office with the school \n     superintendent. The clerk of court's office included a vault \n     for court records and a working area. The county treasurer \n     and register of wills occupied offices on each, side of the \n     main entrance. The state's attorney and sheriff shared a \n     small office in the rear of the building. Each office was \n     equipped with a cuspidor to accommodate the tobacco-chewing \n     occupants and visitors.\n       A large rope hung from the belfry to the second floor \n     landing which was used to ring the courthouse bell. The bell \n     was tolled each day at 10 a.m. by the clerk of the court or a \n     bailiff to announce the beginning of a session.\n       The second floor included a court room in the center to \n     accommodate 250 persons, with a law library to the rear and \n     rooms for the grand and petit juries. There were two \n     restrooms in the basement adjacent to the furnace room. There \n     were four fireplaces in the courthouse, and, though not used, \n     existed until the 1954 addition.\n       The first meeting of the county commissioners in their new \n     quarters in the courthouse was on Jan. 5, 1897, and the \n     first-ever term of the circuit court in the new courthouse \n     began in February 1897.\n       The jail built in the courtyard behind the courthouse was \n     two stories high and made of stone, brick and cement. There \n     were rooms on the first floor for the jailor and cells on the \n     second floor for the prisoners. Its cost was $2,500 and \n     considered fireproof. Criminals condemned to death were \n     hanged from a gallows just outside its walls.\n\n\n                Additions to the courthouse at La Plata\n\n       The first addition to the 1896 courthouse was in 1949. It \n     consisted of two restrooms and an office for the clerk of the \n     court on the first floor. The second floor of this addition \n     provided for an addition to the law library and an office and \n     restroom for the country's newly appointed judge, J. Dudley \n     Digges, who at age 37 was the youngest circuit judge in the \n     state. The addition was made to the rear of the courthouse, \n     and the contractor was Cleveland Herbert of Hughesville.\n       The courthouse changed little inwardly and not at all \n     outwardly until 1954. In 1953, the Greek Revival facade of \n     the building was added as the south addition to the original. \n     The architect was Frederick Tilp (who also designed the \n     county seal), and the contractor was Kahn Engineering Co. of \n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dedicated on Oct. 2, 1954, the renovations had been \n     sponsored by county commissioners William Boone, Bernard \n     Perry and Calvin Compton. The building committee was chaired \n     by Judge John Dudley Digges, with DeSales Mudd, Patrick Mudd, \n     Calvin Compton and J. Hampton Elder as members. The cost was \n     around $300,000. The commissioners to whom the building was \n     turned over were John Sullivan, W. Edward Berry and Lemuel W. \n     Wilmer.\n       The 1954 addition created much needed space for all \n     courthouse occupants. The new front provided offices for the \n     county commissioners in the east wing. The register of wills, \n     trial magistrate and sheriff occupied the west wing. The \n     county treasurer and assessor took over the west wing of the \n     old building along with the state's attorney. The clerk of \n     court's office was extended to include the entire east wing \n     of the old building. The east wing of the second floor of the \n     new front was occupied by the superintendent of schools and \n     the entire staff of the board of education.\n       In addition to the planned office space, rooms were added \n     by means of temporary partitions to make space for probation, \n     county roads superintendent and town commission officials. \n     The new library occupied a wing of the courthouse.\n       Two of the old, high desks used in the last Port Tobacco \n     courthouse were saved, like the records, from the fire. One \n     is in the trial magistrate's office and the other is in the \n     office of the supervisor of assessments.\n       The former jail, occupied for a time by the library and \n     county agent's office, housed the Children's Aid Society and \n     possibly the surveyor's office. In later years, the former \n     local jail became home to the county's parks and recreation \n     department, Economic Development Commission and currently \n     houses a division of the sheriff's office.\n       The first fence around the courthouse yard was a wooden \n     board fence which was replaced by a black pipe fence until \n     1954 when a brick serpertine wall was erected duplicating the \n     one Thomas Jefferson designed for the University of Virginia \n     at Charlottesville.\n       In 1974, the center section and north addition was \n     completed in Georgian design and added an additional 35,000 \n     square feet to the building. Baltimore architects Wrenn, \n     Lewis and Jencks designed the addition. Renovation was \n     directed by county commissioners James C. Simpson, Michael J. \n     Sprague and Eleanor Carrico. The building committee was \n     chaired by Judge James C. Mitchell with Judge George Bowling, \n     J. Douglas Lowe, John McWilliams, Thomas F. Mudd, and \n     Gertrude Wright assisting. The construction, begun in 1973, \n     was by the Davis Corp. of La Plata, with the cost at \n     $2,038,238.\n       In 1965, plans for the addition were halted when the voters \n     failed to give the county bonding authority to finance the \n     project.\n       During the renovation, court was conducted in the social \n     hall of Christ Church, and the treasurer's office was in the \n     basement of Sacred Heart Catholic Church.\n       In 1988, county government offices moved from the \n     courthouse to the former Milton Somers Middle School \n     building. Now the courthouse includes the circuit and \n     district courts, and offices of the state's attorney, clerk \n     of the circuit court and register of wills.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

It is a great pleasure to \nrecognize these two events as annual occasions that will continue to \nremind our Nation's future generations of the importance of \nconstitutional government.\n  In 1952, to commemorate the signing of the Constitution, the U.S. \nCongress authorized an annual Presidential proclamation designating \nSeptember 17 as Citizenship Day. Later, on August 2, 1955, the \nDaughters of the American Revolution proposed and Congress approved a \nsecond resolution authorizing the President to designate annually the \nweek of September 17-23 as Constitution Week.\n  I believe that both of these occasions provide the American people \nwith the opportunity to learn about and reflect upon the rights and \npriveleges of citizenship which are protected by the Constitution. This \nyear, as we celebrate Constitution Week and Citizenship Day, I invite \nevery citizen and institution to join in the national \ncommemoration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/04/senate-section/article/S9862-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JUNIOR ACHIEVEMENT OF WESTERN CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Junior \nAchievement of Western Connecticut as it celebrates its 50th \nanniversary this year.\n  For the past 50 years, Junior Achievement has been dedicated to \nserving over 5,000 children in my home State of Connecticut. It gives \nme great pleasure to acknowledge the accomplishments of an organization \nthat recognizes the needs of today's youth.\n  I am especially proud of the Junior Achievement Program's ability to \nmotivate over 2,000 volunteers to participate in this year's event. We \nshare the sentiment that by educating our children now, they will be \nbetter prepared to enter the workplace in the future.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Junior Achievement \nof Western Connecticut on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Junior \nAchievement has served the people of Connecticut through organized \nevents such as their annual Bowl-A-Thon, which will celebrate its 11th \nanniversary on November 2. I thank Chairman Ronald J.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, I am pleased we are able to \nbring to the Senate S. 1645, the Antarctica Science, Tourism, and \nConservation Act of 1996, a bill introduced by Senator Kerry and \ncosponsored by Senator Hollings. The bill has been considered by the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and was reported \nJune 6, 1996. A similar bill, H.R. 3060, introduced by Congressman \nWalker of the House of Representatives has been adopted by the House.\n  During consideration of the bill, Senator Stevens had asked that he \nbe allowed to provide an amendment addressing Arctic research programs \nto the bill prior to floor action. The amendment that has been included \ndoes that.\n  S. 1645, amends the Antarctic Conservation Act to make the existing \nlaw governing U.S. research activities in Antarctica consistent with \nthe requirements of the Protocol on the Environmental Protection to the \nAntarctica Treaty. As under current law, the National Science \nFoundation would remain the lead agency in managing the Antarctic \nscience program, and in issuing regulations and research permits.\n  In addition, the bill would amend the Antarctic Conservation Act to: \nFirst, use established procedures under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act to meet the protocol mandate for comprehensive assessment \nand monitoring of the effects of both governmental and nongovernmental \nactivities on the fragile Antarctic ecosystem; second, prohibit \nintroduction of prohibited products and open burning or disposal of any \nwaste onto ice-free land areas or into fresh water systems in \nAntarctica; and third, require a permit for any incineration, waste \ndisposal, entry in special areas, and takings or harmful interference.\n  Mr. President, this bill also amends the Antarctic Protection Act to \ncontinue indefinitely a ban on Antarctic mineral resource activities. \nAnd finally, the bill amends the act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to \nimplement provisions of the protocol relating to protection of marine \nresources.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that has been added simply requires that \nthe National Science Foundation report to Congress not later than March \n1, 1997, on the use and amounts of funding provided for Federal polar \nresearch programs. This report will allow Congress to reexamine funding \npriorities for Arctic and Antarctic research programs.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I rise to support final passage of \nthe Antarctic Science, Tourism, and Conservation Act of 1996, \nlegislation to implement the protocol on Environmental Protection to \nthe Antarctic Treaty, a longstanding concern of the American scientific \ncommunity and environmental groups. The protocol was signed by the \nUnited States 5 years ago and approved by the Senate in the 102d \nCongress, but implementing legislation remains to be completed. Senator \nKerry and I introduced S. 1645 earlier this year to accomplish that \ntask.\n  In pressing for legislation, our primary objective has been to \nprovide a balanced approach that preserves both the environment and the \nability to conduct scientific research in the Antarctic. Having had the \nopportunity to visit Antarctica, I can attest to its special beauty and \npristine wilderness. While on the continent, I was impressed by a \nnumber of dedicated scientists operating under difficult circumstances \nto help us to understand better our global environment. The Antarctic \nprovides scientists with a truly unique laboratory to conduct \nactivities that cannot be done anywhere else. However, as important as \nthese scientific activities are, we must be honest and accept the fact \nthat the U.S. Antarctic Program has not always been the best steward of \nthe Antarctic environment. Scientists themselves understand the \ncritical importance of preserving the Antarctic as a natural reserve \nfor generations to come. While much has been done in recent years to \nimprove U.S. operations in the Antarctic, S. 1645 will help to ensure \nthat present and future U.S. activities by scientists, explorers, \ntourists, and others comply with the highest environmental standards.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, for his persistent and thoughtful leadership in balancing \nenvironmental protection and the pursuit of greater scientific \nunderstanding. And I urge my colleagues to support final passage of \nthis legislation today.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5186\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for a polar research and policy study)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Senator Stevens has an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Stevens, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5186.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n               TITLE III--POLAR RESEARCH AND POLICY STUDY\n\n     SEC. 301. POLAR RESEARCH AND POLICY STUDY.\n\n       Not later than March 1, 1997, the National Science \n     Foundation shall provide a detailed report to the Congress \n     on--\n       (1) the status of the implementation of the Arctic \n     Environmental Protection Strategy and Federal funds being \n     used for that purpose;\n       (2) all of the Federal programs relating to Arctic and \n     Antarctic research and the total\n\n[[Page S9864]]\n\n     amount of funds expended annually for each such program, \n     including--\n       (A) a comparison of the funding for logistical support in \n     the Arctic and Antarctic;\n       (B) a comparison of the funding for research in the Arctic \n     and Antarctic;\n       (C) a comparison of any other amounts being spent on Arctic \n     and Antarctic programs; and\n       (D) an assessment of the actions taken to implement the \n     recommendations of the Arctic Research Commission with \n     respect to the use of such funds for research and logistical \n     support in the Arctic.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today before the Senate is S. 1645, the \nAntarctica Science, Tourism, and Conservation Act of 1996. This bill \nwas introduced on March 26, 1996, by Senator Kerry and Senator \nHollings. House Science Committee Chairman Walker has sponsored similar \nlegislation, H.R. 3060, which the House passed earlier this year, \nprovides for the U.S. implementation of the Protocol on the \nEnvironmental Protection to the Antarctica Treaty.\n  This legislation will help protect the natural resources of the \nAntarctica by establishing regulations to protect native species, \nprevent marine pollution, manage waste disposal, and extend specially \nprotected areas. It will implement the Environmental Protocol to the \nAntarctica Treaty.\n  I support S. 1645, and ask for unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor. In addition, I am offering an amendment that is equally \nimportant to the protection of the Arctic, an area very important to my \nState and for the entire Nation. My amendment would require the \nNational Science Foundation to report to Congress on the status of its \nimplementation of the Arctic environmental protection strategy. We are \nvery concerned about delays and inadequate funding for this important \nenvironmental initiative.\n  My amendment would also require the National Science Foundation to \nreport to Congress on the use and amounts of funding provided for \nFederal polar research programs, and tell us why they have not followed \nsome of the recommendations of the Arctic Research Commission.\n  I have spoken to Chairman Walker in the House, and explained this \namendment to him. I do not believe there is any opposition to it in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered as read and agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third \ntime, the Senate then immediately proceed to Calendar No. 445, H.R. \n3060; further, that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of S. 1645 be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill then be deemed \nread a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5186) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1645), as amended, was deemed read for a third time.\n  The bill (H.R. 3060), as amended, was deemed read a third time, and \npassed as follows:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 3060) entitled ``An Act to implement the Protocol on \n     Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty'', do pass \n     with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Antarctic Science, Tourism, \n     and Conservation Act of 1996''.\n     TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE ANTARCTIC CONSERVATION ACT OF 1978\n\n     SEC. 101.
