I just say for the information of all Senators, we would \nnot expect any rollcall votes on Wednesday. I am not certain what the \nstatus of the House will be by Wednesday. They may be in recess subject \nto the call of the Chair. So it would be my thought that probably on \nWednesday there would be very little, if any, business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/08/senate-section/article/S111-7", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S111-S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we started our negotiations with the White \nHouse about 40 minutes ago. I will return to the White House. Again, I \nthink everybody is acting in good faith. We have not reached any \nagreement. We may not; we may. I do not think anybody knows at this \npoint. But I think as long as there is the spirit of cooperation and \ncredible negotiation, the Speaker and I, and the majority leader in the \nHouse, Congressman Armey, feel that we should continue negotiating with \nthe President. So we will be doing that for the rest of the afternoon.\n  (Mr. JEFFORDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  \n[[Page S112]]\n\n\n                COMMENDATION FOR LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise just to acknowledge, speaking for \nmyself and I think a great majority of Senators on both sides of the \naisle, and commend our distinguished Republican leader for the \nleadership he has given this body and, indeed, for the leadership he \nhas given the United States during this most unusual period of the \nbudget. As I read the numerous columns, listen to the press throughout \nthe Nation, I think due recognition is given to our distinguished \nleader for his role.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to say that in my own State and in the \nadjoining areas of the greater metropolitan area of Washington, other \nchapters of leadership are being written by citizens who are pouring \nout to help others who might not be as fortunate as a consequence of \nthis storm. The response to our local hospitals by people with 4-wheel \ndrive vehicles has been very dramatic.\n  Also, I know there are many stories about people helping others, in \nall types of extreme circumstances with this unusual storm.\n  Also, Mr. President, I have maintained contact with this institution \nthroughout this period of the storm as a consequence of my role as \nchairman of the Rules Committee, and I wish to commend the security \nstaff here of the Senate and many others, notably the operators. They \ncame in before the storm and have, frankly, stayed here throughout the \nstorm, sleeping intermittently on couches, to provide the necessary \ncommunications between the Senate and its Members and to receive calls \nfrom many citizens.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this after I collect the \nstories later this week. I commend the Senator for his work.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleague from Virginia for his kind remarks. I \nalso would want to compliment the Architect's office and all those \nresponsible for snow removal at the Capitol. All the streets around the \nCapitol have been cleared and most of the areas in and about the \nCapitol have been cleared. They have done an outstanding job. I \ncertainly appreciate their efforts, as I said earlier.\n  Now, maybe being from the Presiding Officer's home State, this is \njust another snowfall, because Vermont takes these things in stride, \nbut for this area of the country it, I guess, is the fourth largest in \nhistory. So it will cause, as the Senator from Virginia said, some \nsuffering in some cases where they are not able to deal with it. I hope \nthat we will be able to get everybody back to work after the one \nGovernment shutdown. This Government shutdown is not one Congress or \nthe President is responsible for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/08/senate-section/article/S111-8", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL JANUARY 10, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
