You alone are the ultimate source of wisdom, \nknowledge, and guidance. Forgive us when we use prayer to try to \nmanipulate Your will. It is not for us to instruct You, make demands, \nor barter for blessings. We confess our total dependence on You not \nonly for every breath we breathe, but every creative or ingenious \nthought we think. You are the Author of our vision and the instigator \nof our creativity.\n  So we begin this day with thanksgiving that You have chosen us to be \nleaders.

Mr. President, there is, in the reconciliation bill \npassed, in both the Senate and the House, an item known as ANWR, the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge lease sale. There have been many views, \nversions, and interpretations of just what this is all about. I think \nit is appropriate that a Representative from Alaska, again, highlight \nthe facts concerning this very important issue relative not only to the \nreconciliation package, where it is anticipated to result in a lease \nsale of about $2.6 billion, but its contribution to the national energy \nsecurity interests of our country.\n  Mr. President, let me attempt to put the issue in an understandable \nperspective relative to the size of the area that we are concerning \nourselves with and the actual footprint anticipated.\n  First of all, there is a bit of a misnomer associated with ANWR, the \nArctic National Wildlife Reserve. I hope the Chair can see this chart. \nPerhaps I should put it up a little higher. This does a pretty good job \nof describing the area in question. ANWR itself covers, basically, this \ntop area, which is the coastal plain, about 1\\1/2\\ million acres; there \nis this wilderness area in green here, about 8 million acres. It covers \nthe Arctic National Refuge--this portion here, which is in an area that \nis in refuge. That is about 9 million acres. It covers this up in the \nArctic coastal plain. This is 1.5 million acres. The point is that the \nRefuge is about the size of the State of South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S 16558]]\n\n  When we talk about allowing an oil lease sale, there are a lot of \nmisconceptions relative to just what the footprint will be. As I have \nindicated, the wilderness area, the green area, is not in jeopardy. \nThat has been put in a wilderness status by Congress permanently, and \nthat was initiated back in 1980.\n  The area of the refuge, which is the color orange--roughly 9 million \nacres--was also set aside in a permanent refuge in 1980. This area in \nyellow, the small area at the top, consists of 1\\1/2\\ million acres. \nThat is the 1002 area that was left out of the permanent designations \nin 1980 by Congress for Congress to address the appropriateness of \nallowing oil and gas leases in the area.\n  So what we have here is, out of the 19 million acres, an area of 1\\1/\n2\\ million acres where the Congress is now making a determination on \nwhether or not a lease sale should take place. This little area up \nhere, as you see in the red or maroon color, is Kaktovik. That is an \nEskimo village. The proposal is to lease 300,000 acres out of the 19 \nmillion acres of ANWR. In reality, it is 300,000 acres out of the \ncoastal plain, a very small area. People have indicated that the \nCanadian border is right in here--that this area has virtually never \nhad a footprint in ANWR. Obviously, that is incorrect. There is an \nEskimo village. There is a radar site at Barter Island. Two abandoned \nradar sites are along the coast. So there has been a footprint, but it \nhas been very negligible.\n  Geologists tell us that this is the most likely place in North \nAmerica where a major oil discovery might take place. We really do not \nknow whether the oil is there, and you do not know where to look for \nit; and when you look for it, you usually do not find it. When you look \nfor it in Alaska and find it, you better find enough because of the \ncost of developing and transporting the oil.\n  It is rather curious to note that on this chart we have the area to \nthe west, Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay, as most Members know, has been \nsupplying this Nation with 25 percent of its total crude oil production \nfor the last 18 years. The significance of Prudhoe Bay is that, while \nit has continued to flow at a rate much higher than predicted, and the \nrecovery is much higher today, that field is in decline.\n  Production has been as high as 2 million barrels a day. Today it is \ndown to 1.5 million barrels a day. As a consequence, we are importing \nmore oil from overseas sources.\n  To give you an idea, Mr. President, and many Members really do not \nreflect on this, but in 1973 we had an oil embargo in this country--the \nArab oil embargo--and the significant thing at that time, we were 36 \npercent dependent on imported oil--36 percent.\n  Today, our Nation is just a little over 50 percent dependent on \nimported oil. For those of you who have perhaps forgotten, in 1990 we \nhad a war in the Persian Gulf. That was a war over oil. It was also an \nenvironmental catastrophe in Kuwait. You recall the burning of the \noilfields.\n  Now, earlier this year, our Department of Commerce put out a report \nthat said the national energy security interests of the United States \nwere as risk as a consequence of our increased dependence on imported \noil. Several years ago there was a great deal of discussion in the \nNation relative to the increased dependence on imported oil, and there \nwere those who suggested we would have to take steps--positive steps--\nto decrease our dependence on imported oil if we ever approach 40 or 45 \npercent dependence on imports. Here we are today at 50 percent.\n  We hear a lot about our trade deficit. We are buying more overseas \nthan other nations are buying from the United States. It is interesting \nto look at the makeup of that. Roughly half is our trade deficit with \nJapan. Mr. President, the other half is the cost of imported oil.\n  Now, about 25 to 30 years ago when they were contemplating whether to \nopen Prudhoe Bay, they made the initial discovery. They had a question \nof how to transport the oil to market. Some may recall the Manhattan, a \nU.S. tanker that had been reinforced to move through the ice through \nthe fabled Northwest Passage, taking the oil from Prudhoe Bay, AK, over \nthe top of the world, but they found the ice conditions were such it \nwas an impractical alternative and proceeded to initiate the Trans-\nAlaska Pipeline--an 800-mile pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez.\n  It proved to be one of the engineering wonders of the world. It \nwithstood bombs. It withstood dynamite. It withstood rifle shots. It \nwithstood earthquakes. There was a bad accident in Valdez with the \nExxon Valdez when it went aground, but certainly it had nothing to do \nwith the integrity of the pipeline.\n  What we have here is a situation where the arguments used against \nthis were very vocal--national preservation, environmental groups said \nthis would be a hot pipeline. The oil comes out of the ground hot. You \nwere putting the pipeline in permafrost, permanently frozen ground; \ntherefore, you will melt the ground from the heat of the pipeline; that \nwill cause the pipeline to break.\n  What about the animals, the caribou, the moose? Are they going to \ncross the pipeline? You will have an 800-mile fence across Alaska. \nClearly, that was not the case. The pipeline did not thaw the ground.\n  As a matter of fact, many of the moose and caribou feed upon the \npipeline because there is more vegetation. As the Acting President pro \ntempore from Montana is very much aware, any heat in an area where you \nhave vegetation causes the grass to grow. We have the animals browsing \nin the spring on top of the buried pipeline because the grass grows \nmore profusely in those areas.\n  The point is, the same arguments used against opening up the ANWR, or \narctic oil reserve, are the same arguments used 25 years ago. They were \npredicting doom. You could not do it safely.\n  What about the people of the area? We have the Inupiat Eskimos in \nPoint Barrow, Wainwright. The Eskimos were concerned because there was \na question about their dependence on subsistence. What would happen to \nthe caribou? Here is a picture, Mr. President, an actual picture of a \nvery small portion of the central Arctic herd. Can you see the caribou? \nThere are lots of them. They are all real. There are males and females. \nYou see the pipeline in the background, and you see an oil rig under \ndrilling. Once this area is drilled, this rig will be removed. Clearly, \nyou see they are compatible.\n  Now, the Eskimos were fearful this development would harm the caribou \nand their dependence on subsistence. They are, today, advocates of \nopening up the Arctic oil reserve because they have seen for \nthemselves, they have satisfied themselves that this activity has \nprovided them with another alternative to subsistence. That is, jobs. \nThey have jobs in huge areas of northern Alaska where jobs did not \nexist any before. They have a choice of jobs or subsistence.\n  Today, Point Barrow--at the top of the world, you can cannot go any \nfurther north--without a doubt, has the finest schools in the United \nStates, without exception. They have indoor recess areas. They have \nbeen able to do this because they have the taxing capability, they have \na revenue stream from the oil activities. They have jobs.\n  There is a concern being expressed by a group of our Native people in \nAlaska called the Gwich'ins, and this chart shows what this issue is \nall about, involving another caribou herd. The caribou herd that moves \nin this general area of the Porcupine River is called the Porcupine \ncaribou, named for the Porcupine River that flows in and out of Canada \nand affects the villages of Arctic Village and Venetie.\n  The particular native people in this area are not the Eskimos of the \nNorth Slope but are very dependent on the Porcupine caribou herd for \ntheir livelihood and subsistence. This is the line that separates \nCanada from the United States up at the top of the world. This caribou \nherd is about 165,000.\n  As far as caribou are concerned, in Alaska we have 34 herds. We have \nabout 990,000 caribou in the 34 herds. Two-thirds of the herds are \nincreasing in numbers and 15 percent are in decline, and the rest are \nrelatively stable. The herds fluctuate.\n  As the Senator from Montana well understands, they can overgraze \ntheir particular area and their numbers decline. There can be a \nconcentration of predators in an area and numbers decline. There can be \nhard winters and the numbers decline.\n  This particular herd is the Porcupine caribou herd--about 152,000 \nanimals. \n\n[[Page S 16559]]\n\n The people that are dependent on this herd are the Gwich'ins, and they \nare in Canada and Alaska. Three quarters of them are in Canada and the \nrest are in the villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon. They are fearful \nthey will lose this subsistence dependence as a consequence of activity \nassociated with the lease-sale development and hopefully discovery.\n  I point out, Mr. President, a footprint is pretty small. The proposed \nlease sale in the Arctic oil reserve--this is a term I use--because it \ndifferentiates from the 19 million acres of ANWR, the actual area under \nconsideration, the 300,000-acre lease sale out of the 1.5 million is \npretty small in comparison to the entire area.\n  But the facts are, these caribou migrate in from Canada, come up into \nthis area, and many of them calve. They calve where they calve; not in \none spot, necessarily. It depends on the winter. Sometimes very few of \nthem calve in America. They calve in Canada. But they come out here by \npreference, if they can, because they come to the coastal areas where \nthe wind blows and there are fewer flies and mosquitoes and it is just \na lot more pleasant.\n  As a consequence, the question is, can we have development compatible \nwith migration?\n  If the Prudhoe Bay case is any evidence, we think we can. But what we \nare anxious to do is work with the Gwich'ins on both the Canadian and \nAlaskan side to form an international caribou management system to \nensure that these animals are not disturbed.\n  The theory behind that would be that development, in the sense of \nexploration, drilling and so forth--which occurs in the wintertime, I \nmight add--would not take place during the calving time, which is 3 to \n4 weeks during the early summertime. So we can address that adequately. \nBut that is one of the major issues that is used to suggest that the \nPorcupine caribou herd is at risk by this development.\n  Interestingly enough, these dots on the Canadian side represent sites \nof actual drilling for oil that took place in the 1970's. It is \ninteresting to note also that there is a highway here, the Dempster \nHighway in Canada. It goes from near Dawson up to Fort McPherson. These \ncaribou in their migration cross that highway. The Canadian Government \ndid not see fit to do an environmental impact statement when they built \nthat highway on the effect it would have on the caribou. The reality is \nit had very little if any effect, just as any activity in the coastal \nplain will have very little if any effect. We can take steps to ensure \nthat it does not have an effect.\n  The argument that the Porcupine caribou herd is in jeopardy because \nof this activity is a bogus argument. It is a bogus argument fostered \nby some of the national preservation, environmental groups, that look \nupon this issue as a cause celebre. It generates membership, it is \nidealistic, it generates dollars. The American people cannot see for \nthemselves just what kind of a footprint there would be. The American \npeople cannot communicate, if you will, with the Eskimo people, as to \nwhat the advantages have been for them with the associated development \nand employment in their area.\n  I might add, for those who are not familiar with this area, because \nof the permafrost in these areas it is almost impossible to have \nunderground utilities. So the tradition in these villages is no running \nwater. The water is hauled in. There are no sewage facilities. You have \nwhat you call honey buckets. The honey bucket man comes around two or \nthree times a week and you dump your honey bucket in the honey bucket \nwagon. A lot of people do not know that in many parts of rural Alaska \nthat is the standard way of life.\n  As a consequence of having a tax base, these villages are getting \nrunning water, they are getting sewage capability, things that we take \nfor granted and have never questioned. But if you do not step in \nanother man's shoes and appreciate how he lives, you will never know \nwhat it is like--not to have running water and sewage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a consequence, the merits of this, \nwhat this means to the people of the area, are significant. The people \nin the area, the Eskimo people, are speaking for themselves and they \nare speaking against the interests as enunciated by the Gwich'ins, who \nare very much opposed to this.\n  I visited one of the Gwich'in villages, Arctic Village. I was up \nthere in August. I was also in Venetie. I went into the meeting hall in \nArctic Village and was cordially hosted. They had a big poster, a \nHollywood poster of the buffalo. The sign under the poster said, \n``Don't let happen to the Porcupine caribou herd what happened to the \nbuffalo.'' Mr. President, they were out to shoot the buffalo and that \nis what they did. This activity has nothing to do with going out and \nshooting the Porcupine caribou. The caribou are very adaptable, unless \nyou run them down with a snow machine or begin shooting them and so \nforth. So, as a consequence, there is absolutely no suggestion that \nthis herd is going to be affected by this activity.\n  The Eskimos have invited the Gwich'ins to come up to Barrow, at their \nexpense, to see for themselves what the alternative advantages are for \njobs, tax base, and so forth. Unfortunately, there are tremendous \npressures by the environmental groups that are funding, through the \nGwich'in Steering Committee, ads in the New York Times and other \nefforts in opposition to this. We have also seen, unfortunately, the \nSecretary of the Interior, who is very much opposed to this \ndevelopment, side with the Gwich'ins.\n  The Gwich'ins are a relatively small population in Alaska, somewhere \nin the area of 400 to 500 people at most. Most of the Gwich'ins live in \nCanada. Of course, Canada is a competitor of the United States, a \ncompetitor to Alaska in the sense that Canada supplies a lot of energy \nto the world, a lot of energy to the United States. So the official \nposition of the Canadian Government is very much opposed to the \ndevelopment of energy in Alaska because they see us as a competitor \nagainst their market which provides energy into the United States--gas, \noil from Alberta, and so forth. As far as the Porcupine caribou herd \nand the dependence on that, about 300 to 400 animals are taken each \nyear by the Alaskan Gwich'in people, about 4,000 by the Canadian \nGwich'in people.\n  So, this is the environmental issue: Whether or not this area can be \nopened safely without harming the Porcupine caribou herd and the \nGwich'in people.\n  To suggest that American technology and ingenuity cannot open up this \narea and do it safely is really selling short America. This pipeline \nwas one of the construction wonders of the world. Prudhoe Bay is the \nbest oilfield in the world. You may not like oilfields, but it is the \nbest. The environmental oversight, permitting requirements are higher \nthan anywhere else in the world. It is suggested by industry that they \ncan have a very small footprint in this coastal plain, if allowed to \ninitiate drilling. People have said, ``Senator, you are from Alaska. \nObviously you have a position on this issue. How do you know that? How \ndo you know that footprint is going to be small?''\n  About 8 years ago we came out and found another field adjacent to \nPrudhoe Bay called Endicott. That came on production as the 10th \nlargest producing field in the United States, at about 110,000 barrels \na day. Today it is the seventh largest at nearly 130,000 a day. They \nput a little island offshore here. And the footprint is 56 acres--56 \nacres.\n\n  Mr. President, this area is 19 million acres, as I said. The coastal \nplain up here is 1.5 million acres. We are talking about a 300,000-acre \nlease sale. Industry tells us now that their footprint, if the oil is \nthere, can be as little as 2,000 acres. Four or five years ago industry \nsaid our footprint might be 12,500 acres. Do you know what 12,500 acres \nis? It is like the Dulles International Airport complex if the rest of \nthe State of Virginia were a wilderness.\n  Remember, this area we are talking about is as big as the State of \nSouth Carolina. So to suggest that this footprint is going to \njeopardize the coastal plain, is going to jeopardize the porcupine \ncaribou herd, is absolutely a fabrication of reality.\n  This is an important issue for the Nation just as Prudhoe Bay was \nbecause Prudhoe Bay has been contributing 25 percent of the total crude \noil produced \n\n[[Page S 16560]]\n\nin the United States for the last 18 years. It is in decline. What do \nwe replace it with? More imported oil? Export more jobs? And $57 \nbillion dollars is the cost of imported oil. We have an opportunity, \nand the opportunity is now because this issue is in the reconciliation \npackage.\n  There has been tremendous pressure on the White House on this issue. \nBut not once has the White House addressed the national security \ninterests. What has happened in the Mideast, Mr. President? What has \nhappened with Libya, our friend Qadhafi? We all know Saddam Hussein, \nIraq, and what is going on in Iran today, and the threat against \nIsrael's national security. The Mideast is going to have a crisis. It \nis just a matter of time. We have heard from a number of statesmen. \nLarry Eagleburger, former Secretary of State, Schlesinger--many, many \nothers saying do not put your eggs in one basket. That Middle East \nsituation is going to explode, and our increased dependence on that \nmarket is going to result in the United States being held hostage \nbecause of our increased dependency on imported oil.\n  Mr. President, this would be the largest single job producer in North \nAmerica. It would not cost the Federal Government 1 cent. There is no \nsubsidy. There is no appropriation. The private sector will bid this in \nat an estimated bidding price to the Federal Government, the State of \nAlaska, at $2.6 billion.\n  In addition, there is approximately $80 million or more that is \nanticipated as a revenue stream to be contributed to refuge maintenance \nin our national parks and refuges. And as a consequence of the \nincreased need for these facilities, I would like to do see more \nfunding put in for our parks and other areas.\n  I appreciate the extension of time. Let me just make a couple of more \npoints because I do not see other Members who wish to speak at this \ntime.\n  There is some suggestion that this is going to have an effect on the \npolar bear. Anyone in Alaska can tell you the polar bear do not den in \nANWR. They do not on land. They den at sea on the Arctic ice. You talk \nabout the polar bear. We do not allow the polar bear to be hunted by \nCaucasians. You cannot take a polar bear in Alaska unless you are a \nNative. You can only take it for subsistence. You cannot take a hunter \nout for hire. In Canada, you can take a $10,000 bill, and you can go \nout and shoot a polar bear; anybody.\n  So we are taking care of our polar bear. We are taking care of our \nrenewable resources.\n  So the environmental community is selling America short on our \ntechnology. And I would look forward to an extended debate on the \nfactual realities associated with this issue because what we have seen \nis rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric, rhetoric; no factual \ninformation of any kind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to yield for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator. In the committee I had an amendment \nwhich said that if we go forward with oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge \nthere ought to be at least an environmental impact statement that is \nfiled. Can the Senator explain why he disagrees with that? I know in \nfact we have not had one since 1987. Much has changed since then, and \nthe Secretary stated that an environmental impact statement will be \nnecessary for each new lease sale. This is certainly a new lease sale. \nEven if you are for drilling in ANWR, I think there is a big argument \nagainst it. It is not rhetoric. Why will the Senator at least not be \nwilling to go forward with environmental impact statement?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As the Senator from Minnesota knows, there are \ndifferent views. The Senator is coming from the point of view of an \nobstructionist. We had an environmental impact statement prepared for \nthe first lease sale. The application of updating that is certainly \nappropriate. But to suggest we have to go back and start the process \nover means you are simply putting it off, and as a consequence we will \nsimply import more oil from overseas.\n  So this is just another obstructionist proposal because we have \nalready had an adequate EIS. If you are going to bury this thing, then \nyou have to take the responsibility for it.\n  The Senator from Alaska simply is fed up with these arguments that \nhave no foundation. They are simply obstructionist views, and as a \nconsequence it is not relevant.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair, and wish the President a good day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, time is \nset aside for Mr. Hatch to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether the Senator from Utah would be \nwilling to give me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I need the full 15 minutes.\n  I will be happy to yield 1 minute. I yield a minute to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Alaska that I would have \nbeen pleased to go on with this debate. I think the national \nenvironmental law requires an environmental impact statement. It is not \nobstructionism to say so. I think for the vast majority of the people \nin the country, First, they do not believe on environmental grounds, or \non energy grounds, that we need to do oil drilling which could threaten \nthe pristine wilderness area, a real treasure for this Nation; and, \nSecond, I think people believe, if you are going to go forward with it, \nyou at least ought to be willing to file an environmental impact \nstatement so we can know what in the world it is going to do. We had \nthe Exxon Valdez oil spill. A lot has happened since 1987. That is not, \nI say to my colleague, obstructionism for me to come to the floor and \nto make that clear.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the environmental impact statement was \ncompleted in 1987, and it took 5 years to complete. There were full \npublic hearings and extensive studies. The record speaks for itself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This would have been an interesting debate for me too. I \nhave to say that with the debate around here this has been studied, and \nit has been unbelievable. We had all the same bizarre and extreme \nclaims with regard to the caribou up there, and now we have more \ncaribou and more wildlife than ever before. Alaska is just such a vast \nplace. Maybe it is time we started thinking about the country, and \nabout how we can stay independent and have national security.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think my colleague should give me a minute to \nrespond.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to finish my other statement. I would like to \nshift. I just had to make that comment because I hear this all the \ntime, and I get kind of tired of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16557-7", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16560-S16562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DRUG SENTENCING\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the past month there has been much \ndiscussion about penalties for crack cocaine and about whether we \nshould lower them. Of course, on Tuesday, President Clinton signed \nlegislation preventing reduced sentences for crack cocaine from taking \neffect. That was the responsible course of action to take, and he \nshould be commended for taking it.\n  So I was disturbed to read, in Saturday's New York Times that:\n\n       * * * in Miami, some Federal prosecutors say they have \n     chosen not to charge some crack suspects because they believe \n     the punishment they will face is unduly harsh. [NY Times, \n     October 28, 1995]\n\n  I am sure most Senators will agree that those who violate the law \nmust be vigorously prosecuted. Congress enacts the laws and penalties, \nand the Justice Department enforces them. I have written to the \nAttorney General asking whether there is any evidence that crack \nprosecutions--or any other type of prosecutions--are being foregone \nbecause Federal prosecutors feel the penalties are too harsh.\n  The Times's unattributed statement is also troubling in light of the \nfact \n\n[[Page S 16561]]\n\nthat Federal drug prosecutions have slipped more than 12 percent since \n1992--from 25,033 in 1992 to 21,905 in 1995.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes to reinforce the reasons why this \nbody voted unanimously to block reductions in crack sentences, \nespecially since the Washington Post has been attacking President \nClinton for signing the legislation [President Clinton and Crack, \nNovember 2, 1995].\n  Some basics: penalties for crack are currently two to six times \nhigher than for a comparable quantity of powder cocaine--not 100 times \nlonger as some have imagined.\n  Crack use is associated with the explosion in the most horrifying \ncases of child abuse in recent years. And while drug addiction has long \nbeen a path to prostitution, crack has created what on the street is \ncalled the ``freak house'' phenomenon, where female crack addicts \ngather to trade sex for their next $5 piece of crack.\n  Crack dealers are notorious for their remorseless killings.\n  Crack is a much more powerful psychoactive agent than powder cocaine.\n  According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the typical dealer is \ncaught selling 109 grams of crack--the equivalent of 3,000 rocks.\n  The Sentencing Commission tells us that crack defendants are more \nlikely to have carried a weapon than other traffickers, and are more \nlikely to have had an extensive criminal record at the time of arrest.\n  No one, to my knowledge, disputes these basic facts. No one claims \nthat those who are convicted are innocent.\n  It is true that some low-level crack dealers are being arrested. Yet, \nvery few Federal crack defendants are low-level, youthful, and \nnonviolent. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, of the 3,430 \ncrack defendants convicted in 1994, there were just 51 youthful, small-\ntime crack offenders with no prior criminal history and no weapons \ninvolvement.\n  In other words, despite all the rhetoric, just 1 crack defendant out \nof 67 qualifies as youthful, nonviolent, and low-level. Incidentally, \nunder the so-called safety valve provision of last year's Crime Act, \ncases similar to the 51 are now eligible for specially lenient \nsentences.\n  We have a situation where, unfortunately, opponents of the sentencing \nregime are dismissing the facts. That is regrettable, especially so \nsince the victims of the crack trade are so overwhelmingly concentrated \namong the minority residents of our inner cities.\n  For a blunt assessment of crack's effects in the inner city, listen \nto T. Willard Fair, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater \nMiami:\n\n       [Crack dealers] sell death to my community. They undermine \n     the peace and harmony of my community by virtue of what they \n     choose to do.\n\n  Crack  is not the only problem we are facing, of course. Today, a \nmajor national  survey is being  released by PRIDE--a parents' group \nheadquartered in Atlanta. PRIDE has found dramatic increases in drug \nuse among kids. Cocaine is up. Hallucinogens are up.\n  Marijuana use is up 111 percent in grades 6-8. It is up 67 percent in \ngrades 9-12. One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana. \nThis confirms reporting from other sources that in 1994, the number of \nhigh-school kids smoking pot hit 2.9 million--nearly 1.3 million more \nthan in 1992.\n  This chart shows the fruits of our newly permissive attitude toward \ndrugs. Among 9-12th graders, marijuana use is up for the 3d straight \nyear, from 16.4 percent of students back in the 1991-92 school year to \n28.2 percent of students.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am also concerned at the Clinton \nadministration's misguided policy of focusing on hard-core drug \naddicts--people who are very difficult to rehabilitate.\n  I am not saying we should not, but our limited funds ought to be \ngoing to these first-time youthful offenders that we have a chance of \nrehabilitating, not for people who we have virtually no chance of \nrehabilitating.\n  One key indicator of the success or failure of such a policy is the \nnumber of emergency room admissions, because many emergency room cases \ninvolve addicts and burned-out users. There is a survey instrument that \nstudies such cases, and many Members of Congress will have heard of \nit--the Drug Abuse Warning Network, better known as DAWN.\n  Members may be surprised to learn that the numbers for DAWN have been \nunaccountably late this year. That is right: The numbers for the first \nhalf of 1994, which should have been released months ago, are now \nsixteen months old.\n  In past years, these numbers have always been released in April. The \n1993 numbers were released on April 11, 1994. The 1992 numbers were \nreleased on April 23, 1993. The 1991 numbers were released on December \n18 of the same year--less than 5 months after the survey data had been \ncollected.\n  It  is  my understanding that the administration had planned to \nfinally release this data on Friday. It is further my understanding \nthat the data will show a large upswing in the use of cocaine and \nmethamphetamine.\n  Unfortunately, the American people will have to wait a few more days \nfor this information. You see, the administration has postponed the \nrelease of this data until next Tuesday, which just so happens to be \nthe day elections are being held in Virginia, New Jersey, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi. In other words, to get past the election, \nor at least that is what it appears to be.\n  Voters in these states will not learn of this evidence of failed \nleadership until after election day. What does this tell the American \npeople about the Clinton Administration's drug policy?\n  And why do we have to wait 16 months for this information when we \nknow from past experience that we can get it in less than 5? It is \nintolerable that the Congress has to wait over a year for vital \ninformation on the present state of our drug problem.\n  The administration is aware of the seriousness of this problem. \nAccording to the Attorney General:\n\n       The latest surveys confirm that despite some recent gains, \n     drug use in the United States is clearly on the upswing once \n     again. The social consequences--of drug use--cannot be \n     reduced of affected by enforcement efforts until our society \n     changes its more tolerant attitude toward drugs. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, the Attorney General called it exactly right. We are \nnot going to get anywhere on this problem until we start to change \nattitudes again. The job of changing attitudes belongs to all of us in \npositions of national leadership. It also belongs to the President.\n  I have previously indicated that I think President Clinton is AWOL--\nabsent without leadership--in the war on drugs. Senator Dole and \nSenator Grassley have already been vocal on this issue, on the need to \nbring national attention to bear on just how bad the situation has \nbecome. We need to revitalize the drug war. In coming months, I will be \ncalling on a number of my colleagues to join in this effort.\n  I am concerned. By working together, I believe we can reclaim this \nlost ground. Just look at this chart, ``Rate of Youthful Marijuana \nUse.'' And we all know that once they start using marijuana, many of \nthem will start trying harder drugs like cocaine, ultimately heroin, \nand so on. In grades 9 through 12, the PRIDE survey shows that we had a \nlow here at 16.4 percent in 1991 and 1992, and from that day on it has \ngone up to where it is 28.2 percent.\n  Keep in mind, almost all these kids, a high percentage of these kids \nare going to try harder drugs because they think it is a fun thing to \ndo after trying marijuana. Marijuana use is up, and it means the other \nharder drug usage will be up as well.\n  I wonder what this particular DAWN survey will say, but we will not \nhave the privilege of knowing it until after the election this year.\n  We have a number of very important elections coming on that Tuesday.\n  No matter which way you look at it, you have to be alarmed by this \nproblem of more and more kids grades 9 to 12 using marijuana every year \nsince 1992.\n  Frankly, there is not much leadership in trying to stop them from \ndoing so. Mr. President, I am concerned about these problems. I hope \nthe administration is concerned. It is about time that they get \nconcerned about these problems. We have to do what is right here. We \nhave to do what is right, and do what is in the best interests of our \nkids and of our grandchildren and the future of our country. We have to \nstart getting very, very tough on drug use in this country.\n\n[[Page S 16562]]\n\n  And for us and this administration to take the limited funds that are \navailable, and use them for hard-core drug addicts, instead of these \nkids that need the help now that have a chance of being rehabilitated, \nI think, is basically immoral. If we have enough money left over, sure, \nI am willing to throw it down the drain by trying to help the hard-core \ndrug addicts as well. And occasionally you will get one that will do a \nlittle bit better in treatment, but it is almost none who come through \nthat process who are hard-core drug addicts. It is very, very uphill.\n  Frankly, with the limited funds we have, we ought to be using them to \nhelp those kids who need it and are likely to quit using drugs after \nthe rehabilitation period starts.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the President and others will do more \nabout this issue. We have all got to do more about this issue, and I am \ngoing to continue to speak out until I see some changes in this \nadministration and some changes in our government as a whole. I  hope  \nthat  we will all cooperate in trying do this because this is not a \nRepublican/Democrat thing and not a pro-administration, anti-\nadministration thing.\n  These are facts that have to be brought out. Hopefully the \nadministration just does not understand, and once they do, will start \ndoing more about it. And hopefully the President will use his bully \npulpit to start fighting these things that are destroying America, \nfinancing crime and murders throughout this society, and killing our \nkids and their futures well into the future.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Mr. President, I rise this morning to call the Senate's \nattention to a report that was released yesterday by the Council of \nEconomic Advisors. The report is entitled, ``Supporting Research and \nDevelopment to Promote Economic Growth: The Federal Government's \nRole.''\n  This report eloquently makes the case for the enormous positive \nimpact which Federal investments and research and development have in \npromoting economic growth and providing greater opportunities for our \nchildren and for future generations. Most of the debate we have had, \nMr. President, about this budget this year has focused on whether \nparticular cuts or reductions or particular tax increases have been \nfair to one group or another in our country. For example, are the \nMedicaid cuts too deep? Are the Medicare cuts too deep? Should we be \nputting an additional financial burden on students in schools? Should \nCongress be scaling back the earned-income tax credit on low- and \nmoderate-income families while cutting taxes for those who are better \noff?\n  But another important part of the debate, the budget debate, needs to \nbe about the impact of what is proposed in this budget on the long-term \neconomic growth of the country. And that is the issue that I would like \nto focus on here this morning.\n  The report that was released yesterday by the Council of Economic \nAdvisors makes several crucial points that the congressional majority \nneeds to understand as it embarks on what I see as a disastrous course \nof slashing Federal civilian research investments by the year 2002. Let \nme just read a couple sentences from the report.\n  It says:\n\n       Increasing the productivity of the American workforce is \n     the key to higher living standards and stronger economic \n     growth in the future. Evidence indicates that investments in \n     research and development have large payoffs in terms of \n     growth. . . . Indeed, investments in--research and \n     development--are estimated to account for half or more of the \n     increase in output per person. Maintaining or increasing this \n     country's research and development effort is essential if \n     we are to increase the rate of productivity growth and \n     improve American living standards.\n\n  The report finds that ``many studies have demonstrated that \ninvestments in research and development yield high returns to investors \nand even higher returns to society.'' The report points out that it is \nthis difference between the returns capturable by a single firm or an \nindividual and the returns to the society as a whole that leads the \nprivate sector to underinvest in research and creates the need for \npublic investment in research and development.\n  Mr. President, this is a need that has been recognized throughout \nthis Nation's history, going back to the first Treasury Secretary of \nthis country, Alexander Hamilton. The report points to the $30,000 that \nwas appropriated in 1842 to build a telegraph between Washington, DC, \nand Baltimore, to demonstrate the feasibility of Samuel Morse's new \ntechnology.\n  It points to the 1862 Morrill Act, and that is an act, of course, \nthat has benefited each of our States--Government funding of \nagricultural research. It points to the enormous benefits that have \nflowed from the expansion of Federal research investments following \nWorld War II pursuant to the vision that Vannevar Bush described in his \nreport ``Science: The Endless Frontier,'' which was submitted to \nPresident Truman in June 1945 at the end of the war.\n  Yet, there are some very disturbing charts in this report. The first \nof these charts I want to refer my colleagues to is a chart of \nnondefense research and development expenditures as a percentage of \ngross domestic product. What you can see here is that the United States \nhas been lagging behind Japan and Germany in its nondefense research \nexpenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for more than \ntwo decades.\n  The yellow line is the United States. Japan is now substantially \nabove both the United States and Germany in its investment in research \nand development, nondefense research and development, as a percentage \nof its gross domestic product.\n  This second chart indicates Federal investments, U.S. investments in \nnondefense research and development and shows very clearly that they \nhave been declining substantially since the 1960's as a percentage of \ngross domestic product. You can see from the period 1961 to 1996, there \nwas a short period there in the early sixties where there was a \nsubstantial increase during the heyday of the space program. It began \nto come down. It has continued its downward trend, as a general matter, \nuntil today, and it is scheduled in this proposed GOP budget for a \nsubstantial additional decline in the next several years. That Federal \nresearch investment, as this chart shows, will plummet during the next \nseveral years.\n  As the report that was issued yesterday points out, this is a greatly \ndifferent plan of action from what governments in other parts of the \nworld are doing, particularly Japan and Germany, who are our main \nrivals economically and technologically. Those countries around the \nworld are seeking to follow the example of the United States, to \nemulate the successful American model of the last century, just at the \nsame time that we, as a nation, seem bent on abandoning that model or \nwrecking it. The Council of Economic Advisers' report points out that \nthe Japanese Government recently announced its plans to double its \nresearch and development spending by the year 2000.\n  We have a chart here that I think is a very important chart for \npeople to focus on. This highlights the effect of our congressional \nbudget plan and the effect of the Japanese plan. What you can see is \nthat by the year 1997, Japan will overtake the United States in \nGovernment support for nondefense research and development, and that is \nnot as a percentage of our gross domestic product, that is in absolute \ndollars. You can see that by 1997, the Japanese will be spending more \nthan we will if we stay on the course that has been \n\n[[Page S 16563]]\n\nlaid out in this budget resolution. Obviously, this gets even worse in \nthe years ahead, as you go to the year 2000.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers' report also points out that there \nis no basis in historical data to believe that cuts in Federal research \nand development spending will be compensated for through additional \nprivate sector investments. I think this is a very important point, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This next chart, which I really do commend to everybody because I \nthink it has a very important message about how history works, it makes \nit very clear that there is a correlation between changes in Federal \nresearch and development expenditures and changes in private sector \nresearch and development expenditures 1 year later. The private sector \nfollows the Federal Government lead in investing in research and \ndevelopment.\n  The report concludes the correlation means that if Federal research \nand development support is cut, the Nation is likely to lose future \nrewards not only from the federally supported research and development \nthat will not be undertaken, but also from the industrial research and \ndevelopment that will not be undertaken as the private sector scales \nback in response to Federal cuts.\n  Stated very simply, when the Federal Government spends more on \nresearch and development, the private sector follows its lead. When the \nFederal Government spends less on research and development, the private \nsector follows its lead and spends less.\n  Mr. President, this is a horrible position for our country to place \nitself in as we approach the beginning of the 21st century. These cuts \nin Federal civilian research and development are not just theoretical \nnumbers out there. These are cuts that are being made in many of the \nappropriations bills that we are passing on the floor of this Senate.\n  The energy and water appropriations bill, which we passed on Tuesday, \ncuts civilian energy research by 17 percent, $637 million. That was 17 \npercent from the President's request and it was cut 13 percent, or $462 \nmillion, from the last year's level of funding. Some research and \ndevelopment activity, such as solar and renewable energy research and \ndevelopment, were cut an even larger percentage, 35 percent, in that \nparticular bill.\n  The same is true in the transportation appropriations bill that we \npassed on Tuesday. The conference report cut the Transportation \nDepartment's R budget request by 30 percent from the President's \nlevel of request and by 8 percent from last year's level.\n  In these two bills alone, civilian research and development is cut by \nalmost $1 billion from the President's request, by over $500,000 from \nthe fiscal year 1995 level.\n  Far deeper cuts are coming in the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill, in the VA-HUD appropriations bill and in the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  This is not what we should be doing to our country as we approach the \n21st century. If we do not change from this path, I believe that we \nwill condemn future generations and our own children to a less \nprosperous and less productive America.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the Council of Economic Advisers' report \nand think about the consequences, the long-term consequences, of eating \nthe seed corn of our future prosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about the consequences of falling \nbehind other industrialized nations in research and development and \nultimately in productivity and standard of living. There is a clear and \na constructive role for the Federal Government in investing in \nresearch. It has been carried out since the beginning of our Republic \nand, on a very large scale, it has been carried out since the Second \nWorld War. It has served our Nation well. It should not be lightly \ndiscarded as a collateral casualty of the effort to balance the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16562-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16563-S16564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IMPORTANCE OF SENATE RATIFICATION OF START II TREATY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments on \nanother matter. This is a subject of profound importance that the \nSenate is not dealing with at the moment, and that is providing our \nadvice and consent to ratification of the START II Treaty.\n  The START II Treaty is one that was negotiated and signed during the \nBush administration.\n  It is so clearly in our national interest to proceed with that treaty \nthat I have heard literally no dissent on that subject. Yet, it remains \nbottled up in the Foreign Relations Committee, apparently, as a hostage \nin a dispute over whether the chairman of the committee will get his \nway in the consolidation of our foreign affairs agencies.\n  In my view, this is profoundly wrong. Getting rid of several thousand \nnuclear weapons in Russia is so clearly in our national interest that \nit is, to me, tragic that the treaty is caught up in the sort of \nbrinkmanship that has come to characterize the new congressional \nmajority's approach to legislating. If it is not the daily public \nthreat to refuse to raise the debt limit, it is the quiet threat we \nhear to torpedo the SALT II Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Let me read into the Record some statements made by various people--\nmost of who happen to be Republican--in favor of the START II Treaty.\n  President George Bush: ``The START II Treaty is clearly in the \ninterest of the United States and represents a watershed in our efforts \nto stabilize the nuclear balance and further reduce strategic defensive \narms.''\n  Senator Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       I a m persuaded that the 3,000 to 3,500 nuclear weapons \n     allowed Russia and the United States in this START treaty \n     does not meet reasonable standards of safety.\n\n       He made that statement on February 3 of this year.\n  The Heritage Foundation, in the briefing book that they prepared for \nnew Members of this Congress: ``The START II Treaty will serve U.S. \ninterests and should be approved for ratification.''\n  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell:\n       ``With a U.S. force structure of about 3,500 nuclear \n     weapons, we have the capability to deter any actor in the \n     other capital no matter what he has at his disposal.''\n  The present Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, said: ``I strongly urge prompt Senate advice and consent \non the ratification of START II.''\n  Senator Richard Lugar of this body said: ``If new unfriendly regimes \ncome to power, we want those regimes to be legally obligated to observe \nSTART limits.''\n  Senator McCain said: ``With the conclusion of the START II, the \nthreat of nuclear war has been greatly reduced, and our relationship \nwith the former Soviet Union established on a more secure basis.''\n  Mr. President, let me also read into the Record a statement made by \nthe President's press secretary on October 20, in response to yet \nanother postponement of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee business \nmeeting on this issue. This is headlined, ``The White House Office of \nthe Press Secretary.''\n  It says:\n\n       The President expressed concern today about the \n     postponement of yesterday's Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee business meeting. He urged the Senate to completes \n     its consideration of both the START II Treaty and the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention and to provide its advice and \n     consent to their ratification as soon as possible.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n\n                    Statement by the Press Secretary\n\n       The President expressed concern today about the \n     postponement of yesterday's Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee business meeting. He urged the Senate to complete \n     its consideration of both the START II Treaty and the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention and to provide its advice and \n     consent to their ratification as soon as possible.\n       ``START II and the CWC are of critical importance to U.S. \n     national security,'' the President declared. ``They will help \n     create a safer world for all Americans, and for our friends \n     and allies. We need these two vital treaties now.''\n       START II will continue the process begun by START I of \n     achieving deep reduction in Russian nuclear weapons. This \n     will further diminish the nuclear threat and advance U.S. \n     nonproliferation interests.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention will ban an entire class of \n     weapons of mass destruction. Its nonproliferation provisions \n\n[[Page S 16564]]\n\n     will make it harder and more costly for proliferators and \n     terrorists alike to acquire chemical weapons.\n       Both START II and the CWC were negotiated and signed under \n     the Bush Administration. Last month, the Senate adopted an \n     amendment expressing the view that the Senate should promptly \n     provide its advice and consent to their ratification. The \n     President urges the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to \n     allow the full Senate to carry out its Constitutional \n     responsibilities and to support the ratification of START II \n     and the CWC this fall.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I said at the outset, it would be \ntragic if the Senate did not give its consent to the ratification of \nthe START II Treaty before we adjourn in December or late November of \nthis year. It will reflect very badly upon the leadership of this \nSenate. It will play into the hands of those in the Duma in Moscow, who \nwant to torpedo the treaty.\n  It is incredible to me that we can find time to debate all manner of \nsecondary foreign policy matters on this Senate floor, such as the \nHelms-Burton Cuba bill and Jerusalem Embassy bill. One newspaper \nheadline referred to this as the ``Majority Leader's World Tour.'' But \nwe do not seem to be able to find time for the START II Treaty. We have \nhad plenty of days around here recently where we were marking time in \nmorning business, and today is one of those days. We will likely have \nmore of them in the weeks to come. We need to use at least one of those \ndays--the sooner the better--to provide our consent to ratification of \na treaty that is so clearly in our national interest. We need to stop \nthe brinkmanship, at least when it comes to matters beyond our shores, \non which there is bipartisan consensus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16563-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATIONS TO PATRICK W.

Mr. President, Sheffield, AL mayor Laughlin Ashe passed \naway recently. In the 3 short years that he served as mayor of his \nhometown, Ashe developed a reputation for integrity and honesty that is \nseldom enjoyed by officeholders. Many of those who worked with and for \nhim say he deserves full credit for the economic revival of this city \nin northwest Alabama.\n  Laughlin Ashe looked after the best interests of his town to the very \nbest of his abilities--abilities that were considerable. He was loyal \nto his friends and he was always true to his word. His was an effective \nstyle that yielded true leadership. He had a multitude of friends who \nwill truly miss him. I am one of them.\n  After he was elected mayor in 1992, Ashe went about building \nconsensus and bringing people together in order to rebuild the downtown \narea of Sheffield. His upbeat and forthright attitude spilled over into \nhis work. He never allowed his serious illness to dampen his desire to \nserve and finish projects he had initiated and hoped to see completed. \nHis dignity and spirit during his illness were reflections of the \nqualities that made him a successful mayor and wonderful human being.\n  He often remarked to close friends that being Sheffield mayor was the \nonly job he ever really wanted. He was the coowner of Ashe-Box \nInsurance for several years, but sold his interest in the business \nafter his election to the full-time mayor's job.\n  Laughlin Ashe was a friend to many, a consummate gentleman, and a \ncompassionate father. He had an undying love for his city. Even before \nbecoming mayor, he was Sheffield's self-appointed No. 1 cheerleader. He \nwill be missed by all of us who had the pleasure of knowing him and \nwatching him in action.\n  Last summer, Mayor Ashe met with editors of the TimesDaily newspaper \nfor an interview to be published after his death. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the account of that interview, from the September 16, \n1995, TimesDaily be printed in the Record.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to his wife, Debbie, and their \nfamily in the wake of this immeasurable loss.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From TimesDaily, Sept. 16, 1995]\n\n              Ashe on Hometown: ``God I Love This Place''\n\n (Laughlin Ashe was a forward-looking person--even when his own future \n   was douded. This summer, Ashe met with TimesDaily editors for an \n  exclusive interview, to be published after his death. For some two \nhours, Ashe spoke candidly about how far his city has come--and issued \n a challenge for others to keep up the progress after his own passing. \n                  Here is an account of that meeting)\n\n                            (By Mike Goems)\n\n       Sheffield.--Laughlin Ashe leaned back on the office sofa \n     with his hands clasped behind his head and continued to talk \n     about the past, present and future of his beloved Sheffield.\n       For more than an hour, he appeared completely content and \n     relaxed. His own bleak future appeared lost in the discussion \n     about business expansions, a sharply healthier city treasury \n     and city revitalization efforts.\n       Without warning, his thoughts suddenly returned to the \n     inevitable. He had known for weeks that he would not be there \n     to see those plans through.\n       ``The good Lord has been kinder to me than I've ever had a \n     right to expect,'' Ashe said. ``He has given me an \n     opportunity to do the one thing that I've always wanted to \n     do. I've never been involved in anything as fulfilling as \n     this job.\n       ``The only regret I have is time. I just don't have the \n     time anymore,'' Ashe continued as tears filled his eyes, his \n     voice cracking. He could not finish his next sentence--``I \n     wish I had more time, just 4\\1/2\\ more years to see. . .''\n       Ashe, a self-proclaimed cheerleader for a city rebounding \n     from the doldrums of the mid-1980s, died Friday from liver \n     cancer. He was 59.\n       Having been told by doctors that his life likely would end \n     before autumn, perhaps his \n\n[[Page S 16565]]\n\n     favorite time of the year, Ashe agreed to be interviewed by \n     the TimesDaily on June 27, provided the story would not be \n     released until after his death.\n       His message on that hot, overcast day came in the form of a \n     challenge to Sheffield residents to keep the city moving \n     forward.\n       ``This city has come so far in such a short period of \n     time,'' Ashe said. ``There's no reason we cannot continue in \n     this direction when I'm gone.\n       ``There's a sense of pride that has returned to Sheffield. \n     People are proud to say they're from Sheffield again. I know \n     it means something special to me to tell people where I live. \n     God, I love this place.''\n       That love and pride for his hometown is perhaps the biggest \n     legacy Laughlin Ashe leaves. Ashe's enthusiasm is credited \n     by many as one of the single biggest factors that made \n     Sheffield a city on the move again.\n       To have heard him talk, you would, think the city is headed \n     toward unprecedented growth.\n       ``We have feelers out in every direction,'' Ashe said. \n     ``We've on the verge of some extremely big things, and slowly \n     but surely we're going to get there.''\n       Ashe downplayed his role in the revitalization of \n     Sheffield, and he made repeated efforts not to point fingers \n     at anyone from past administrations. Instead, he praised the \n     City Council, which he said has done ``an unbelievable job,'' \n     and the residents who ``feel as deeply about the city as I \n     do.''\n       ``When I was running for office, Sheffield had gotten into \n     a rut,'' Ashe said. ``People were not negative but they \n     certainly weren't positive, either. That kept us in that \n     rut.''\n       Change came subtly but quickly, a product of a joint effort \n     between the council and Ashe.\n\n\n                           we're businesslike\n\n       We were fortunate enough to have six brand new people with \n     no political experience to come into office at one time,'' \n     Ashe said. ``Not a single one of us knew that something \n     couldn't be done. We didn't understand there was no way to \n     get from one point to the other. So, we just did it.\n       ``We don't have the pizazz that Florence does with their \n     nearly $20 million budget, we don't have the little hint of \n     scandal that may sometimes trouble Muscle Shoals where you \n     have this faction hollering at another faction, and we don't \n     have that little smoke like what's coming out of Tuscumbia. \n     We've business-like. We discuss the issue and 20 minutes \n     later we're out of there.''\n       Ashe saw his role as one of a cheerleader. While promptly \n     dealing with the negatives, Ashe focused on the positive \n     things in Sheffield. It's an attitude that proved to be \n     contagious.\n       ``During these past three years, we have uncovered a lot of \n     those needs and started serving them.'' he said, ``When you \n     get down to it, you provide the basic services and the rest \n     is attitude.\n       ``And hell, yes, our image has improved. I base that on \n     what people say to me, my family and the council. The \n     attitude has improved. The way to discover that is by driving \n     through our neighborhoods like York Terrace, the Village and \n     Rivermont and you'll see people building onto their houses \n     and taking pride in their property.''\n       During the Ashe administration, the city has attacked the \n     problem of rundown houses and property that has gone \n     unattended by landowners. Several of those eyesores have been \n     torn down, at a cost of about $10,000 per project.\n       That condemnation process is far from complete, according \n     to Ashe. Singling out a property owner on Columbia Avenue, he \n     said the face-lift ultimately will include the removal \n     of some house trailers and other unsightly residences.\n       Ashe also talked at great length about the council's \n     ability to update equipment for the street and cemetery \n     departments, while improving resources for the police and \n     fire departments. Sheffield's 101 city employees have been \n     given another raise, marking the third straight year they \n     have received pay increases.\n       ``We got behind during the level times of the 1980s, and \n     we're still not where we want to be,'' Ashe said, ``We have \n     lost three or four top-notch police officers over the last \n     month or so. We can't afford to keep them. We get them \n     trained in the academy and then on the streets, and then they \n     go to Muscle Shoals or Florence for a $5,000 raise. And I \n     don't blame them.''\n       The purchases and raises are products of an improved \n     economic and retail base. Ashe credited Sheffield businessmen \n     Bob Love and Tony McDougal for initiating some of that growth \n     before the 1992 election. The influx of restaurants in the \n     city has revitalized downtown.\n\n\n                            a reason to come\n\n       ``The thing Sheffield had been missing for so many years \n     was a hook, a reason for people to come to the city,'' the \n     mayor said. ``There had been no real reason to come into \n     Sheffield unless you had a specific purpose. We don't have \n     the upscale anything for shoppers. Restaurants are changing \n     that. They're giving people a reason to come into our city.''\n       Ashe forecast that the crowning jewel of Sheffield's \n     revitalization will be a promised overpass that will allow \n     motorists to travel to Sheffield without fear of being \n     delayed by passing trains at the Montgomery Avenue crossing. \n     Despite the belief among some residents that the overpass \n     will never be built, Ashe never wavered.\n       ``I still go to bed at night and say my prayers and thank \n     God this overpass is coming,'' he said. ``this overpass is \n     going to do more to change Sheffield positively as Woodward \n     Avenue did in Muscle Shoals.\n       ``We're going to have a business route again, and we're \n     going to have traffic flow through here that made this town \n     back in the `50s and earlier years. Once the traffic flow \n     starts, the retail and commercial portions will come. We have \n     some people already beginning to think in those terms.''\n       Sheffield's long-range plan includes the development of an \n     office park near the intersection of Nathan and Hatch \n     boulevards, a project that will tie in with the Old Railroad \n     Bridge walking-trail system. The city also is working on a \n     softball-baseball complex.\n       As Ashe put it, ``We've got so many things in the cooker \n     it's hard to keep up with.'' That's why he asked the council \n     to hire an assistant to the mayor during his final months, so \n     he could make that person aware of those projects. The \n     council responded by hiring Linda Wright, who will now play a \n     role in the transition to a new mayoral administration.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16564-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, yesterday, I was on the floor of the \nSenate discussing the reconciliation bill and discussing some other \nissues, including trade issues, and I was confronted, once again, with \nthe rejoinder that a discussion of the type that I was having was class \nwarfare. I responded to that at the time. But I was thinking about this \nlast night as I was reflecting on the discussion we had.\n  I thought to myself that it is interesting because every time you \ntalk about the economic system in this country and who it rewards and \nwho it does not reward, who it penalizes and who it does not penalize, \nsomebody says you are talking about class warfare. What a bunch of \nclaptrap, to call a discussion about economic strategy in this country \nand who benefits ``class warfare.\n  Here is what I said yesterday. I was relating it to the \nreconciliation bill, a bill that, not me, but a Republican strategist \nsaid largely takes from those who do not have and gives to those who \ndo.\n  I was reading an article written by John Cassidy, which I thought was \ninteresting. He talks about the economic circumstances in our country. \nHe said that if you were to line up all Americans in a row, with the \nrichest American far on the right and the poorest American far over \nhere on the left--line all Americans up in one row--and then go to the \nmiddle American, the one right in the middle, the average, and that \nmiddle American standing in the middle of that line would be a working \nAmerican, who earns, on average, $26,000 a year.\n  His article pointed out something I pointed out to the Senate \npreviously, which I think relates to why people are sour in this \ncountry and why they are upset about where we are headed. He pointed \nout what that person making $26,000 a year, that working family there \nmaking $26,000 a year, has experienced in this country.\n\n[[Page S 16566]]\n\n  In September 1979, this person was earning $498 a week. In September \nof 1995, if you adjust for inflation, this worker had lost $100 a month \nin income. Let me state that again. This is a person working in this \ncountry--a country we always expect to have an economy that provides \nopportunity, growth, and advancement--a person who works for an income \nof $26,000, in 16 years, discovers he is $100 a month behind.\n  Why is that happening? Because our economic system in this country is \none where we are saying to the American workers, ``We want you to \ncompete on a different level.'' Other people in this world are willing \nto work for pennies an hour. People putting shoes together in Malaysia \nwork for 14 cents an hour. They hire kids in India to make rugs. They \nhire cheap labor in Mexico to make products that used to be \nmanufactured in this country by people who had good manufacturing jobs.\n  It is because those jobs increasingly have moved out of our country, \nbecause wages in this country have diminished, because we have decided \nto allow foreign competitors to access our marketplace with a product \nof cheap goods, which are the product of cheap labor, people earning 20 \ncents an hour making shoes in Sri Lanka, or shirts from China. The list \ngoes on and on and on. Is that good for the consumer? Yes, because in \nthe short run they can buy cheaper goods, presumably. In the long run, \nAmerican jobs are gone.\n  That middle-income wage earner, who loses $100 a month in earnings in \n16 years, discovers that this kind of global economics hurts middle-\nincome wage earners.\n  The same article made a different point. The top 1 percent of the \nfamilies in this country in 1977 were earning an average of $323,000 a \nyear. In 1989, the year for the comparison of the top 1 percent, that \nwas up 78 percent; they went from $323,000 a year in income to $576,000 \na year in income.\n  So while the person right in the middle in this country has lost $100 \na month, we have the upper 1 percent, whose incomes per person go up to \nhalf a million per year, with a nearly 70 percent to 80 percent \nincrease in income.\n  My purpose was not to say that the people at the top are not worth \nit. I do not know whether someone making half a million is worth it. I \ndo not know what they are doing. My purpose is not to say they do not \ndeserve it. They may well deserve all of it.\n  My purpose is to say an economy that provides enormous rewards to the \nsmall group of people at the top but penalizes--because of its economic \nstrategy--the middle-income families in the middle by saying to them, \n``Work 16 years and you will be $100 less a month and you will be \nfarther behind,'' something is wrong with that strategy.\n  That was the point I was making. I was equating that point to the \nstrategy in the reconciliation bill that says to 50 percent of the \nAmerican families--and guess which 50 percent--the bottom half will pay \nmore as a result of this bill; and then says to the top 1 percent--\nguess what--it is time to smile. When you get your envelope, it will \nhave good news because you get a significant tax break.\n  That is the point I am making--not class warfare, just the facts, the \nfacts that describe why a lot of people are upset about which economic \nstrategy. Why do we see a $26,000-a-year wage earner work hard for 16 \nyears and lose ground?\n  Let me give examples. Here is a company that makes pants--slacks. On \nJuly 19, they filed a form down at the Department of Labor that says \n280 of their workers now apply for trade adjustment assistance.\n  What does that mean? In plain English, they had 280 people working \nfor them that are not working for them anymore because of foreign \ncompetition. That means this company moved their company to Mexico, \nfired the American workers, the American workers go on trade adjustment \nassistance. Then this company, after the taxpayers pay trade adjustment \nassistance for unemployed Americans who lost their job and takes its \nproduction to Mexico where it can hire cheap labor, makes the same \nproduct, and ships it back into this country.\n  The net result? More profits for this company, more profits for the \npants maker, but 280 people out of work.\n  Are these slothful, indolent people who do not want to make their way \nin life? No, working families that had a job but cannot compete with \npeople who make 70 cents an hour or $1 an hour and should not be \nexpected to compete in those situations because it is not fair \ncompetition.\n  This company, by the way, that has 280 of its people receiving trade \nadjustment assistance says the following: ``They perform most of their \nsewing and finishing offshore to keep the production costs low.'' \nHowever, the finishing of garments sewn by third-party contractors is \nconducted either in one of its U.S. facilities or in the offshore \nfacilities. The offshore plants pack the finished garments and ship \nthem back to the United States for U.S. customers.\n  Here is what it says in the financial report. Certain of the \ncompanies that formed subsidiaries had undistributed retained earnings \nof $21 million on November 4, 1994. No U.S. tax has been provided on \nthe undistributed earnings because management intends to indefinitely \nreinvest such earnings in the foreign operations. In other words, they \nmade $21 million by moving the jobs outside of this country and pay \nzero tax.\n  What about their competitor? If their competitor across the street \nstays in this country and makes the same kind of pants and makes $21 \nmillion, they pay a $7 million tax to the U.S. Government. Said another \nway, this company gets a $7 million tax break for moving its jobs \noffshore.\n  Last week, I offered an amendment here in the U.S. Senate--very \nsimple. No one could misunderstand it. It said at the very least we \nshould stop penalizing the companies who stay in this country and keep \nthe jobs in this country, get rid of the tax incentive that says if you \nclose your plant in America and move it overseas, we give you a tax \nbreak.\n  Stop this perverse, insidious tax break for companies who decide they \nwill close their American plant and move the jobs overseas, giving them \nan advantage over the people who stay here and produce here and work \nhere in this country. My amendment failed on a party-line vote. It \nfailed on a party-line vote. I say if we cannot close this loophole, we \ncannot close any loopholes. We will have a chance to vote on this \nagain.\n  Let me give another example of why that $26,000 family is working \nharder and losing ground. This is from a Fruit of the Loom news story, \nOctober 31, 1995. That is the day before yesterday. Fruit of the Loom, \nthe Nation's largest underwear maker said today it would close six U.S. \nplants and cut back operations at two others, laying off 3,200 workers, \nor 12 percent of its work force.\n  What you are seeing, said their spokesman, is the cumulative impact \nof NAFTA and GATT, our trade agreements.\n  This company will lay off 3,200 people. It does not mean much, just a \nstatistic. A statistic is sterile, antiseptic, and does not mean \nanything to anybody.\n  One of the 3,200 is a person that has a name, went to school, had \nsome hopes deep in their chest for themselves and their family and \ntheir future, who are called in some place and told, ``Guess what? We \nhave some news for you. This job you had at our company does not exist \nanymore. We are moving that job to a foreign country where we can buy \nlabor for 50 cents an hour, 14 cents an hour or $1 an hour. We think \nhaving to pay you $5, $7 or $10 an hour is way too much money. So we \nwill access profit by obtaining foreign labor and doing overseas what \nwe used to do here.''\n  This $26,000 worker or one of these 3,200 people that have lost their \njobs might ask the question these days: If productivity is up--and it \nis--productivity is up in this country; the stock market is up--it is \nat record levels; corporate profits are up--at record levels; if \nAmerica is doing so well, why is this middle-income family losing \nground?\n  I spoke yesterday about part of the reason for that. It is a combined \nstrategy that says in this country that we measure economic health by \nwhat we consume, not what we produce. There is no premium on \nproduction. If we have not learned anything by studying several hundred \nyears of economic lessons, we certainly have not learned the \n\n[[Page S 16567]]\n\nlesson of the British disease--slow economic decline. Once you decide \nthat production does not matter, consumption is what counts.\n  You measure consumption every month forever and talk about how good \nthings are going in this country and have your production facilities \nleave America, you weaken this country forever. You inevitably weaken \nAmerica's ability when you weaken its productive sector.\n  Now, I talked about all of that yesterday in the context of needing a \nnew trade strategy, especially a new trade strategy. We cannot compete \nwith one hand tied behind our back and should not be expected to \ncompete with people making 14 cents an hour or we do not want to \ncompete with those kids who are paid 12 cents an hour working 12 hours \na day. American workers should insist that competition be fair in \ninternational trade.\n  I also said yesterday that not only is our economic strategy and \ntrade strategy desperately in need of reform so that it responds to the \nneeds of those who stand in the middle of the line of the income \nearners in this country. At a time when those on the upper side of the \nline are doing handsomely, the people in the middle are losing ground. \nNot only do we need a new economic strategy to address those issues as \nwe discuss issues like the reconciliation bill in Congress, we also \nneed to understand what all the statistics mean.\n  When we decide that the philosophy we pursue is one that says let the \nbottom 50 percent pay more and let the top 1 percent be handsomely \nrewarded, it is not any wonder that people are sour about the \npriorities here.\n  The earned-income tax credit, as an example in the reconciliation \nbill, the earned-income tax credit changes are the result or are the \nreason why the bottom half will largely pay marginally more tax after \nthis reconciliation bill is passed.\n  What is the earned-income tax credit? It is the earned-income tax \ncredit that goes to people that work at the low end of the income scale \nthat provides incentives for them to work, the very thing we have \ndebated for months.\n  We want to get people off of welfare rolls and onto payrolls. We need \nto provide incentives for people to go to work. People who are working, \noften at the bottom of the scale, need those incentives.\n  This reconciliation bill says, by the way, these incentives are \nunimportant to us, so what we will do is limit the earned-income tax \ncredit. And what is important to us? Building B-2 bombers nobody asked \nfor, building a star wars program nobody wants, buying F-16 and F-15 \nairplanes nobody ordered, buying two amphibious ships for $2 billion \nthat the Defense Department said it did not need, and spending $60 \nmillion, without a hearing, for blimps.\n  I am still asking, and I am asking again today, if there is anybody \nin this Chamber who knows who wrote in the $60 million in the defense \nbill to buy blimps, please raise your hand or come to me in the coming \ndays so I can give proper credit where credit is due. Who in the Senate \nthinks we ought to buy blimps in the American defense bill? Somebody \ndoes. Somebody wrote it in. Nobody now will claim credit.\n  This is all about priorities. It is not about class warfare, not \nabout one group of Americans versus another. It is all about trying to \nmake sure the American wagon train moves ahead without leaving some \nwagons behind. It is about the priorities in this economic strategy, a \nstrategy that actually encourages American corporations to move jobs \nout of this country, move them overseas, through this perverse tax \nincentive that rewards them when they do it. It's the economic strategy \nthat says we do not care about those who stay here. We will not offer a \nminimum level of protection against unfair competition by 12-cent labor \nor 12-year-old laborers, or stuff produced by companies overseas that \npump pollution into the air or water.\n  It is not a strategy that makes sense for this country's future. We \nmust find ways, not only as we discuss this strategy on trade but also \nas we discuss the reconciliation bill, to merge our interests and make \nsure that all Americans move ahead. This country succeeds when we make \nsure that we provide opportunities for everyone. The private sector, \nthe job base, the opportunities that exist must exist for all \nAmericans, not just a select few Americans.\n  Most people I know want an opportunity to succeed and want an \nopportunity to do better. Most people are willing to get training and \nget education and go search for jobs. Regrettably, these days, fewer \nand fewer good jobs are available. The good manufacturing jobs, they \nare going to Mexico, going to Sri Lanka, going to Bangladesh, Malaysia, \nand Indonesia. Those are jobs that used to be in Phoenix, yes, some in \nBismarck, El Paso, Denver, Chicago, and Pittsburgh.\n  This country needs to rethink its economic strategy. It needs to \nrethink the strategy in the reconciliation bill, which is wrong. It \nneeds to rethink its economic strategy in trade policy and have a \nbroader economic game plan to try to encourage, persuade and retain an \naggressive, thriving production industry in our country.\n  Not our country, not any country, will long remain an economic power, \na world-class economic power, if it exports its productive base.\n  I asked a recent Trade Ambassador, who shall remain unnamed--Carla \nHills--is there any area at all, any area of productive capability, \nsteel, autos, any area that you think that we must not do without, that \nwould hurt our country if we lose? No answer. Apparently, there is \nnothing the loss of which would hurt our country.\n  I could not disagree more. No country will remain a strong economic \npower unless it has an auto industry that thrives, a steel industry, a \ntransportation industry. The storm clouds are overhead. The small craft \nwarnings are out already.\n  People who do not study these issues, including international trade \nand the broader economic strategy, and who wins and who loses, and \npeople who do not study the consequences of the reconciliation bill, I \nthink only add to the aggravation that a lot of American families feel \nabout a system that says to them: Work harder and you will achieve \nless. Work 15 years and you will be $100 a month behind, if you happen \nto be in the middle of American wage earners.\n  We have a lot of debate ahead of us on the issue of reconciliation \nbecause the President, justifiably and predictably, will veto this \nbill. This is a terrible piece of legislation. There will be a veto and \nthen this country, in the tradition of 200 years of democracy, must \ncome together and reach a compromise.\n  Republicans and Democrats may disagree on some things, but the fact \nis, it is required for us to compromise. That is the way the system \nworks. One side or another may not like it, may not want to, but we are \nrequired to do that.\n  This stuff about default, train wreck, shutdown, is fundamentally \nirresponsible. No one in this country expects any thinking or any \nthoughtful legislator to believe that any of those strategies would be \nin America's best interests.\n  It is my hope in the coming days and in the coming next several weeks \nthat Republicans and Democrats together will think through the common \nelements of a plan that makes sense for this country. Can anybody, \nanybody ever believe it is in our interest to provide a tax break to \nmove your plant overseas? Anybody? I understand we have had a couple of \nvotes on it. Both times I have lost. But one of these times it must not \nbe political. One of these times people need to look at that and say: \nIs there a reason to provide a tax break to say to somebody, ``Close \nyour plant in America, move it overseas, kill those jobs in America, \nhire some foreign workers for pennies an hour, and we will give you a \nreward; in this case, we will give you $7 million; close it up--a $7 \nmillion benefit''?\n  We will not give that benefit to an American plant operator, some \nowner of an American business or some workers in an American business. \nWe will not give that to them for staying there. We will just give it \nto somebody who decides to move the jobs out of our country.\n  I need to explain that vote to a number of constituents, honestly. We \nare going to vote on it again. That is just a small, baby step in the \nmarch of a better economic strategy that makes sense for this country \nin terms of the growth of the productive center, growth of good jobs \nand opportunity for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S 16568]]\n\n  Mr. President, I make a point order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to be able to join my \nfellow freshmen and sophomores with a message that has been consistent. \nIt is a message asking for the courage of the American people to come \nforward to accomplish the agenda that has been set out in a very clear \nfashion.\n  Politics, like medicine, must be based on trust. Without trust, \npeople lose more than their faith in Government. They lose all hope, \nhope that life in the future will be better than in the past.\n  That is why in the 1994 campaign, Republicans pledged not just to \nchange politics but to restore the bonds of trust between the people \nand their elected representatives, to make us all proud once again of \nthe way free people govern themselves.\n  The ideal of freedom and opportunity, which is the spiritual strength \nof our Nation, is what motivated our Founding Fathers. That ideal is \nwhat motivates us today.\n  As the poet Archie MacLeish once remarked in a debate about national \npurpose, ``There are those who reply that the liberation of humanity, \nthe freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a dream. They are right. It \nis. It is the American dream.''\n  Mr. President, we can no longer sacrifice the future, the future of \nour children, by clinging to the past. We must work to restore the \nAmerican dream for our children and for our grandchildren, but that \nmeans keeping our promises.\n  Keeping our promise to balance the budget means a better life for all \nAmericans. As interest rates fall and productivity rises, all Americans \nwill enjoy a higher standard of living.\n  Keeping our promise to save and strengthen Medicare means that for \nthe first time seniors will have a voice but also a choice, and the \nMedicare system will be preserved for that next generation.\n  Keeping our promise to cut taxes means that all Americans who have \nwatched their tax burden grow from as little as 2 to 5 percent in 1950 \nto almost 50 percent today will finally get to keep more of what they \nearn.\n  Keeping our promise to end welfare as a way of life means that the \ncycle of poverty that has trapped a generation of families in welfare \nwill at last be broken and parents will be able to regain their pride \nand their dignity through work and personal responsibility.\n  It is a time to change. It is a time to call upon the courage of \nlegislators, of representatives, and of the American people to \nrecognize and carry out this change.\n  The decisions we make today will determine our future. Let us go \nforward with hope, confident that the future we leave to our children \nand to their children will be brighter than our past.\n  That is the legacy of our parents and that their parents left to \nthem. It is the legacy all Americans inherited from our Founding \nFathers, the legacy of the American dream. Let us not be the first \ngeneration who fails to pass it on.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield myself such time as I usefully use.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my friend from Tennessee, who has \ncertainly been a leader in the Medicare-Medicaid propositions that have \ncome forward. He has been a leader partially because of his experience \nas a physician, but also having a very strong commitment to move \nforward in the changes that need to be made in order to strengthen and \npreserve these programs so that they will be useful. So I congratulate \nmy friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16568-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16568-S16569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LET US TALK ABOUT THE FACTS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been talking now for some time and \nwill continue to talk, certainly through this month. I hope much of the \nbill will be completed within the next month so it will come to a \nclosure that will be useful to the American people. I am confident that \nit will.\n  In the meantime, I think it is important that we continue to talk \nabout what it is we are seeking to do, that we continue to foster an \nunderstanding in the country of what the issues are that we are talking \nabout. I have expressed before and again say that I am very concerned \nthat in this democracy, in this country, this Government of the people \nand by the people and for the people, that we need to have facts upon \nwhich each of us can make the decisions that we need to make as \ncitizens and as voters and as leaders in our communities there.\n  There are differences of view. That is legitimate. There will \ncontinue to be differences of view. There are extreme differences of \nview among some of the Members in this place. But the decisions that \nare made, regardless of that point of view, have to be made on facts.\n  We all have a right to our own opinion, but we do not have a right to \nour own facts. I am concerned about it. I am concerned about it. When I \ngo home to Wyoming, people talk about what they perceive, what they \nhave heard in the media, what they have heard from opinion analysts and \nthings of that kind that are not necessarily so. So I hope that for the \nmost part we can talk about the facts.\n  I received a letter, as a matter of fact, from a lady in Afton, WY, \nwhom I know, who has been very involved in public issues and has been \nactive as a silver-haired legislator. She expressed her concern about \nsome of the decisions that are being made and are being proposed. But I \nthought the interesting part was that she expressed her particular \nconcern about the future and about her grandchildren and the things \nthat would affect them. She talked about the fact that things are not \ngoing well, in her judgment, in the country. And, indeed, they are not \nwhere we would like them to be.\n  I thought it was interesting that she resisted the idea of change. \nBasically that is what we are talking about here a lot. People will \nstand up, one after another, decry the situation we are in, talk about \nthe future, talk about kids, talk about taxes, and then resist change, \nas if things were going to change by continuing to do what we have been \ndoing. It seems to me that is a fairly simple concept. We have not \nbalanced the budget for 26 years. We have got to do something different \nif we believe, as I do, that we need to balance the budget. I think \nmost people know something of the condition that we are in, some of the \nconditions that we need to change. One of them is to balance the \nbudget.\n  Let me read from this column, the Parade magazine column. This author \nuses this example:\n\n       Let's suppose you have an income of $125,760 that comes not \n     from work but from the contributions of all your friends and \n     relatives who work. You're not satisfied with what $125,760 \n     can buy this year, so you prepare yourself a budget of \n     $146,060 and charge the $20,300 difference to your credit \n     card, on which you're already carrying an unpaid balance of \n     $472,548 . . . on which you pay interest daily. Multiplied by \n     10 million times, that's what our government did in the \n     fiscal year of 1994.\n\n  That is what we have been doing, putting it on the credit card for \nthese young people who will pay for it. We maxed out the credit card. \nWe will be working in the next month to have to raise the debt limit to \n$5 trillion. So balancing the budget, most everybody \n\n[[Page S 16569]]\n\nunderstands, is something that has to be done.\n  Medicare and Medicaid. Clearly if you think Medicare is something you \nwould like to have in the future, if you think health care for the \nelderly is something that we should maintain and strengthen, then you \nhave to change. The trustees say you have to change. It cannot continue \nto go on the way it is.\n  Welfare. Most everyone who has watched welfare at all would agree, \nfirst of all, with the concept that we ought to have programs that help \npeople who need help, but that they should be designed to help people \nhelp themselves to go back into the workplace. That has not worked. \nThere are more people in poverty than there were when Lyndon Johnson \nwas here and started this whole system.\n  Yet each year in the interim, as things did not go well, the solution \nwas to put more money into the same program and expect different \nresults, which of course, does not happen.\n  Reduction of taxes allowing people to spend more of their own money, \nis that not a concept? And we are seeking to do that.\n  So that is what we need to do. Unfortunately, we need to come \ntogether on these principles. We need to come together to move forward \nin an area that will accomplish these things. And guess what? Guess \nwhat? We do not have any leadership from the White House. These are the \nthings that the President has said he is for--balancing the budget, \nsaving Medicare, reforming Medicaid.\n  He wrote a letter when he was Governor in 1989 asking that some of \nthe mandates be removed so that the States would have more flexibility. \nThat is what we are trying to do. The President in his campaign was the \none that was going to change welfare as we know it. These are the \nthings that everyone will stand up and agree we need to change. And all \nwe find is resistance and denial, that, ``No, we can't do that. No. \nThat is too fast. That is too much. That isn't the right way.''\n  So we end up in something of a gridlock, a gridlock that I think we \nwill overcome, a gridlock that we will overcome and still maintain the \nprinciples that are involved in making these things succeed.\n  Let me talk just a minute about what happens if we do not do \nsomething. If we do not do something about balancing the budget, the \ndeficit will top $460 billion by the year 2005. Now, that is a \nprojection of the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit will be $288 \nbillion in the year 2000 and upward of $462 billion in 2005 if we do \nnot do something different than we have been doing.\n  The national debt now stands at about $18,000 for each of us. It is a \ndebt of $18,000 per capita. The servicing on the interest of that \ndebt--not the servicing on the debt, not the reduction of the \nprincipal--the interest cost each American $800 in 1994. Today's \nnewborn child, who is born today, owes $187,000 over his or her \nlifetime just to pay the interest on the national debt. That is what \nhappens if we do not do something. If we do not do something, six \nprograms will absorb 75 percent of the Federal budget: 22 percent for \ndefense, 18 percent for net interest, 15 percent for Medicare, 11 \npercent for Medicaid, 6 percent for retirement programs; that is 75 \npercent of all Federal revenues will go in those areas unless we make \nsome changes.\n\n  With respect to the Medicare tax, we pay now, what, 2.9 percent \npayroll tax? If we do not slow the program from 10.5 percent down to 6 \npercent a year in growth, it will require an 8 percent payroll tax \ninstead of 2.9 percent by the year 2030. So we need to make some \nchanges.\n  On the other side, what happens if we do? As a result of balancing \nthe budget in 2002, a 2-percentage-point reduction in interest rates on \na typical 10-year student loan for a 4-year private college would save \nAmerican students 8,800 bucks. If we could get that 2-percent reduction \nin interest rates as is predicted, on a 30-year mortgage on an $80,000 \nhome, it would save the American home buyer $107 each month, or $38,000 \nover the life of the mortgage.\n  So not only do we have some very destructive kinds of things that \nwill happen if we do not make some changes, there are some very, very \npositive things that will happen.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that President Clinton will reconsider his \nposition and join in a useful dialog in terms of coming to some \nagreement and seek to deliver on some of the promises he made in 1992. \nI invite the President to drop the rhetoric and come to the table in \ngood faith.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16568-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16569-S16570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BENEFITS OF BALANCING THE FEDERAL BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, my freshman colleagues and I have come to \nthe floor again this morning to talk about our plan to balance the \nFederal budget and what that balanced budget will mean to this \ngeneration and, more importantly, or as importantly, to the generations \nto follow. But no statement that we make today could speak more \neloquently than a letter I received from a young Minnesotan in Duluth, \nMN. He writes to me and urges me:\n\n       I urge you, Mr. Grams, to take a stand for eliminating this \n     overwhelming national debt. It is a cancer that is growing \n     and growing, and something needs to be done soon, if not for \n     your generation's sake, for mine.\n\n  For the first time in a quarter of a century, Congress is standing up \nfor the coming generations, and we are standing up to the big spenders \nwho have long dominated the decisionmaking here on Capitol Hill. We \nhave finally said, ``Enough is enough--it is time to return to reality, \nit is time to stop the wasteful spending, and it is time to balance the \nFederal budget,'' and that is what we have done with our revolutionary \nbudget plan that eliminates the deficit by the year 2002 without \nraising taxes and without drastically slashing Government spending.\n  Ask Minnesotans if they think the Federal Government ought to balance \nits budget, and most people would say, ``Well, yes, of course,'' after \nall, Minnesota families have to balance their own budgets every month, \naltering their spending habits to keep pace with the paychecks coming \nin and the bills that are going out.\n  The corner grocer, the video store owner, and every other job \nprovider has to do the same thing. It is the responsible thing to do, \nand at a time when the taxpayers are demanding accountability in \nWashington, a responsible Congress is expected to meet those same \nstandards that we ourselves have to meet.\n  Besides the obvious benefits that come with prudent financial \nmanagement, balancing the Federal budget offers tremendous economic \nbenefits for all Americans--and my friend from Wyoming just went a \nthrough a list--through lower unemployment, lower interest rates, and a \nhigher standard of living.\n  The story of the credit-hungry power shopper really illustrates why.\n  With a new job and a pretty good salary to go along with it, he \napplies for and receives his first credit card. An incredible shopping \nspree follows, and then another and another, and it does not take long \nbefore he reached his credit limit. Now he has three choices: Stop \nspending so recklessly; ask for more credit; or go to your boss and ask \nfor a raise.\n  The spending has become addictive and he is not about to stop. He \nalready spent his last raise, so he phones the credit company and asks \nfor additional credit. They are happy, of course, to oblige and he is \noff on another spending spree.\n  This pattern continues for several years until he has increased his \ncredit line to the point now where his monthly payments are barely \nkeeping up with the interest that he owes on his tremendous debt. He \nhas spent every raise in advance without a second thought, yet refuses \nto stop spending. He knows what he is doing is wrong and, in the back \nof his mind, he understands that he cannot keep doing this forever, \nafter all, sooner or later the credit card company is going to come \nafter him for their money, and that is the very position that our \nFederal Government finds itself in.\n  For four decades, the Government has been that uncontrollable \nshopper, raising taxes, spending hundreds of billions of dollars more \nthan it takes in and, in the process, it has dug this Nation into a $5 \ntrillion debt. Whenever it \n\n[[Page S 16570]]\n\nreached the credit limit, Congress would vote to increase it. Whenever \nit needed to ask for a ``raise,'' it would vote to increase taxes on \nmiddle-class families.\n  But now the Federal Government is in the very same position as that \nover-eager shopper. We have now reached the point where we are only \npaying enough on our national credit card, so to speak, to cover the \ninterest, let alone trying to make any dent at all on the principle. In \nfact, this year for the first time, we will pay as much in interest on \nthe debt as we will on national defense.\n  Let us be clear, the call to raise the debt ceiling is so that this \nGovernment can go out and borrow another $25 billion so it can just \nmake an interest payment.\n  Let me say that over again. The reason the debt ceiling is going to \nhave to be raised is so this Government can go out and borrow $25 \nbillion to meet an interest obligation. That would be like you or me \ngoing to the bank and borrowing money so we could come home and make an \ninterest payment on our credit cards.\n  Usually when we go to the bank to borrow some money, we do it in \norder to purchase something--a home, a car, or other goods--and we do \nget something in return and then we plan to make the payments, both \nprinciple and interest, out of income that we have. But we have a \nGovernment that is now so out of whack that we now are asking the \ntaxpayers to let us borrow more money so we can just pay the interest. \nIn other words, it is like you taking your Visa card and paying off \nyour MasterCard.\n  Because the Government is borrowing so much money, the dollars that \nwould otherwise be available to the job providers, to the home buyers \nare no longer there. They have been sucked up by this Government.\n  Without those investment dollars that could go to the private sector \nthat are now going to the Federal Government, companies have been \nforced to put their long-term investments, such as new facilities and \nnew equipment, on hold, and those are the type of investments that \ncreate the jobs that we need. Those are the investment opportunities \ncurrently being undermined by the Government.\n  That has been especially hard on the economy, because when American \nbusinesses are not making long-term investments or cannot find the \nmoney to do it, the jobs are not being created, productivity is \nslipping and incomes do not grow. Balancing the budget and eliminating \nthe deficit will free up those valuable dollars for investment allowing \nbusinesses to create new and higher paying jobs, by some estimates as \nmany as 6.1 million new jobs by the early part of the 21st century.\n  Under a balanced budget, interest rates will decline by up to 2 \npercent, making loans for education, automobiles or startup businesses \nmore affordable. For home buyers, a 2-percent drop in the interest rate \nwould drop mortgage rates on average $100 a month. Those lower interest \nrates could boost a household's annual income by an additional $1,000 a \nyear by the year 2002 and raise a family's standard of living to go \nalong with it.\n  Mr. President, I was listening to the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom North Dakota while he was speaking on the floor one day earlier \nthis year. I have to thank him for introducing me to a very interesting \nbook. It is a children's book, and it is something I think my \ngrandchildren are going to enjoy, but its central message certainly has \na special meaning for here in Washington as well.\n  The book referred to is called The Berenstain Bears Get the Gimmies. \nThe plot resolves around the little bear cubs in the family during a \ntrip to the mall. It seems they have been infected with the \n``gimmies''--gimmie this, gimmie that, gimmie the other thing. The cubs \nwere asking for everything in sight on this shopping spree, never \ngiving a thought to the price tag, and it was driving the parents \ncrazy.\n  Well, for 40 years, the Federal Government has been infected with the \ngimmies, as well. Every pork project it wanted to dole out, every new \nsocial program it wanted to bankroll, it just said, gimmie. The \nGovernment got what it wanted because the liberal Democrats had the \nvotes to take the money, and it always gave away the bill to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Well, this Congress is finally putting a stop to the gimmies because \nit is the only way we will ever begin to restore fiscal sanity.\n  Along with cutting taxes for working-class Minnesotans, balancing the \nbudget by finally getting spending under control is the most important \nstatement this Congress can make to the American people that we have \nheard their calls for reform.\n  Balancing the budget demands patience, however, because the greatest \nbenefits from eliminating the deficit will not be realized tomorrow--it \nis not a short-term political fix--but rather 5 or 10 years from now, \nfor our children and grandchildren's future.\n  Mr. President, it is our moral responsibility to free the coming \ngenerations--our children and grandchildren--from the burdens of paying \ndecades of extra interest payments because of this generation's \nextravagant spending. We cannot continue to spend our children's money.\n  We have made a lot of promises, but are we really committed to \nfulfilling that tremendous responsibility? Does this Congress have the \nwill, the determination, to prove that there is a better way out there \nto govern than we have seen over the past 40 years?\n  Our balanced budget legislation should be proof enough that this \nCongress is prepared to meet that challenge. This is not the easy way \nout. The easy way out has always been the quick fix, going to the \ntaxpayers and raising taxes, year after year, time after time. That has \nalways been the easy fix, the compassionate fix, to give more money \naway that we do not have. But when we start picking our children's \npockets, I think it is time we face our problems squarely in the eye \nand take the necessary steps to improve it. Again, this is not a short-\nterm fix. We are not going to realize a lot of the benefits or see it \nas early as tomorrow, but if we do not, we are going to see the tragedy \nin our children and grandchildren's faces 5, 10 years from now, when \nthey look back and ask why we did this to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will utilize the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Chair informs the Senator \nthat, under the previous order, the Senator has 5 minutes 6 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have talked largely about balancing the \nbudget. There are a number of other fundamental items involved in what \nwe are doing now, including Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and it \nincludes doing something about tax reform. I think those are equally \nimportant.\n  At this time, I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16569-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16570-S16571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 1994 ELECTION MANDATE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. I was listening, and I think I can \npretty well summarize why my colleagues are distressed about the \ndemagoging going on in the reconciliation legislation.\n  We have to remind the American people that there was a mandate that \nwent with the 1994 elections: Less Government involvement in our lives, \nbalanced budgets, and to do something about the tax increase of 1993. \nIn other words, let us offer tax relief and welfare reform and Medicare \nreform. That is exactly what we have in our reconciliation effort.\n  I really think that those who are trying to stop these major changes \nand the revolution from taking place are underestimating the \nintelligence of the American people. I would like to read a couple \nparagraphs of something that appeared just the other day. This was the \nday of the vote in the U.S. Senate of this reconciliation bill. This is \na quote: ``I have been in this field all my adult life, almost 60 years \nnow, and I have never seen a change of this magnitude.'' This is \nRichard Nathan, provost of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs. \nHe said: ``This is bigger than Lyndon Johnson's Great Society because \nit is going to profoundly affect the American federalism and social \npolicy.'' And then Jim Richley, a political scientist from Georgetown \nUniversity, said, ``Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted \nbefore.''\n  I think that it is necessary to talk about the magnitude of what we \nare doing here. This is something we have \n\n[[Page S 16571]]\n\nbeen talking about all these years. This is something that we talked \nabout during the campaign of 1994. And this is something that the \nPresident is trying to reject. He has come out and said he is going to \nveto this. It is very difficult for us to understand how he can talk \nabout vetoing it when these are things he has talked about, when he ran \nfor President of the United States on this very platform--welfare \nreform, reducing taxes, Medicare reform, balancing the budget. That is \nexactly what we are trying to do. I want to stick with this and not \ngive in.\n  There is an interesting statement that was made just the other day by \nthe President. I will quote that statement. I think this gets to the \ncrux of where we are in this debate. He said: ``Probably, there are \npeople in this room still mad at me for the budget because you think I \nraised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think \nwe raised them too much, too.''\n  This is exactly what we have been saying. If you were not for the \nlargest single tax increase in the world--and that is not conservative \nRepublican Jim Inhofe talking, that is the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee when this was passed--if you were not for that \nlargest tax increase that now even Bill Clinton says he was not for, \nand that was his tax increase, then you ought to support repealing part \nof that tax increase. That is exactly what we are doing with some of \nthe tax cuts that we are suggesting, Mr. President.\n  I think that when you talk about the cuts, it is interesting that we \nhave a President now who is saying over and over again that the \nRepublicans are trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I will read you another quote, and this came from the President in a \nspeech to the AARP on the October 5, 1993, just 2 years ago: ``Today, \nMedicaid and Medicare are going up three times the rate of inflation. \nWe propose to let it go up two times the rate of inflation. That is not \na Medicare or Medicaid cut. So when you hear all this business about \n`cuts,' let me caution you that that is not what is going on.''\n  So there is the President saying--very accurately, I might add--back \nin 1993, that we are talking about slowing down the growth in the areas \nof Medicare and Medicaid because if we do not do it, the system is \ngoing to go into bankruptcy. He is turning around now and saying that \nwhich we want to do on the Republican side is cutting Medicare and \nMedicaid when, in fact, it is not.\n  So it is a very difficult thing when you are dealing with these \nmoving targets, and you have a President that says one thing one day, \nhas his polls around the White House, and he says something different \nthe next day. That is very discouraging.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16570-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A TRIP TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to be leaving today, going over \nto Bosnia. I have never seen something that is as critical as it is \ntoday on what the President is trying to do by sending our troops on \nthe ground in Bosnia. Two and a half years ago, I predicted, when the \nPresident wanted to do airdrops in Bosnia, thereby giving the Americans \na position within that warring faction of three different factions and \ngoing with one side against the other in getting involved in it, I said \nat that time, first, we will have airdrops, then air attacks and, after \nthat, the President is going to want to send troops in on the ground. \nIt was the other day, Michael Rose, the British general, commander of \nthe Bosnian troops--he probably is the greatest authority on Bosnia--\nsaid, ``If America sends troops into Bosnia on the ground, they will \nlose more lives than they lost in the Persian Gulf war.''\n  Mr. President, I think that is exactly what is going to happen. I \nasked Secretary Perry and Secretary Christopher in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, ``Is this mission that we have in Bosnia--that \nmission being twofold, containing a civil war and, two, protecting the \nintegrity of NATO--worth the loss of hundreds of American lives?\"\n  Secretary Perry said, ``Yes.'' Secretary Christopher said, ``Yes.'' \nGeneral Shalikashvili said, ``Yes.''\n  That is why I am going to Bosnia. I want the American people to know \nwhat kind of risk we are sending our troops in there to sustain. It was \nnot until we went month after month, when we tried to get President \nClinton, by resolution, to bring our troops out of Somalia--he did not \ndo that until, finally, 18 of our rangers were murdered in cold blood \nand their corpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. I do \nnot want that to happen in the streets of Gorazde or the streets of \nSarajevo.\n\n  I think we have a job to explain to the American people what the \nrisks are over there and to stop this obsession that President Clinton \nhas in sending our troops into Bosnia on the ground.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following brief \nstatements, the bill be advanced to third reading and final passage \noccur, all without further objection or amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the manager on the other side \nand then I will make a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of the \nbill, H.R. 2492, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 1996. The provisions in this bill are exactly the same as those \ncontained in the conference report on H.R. 1854, which overwhelmingly \npassed the Senate on September 22, 1995, by a vote of 94 to 4 but was \nsubsequently vetoed by the President on October 3. At that time, as \nMembers will recall, the President indicated \n\n[[Page S 16572]]\n\nthat because the Congress had completed action on only two \nappropriation bills for fiscal year 1996--legislative branch and \nmilitary construction--he felt it would be inappropriate to provide \nfull-year funding for Congress and its offices while most other \nactivities of the Federal Government were being funded through a short-\nterm continuing resolution. I am hopeful that the leadership will not \nsend this bill to the President until Congress receives assurances that \nhe will sign it.\n  For the benefit of Senators, let me briefly point out that this bill \nrequired many difficult decisions in order for the legislative branch \nto do its share in achieving substantial deficit reduction in fiscal \nyear 1996. The bill appropriates $2,184,850,000 for fiscal year 1996 \nfor legislative operations, which is a reduction of over $200 million \nfrom the 1995 level, or approximately 10 percent. The majority leader \nhas cited the important features of the bill, which I will not repeat \nat this time, but, Mr. President, I do want to again thank Senator \nMack, the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, for his \nunfailing courtesy and to express my appreciation to him for the open \nand bipartisan spirit in which he has handled this important \nlegislation throughout the year.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2492.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I am pinch-hitting for \nSenator Mack of Florida, who is, right now, involved in a very \nimportant hearing on the Banking Committee. Let me indicate I will \nplace in the Record at this point a summary of the funding \nrecommendations.\n  As pointed out by my colleague from Washington, this is a reduction \nof about 8.6 percent. We believe we are setting an example for other \nbranches. There are a number of areas where we made rather significant \ncuts, also terminating the OTA, for example, something that was not \neasy for many of my colleagues. But it is an indication we are \nconcerned, we are sincere about a balanced budget, and we are prepared \nto do our share or more.\n  The bill includes a provision relative to the disposition of the \nrecords and property of the Office of Technology Assessment subsequent \nto its closure. Specifically, the agreement provides that OTA's \nproperty and records ``shall be under the administrative control of the \nArchitect of the Capitol.''\n  The Office of the Senate Historian has raised a concern that this \nprovision not interfere with the transfer of archival material of the \nOffice of Technology Assessment to the legislative archives of the \nNational Archives. It is my understanding that the conferees had no \nsuch intent, and that the Architect of the Capitol will only assume \ntemporary, administrative control of the material before transferring \nappropriate records to the National Archives.\n  It is also my understanding that the Clerk of the House, after \ndiscussions with the Secretary of the Senate, has agreed that OTA's \narchival material shall be treated as records of the Senate and \nadministered according to Senate Resolution 474 of the 96th Congress. \nThis will give the Secretary of the Senate administrative jurisdiction \nover the archival records.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a statement of a summary of \nfunding recommendations be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Summary of Funding Recommendations\n\n       The total recommended is $2,184,856,000, a reduction of \n     $205,698,700, or 8.6%, from FY95.\n       GAO is reduced 15% from FY95 levels; Committee is committed \n     to another 10% in FY97 for a 25% reduction from FY95 levels \n     over two years.\n       OTA is terminated; termination costs totalling $6,115,000 \n     are provided. ($3,615,000 in FY96 funds, $2,500,000 \n     reappropriated from FY95.)\n       Library of Congress granted $1,500,000 over FY95 for \n     digital library initiative; all other Library activities, \n     including CRS, at FY95 level.\n       CBO granted $1.1 million and 13 FTE's for unfunded mandates \n     analysis.\n       Architect of Capitol activities in Title I reduced \n     $16,163,000 overall (10%) from FY95 levels.\n       Joint Committees reduced commensurate with Senate committee \n     cut.\n       New ``Office of Compliance'' created by Congressional \n     Accountability Act funded as a joint item at $2,500,000. A \n     permanent indefinite appropriation is recommended for \n     settlements and awards arising from the new Accountability \n     Act.\n       Total recommended Senate funding is $426,919,000, a \n     reduction of $33,661,500. In addition, $63,544,723.12 from \n     prior year funds is rescinded.\n       Committee funding is reduced 15%; Secretary of the Senate, \n     Sergeant at Arms, and OFEP reduced 12.5%; Chaplain, Legal \n     Counsel, and Legislative Counsel frozen at FY95 levels.\n       Official mail frozen at $11,000,000. (N.B. House merged \n     official mail with office accounts.)\n       Statutory allowances for Senators' personal offices are not \n     reduced.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I also confirm the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, \nhas, as indicated by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, agreed \nto have hearings and a markup of an amendment that Senator Simon would \nhave offered to this bill.\n  So there are no amendments, no objections to it proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 2492) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, last week we passed out of this body the \nreconciliation bill which will lead to a balanced budget. This is \nobviously a significant step on the road to guaranteeing our children a \nnation which can be prosperous and which is solvent. I believe most \nAmericans understand the importance of the balanced budget. They \ncertainly expressed it in my district, and I am sure in other States, \nyear after year as they have gone to the polls. They understand it \nbecause in their homelife they experience the need to maintain fiscal \nsolvency. They know that if they continue to spend every year more than \nthey take in, it will lead to some sort of economic chaos in their own \nlives, and intuitively and logically they understand, therefore, that \nfor the Federal Government to do that, not only year after year but \nwhat has amounted to generation after generation, leads inevitably to \neconomic chaos.\n  So the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House has produced \na budget which will give us a balanced budget by the year 2002. For the \nfirst time in years we will actually be living within our means. This \nis, I believe, a critical step on the path to assuring, as I said \nearlier, a solvent nation for our children, which is, I believe, our \nNo. 1 responsibility as keepers of the flame of America as Members of \nthis Senate.\n  The question, however, is whether or not the President will join us \nin this effort in a serious way. The President has repeatedly said that \nhe wants to balance the budget. But so far his actions have certainly \nnot matched his words. Although we have produced a serious proposal for \nbalancing the budget, which the Congressional Budget Office has scored \nas being in balance, and are now trying to iron out the differences, we \ndo not find that the President has been willing to join in \nsubstantively discussing this matter in a serious way.\n  Conventional wisdom holds, in fact, that the President will veto this \nbill and then he and the Congress will negotiate and reach some type of \nagreement, hopefully. But I am not so sure. \n\n[[Page S 16573]]\n\n I say this because before we can negotiate, the President, despite all \nhis nice political statements, still must prove he is truly serious \nwith accomplishing a balanced budget. So far, he has not taken this \naction. He certainly has not proved it either to the Congress or to the \nAmerican people.\n  In my view, there are five things which the President must do if he \nis to prove that he is serious about the issue of balancing the budget. \nThese go beyond the rhetoric of campaign promises. I would like to go \nover these five items.\n  First, we must start using the same numbers to talk about the issue \nof balancing the budget. The administration began its term with a very \ngrandiose statement back in February 1993 fresh off the election that \nthey would use the Congressional Budget Office for the purposes of \ndetermining the fair scorekeeping of the budget process. He made this \nstatement a number of times. But he made it most eloquently when he \nspoke in his initial speech to the Congress.\n  In taking this position when he was first elected President, he took \nthe right position, the correct position. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is the fair arbiter of the scoring of the budget process. \nHowever, since the Congressional Budget Office scoring process has no \nlonger become convenient to the administration, the President has \nabandoned his original commitment. This is a mistake. The numbers which \nhe sent up to us in June--which were basically a sheaf of paper and \nwere not really a budget--represented, according to the President and \nto his people, a balanced budget which we would reach in 10 years. \nUnfortunately, those numbers used as their baseline and for their \nassumptions were numbers produced by his own inhouse accountants, the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  When that budget was scored by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nfair arbiter of budget scoring in this body and which the President had \ninitially said would be the fair arbiter, it turned out that their \nbudget did not reach balance, that, in fact, it represented $200 \nbillion deficits each year for as far as the eye could see and that \nthere was no closure between spending and revenues.\n  So, the first thing the President's people have to do is be willing \nto agree to use numbers which are credible and which are acceptable. \nAnd I would suggest that we go back to the beginning of this Presidency \nand follow the counsel that he gave us at that time and use the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers.\n  In June, the President submitted a revised budget, and, as I \nmentioned, it alleged that it would reach balance in 10 years. \nUnfortunately, he only released 25 pages, and he gave us no specifics \nas to how he would accomplish this, even in terms of the numbers, which \nas I mentioned earlier, were inaccurate.\n  It is essential that we get details, that he--as we have as Members \nof the Senate and as Members of the House--produce a budget which has \nthe details behind the numbers, which has substance, which has meat on \nthe bones. We cannot possibly reach a budget agreement if we are simply \ngoing to work off a sheaf of paper which has no specifics.\n  We have put down on the table in extensive language what we as \nRepublicans think should be done to correct some of the excesses of the \nFederal Government, to improve the manner in which it delivers \nservices, to give people an opportunity to have a Medicare trust fund \nwhich will remain solvent. We need now to hear from the President as to \nhis specifics in detail as to what he would do in the area of Medicare \nreform, in the area of Medicaid reform, in the area of welfare reform. \nYet, we have not heard that. That is why one questions his sincerity \nwhen he talks about producing a budget that will be in balance.\n  Third, we need to reach an agreement as to when we should reach a \nbalanced budget.\n  We, as Republicans, have put forward a budget which reaches balance \nin 7 years. It was not easy. It meant that we had to make some very \ndifficult decisions. We had to agree--amongst ourselves, unfortunately, \nbecause the White House was not willing to participate--to agree to \ntake $1 trillion of spending out of the Federal stream of spending. \nThat did not mean we cut the size of the Federal Government. In fact, \nit will continue to grow by 3.3 percent annually. Medicare will \ncontinue to grow by 6.4 percent annually, and Medicaid will continue to \ngrow by approximately 4.5 percent annually. But we did have to slow the \nrate of growth of those programs, and we did, in a number of programs, \nactually have to cut spending. For example, defense spending will go \ndown in real terms over the next 7 years by $19 billion.\n  But we have to have a definable period when we are going to reach a \nbalanced budget. The people of this country have a right to know that \nwe are willing to step up to the issue and define the terms of the \nissue in benchmarks that are scorable and which we can be held \naccountable for. We have said we will reach a balanced budget in 7 \nyears. We have produced a budget which accomplishes that. It is \nabsolutely critical that the President give us a timeframe in which he \nis willing to put forward a budget which reaches balance with real \nnumbers and with details. Recently, he said 7 years was something he \ncould live with. If that is his position today, I believe he should \nstate it. Unfortunately, sometimes his positions change. But hopefully \nhe can stick with the 7-year commitment. If he can, that means we can \nreach agreement on that one critical point.\n  Fourth, if we are going to reach an understanding, we have to have \nthe ability to sit down with the President and talk to him in terms \nthat are substantive and not in simply political election-year \nrhetoric. If you look at what the President sent up here in June and \nyou take those numbers and score them by CBO's accounting rather than \nby OMB's accounting, you find that we really were not that far apart. \nFor example, in the area of Medicare, he wanted Medicare to grow at a \nrate of 7 percent. We suggested it grow at a rate of 6.4 percent. Both \nof those numbers were significantly less than the present 10-percent \nrate of growth that Medicare is experiencing. That 10-percent rate of \ngrowth we know is not sustainable. The Medicare trustees have told us \nthat if we continue to allow Medicare to grow at that rate, it will be \ninsolvent, there will be no trust fund for the seniors from which they \ncan get a health care benefit.\n  So we have suggested proposals which will give seniors more choices, \nmore options, which we think will strengthen the Medicare system and \nwhich will slow the rate of growth to 6.4 percent.\n  The President sent us up a number which when it was recalculated by \nCBO--granted, it came up under OMB's scoring mechanisms, but when it \nwas calculated by CBO said we only want Medicare to grow at 7 percent. \nI believe that difference is not great. And yet if you listen to this \nadministration, they talk in terms of hyperbole which would make you \nthink that the Republican proposal on Medicare was going to slash, was \ngoing to devastate, was going to savage the rights to health care which \nwe all recognize are absolutely essential for our seniors.\n  In fact, the Vice President of the United States had the temerity to \ncome to New Hampshire just a few days ago and speak to a very self-\nserving audience, the AFL-CIO convention, and state time and again--in \nfact, I think we found the word ``extremist'' in every sentence during \nthe period of a couple paragraphs--that our Medicare Program was \nslashing.\n  If our Medicare Program is slashing, and we are talking about a 6.4-\npercent rate of increase and the President is talking about a 7-percent \nrate of increase, which is 3 percent down from 10 percent and we are \n3.5 percent down from 10 percent, what is the President's program? He \nwould have to apply the same standards to his own. It would also be \nslashing. It would also be extremist.\n  The fact is that neither of the proposals are extremist or slashing. \nThey are both--at least in our case--a reasonable attempt to try to \nstrengthen the Medicare system so that seniors will have a solvent \ntrust fund.\n  If the President would send up details of his proposal, maybe we \ncould say that his proposal was also a reasonable attempt to accomplish \nthe same goal, but at least the number he is talking about, a 7-percent \nrate of growth, is something that is within the ballpark, \n\n[[Page S 16574]]\n\nwithin the range of doability and certainly within the range of what is \nnecessary to keep the trust fund solvent.\n  So in substance what he sent up here in June can be discussed, and it \ncan be worked for the purposes of resolving the matter. But when the \nPresident and the Vice President talk in such outrageous political \nterms and use such hyperbole, it is not constructive to the process.\n  So the fourth thing I think the President must do is stop running for \nreelection all the time and start trying to govern the country. Is that \nnot his job for the next year and a half? There will be plenty of time \nto have an election next summer. Let us get about governing the \ncountry. Let us start talking some substance around here.\n  And that comes to my fifth point, which is leadership. If there is \none obligation of the Presidency, it is to lead. Regrettably, this \nPresident has been leading like a bumper car. It is time that he gave \nus some definition and direction. It is time that he sent up here a \nbudget based on numbers which everyone can agree are honest and fair, \nCBO numbers--a budget which has details attached to it, or if not a \nwhole budget at least major programmatic activities that have details \nattached to them so that we can evaluate them.\n  It is time he started talking to Members of Congress as if they were \ncolleagues working on a problem rather than opponents created by some \npolitical spinmeister that he has hired to do his polling for him. The \nfact is that leadership does not involve running for reelection. \nLeadership involves guiding this country through some very difficult \ntimes.\n  So the time has come, in my opinion, for the President to engage in \nthese five areas, to show that he is serious about balancing this \nbudget. We have put on the table serious proposals to balance this \nbudget, to give our children a future, to make sure that this country \nbrings under control its most serious threat to its future, which is \nthe expansion of its Federal debt and the fact that our generation is \nborrowing from the next generation to finance day-to-day activity that \nwe are benefiting from today.\n  If the President is serious, he has to address these five points. He \nhas to start using numbers that we all agree are reasonable. And I \nsuggest CBO numbers are the ones that are the best. He has to start \ngiving us some details of what he intends to do in these major \nprogrammatic areas such as Medicare and Medicaid. He has to agree to a \ngoal that is scorable, such as a 7-year goal to reach a balanced \nbudget. He has to stop politicizing the issue, using the extreme \nlanguage that may score well in the polling place but does nothing to \nmove the process along.\n  Finally and most importantly, he has to give us some definable \nleadership that shows us where he feels we can reach compromise and \ngovern rather than run for reelection.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16572-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I have listened with interest to some \nof the speeches that were being made this morning, and I heard speeches \nthat decry the President's use of his opportunities for political \nreasons and to disagree with virtually everything that President \nClinton has accomplished. I find it a strange anomaly. As Yogi Berra, \nthe famous New Jersey philosopher said, ``It's deja vu all over \nagain.''\n  I stand here listening to political speech after political speech in \nwhich the President of the United States is accused of being \nexcessively political.\n  I think we ought to look at the record just for a couple of minutes. \nFirst of all, we are faced with a reconciliation bill put out by the \nRepublican majority--and I sit on the Budget Committee, and I can tell \nyou this--and this is no surprise--that is going to take care of lots \nof wealthy wage earners, income earners, big investment yields, at the \nexpense of lots of little people, if I can use that word to describe \nthem, those who are dependent on Medicare for the sustenance, for the \nmaintenance of their health, those who depend on Medicaid, in many \ncases the only source, the only source to enable them to get the health \ncare they require.\n  And so it is despite the fact that Health and Human Services has \nprojected an $89 billion program to keep Medicare viable until the year \n2000, during which period we will have a chance to evaluate what is \ntaking place, maybe get to work on some of the problems we know exist \nthat are solvable and will not require less to be available to the \nMedicare beneficiary--waste, for instance. We know there is a \nsignificant amount of waste. We know that there is fraud--this is not a \nsecret--amounting to billions of dollars.\n  Those options ought to be examined before we turn to people who on \nbalance in the senior community have less income than $25,000 a year, \nto the extent of three-quarters of that population. Three-quarters of \nthe senior citizen population have incomes of less than $25,000 a year; \n35 percent have incomes of less than $10,000 a year.\n  But yet we say here in a majority voice that it is OK. ``We're going \nto save you from the demise of this program. We're going to save you by \nmaking sure you pay more, significantly more, in premiums for part B, \nin higher copays, in higher deductibles. We're saving you. We're taking \nmoney out of your pocket and transferring it over to those on the other \nside.''\n  By way of example, the House bill calls for a $20,000 tax break for \nthose making $350,000 a year. The Senate, a more modest program, allows \nfor a $6,000 tax break for those earning $350,000 a year. But at the \nsame time, we are saying to the senior citizens, whose profile and \nincome I just gave you, that they on balance will pay an average of \n$3,000 over a 7-year period more for their health care.\n  There is something funny, as they say. And the question is raised, in \nmy mind, whose side are we on? I think it is pretty obvious that on \nthat side of the aisle, from there over, that they are on the side of \nthe wealthy and the comfortable and those who have special access. It \nis obvious. The arithmetic is there. If only the American people get \nthe full story, then we will start to see changes, I believe.\n  We have already seen it. Congressmen in my State, who were dead full \nthrottle behind the Gingrich proposal, the Contract With America, have \nnow retreated because they are beginning to smell the ire of the \nconstituency. They are beginning to hear the message that ``We do not \nwant you to take money from us hard-working, modest-income people and \ntransfer it to those who have been fortunate enough to make lots of \nmoney in this society.''\n  So, Mr. President, as we look at the record that President Clinton \nhas compiled, it is a pretty good one. We just finished a year in which \nwe saw one of the smaller deficits in many years, $164 billion, and it \nis on the decline since President Clinton has taken over. We notice \nthat we have a robust economy, that until the end of September, the \neconomy grew at a very firm rate.\n  At the same time, we see almost an ideal situation in terms of \ninflation--modest growth, so little as to be of relatively minor \nconsequence in the perspective that the people in this financial \ncommunity have.\n  So, we have seen growth in the economy, we have seen growth in jobs, \nwe have seen inflation under control, we have seen the budget deficit \nat a relatively low point. And yet the President gets little or no \ncredit and lots of criticism as the debate obscures the reality of what \nis taking place in this reconciliation discussion: Taking care of those \nwho have money, who have influence, who have power, at the expense of \nthose who work hard, who plan their futures, and who are concerned \nabout what tomorrow brings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16574-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16574-S16575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Last, Mr. President, we hear about the concerns \nexpressed by people on both sides about Bosnia and about whether or not \nwe ought to have American service people in Bosnia as part of a \npeacekeeping operation. I think that question is yet to \n\n[[Page S 16575]]\n\nbe resolved. I think it is a dangerous practice to simply say that we \nwill not do it, to describe the situation as throwing our people into \nthe meat grinder.\n  Mr. President, when America lacks the ability to stand up for human \nrights, to stand up against abuse of men, women, and children such as \nwe have seen in Bosnia and such as we saw 50 years ago in Europe, when \nfor a long period of time, America was silent while the slaughter went \non--Mr. President, we have troops in Korea. They are there to protect \ndemocracy. They are at risk. There is some danger that something could \ngo awry and people could get killed or injured, and we do not want that \nto happen. I want us to have a careful debate about Bosnia. But when \nAmerica withdraws, as we see what is taking place in Europe, in the old \nYugoslavia, where women are routinely raped, where young men are \nroutinely killed, and we stand by doing nothing about it, shame on the \nfree world, shame on America.\n  I am not talking about troops. A long time ago I felt we should have \nmen supporting the Bosnians by lifting the arms embargo because they \nwere taking a terrible, terrible beating at the hands of a brutal \ninvader. So, Mr. President, I think that as we talk here about the \nPresident, about programs, about ridicule, about lack of respect--\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we discuss where we have to go, the \nvery difficult times in America--we have problems within our society in \nterms of crime and in terms of race relations, in terms of building our \neconomy for the next century--I can understand people sticking up for \ntheir party because there is a separation of beliefs in many cases--in \nmost, certainly. But to stand here to heap abuse on the President of \nthe United States and try to discredit the office by even the \nterminology that is used to describe the President, I think that it \ndoes us no good, that it, in fact, continues to reduce the civility \nthat used to exist here.\n  I am here 12 years now--almost 13 years. If nothing else, we had our \ndisagreements, but the tone was far more civil. There was far more \ninteraction between the parties. And now what has happened is this has \nbecome a political staging ground.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we can do away with some of that, work on \nthe problems, work on the budget, on reducing the budget deficit, \nsticking behind our country; if a decision is made by the Commander in \nChief that makes sense in our review, we support it and not simply use \nit for another opportunity for a political score.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16575-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16575-S16584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENIOR CITIZENS' FREEDOM TO WORK ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the Senate will now turn \nto consideration of S. 1372, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1372) to amend the Social Security Act to \n     increase the earnings limit, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. If it is agreeable to him, I would like to proceed with the bill. \nIf he is not ready, we could go into a quorum call.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I most assuredly am prepared to go to \nthe bill and look forward to the Senator's remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New York. Before I go into my \nremarks, I want to thank the Senator from New York for his steadfast \nsupport over many, many years of the principle of lifting the earnings \ntest. The Senator from New York was kind enough, in a hearing that we \nhad earlier this year, to point out in his own unique, descriptive \nstyle how unfair this is for working seniors. I am appreciative of his \nunderstanding of the obstacles that were posed to lifting the earnings \ntest but, at the same time, his support of the concept of doing so.\n  Mr. President, after 8 years of being involved in this issue of \nraising the Social Security earnings limit, we have arrived at the \nmoment when seniors will no longer be punished by their Government for \nbeing required, often by circumstances beyond their control, to work to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  We begin debate today on long overdue legislation, the purpose of \nwhich is best summarized in the legislation's title, the ``Senior \nCitizens' Freedom To Work Act.'' Mr. President, this bill is not \neverything that I wanted it to be. I wanted it to lift the earnings \ntest completely. The scoring of that by CBO would have been \nprohibitive.\n  What this bill really does is increase, over a 7-year period, the \npresent earnings cap minimum from today's level of $11,280 per year to \n$30,000 per year. It is over a 7-year period. I will discuss later the \nfactors that motivated us to make it that modest, but primarily it had \nto do with scoring.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that in President Clinton's very important \nstatement during his Presidential campaign book entitled ``Putting \nPeople First,'' the President stated, and a direct excerpt reads:\n\n       Lift the Social Security earnings test limitation so that \n     older Americans are able to help rebuild our economy and \n     create a better future for all.\n\n  That, I think, describes it as well as can be.\n  Let me also point out, and I will say this time and time again, as I \nhave in the past, this earnings test limitation does not affect wealthy \nseniors who have trust funds, stocks, pension funds, any other outside \nincome that is not earned income. The only people that are affected by \nthis Depression-era dinosaur are those seniors that go out and work and \nwork because, generally, they have to because of either unforeseen \ncircumstances or the fact that they just simply do not have enough \nmoney from their Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of a more onerous and unfair tax than \nthat. It would probably astound people to know that if a senior went \nout to work, that as soon as he or she exceeded $11,000 per year, for \nevery $3 that person earned over that limit, they lose $1 in Social \nSecurity benefits. Due to this cap on earnings, the senior citizens, \nmany of whom are existing on low incomes, are effectively burdened with \na 33.3-percent tax on their earned income. If you put in Federal, \nState, and other Social Security taxes, it then mounts up to somewhere \nbetween 55 and 65 percent, placing these seniors who are low-income \npeople in the highest tax bracket in America.\n  I do not want to spend a lot of time going through the history of \nthis, because I have been fighting it, as I said, since 1987. There has \nalways been a reason for not doing it because, one, it was brought up \non an appropriations bill, there was no offset, it could not be scored \nby the CBO, et cetera.\n  I have always, up until now at least, resisted this business of \naccepting CBO scoring because it is clear to anyone that if we lift \nthis earnings test, more seniors are going to go to work and more \nseniors will pay more taxes. So the static scoring idea has never been \nrevealed as being more fallacious than in this type of scoring that \ngoes on.\n  On September 10, 1992, we had a vote in the Senate on a motion to \nwaive a Budget Act point of order which required a three-fifths vote. \nThere were 51 votes in favor and 42 against.\n  I want to quote some of those who opposed the motion to waive the \nBudget Act:\n\n       Do not misunderstand us. The idea to raise the earnings \n     test is not a bad idea. We just believe we should pay for \n     raising the limits with offsets or a tax increase.\n\n  Another argument was:\n\n       We would support Senator McCain's amendment if it were not \n     being offered to an appropriations bill. The Senator is \n     right, we should stop using static models and analysis for \n     economic forecasting. We agree that this amendment would \n     bring additional revenue to the Treasury. Further, we agree \n     with all of the other arguments made by those who favor this \n     bill and who would support this bill if it were freestanding \n     or an amendment to a bill that was not an appropriations \n     bill. Unfortunately, we must urge our colleagues to oppose \n     the motion to waive the Budget Act since it is being offered \n     to an appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S 16576]]\n\n  So the objections to this legislation in the past were twofold: One, \nwe did not have an offset and, two, it was offered as an amendment to \nan appropriations bill. I will not go into the obvious reasons why I \nhad to offer it as an amendment to the appropriations bill, but the \nfact was, I could not get it up as a freestanding bill which I wanted \nto very much.\n  Under the static scoring model, which I just described in my view as \nfallacious, one used by the Congressional Budget Office, this amendment \nwould be scored as costing $9.92 billion. I disagree with the CBO's \ndetermination. However, to rectify this perceived problem, the bill \ndoes the following: It would mandate that the interest paid to Social \nSecurity funds be increased by 0.25 percent each year for the next 7 \nyears. This would ensure the integrity of the trust funds.\n  To reimburse the General Treasury, which would make this increased \npayment, the bill then mandates all nonprotected discretionary programs \nbe cut across the board by a uniform percentage equal to an amount \nnecessary to pay the increased interest.\n  By using this mechanism, the trust funds are made safe and the cuts \nnecessary to pay for the bill, consistent with CBO's position, are \nspread fairly across the board. Indeed, CBO has informed us that this \nlegislation's overall impact on the deficit is zero.\n  The bill also mandates that GAO and the Comptroller General engage in \nan analysis of the actual effect on the Treasury of raising the \nearnings test and report to the Congress their findings no later than 2 \nyears after the date of enactment of this act. This study will enable \nthe Congress to react to what actually occurs, not to what CBO analysts \nspeculate.\n  There is not a shred of doubt in my mind that 2 years from now the \nGAO will report that there is a greater inflow of revenues to the \nTreasury as a result of lifting the earnings test. There is no doubt \nabout that in my mind; I have talked to too many seniors. I have \ntalked, interestingly enough, to the CEO of Disney who came to my \noffice one time on another issue and, on the way out, said, ``Senator, \nI understand you are trying to lift the earnings test. Please do so. We \nwant to help you in any way, because the best employees we have at \nDisney World and Disneyland are''--guess what--``senior citizens.''\n  The people of the McDonald's franchise came to my office and said, \n``Senator, our best employees--our best employees--our most dedicated \nemployees are senior citizens, but there is no reason for them to work \nin our establishment because $1 out of every $3 they earn is taken away \nfrom them, not to mention the additional taxes,'' as I mentioned.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been ventilated by me and others for a \nvery long period of time. I want to point out that there may have been \nan argument during the Depression when 50 percent of the American work \nforce at least was out of work. It might have made sense to have \ndisincentives for seniors to go to work.\n  All you have to do is pick up today's newspaper and you will find \nthat there are lots and lots of jobs available all over America. We \nshould not preclude people by virtue of age, and by virtue of age only, \nfrom being able to take advantage of those opportunities in our \nsociety.\n  In 1935 when Social Security was created, we lived in a far different \ncountry. It is clear that our situation is not the same now. I want to \npoint out, again, seniors who are without private pensions or liquid \ninvestments which are not counted as earnings or affluent children to \nsupport them often need to work to meet their most basic expenses, such \nas shelter, food, and health care costs.\n  I am sure my colleagues all heard warnings that America will confront \nin the future a labor-shortage. Why should we discourage our senior \ncitizens from meeting that challenge as the U.S. Chamber, which \nstrongly supports this legislation, has pointed out:\n\n       Retraining older workers already is a priority in labor-\n     intensive industries, and will become even more critical as \n     we approach the year 2000.\n\n  A number of our Nation's most prominent senior organizations strongly \nsupport fully repealing the earnings test. This is a minimal test \nmeeting their just, I repeat, just demand. Everybody is in favor of \ntotally repealing it. As I said, that would be my first priority. For \nthe reasons that I stated before, that is just not possible.\n  My family is very close friends with a family that lives in northern \nArizona near where we live. It is a man and his wife. They have a son. \nThey are in the earnings test age bracket. They have a son who recently \nhad a serious illness and had to have an operation, thereby losing his \njob. That son has a daughter who lives with him.\n  My friend's wife, Lorraine Luke, had to increase her hours at the \nhospital transcribing medical information in order to help their son, \nwho is out of work, and their granddaughter. The Luke family sacrificed \nenormously. She went to work on a 6-day-a-week basis, and guess what, \nMr. President? A couple weeks ago, she received a bill from Social \nSecurity for $1,200 because she had exceeded the $11,000 threshold, and \nthey were demanding that money back--money that they had spent on \ntaking care of their son and their granddaughter.\n\n  Mr. President, that story is true throughout America. What happened \nto the Luke family is what happens many times in the lives of senior \ncitizens. Why we should do this to them and why we have done it for so \nlong, in fact, is a national scandal.\n  Mr. President, I would like to name the groups who have supported \nthis earnings test reform: Air Force Association, Air Force Sergeants \nAssociation, American Health Care Association, Association of the U.S. \nArmy, Enlisted Association of the National Guard, Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, Jewish War Veterans, Marine Corps League, Marine Corps \nReserve Officers Association, National Association of Uniformed \nServices, National Association of Temporary Services, National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Council of \nChain Restaurants, National Military Family Association, National \nRestaurant Association, National Society of Public Accountants, \nNational Tooling and Machining Association, National Enlisted Reserve \nAssociation, Naval Reserve Association, Navy League of the U.S., Sears \nRoebuck and Co., the Seniors Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nand the list goes on and on.\n  I would like to quote from a few editorials because virtually every \nnewspaper in America has editorialized on this issue at one time or \nanother.\n  The Chicago Tribune says:\n\n       The skill and expertise of the elderly could be used to \n     train future workers, while bringing in more tax dollars in \n     helping America stay competitive in the 21st century.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times says:\n\n       As the senior population expands and the younger population \n     shrinks in the decades ahead, there will be an increasing \n     need to encourage older workers to stay on the job to \n     maintain the Nation's productivity.\n\n  The Baltimore Sun:\n\n       The Social Security landscape is littered with a great \n     irony: While the program is built on the strength of the work \n     ethic, its earnings test actually provides a disincentive to \n     work * * * One consequence of this skewed policy is the \n     emergence of a gray, underground economy--a cadre of senior \n     citizens forced to work for extremely low wages or with no \n     benefits in exchange for being paid under the table.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News:\n\n       Both individual citizens and society as a whole would \n     benefit from a repeal of the law that limits what Social \n     Security recipients may earn before benefits are reduced.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The punitive taxation of the earnings limit sends a message \n     to seniors that their country doesn't want them to work, or \n     that they are fools if they do.\n\n  The New York Times:\n\n       * * * it is not wrong to encourage willing older adults to \n     remain in the work force.\n\n  The Detroit News:\n\n       Work is important to many of the elderly, who are living \n     together. They shouldn't be faced with a confiscatory tax for \n     remaining productive.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to read a letter from the AARP [American \nAssociation of Retired Persons]. I will read parts of it:\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: The American Association of Retired \n     Persons commends you for your sustained leadership on behalf \n     of working Social Security beneficiaries age 65 through 69 \n     who are penalized by the Social Security earnings limit. Our \n     nation needs the skills, expertise and enthusiasm of older \n     workers and raising the current limit would \n\n[[Page S 16577]]\n\n     send a strong message to older Americans that they can work \n     and earn more.\n       The current limit is too low and should be raised so that \n     moderate and middle income beneficiaries who work out of \n     necessity will be able to improve their overall economic \n     situation. * * *\n       An increase in the earnings limit is overdue. Over the last \n     several Congresses, either the House or the Senate has passed \n     earnings limit legislation, but it did not become law. As you \n     know, AARP has repeatedly supported earnings limit proposals \n     that were paid for in a responsible manner that was \n     consistent with the Social Security Act and did not increase \n     the ``on-budget'' deficit. The Association remains committed \n     to raising the earnings limit in a fiscally prudent way and \n     will work with you and others to ensure the earnings limit \n     legislation is adopted with the appropriate financing.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, who has more knowledge on the \nissue of Social Security than not only any Member of this body, but \nperhaps any living American--and I know that it has nothing to do with \nhis advanced age--the fact is that the Senator from New York has been \nextremely helpful on this issue. The Senator from New York understands \nit, and his support of the concept of lifting the earnings test has \nbeen a vital factor in helping this issue to move along. I want thank \nhim for his consistent knowledge and support on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my colleague and friend from Arizona is \nmore generous than even the hyperbole of the U.S. Senate allows. There \nare some important issues here.\n  It is interesting to note that issues such as the Social Security \nearnings test go far back in our history. Indeed it was raised in 1935. \nAnd the gentleman who was brought from the University of Wisconsin by \nEdwin Witte to be on the staff of the Committee on Economic Security \nthat Francis Perkins established, is still very much with us--the \nformer chief actuary of the Social Security system. He was staff \ndirector of the Commission on Social Security that President Reagan \norganized in 1982, and which included Senator Dole in 1983. It is \namazing, the continuity of the persons who have worked with the \noriginal legislation, or were in the original administration, and their \nwisdom and wit is available to us today.\n  On Monday, Senator McCain and the majority leader introduced S. 1372, \na bill to gradually increase the earnings limit to $30,000 in 2002 for \nSocial Security beneficiaries aged 65 to 69. Under current law the \nearnings test is projected to increase from $11,280 for this year to \n$14,400 in 2002.\n   In the past I have supported liberalization of the earnings test, \nand I will continue to do so in the future. But I have always insisted \nthat any liberalization of the earnings test should be paid for and \nshould be considered in the context of overall policies on Social \nSecurity.\n  This bill does neither.\n  Under the bill, discretionary outlays are reduced. But this does \nnothing for the off-budget OASDI Social Security trust fund as outlays \nin this account are increased by almost $10 billion over the next 7 \nyears. So the bill makes use of a budget gimmick. The interest rate \nreceived by the trust fund is increased by one-quarter of 1 percent so \nas to make it appear that the liberalization of the earnings test is \npaid for.\n  And the bill is being considered--on the floor of the Senate, without \nhaving been referred to the Committee on Finance. This prevents us from \ntaking into account the other important issues involved in the longrun \nfinancing of the Social Security system.\n  If we want to liberalize the earnings test, this bill should be \nreferred to the Finance Committee where we can have hearings, consider \nhow to pay for it, and how to integrate changes in the earnings test \nwith other Social Security policies.\n  Let me make clear my support for the concept of increasing the \nretirement test to about $30,000. In 1990, I introduced S. 1909, a bill \nto increase the earnings test to $24,720 in 1996--roughly comparable to \n$30,000 in 2002. But I also paid for that liberalization of the \nearnings test by increasing the amount of Social Security benefits that \nwould be subject to taxation. While that offset is no longer available, \nmy bill addressed several important issues that are not addressed by \nthe legislation now before the Senate.\n  First, the liberalization was paid for with offsetting changes in the \nSocial Security program.\n  Second, the two provisions represented a move toward treating Social \nSecurity benefits on a parallel basis with private pensions. \nIndividuals can retire from a company, collect a pension and continue \nto work in other occupations. And the portion of the private pension \nnot previously taxed--the employer contribution and any accrued \ninterest earnings--is taxed upon receipt of the pension benefit.\n  Last week, along with every other Member of the Senate, I voted for \nthe Senator from Arizona's sense of the Senate resolution acknowledging \nthe need to raise the Social Security limit. The last clause of that \nresolution states:\n\n       It is the intent of the Congress that legislation will be \n     passed before the end of 1995 to raise the social security \n     earnings limit for working seniors aged 65 through 69 in a \n     manner which will ensure the financial integrity of the \n     social security trust funds and will be consistent with the \n     goal of achieving a balanced budget in 7 years.\n\n  I would say to my friend from Arizona, let us do this, but let us do \nit right. Let us refer this bill to the Finance Committee and make sure \nwe are indeed ``ensuring the financial integrity of the Social Security \ntrust funds.''\n  There are two additional things to be said. First, the earnings \nlimitation is a holdover from the 1930's. When the legislation was \nadopted the unemployment rate was about 25 percent. We did not have \nprecise data on the unemployment rate and we used extrapolations from \nthe decennial census. We counted everybody. We did not know about \nsampling. In April 1930, there was not much unemployment. And in April \n1940, there was not much unemployment and, therefore, the Depression \nwas not reflected in the unemployment data gathered in the decennial \ncensus. People did know that large numbers of workers were unemployed. \nSo the earnings test was meant to discourage older retirees from \ncontinuing to work. It was meant to persuade people to leave the work \nforce when they had retired. And that is from another era.\n  We have had extraordinary success with American economic policy since \nthe Employment Act of 1946. In all those years--a half a century, we \nhave had less than 12 months in which the unemployment rate has been \nabove 10 percent,  and  that  was  during  the 1981-82 recession.\n  The object of putting an end to the retirement test is not only \nappropriate, but it is at hand. In 1983, we did this. We arranged that \npersons who do work and are subject to the loss of benefits because of \nthe earnings limitation are ``made whole,'' I think that is the usage, \nafter they stop working. We phased in the so-called ``delayed \nretirement credit'' so that by 2005 it completely offsets the loss of \nbenefits. Right now, beneficiaries get back about two-thirds of what \nthey lose due to the earnings test.\n\n  Why do you not want people to work beyond age 65 or 62? And why does \nthe Government take benefits away and then give most--and by 2005, \nall--of them back? It is not the Government's business to tell you when \nyou should work and when you should not work if what you are getting \nare benefits that you have earned.\n  One problem I have with this measure is that it is not paid for in \nthe mode I would have thought necessary and pretty central as a matter \nof principle, which is that all Social Security benefits be paid out of \na trust fund financed by Social Security revenues--payroll taxes \ncollected under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) of 1935.\n  This is no small matter. We would not be here today--I suspect we \nmight be here--but with a very different Social Security System. At \nthat time, no sooner did a bit of New Deal legislation get enacted, \nthen it would be challenged and end up in the Supreme Court and the \nSupreme Court would find it unconstitutional.\n  Frances Perkins, who was very much a person around Washington in the \n\n[[Page S 16578]]\n\n1960's when I knew her, described the scene in a garden party in 1935 \nwhen Harlan Fiske Stone came up to her and said, ``What are you up to \nlittle lady,'' and she was a master mistress at getting men to do \nthings for her because she appeared so helpless, and she said, ``We \nhave this wonderful plan. It would give people retirement benefits, \nunemployment insurance, dependent children would get support, all these \nfine things, but every time we do something like this, great members in \nthe Supreme Court say it is unconstitutional.''\n  He said, ``Tell me a little more, if you would.'' He listened. Then \nhe leaned over and did something no Supreme Court Justice would ever do \ntoday. He said, ``The taxing power, my dear. All you need is the taxing \npower.''\n  So my distinguished predecessor, Robert F. Wagner, introduced the \nbill over here and the people did it over there in the Labor Committees \nand so forth. The bill that was signed by the President of the United \nStates was introduced by a still obscure Representative from North \nCarolina who was chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. It came \nover here to Finance. We passed it out, and in due time it was \nchallenged, and the Supreme Court looked at it and said, ``You say this \nis a tax. Yes, it is a tax.\n  ``It says here, Article 1, Congress should have the power to lay and \ncollect taxes.'' That is why this is a Finance Committee legislation. \nWe have always paid for Social Security benefits with FICA revenues.\n  The measure before us pays for these benefits by an across-the-board-\nreduction in discretionary spending. I think you start at about one-\ntenth of a percent in fiscal year 1996 and go up to four-tenths of a \npercent by fiscal year 2002. These are large sums. We have to find \nabout $10 billion over the next 7 years. We will be financing Social \nSecurity benefits from general revenues that are not spent on these \ndiscretionary programs.\n  I have to assume that we will cut education programs. We will cut \ndefense programs. We will cut transportation programs. Those outlay \nreductions will pay for the transfer of general revenues to the trust \nfunds which pay for the increase in trust fund outlays. But these \ntransfers are artificially created, by an increase of one-quarter of 1 \npercent above the interest rate received by the trust funds under \ncurrent practice. The current rate is a blend of the actual rates paid \non Treasury Securities with a maturity of more than 4 years.\n  I do not think we should do that. I think it compromises the \ninsurance principle. It compromises the right of the beneficiary to the \nbenefits that is earned by payments into the fund.\n  There is a nice story about this. In 1941, a very distinguished \nprofessor at Columbia, who had been a member of the President's \nCommittee on Administrative Management--the Brownlow Committee--that \nPresident Roosevelt established in 1937, called on President Roosevelt \nto say he had been looking around things here and Social Security \nrevenues were coming in now. They were all being posted, as the clerks \nwill say, by Federal clerks with pens and nibs and cardboards, and they \nput down the 14 cents or the 22 cents that a person earned.\n  The professor in question called on President Roosevelt and said, ``I \nthink that is just a lot of extra paperwork we do not need. This is a \npay-as-you-go system. Just collect the money and pay it out and stop \nall this record keeping, which is really not very essential.''\n  That was Luther Gulick of Columbia University. He lived to the age of \n100. He died last year. I called him in upstate New York. He lived on \nthe St. Lawrence River. I went over this recollection with him. His \nmind was clear as Easter bells and President Roosevelt said to him--you \ncould see Roosevelt doing it: ``Now, Luther, I am sure you are right \nabout the administrative matters, but I never thought of those \nprovisions as a matter of administrative efficiency. I wanted every \nSocial Security beneficiary to have a number and have an account so \nthat''--I hope the Senate will forgive this usage because Luther Gulick \nrecorded--``no damn politician can ever take the Social Security \nbenefit away.'' That is why you have a number. Senator McCain, it is \nprobably your dog-tag number, I would not be surprised. Originally it \nwas not to be used for identification. Now it is. You get them in \ndelivery rooms.\n  We have never paid out a penny in Social Security benefits that did \nnot represent contributions made to the trust fund. For the longest \nwhile, the Federal Government was required to pay both the employer and \nthe employee contributions for members of the Armed Services Committee. \nThey had not done so, and in 1983 we found a big chunk of money that \nwas put in the trust fund.\n  On that basis, I say we ought not to depart from the principle that \nentitles you to the money. It is called an entitlement because it is \nyour money. We tax it the way we tax --and we did this in 1993--pension \nbenefits.\n  You calculate what you paid in, and what you already paid taxes on. \nSubsequently you pay taxes on the portion that was not taxed--the \nemployer contribution and the interest earnings on your contribution \nand that of your employer.\n  So, with the greatest enthusiasm for the enterprise but reservation \nabout the specific financing mechanism, which, in my view, goes to not \njust a marginal but a central point of the nature of Social Security, I \nrespectfully say I will not support the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just point out how we would cure \nthis perceived problem would be to mandate that the interest rate paid \non the Social Security funds be increased by .25 percent each year for \nthe next 7 years. This would ensure the integrity of the trust funds, \nwhich is the primary goal and overriding concern, obviously.\n  To reimburse the Treasury, which would make this increased payment, \nthe bill then mandates that all nonprotected discretionary programs be \ncut across-the-board by a uniform percentage equal to an amount \nnecessary to pay for the increased interest.\n  As the Senator from New York well knows, we find money around here \nall the time. It was interesting to me in the last 24 hours of the \nbudget debate we found $13 billion. I did not find it, but the so-\ncalled experts did. I am sure members of Senator Moynihan's staff here, \nif they were allowed to speak, would describe how they found $13 \nbillion. We seem to find all this money all the time.\n  Yet, we are seeking to take care of what is a gross inequity, knowing \nfull well there is no one--I say to the Senator from New York, I \nchallenge him to find someone to tell me that there will not, at the \nend of the day, be increased revenues into the Treasury because more \nseniors will go and work. So what we are really talking about here is a \nway of satisfying some paperwork requirements as far as CBO is \nconcerned, which is dictated by static scoring, when the reality is \nthere is going to be more money coming into the Treasury because \nseniors will be working.\n  So I appreciate Senator Moynihan's concern about the mechanism, but I \nhave to tell him we have been wrestling with this particular problem \nfor 9 years that I know of. Every time we try to remove this terrible \ninequity that exists in our society today, we say we cannot find the \nmoney. We obviously do not want to take it out of entitlement programs \nbecause we are then robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is kind of a kabuki \nshow here, because we know full well from the GAO reports back to us \nthat the money, after 2 years, will not be required because there will \nbe additional revenues. In fact, the funds for Social Security \nrecipients will be increased because as these people work, they also \ncontinue to pay into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do not in the least disagree with the \npoint of the Senator about an increased work effort and therefore \nincreased revenues, including direct revenues to the trust funds. What \nthe actual amounts would be, how actuaries would judge them, is beyond \nmy capacity, but there would be some and they would be not \ninconsiderable.\n  Even so, I maintained what might seem to be too purist a view but it \nis one I hold, that only revenues from the trust fund should be used to \npay benefits. We will see what the Senate's wish is.\n\n[[Page S 16579]]\n\n  The principle is correct. The issue can be resolved, the sooner the \nbetter. But it is my hapless responsibility to say, not this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New York again. By the way, I \nremind him we had a very interesting hearing on March 1 of this year, \nwhere they had several very interesting witnesses including Mr. Meyers, \nwho is another one of those.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Meyers who came here in 1934.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Exactly, the gentleman who probably is really the real \ncorporate knowledge on Social Security, who also at that hearing \ntestified that this earnings test should be raised and that additional \nrevenues would accrue from lifting this earnings test.\n  I also remind my colleagues it is a fact that $200 million per year \nare spent just to monitor the earnings test; in other words, to make \nsure that everybody who is between age 65 and 69 is penalized properly \nand does not get away with keeping that $1 out of every $3 in their \nearnings.\n  So we would dramatically reduce that burden right away and experience \nan immediate savings of considerable numbers of millions of dollars if \nwe just go ahead and lift it. Because then the Social Security \nAdministration would not have to expend $200 million on an annual basis \nfor that.\n  I note the presence of my friend from West Virginia on the floor. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nArizona. One of the things which actually is not generally, I expect, \nknown that much is that Medicare as well as Medicaid are part of the \nSocial Security Act that is being discussed, in fact, by the Senator \nfrom Arizona. It has to be said that when one looks at what might \nhappen in legislation, what might be the result of a conference, what \nmight be the result of a compromise following a veto by the President, \nshould that happen, there is a lot of speculation about what might \nhappen. But I think one thing which is very, very clear at this point \nis that what we are doing in the U.S. Senate and what we have done to \nMedicare, which is a part of the Social Security Act, is extraordinary.\n  I would like, in fact, to take from my friends from across the aisle \nthe word which they often use when they are discussing Medicare, which \ncomes from the Social Security Act. They talk about reforming Medicare.\n  I went, as I do every afternoon at 1 o'clock sharp, to my Webster \ndictionary, and I took out the word for ``reform.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent when I am finished, Mr. President, if I can have this printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It says, ``a: to amend or improve by change of form \nor removals of faults or abuses; b: to put or change into an improved \nform or condition.\n  ``2: to put an end to (an evil) by enforcing or introducing a better \nmethod or course of action.\n  ``3: to induce or cause to abandon evil ways,'' and then they use the \nexample of a drunkard--odd.\n  ``4: to subject (hydrocarbons) to cracking.''\n  I think I better stop there because that is rapidly getting into \nareas which I cannot be quite so sure of.\n  Then I also, being the persistent intellectual at 1 o'clock every \nday, in my Webster's dictionary, I went to the word ``raid,'' because \nthat is what those of us on this side of the aisle use referring to \nwhat happens to Medicare in the reconciliation bill. That is described, \nand I would similarly ask that portion which I read be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. ``Raid'' is, ``1a: a hostile or predatory incursion; \nb, a surprise attack by a small force.\n  ``2a: a brief foray outside one's usual sphere; b: a sudden invasion \nby officers of the law; c: a daring operation against a competitor,'' \nand, again, here I think the definition is wandering off into different \nterritory.\n  But my point, obviously, is what we are contemplating, and what it \nis, in fact, that we have put forth in reconciliation is not yet \naccounted for, not yet conferenced with the House, and is nothing less \nthan the ``raiding'' of Medicare. I assume that there are those who \nfeel very differently about it. But I do not. I feel very strongly \nabout it. I speak as a representative of the State of West Virginia \nwhere the average senior income for seniors in general is $10,700 a \nyear, and 21 percent of that goes already to health care, unless the \nsenior is 84 years old, which increasingly seniors are, in which case \nit is 34 percent of the $10,700. You can see, therefore, that the \namount of money that is being spent on health care already by Medicare \nrecipients, beneficiaries, is enormous.\n  So the majority party wants to fix Medicare, to reform it. And they \nwant to do that by cutting $270 billion from it, they would say to slow \nthe growth by a rate of $270 billion.\n  I, incidentally, had responsibility in the 1993 Budget Act, so to \nspeak, for cutting $56 billion out of Medicare. I never referred to it \nas ``slowing'' the rate of reduction. I always referred to it as \n``making the cut.'' And I hold to the same language then as now because \nthat is what I believe. It is like, if you had a certain amount of \nmoney 3 years ago and you have the same amount of money now, a hip \nreplacement has gone up by 22 percent in cost, you cannot do 84 percent \nof the hip replacement. You either do the hip replacement and you can \npay for it, or you do not have the money for it and you cannot do it at \nall. So this whole question of rate of growth is one that I will leave \nfor historians to worry about.\n  But any way you slice it, if you are cutting $270 billion--and when \nall the trustees of the hospital insurance trust fund say that you have \nto cut it $89 billion--then you come to the obvious conclusion that \nthose who would cut $270 billion are saving Medicare for a much longer \nperiod of time than those who would only cut it by $89 billion.\n  But an interesting thing happens. The fact is that, if you cut $89 \nbillion, as the trustees have recommended publicly in testimony and \nevery other way, Medicare will be solvent until the year 2006. On the \nother hand, if you cut it $270 billion, guess until what year Medicare \nwill be solvent? The year 2006, the same year, the same amount of time.\n  So the whole question then arises, Why cut $270 billion out if $89 \nbillion will do the job over the period of the next 10 years? The \nanswer, of course, is in the contract phase of the need for the $245 \nbillion tax break. I understand that intellectually because, if you are \ngoing to get a $245 billion tax break and at the same time balance the \nbudget in 7 years, you have to get your hand on a whole lot of money, \nand there is not a whole lot of money in any one pot, except if you go \nto Medicare, or if you go to Medicaid. Those are the two pots. Those \nare the two pots that you can go to under reconciliation or a Budget \nAct, and simply get large amounts of money, if you are of a will to do \nso.\n  However, the consequence of what the majority party is doing in the \nSenate, and has done in the Senate, means that Medicare recipients are \ngoing to have to pay enormously more from out-of-pocket expenses--out \nof their own pocket expenses, and all of this to fund a tax break. \nThere is going to be about $1,700 less per beneficiary by the year \n2002. Deductibles are going to be doubled. Premiums are going to be \nraised. The eligibility age for Medicare is going to go from 65 to 67 \nyears old, and there will be an enormous amount, I believe, of danger \nin equality and quantity of health care. Let me explain what I mean.\n  Putnam County General Hospital, Mr. President, is what I would \nimagine many hospitals are like in the Presiding Officer's State. It is \na rapidly increasing county in terms of its income, and in the sense of \nupscale county. Its future is unlimited. It has most of the flat land, \nor a lot of the flat land in West Virginia, and a lot of upper income \nhouses as well as middle-income houses. Yet, when you go to the \nadministrator of that hospital, he will tell you that between 68 \npercent and 72 percent of his entire revenue stream is paid for not by \nthe newly dynamic wealth of Putnam County, not by private-pay patients, \nbut by Medicare and \n\n[[Page S 16580]]\n\nMedicaid. He says that if this cut is allowed to stand, that Putnam \nGeneral Hospital is in severe difficulty. The mathematics make it \nclear--$270 billion cut in Medicare, $187 billion cut in Medicaid, and, \nhence, real problems for that relatively upscale hospital.\n  We have a lot of hospitals in West Virginia that do not fit that \ncategory. They are in very rural counties. Many shut down some years \nago. They depend almost entirely on Medicare or Medicaid for their \nrevenue stream. When I say the ``revenue stream,'' I just simply mean \nthe money they use to pay their doctors, nurses, oxygen, their light \nbills, and the rest of it.\n  I believe--I do not really think anybody can make the argument--that \nthe Boren amendment, by which you are meant to pay people much closer \nto the services that they render, has now been tossed aside. And I \nbelieve that doctors, physicians who have been taking care of seniors \nfor many years are--some of them--going to be in the economic position \nwhere they will have to simply say on their little shingle, ``Dr. So-\nand-So. But if you are on Medicare, please do not stop here. I cannot \nafford to treat you. I cannot afford to treat you.''\n  In other words, I believe that doctors will be driven out of the \nprogram and Medicare beneficiaries will be turned away.\n  There is another problem which we, in fact, cured in the Senate. This \nis the most devastating problem. It came pretty much as news to \neverybody. But it has not been cured in the House. Therefore, I \nconsider it to be a live neutron bomb just sitting there on the table. \nIt was the majority party's efforts to, in fact, get control of the \ncost of fee-for-service Medicare. Obviously, some Medicare patients are \nin HMO's. It is estimated that as much as 20 percent may go into HMO's. \nBut, obviously, the great body of Medicare beneficiaries are in fee-\nfor-service Medicare, and they like that. They like that for one \nreason--because, by definition, over the years it has always meant one \nthing, and, that is, they get to go to the doctor of their choice. They \nget to choose the doctor of their choice, they get to keep the doctor \nof their choice, and use the doctor of their choice. And that is the \ncentral, sacred theme of fee-for-service Medicare.\n  But until it was taken out in the Senate--I will say that the junior \nSenator from West Virginia probably had something to do with that by \ntalking about it for about an hour one day several weeks ago--there was \nthis thing called BELT which was a mystery. Nobody had heard of BELT. \nBELT stands for budget expenditure limit tool.\n  I am not discussing something in the abstract. We thankfully have \ntaken it out of the Senate's package. But it remains--and in fact a \nrougher one remains--in the House. So that in the conference, where I \nalways have this worry that the House is going to outdo the Senate \nbecause of their fervor--they appear to be less willing to negotiate, \nless willing to compromise on both sides than the Senate, so I always \nworry very much about the conference. So the way this would work would \nbe that the majority party now in the House would assign about a 4 \npercent, 4.7-percent growth rate to Medicare, the cost of health care \nin Medicare.\n  Now, we know that the actual cost of the increase in health care in \nMedicare is over 7 percent. But if this rate of growth of the cost of \nhealth care exceeded 4.7 percent, automatically--automatically--there \nwould be a sequester and there would be automatic reductions, arbitrary \nin nature but absolute in fact, in key Medicare spending in the \nfollowing year. The cuts that are specifically listed were inpatient \nhospital services, home health services, hospital care services, \ndiagnostic tests, physicians' services, outpatient hospital services. \nAs far as I know, that is most of health care. Mental health and other \nthings are not in there, but that is most of health care. There would \nbe, therefore, this sequestration and a ratcheting down so that the so-\ncalled fee-for-service concept for the Medicare beneficiary would \nsimply disappear.\n  It was all hidden in this little piece of paper and still resides in \nthe House. So I am very, very worried about that.\n  People listening may wonder why I am talking about Medicare. It could \nbe that the Senator from Arizona is sharing some of those thoughts at \nthis particular point. This is why I am talking about Medicare. I am \nhere to use this opportunity to offer an amendment, which I will do but \nnot immediately, to give the Senate yet another chance to walk away \nfrom some of the ills that I have been talking about and give it a \nchance to protect Medicare from the damage that is contemplated in the \ntwo versions, the House version and the Senate version, of the majority \nparty's budget, which is, of course, now headed for a conference where, \nas I indicate, I worry because I think the House's fervor in some areas \nis in excess.\n  I will offer an amendment very soon to do just what we have been \ntrying to get a vote on for 3 days but have not been permitted to get a \nvote on for 3 days. We have been prevented from being able to do this \nuntil this opportunity.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Senate still needs to appoint \nconferees to the reconciliation bill so that we can negotiate some of \nthese matters out. It is amazing that conferees have not been \nappointed, but they have not been appointed. This side can do nothing \nabout that. That has not been done because the majority leader knows \nthat the Members on this side of the aisle have just a few motions to \ninstruct conferees. We only have a few. Of course, the purpose of this \nis designed to make one last plea for the prevention of damage to \nMedicare, for real nursing home protection, and one or two other vital \ngoals. I think there are a total of maybe four or five.\n  The bill now in the Chamber is a very appropriate place to make the \nsame proposal. So I am here to make sure that when we are on a bill \ndesigned to spend billions more on a category of Social Security \nrecipients through the earnings test we first discuss, debate and vote \non the question of whether $270 billion is going to be cut from \nMedicare or whether that will not be the case and whether 30 million \nseniors are going to see their premiums increase or not, whether they \nwill be turned away from doctors or whether they will not.\n  So that is my purpose, and I share that respectfully with my \ncolleague and friend from Arizona, who probably wishes that I had \npicked another time to do all this. But you do have to consider the \nfact that in spite of the fact that in West Virginia the average income \nfor seniors is $10,700, nationally that same figure is only $17,750.\n  Most of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries with very modest \nincome, and we have discussed this before, but it bears repeating \nbecause I am not sure how far out there into the public this has \ngotten. Sixty percent of those with incomes of less than $15,000; 83 \npercent of those with incomes less than $25,000; 97 percent of those \nwith incomes less than $50,000.\n  This is a Medicare beneficiary population that we are talking about. \nAs I have indicated, seniors already spend more of their income on \nhealth care in 1994 than anything else--21 percent. Nonsenior \nhouseholds, interestingly, only spend about 8 percent of their income \non health care. Private insurance grew at a faster rate, almost 10 \npercent, than Medicare spending, which was about 7.7 percent, from 1984 \nto 1993.\n  Under the Republican plan, as I indicated, Medicare will be squeezed \nto a growth rate of 4.9 percent--I believe I said 4.7; I correct \nmyself--4.9 percent per person while private health insurance will \ncontinue to grow at over 7 percent per person over the next 7 years, \nrelegating seniors to a second- rate, second-class health care system.\n  My amendment will be a final opportunity for the Republicans in the \nSenate to defend--not raid but defend--the Medicare trust fund from a \nmind-boggling raid, a raid that will cut health care benefits, that \nwill increase seniors' costs and threaten the very existence of \nhospitals, a raid that is designed purely and simply, mathematically, \narchitecturally, self-evidently to pay for tax breaks tilted in favor \nof the most affluent, comfortable households in our great country.\n  The reconciliation bill passed at 1 a.m. on Saturday last will cut \nMedicare by $270 billion over 7 years. We all know that. We have all \nbeen told that this will save Medicare, keep it solvent, make the \nprogram stronger. Wrong, Mr. President, wrong and wrong again. The \nprofessional experts \n\n[[Page S 16581]]\n\nin charge of keeping the books for Medicare, the actuaries, the \nprofessionals, the people who do this for a living, say that $89 \nbillion will solve the problem.\n  That is not the long-term problem. That is the short-term problem, \nfrom now through 2006, and then our suggestion would be that we do \nexactly what Ronald Reagan did, wisely and effectively, in 1981, when \nhe appointed the Social Security Commission which came out in 1983 in \nfact with a solution for Social Security, a solution which was accepted \nby the people of this country, accepted by the seniors of this country, \naccepted by the Congress of this country, both sides of the aisle, \nbecause it had been entered into with the understanding that it would \nbe done with the idea of it being fair, nonpolitical and, therefore, \nworthy of the support of all, including the President of the United \nStates.\n\n  It was an extraordinary ability. Senator Moynihan and Senator Dole \nwere two of the members of that commission. What they did in service to \ntheir country and in service to the Social Security commission is \nlittle noted, but can never be forgotten by those who understand the \nconsequences of their actions.\n  Hospitals, doctors, and nurses and other health care providers in \nevery single one of our States believe, with absolutely certainty--they \ndo not equivocate--that cuts of this size, the $270 billion, will \ndisintegrate the kind of health service that 30 million senior \nAmericans have counted on for three decades, in a program that works, \nin a program that works in part because, prior to its passage, less \nthan half of Americans had health insurance who were of the senior age.\n  Why? Because if you are at the senior age and you have any kind of \nailments at all, or you are just senior age, you cannot buy health \ninsurance. If you have anything wrong with you at all, you cannot buy \nhealth insurance. You can have $10 million and you cannot buy health \ncare. That is why Medicare took place. Now 99 percent of our senior \npopulation has health care insurance. What a wonderful thing that is, \nwhat a marvelous thing that is.\n  I have no way of explaining to my constituents back in West Virginia, \nto the 330,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my State, why their Medicare \ndeductibles will double, their premiums will skyrocket, and West \nVirginia hospitals are threatened with the possibility of losing $25 \nmillion in 1996 and more than $681 million over the next 7 years.\n  I keep saying I wish this were some kind of a dream. But the threat \nis real, and it is not a dream. It is written into the pages of the \nbill that has been passed, unless, of course, we decide to change it. I \ncan only report what I read in this budget package. So, $270 billion \nwould be cut out of Medicare, $225 billion will be given--some say $245 \nbillion, some say $225 billion--will be given away in tax breaks and \ngiveaways.\n  Then, Mr. President, there is the $187 billion which is sliced out of \nMedicaid, which is integrated into Medicare in its effect on our health \ncare system, leaving the Medicaid system in tatters, as it is chopped \nup into block grants, something which States, no matter what their \nGovernors might say, do not want--do not want.\n  Talk to George Voinovich, talk to Christine Whitman, talk to some of \nthose Republican Governors who have the courage to say what they feel. \nTalk to any of the Democrat Governors. I mean, I was a Governor of my \nState for 8 years. I know our present Governor does not want any part \nof it, because all he does now in his regular session, and then special \nsessions, and then additional special sessions, is try to figure out \nhow to come up with more money to pay for Medicaid. Medicaid is about \nthe only subject they even talk about.\n  It is true, Mr. President, it is a terrible crisis in our State as it \nstands today, much less cutting $187 billion out of it and block \ngranting.\n  The response on the other side will be that we are exaggerating, we \nare trying to scare seniors. We do not agree with that. This budget is \nscary. The seniors I have talked to are scared. And, interestingly, \nthey have become scared at what I would call a very rational pace, if I \ncan explain myself. Some of the groups responsible for communicating \nwith seniors have been rather casual about this whole subject, in my \njudgment. Indeed, the American Hospital Association for a period of \ntime was rather casual about dealing with this subject.\n  But, interestingly, seniors began to understand what the consequences \nto their lives might, in fact, become. They began to get very angry, \nvery angry. And then some of the groups here in Washington started \nreacting to them. The hospital administrators already were very angry. \nThey were angry months ago. But their association was not listening \nhere in Washington as closely as it could have been. Now they are. And \nthe American Hospital Association very much dislikes, and is very much \nopposed, and very blatantly and openly opposed, to these kinds of cuts \nbecause of what it will do to the hospitals that take care of the sick, \nincluding seniors in our country.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      [From Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition]\n\n     \\1\\ re-form \\ri-'form\\ vb [ME, fr.

Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the conferees on the \n     part of the Senate on H.R. 2491 should not agree to any \n     reductions in Medicare beyond the $89 billion needed to \n     maintain the solvency of the Medicare trust fund through the \n     year 2006, and should reduce tax breaks for upper-income \n     taxpayers and corporations by the amount necessary to ensure \n     deficit neutrality.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from West Virginia \nthat I am very disappointed, of course, he would put this amendment on \na bill that is very important to the people of his State. He stated the \naverage income of the elderly in the State is $10,000 a year. It seems \nto me that he would be eager to, as quickly as possible, give them an \nopportunity to earn a sufficient amount of money in order to be able to \nbetter their living standards and raise their income.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  \n[[Page S 16582]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to talk a bit about this \nbill. I know the Senator from Arizona has worked on this for, I guess, \n7 or 8 years now. And I know for at least the time I have been in the \nSenate this has been an active interest of his, and he has played a \nvery constructive role in raising this earnings test in the past.\n  Unfortunately, I was not here when he made his opening statement. \nThis is a very--fortunately for all of us who have trouble reading some \nof these bills--a very short piece of legislation, and I do not want to \nmake any comments on it that are inaccurate. But, as I understand it, \nwhat we basically have in the law right now says that for a period of 5 \nyears, from age 65 to 70, there is an earnings test. After 70 there is \nno earnings test. During that period of 65 to 70 years of age, \nbeneficiaries of Social Security payments are penalized. They have \nactual reduction in their benefits as they receive income. I think the \ntest is at $11,200 today.\n  What this piece of legislation would do is, over time, take that 5-\nyear window, that penalty, up to $30,000 over a 5-year----\n  McCAIN. Seven.\n  Mr. KERREY. 7-year period of time.\n  Mr. President, in general, I have supported and on a number of \noccasions have actually voted for raising this earnings test. I must \nsay I have very strong mixed feelings about it. I would like to just \ntalk, and I am not going to offer any amendment at this point in time. \nWhen I am through, I will put the Senate back in a quorum call.\n  I have had the opportunity to examine and spend a great deal of time \nlooking at Social Security as a program. Senator Simpson and I, in \nfact, have developed a piece of legislation, S. 825, that we have \nintroduced in this body to reform the Social Security Program, that has \na different purpose than what the Senator from Arizona is attempting to \ndo, and I find myself increasingly sort of obsessed with this issue and \ntalking sometimes when no one particularly cares to hear about it. But \nI would like the take this opportunity, for a moment, to talk a bit \nabout what I think needs to occur with the Social Security program to \nimprove it for different objectives.\n  First of all, it must be understood that Social Security is an \nintergenerational commitment; it is a very strong and powerful \ncommitment.\n  It is not a retirement fund. There is not an account held for \nindividuals that they own. We have a calculation that you can get. If \nyou send in to the Social Security Administration and ask them, they \nwill tell you how much you have paid in and they will tell you \napproximately, based upon your current earnings at least, what you are \ngoing to be paid when you retire.\n  It is not a defined contribution system. It is a defined benefit \nsystem. We are told what our benefits are, and it is a very progressive \nsystem, though the contribution is flat and, as a consequence, I think \nfairly you can say the contribution system is a regressive system of \ntaxation, which is, interestingly, one of the reasons that a recent \npoll, that was very controversial, the New York Times did asking a \nnumber of questions about the budget reconciliation agreement. The \nlower the income, the higher the enthusiasm for a tax cut. The lower \nthe income of Americans who are in the work force, the more \nenthusiastic they were about their tax cut. I argue that is because the \npayroll tax and the other taxes that lower income people pay who are in \nthe work force tends to actually force them to make painful and \ndifficult choices. That is probably why that is the case.\n  Nonetheless, it is a regressive tax, but it is a very progressive \npayment system. That is to say, there are bend points in the \ncalculation which will actually decrease my income from Social Security \nin order to make sure that people with lower incomes will, over their \nworking life, get a higher payment. We have designed it in that \nfashion.\n  So I want to take this opportunity to, again, make it clear to \ncitizens who sometimes write me and say, ``I've got an account there; I \npaid in it all my life; I am getting out what I paid in,'' that is not \ntrue. We are not paid what we pay in. We usually get back more.\n  The system is designed to provide us with a supplemental source of \nincome. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which \nare tax law changes and pension law changes that make it more difficult \nfor people to provide private sector pensions, increasingly people see \nSocial Security as a primary source of income. The percentages are \nincreasing of those who have as their only source of retirement income \nthe Social Security System.\n  Accurately described, Social Security is a very strong and, I think, \ncorrect intergenerational commitment. It is an intergenerational \ncommitment. Every time I give a speech like this, people call and say, \n``Kerrey wants to get rid of Social Security.'' I do not. It is a very \nstrong commitment that is made on behalf of people who are retired by \npeople who are not retired to allow a fixed percentage of their wages \nto be taxed and distributed to those who are retired. That is basically \nwhat it is.\n  When it began, the first payment that was made in 1935 took 1 percent \nof our wages, and the reason it took 1 percent of our wages is the \npromise to pay was to begin 6 years after normal life expectancy. \nNormal life expectancy was approximately 59; 65 was the normal \neligibility age for Social Security in 1935. Today, it is still 65.\n  The good news is we are living longer. That is very good news. I do \nnot want anybody to think that I think we should be dying earlier. I am \nglad, through medicine, through research, through changes in \nlifestyles, and so forth, that people are living longer. That is good \nnews. That is my intent, anyway.\n  But now the promise continues 11 years after the age of 65. Normal \nlife expectancy is now 11 years beyond this normal eligibility age, \nwhich is age 65. There is an early eligibility age of 62 and there is a \nnormal eligibility age of 65 written into law, both of them begin \nconsiderably before normal life expectancy ends.\n  It would be bad enough if we were dealing with sort of constant \nnumbers in terms of the number of people retiring, but we are not. My \ngeneration did not have as many children as our parents thought we were \ngoing to have. So, when the baby boomers start to retire in 2008--60 \nmillion of us, by the way--if anybody doubts this problem is caused by \nRonald Reagan, George Bush, or Bill Clinton, it is a demographic \nproblem not caused by any political leader; it was caused by a \ngeneration.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, the point I am trying to make here is we \nhave a tremendous problem with Social Security. The longer we wait to \naddress it, the more difficult it is to address, and the problem is a \ndemographic problem.\n  The problem is also one of perception. Many citizens are of the view \nthat Social Security is a fund that is held for them and it is \navailable to them when they retire. That is not what it is. We pay into \nit, but it is an intergenerational commitment made by people who are in \nthe work force today to allow a fixed percent of their wages to go to \npeople who are out of the work force. It is a contract. It is a \ncontractual arrangement, and everybody out there in America, whether \nthey are currently eligible or will be eligible in the future, \nunderstands that contract is there for them.\n  There are really 260 million Social Security beneficiaries. It is \njust that 30-some million are currently eligible. All the rest will be \neligible. All Social Security beneficiaries up to about the year about \n2006 or so are currently alive. What you have to do is look and ask, \n``Not only can I write the checks today, but how am I going to do in \nthe future?''\n  In 1983 when we changed the law, what we did for the first time was \nbreak the pay-as-you-go system and create, in effect, a system where \nthe reserve is going to build up to a very large amount. Unfortunately, \nwe have been borrowing it and using it to pay budget bills since 1983. \nBut that number drives up to a very large amount and then drives down \nstarting at about the year 2013 until the fund is completely expended \nin 2029.\n  When I say 2029, people say, ``Fine, let's just wait until 2029.'' \nMadam \n\n[[Page S 16583]]\n\nPresident, the longer you wait, the bigger the adjustment is. We may be \nable to jog and we may be able to quit smoking or drink in moderation, \nwhatever you want to do to hopefully extend your life, but you do not \nget those years back. When you are trying to take advantage of \ncompounding interest rates in a savings, a collective savings, time is \nnot on your side. Every year you wait, you do not get that year back.\n  The people who will pay the price for it are not the current \nretirees, but it will either be future retirees or my children who are \ngoing to be scratching their heads trying to figure out, ``Do I cut \ndad's Social Security payment substantially or do I have my taxes go up \nin a rather substantial fashion?''\n  We are going to see a decline in the number of workers per retirees \nstarting in the year 2008 that is without precedent. There is no \nprecedent for it, and there is no possibility we are going to see gains \nin productivity that are sufficient to be able to allow less than three \nworkers per retiree to be able to produce what five workers per retiree \nare producing today.\n  Madam President, there is a need for us to change this trend line of \nSocial Security payments so that we can say to all beneficiaries--those \nwho are eligible today and those who are eligible in the future--that \nwe are going to be able to write your checks.\n  Today, you cannot say that. Today, if you look at somebody under 40, \nyou have to say to them, ``The current law will not allow me to write a \ncheck to you. I am going to have to make an adjustment.'' The longer I \nwait, the bigger the adjustment; the longer I wait, the higher the \ntaxes have to be or the larger the cuts have to be in current \nbeneficiaries. That is problem No. 1.\n  Problem No. 2 with Social Security is that it is a very rigid system. \nThe legislation of the Senator from Arizona addresses one part of that \nrigidity. That is, we have a rule, a Federal rule--a law, actually--\nthat the Senator is trying to change that says for a 5-year period of \ntime, from age 65, which is normal eligibility age. It is not normal \nretirement. You can wait to retire or you can retire early or retire \nany time you want, but you are eligible for a payment from the Federal \nGovernment, full payment at 65 and an early smaller payment at age 62. \nThe rules say I have to wait until I am 65 to get a payment, and for 5 \nyears, if my income exceeds $11,200 a year, you are going to reduce the \npayment that I get.\n  It is a very rigid system. I believe what needs to occur and what \nSenator Simpson and I have done with our legislation is said, let us \nchange the law so that 2 percent--we start with 2--so that 2 percent of \nthe 12-percent payroll tax goes into a personal investment plan for \nindividuals when they start working that has three big advantages: \nFirst, a much higher rate of return. Let it be known to all citizens \nthat one of the problems we have with Social Security is they are \ninvested in non-negotiable Treasuries, the lowest possible rate of \nreturn that you can have out there.\n  The lowest possible rate of return that we have--less than 2 percent \nand closer to 1 percent--does not even double twice during the course \nof a 45-year working life. It doubles once, that is all. A higher rate \nof return. In the FERS account, it is not unusual for our employees to \nsay they expect to get 8 to 10 percent when compounding it. That means \nthey are going to get a doubling, over a 45-year period, of six times--\na substantial increase as a consequence of taking advantage of a higher \nrate of interest.\n  Secondly, Madam President, the advantage is that it is more flexible. \nSome people have attacked the proposal that I have made, saying that we \nare going to adjust the eligibility age from 65 to 70, which we do. It \ndoes not affect anybody, by the way, over the age of 50, that is not in \nthe baby-boom generation, that is already retired, or will retire \nduring the next 10, 15 years. We do increase the eligibility age. But \nby establishing this personal investment plan, we give something to the \nindividual that they own and can take at age 59\\1/2\\ under the current \nindividual retirement account law.\n  So the second thing is that it is more flexible. You can tailor it to \nyour own needs, rather than being dependent upon Congress changing the \nlaw to satisfy whatever your individual requirements are.\n  Third, Madam President, we do change it so that you own it. Unlike \nthe current system, if you happen to, unfortunately, not make it to age \n65--let us say at age 64 you die--all those moneys that you paid in go \nto somebody else. You do not get anything out of it. It is a collective \npool. Under our proposal, the individual owns it. They have an asset. \nDone correctly, it can be a way for us to help Americans of all incomes \nacquire wealth--$1,200 a year, dedicated into an average savings \naccount over a 45-year period, will convert that individual into a \nmillionaire.\n  Well, Madam President, that is exactly what 12 percent payroll tax is \non $10,000 worth of wages. So there are other changes that I believe \nare more important than the earnings test if we are going to be able to \nsay to all beneficiaries, whether you retire today or in the future, \nthat the promise we have on the table we are going to be able to make \nand we are going to be able to keep; secondly, to convert that system \ninto one that brings a higher return and that individual owns it. It \nseems like the system we set up 60 years ago needs to be adjusted in \nmore ways than just raising the earnings test.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise as an original cosponsor of S. 1372, \nintroduced by Senator John McCain and Majority Leader Dole. It is time \nto lift the senior citizens earnings limitation off the backs of \nAmerica's and Arizona's senior citizens. This legislation would \ngradually raise the limitation to $30,000 between 1996 and 2003, and \nwould thereafter index for inflation.\n  During the 1992 Presidential campaign, President Clinton said that \nAmerica must ``lift the Social Security earnings test limitation so \nthat older Americans are able to help rebuild our economy and create a \nbetter future for us all.'' I could not agree more. Yet, despite the \ncontinued urging of many Members of Congress and millions of Americans, \nthe President appears reluctant to make good on this campaign promise. \nSo, it has fallen to Senator McCain once again to pursue this issue, as \nhe has for so long.\n  The Social Security earnings limitation [SSEL] was created during the \nDepression in order to move older workers our of the labor force and to \ncreate job opportunities for younger workers. Obviously, this situation \nno longer exists. Currently, under the SSEL, senior citizens aged 62 to \n64 lose $1 in benefits for every $2 they earn over the $8,040 limit. \nSeniors aged 65 to 69 lose $1 in benefits for every $3 they earn over \n$11,160 annually. When combined with Federal and State taxes, a senior \ncitizen earning just over $10,000 per year faces an effective marginal \ntax rate of 56 percent.\n  Moreover, when combined with the President's tax on Social Security \nbenefits passed in 1993, a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 \npercent--twice the rate millionaires pay.\n  If enacted, this legislation would gradually repeal the earnings test \nand would allow seniors to continue to work to meet their needs without \npenalty.\n  Some lawmakers apparently forget that Social Security is not an \ninsurance policy intended to offset some unforeseen future occurrence; \nrather, it is a pension with a fixed sum paid regularly to the retirees \nwho made regular contributions throughout their working lives. Social \nSecurity is a planned savings program to supplement income during an \nindividual's retirement years.\n  I believe no American should be discouraged from working. Such a \npolicy violates the principles of self-reliance and personal \nresponsibility on which America was founded. Regrettably, America's \nsenior citizens are severely penalized for attempting to be financially \nindependent. When senior citizens work to pay for the high cost of \nhealth care, pharmaceuticals, and housing, they are penalized like no \nother group in our society.\n  Senior citizens possess a wealth of experience and expertise acquired \nthrough decades of productivity in the workplace. Companies hiring \nseniors have noted their strong work ethic, punctuality, and \nflexibility. Their participation in the work force can add billions of \ndollars to our Natiion's economy. To remain competitive in the global \nmarketplace, America needs for its senior citizens to be involved in \nthe \n\n[[Page S 16584]]\n\neconomy: working, producing, and paying taxes to the Federal \nGovernment. A law which discourages this is not just bad law, it is \nwrong--and it hurts not only seniors but all Americans.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, this legislation would provide \nthe flexibility and opportunity for older Americans to remain \nproductive citizens of this Nation. I do not believe that older \nAmericans should be penalized for their ability and willingness to \nremain active and productive members of society. The current earnings \ntest arbitrarily mandates that a person retire at the age of 65 or face \nlosing benefits. I do not believe that any person who desires to work \nshould be dissuaded from pursuing the goal of employment due to the Tax \nCode. Finally, let us not forget the hazards our low income senior \ncitizens face who do not possess a pension fund or retirement plan. \nLow-income seniors who are working out of necessity and face a severe \ntax penalty should not be penalized for no other reason than their age. \nFor these reasons I support S. 1372 which would increase the earnings \nlimit for seniors.\n  Unfortunately this legislation to correct that inequity was paid for \nby using discretionary Federal dollars. In the last 30 years we have \nseen discretionary Federal outlays, as a percentage of this country's \ngross national product, plummet from over 14 to 8 percent in 1994. \nMoving money from discretionary accounts to mandatory accounts is \nmoving us in the wrong direction. I look forward to voting to correct \nthis inequity in the Tax Code at a latter date when discretionary \nspending accounts are not used to offset the cost.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I want to commend the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, for his leadership on this issue and ask \nunanimous consent to have my name added as a cosponsor to the Senior \nCitizens' Freedom to Work Act.\n  As a longtime proponent of an all-out repeal of the earnings limit, I \nam pleased the Senate is taking action on eliminating the additional \nburden President Clinton placed upon our seniors in his 1993 tax bill.\n  The current Social Security earnings test penalizes senior citizens \nby reducing their benefits if they continue working beyond retirement \nage and earn over $11,160 per year. For every $3 earned above that, \nthey are forced to send $1 back to the Federal Government. That is \nunfair.\n  While repeated attempts have been made to repeal this seniors' \npenalty, or to at least substantially raise the earnings limit so that \nsenior citizens can continue to contribute to society, the Clinton \nadministration and the leaders of the previous Congress prevented any \nmeasures from passing. Today, we have an opportunity to prove that \nthings have changed, and the Senate can do that by passing S. 1372 and \nproviding some overdue tax relief to our seniors.\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues some of the letters I have \nreceived from Minnesota seniors on this issue.\n  One constituent of Pierz, MN, writes:\n\n       I cannot afford to start drawing my Social Security because \n     of the earnings limit penalty. . . . If allowable earnings \n     were increased to $30,000 as the Republican plan proposes, \n     consider all the additional Social Security taxes that would \n     be collected. Also consider all the additional income taxes \n     that would be collected by the federal and state governments. \n     We, as Seniors on this issue, need YOUR HELP.\n\n  A senior citizen from Eden Prairie shared a copy of a letter he sent \nto one of my colleagues. ``I wrote in 1993 regarding my concern over \nSocial Security income being taxed,'' said the original letter. ``Not \nonly was 50 percent of it then being taxed . . . but the Clinton budget \nplan increased the amount subjected to tax to 85%.'' The response this \nSenator received from my colleague was that he supported President \nClinton's 1993 tax plan because it was ``fair.''\n  Madam President, I stand before you today because Clinton's assault \non this Nation's senior citizens in 1993 was not fair. It is blatant \ndiscrimination against 700,000 older Americans. Furthermore, it \ndiscourages seniors from working, robbing businesses of skilled and \nexperienced workers.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to restore fairness, and to deliver on \nthe promise we made to seniors. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16575-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MIDDLE EAST PEACE EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

This \nlegislation is critical and overdue, and we needed to pass it. I think \nit enjoys broad bipartisan support, and separating it from other issues \nrelating to our agenda, I think, is important. In this case, we were \nable to accommodate all Senators. I appreciate the work done by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts in accommodating these needs. \nAgain, I appreciate the effort of the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I, in turn, would like to thank Senator \nHelms for his cooperation. I know he has been trying and trying to get \nthe State Department bill passed. He is working in good faith. We \nexpect that a managers' amendment will be agreed on shortly and that \nthe Senate will pass a modified version of his legislation. I am \npleased that the chairman has lifted his objection, and that we can \npass a clean MEPFA, Middle East peace facilitation extension--at least \nin the Senate. I hope it can be taken up in the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16584-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16584-S16585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FIRST SESSION OF THE 104TH CONGRESS--STATISTICS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this may be of interest to all my \ncolleagues. We thought they might be interested in a statistical \ncomparison from January through October 31 of the first session of the \nprevious four Congresses to this current first session of the 104th \nCongress. The comparison contains the number of session hours, rollcall \nvotes conducted, and measures passed in the Senate.\n  In the first session of the 104th Congress, the Senate has already \nconducted 558 rollcall votes, as compared to the first session of the \nlast four Congresses, as follows: 100th Congress, 362 rollcall votes; \n101st Congress, 279 rollcall votes; 102d Congress, 241 rollcall votes, \n103d Congress, 342 votes.\n  In this first session alone, the Senate conducted 119 rollcall votes \njust on the budget resolution and reconciliation bill, and we are not \nfinished yet.\n  Actual session hours for the first session are 2 minutes' shy of \n1,548 hours, as compared to the 100th Congress, 1,026 hours; 101st \nCongress, 861 hours; 102d Congress, 1,014 hours; 103d Congress, 1,091 \nhours.\n  The final statistic I will share with my colleagues is the number of \nmeasures passed in the Senate in the first session of the various \nCongresses. In this first session, the Senate passed 259 legislative \nmeasures, as compared to 477 in the 100th Congress; 452 in the 101st \nCongress; 476 in the 102d Congress; 356 in the 103d Congress.\n  Needless to say, this session has been historical in many ways, \nincluding the number of rollcall votes conducted in one day.\n  The good news is that we have not passed as many legislative measures \nas \n\n[[Page S 16585]]\n\nthe previous four Congresses. However, in this Senator's opinion, we \nhave passed more sweeping, fundamental reforms that will help bring \nthis country back to financial soundness, putting the American people \nback in control of their own budgets, and getting big Government off \nthe backs of the American people and our States and cities across the \ncountry.\n  I guess my one regret thus far--whether it is in this session or the \nnext--is the failure to pass a balanced budget amendment. We failed by \none vote. However, this Congress is far from over. Senators may yet get \nanother opportunity to do what this Senator from Kansas believes is \nfundamental in controlling Government waste and spending--that is, \npassing a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget.\n  I think it is clear, if the time we have spent here and the number of \nrollcalls are any indication, that the Senate has worked very hard this \nyear, and I commend all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I \nthought this might make rather interesting bedtime reading, if we ever \nget home in time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16584-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16585-S16589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENIOR CITIZENS' FREEDOM TO WORK ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I want to pay tribute to Senator \nMcCain. There is not a more fierce advocate of his position in this \narea. He has been that way since I have known him. I have been on the \nother side of the issue all that time, also. We have serious \ndisagreement. But I have a deep respect and admiration for him. He has \nbeen of great assistance to me in dealing with the tough issues on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, like POW's/MIA's. No one speaks with more \ncredibility and integrity than this man from Arizona. So I want that \nclearly on record.\n  As to Senator Kerrey, let me share with my colleagues here that I \nhope you heard every word that Senator Kerrey was saying, because every \nword that he was saying is absolutely true with regard to Social \nSecurity.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot continue to leave out of serious \ntotal discussion something that is $360 billion a year, and we are not \ntouching it. You do not dare touch it. That is why this will pass. Do \nnot worry about the 60 votes on a point of order. Do not worry about 70 \nor 80; it will pass by 90 to 10.\n  Then we will deal with it. We will ``find the money.'' I hear that \nplea. I can understand that clearly.\n  This, however, in my mind, does not comport with the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which I voted for the other day, because it said if \nit can be done ``without injuring the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity or negatively impacting the deficit.''\n  What this fundraising mechanism does is get the money short term, but \nin the long term it is absolutely devastating.\n  Now, this legislation, in my mind, does violate the Budget Act \nbecause it increases outlays in the Finance Committee area of \njurisdiction during the 5-year budget windows of 1996 to 2000. I hope \nthe Senate will sustain the point of order lying against it, but I know \nthat will be a very remote possibility because I am sure the phone \nlines are jingling right now as to the fact that we are going to free \nup senior citizens to do what they need to do. We may well be doing \nthat between these ages of 65 and 70, which has been apparently a very \nvigorous movement in America with regard to the earnings limit.\n  There is not a single person in this body that has been more \ndedicated to that issue in all my time of serving with him than the \nSenator from Arizona. I am sympathetic. The rest of the Senate is \nsympathetic. They will prove it in their votes. There is no question \nthat Americans are living longer and are productive for a longer time. \nOur retirement policy should reflect that.\n  Let me caution my colleagues and the vapors of the day that it will \npass in the Chamber as we vote this because I know how this game works. \nThis is a $360 billion program, the biggest and largest of all handled \nby the Federal Government. Millions of Americans depend upon it. They \nshould not, but they do. They never should have under the original \nSocial Security law because it was never intended to be a pension. \nRegardless of what the senior groups may tell you, it is not a pension. \nIt was an income supplement, very well put together, as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska has pointed out.\n  A majority of Americans who stand to retire some day--and almost all \nof us hope to and many of us in this line of work hope we get out \nbefore they throw us out--some day will be dependent upon it as a \nprincipal source of income. It is not right that it should be, but \nnevertheless it is.\n  It is very difficult to craft it now in these later years to be a \nprincipal source of income when it was never intended to be a principal \nsource of income but only a supplemental source of income. That is all \nvery well reflected.\n  I just want to review the bidding one more time as to what you put \ninto this--as people complain vigorously about what they are getting \nout--and give some very critical comments about COLA's and why are the \nseniors being treated this way.\n  Let me put it in a very personal way. I am 64 years old. I have \nworked since I was 15. My first job was at the Cody Bakery in Cody, WY. \nI was the person who put that remarkable strawberry clear glop in the \nmiddle of the sweet roll. That was my job. You went tick, tick like \nthat every morning. Somehow I have never eaten one of those again and \nnever shall. That was my job.\n  Do you know what I put into Social Security that year? Five bucks--\nthey really bit me that year, 1959. Worked at the B4 Ranch, did not put \nin a nickel. Off to college after high school, never put in a nickel. \nNever earned enough in the summer--there was an earnings limit--I never \nearned enough in the summer to contribute to Social Security. Went to \nthe army. Never put in a nickel in those years. Got out. Went to finish \nlaw school. Started to practice law.\n  The first year I practiced law, I put in $59 that year. Then the old \nman put me to work and he kept the money. I remember how that worked in \nthe partnership. I put a shingle up and it said ``Simpson and Father,'' \nand he never got over that--instead of ``Simpson and Son.'' But I had a \ndear, loving father and we worked together.\n  Then for all the years of my practice--I hope you will hear this--I \nnever put in over $874 a year and neither did anyone else in America. \nGot it--874 bucks a year and self-employed, and no other person did \neither, because there was a cap. A person could make $100,000 a year \nand the cap was $12,000. A person could make $1 million and the cap was \nset at $12,000 or $8,900 or whatever it is, and you applied the \npercentage rate to that. I understand what Social Security is and what \nit was. So, earning the maximum, from the year 1959 until 1976, I never \nput in over $874 per year.\n  Then off to Washington: $1,200 a year, a real hit there, and then \n$1,500 a year, and then $2,000 a year and then $3,000 a year up in the \nlate 1980's, and now I think I am up to 4,200 bucks a year.\n  Got it? If I retire at 65 I will receive $1,120 a month--got it? If I \nsave my strength until the age of 70 and not take it until then, I will \nreceive $1,540 a month. That is the way it is. That is Social Security. \nIt cannot be sustained. There is no way it can be sustained.\n  When I was a freshman at the University of Wyoming, there were 16 \npeople paying into this system and one person taking benefits; today \nthere are three people paying into the system and one person taking \nbenefits. In 20 years, there will be two people paying into the system, \none taking benefits. Everybody in this Chamber knows that. Everybody \nwho is a trustee of the Social Security Administration knows that.\n  So this continual ritual is played out that somehow we are doing \nsomething hideous to senior citizens. If you retired in 1960, you got \nall your money back in the first 2\\1/2\\ years, plus interest. Got it in \n2\\1/2\\ years, every penny back.\n  In the 1970's, you got it all back in 3 years. Today, if you retired, \nyou get it all back in 6\\1/2\\ years, plus interest.\n  That is where we are, a totally unsustainable system. Who is telling \nus that? The trustees. Are the trustees all Ronald Reagan Republicans \nor far-right legions? No. No, they are not. The trustees are Robert \nRubin, Robert Reich, Donna Shalala, Shirley Chater--one Republican, one \nDemocrat--telling us very simply, in the year 2013 there will not be \nsufficient revenue coming in under this pay-as-you-go plan, only \n\n[[Page S 16586]]\n\nsufficient revenue to pay the benefits right there. At that point, in \n2012, you have no choice but to cash in the bonds. You take the IOU's \nand you cash them in.\n  If this passes, the interest rate is going to be .25 percent more. It \nwill be good for the short term. It will take care of this for the \nshort term. That is the Senator's intent. But if this is long-term \nsolvency, it does not meet that test. It does not, because when cash-in \ntime comes, you will pay more because the interest rate is higher and \nyou pay more.\n  I just think we should be very, very careful about making Social \nSecurity policy or any policy which may increase outlays without \nsufficient offsets on the floor of the Senate. I hope my colleagues \nwill see this legislation, as I say, does not follow the sense-of-the-\nSenate vote last week. I know this is the intention.\n  I attribute not a single ulterior motive to the Senator from Arizona. \nHe is a believer. He says to me often, ``Look, I will get a vote on \nthat, regardless of where you are.'' And he will and he does.  And that \nis his forte.\n\n  But, as chairman of the Social Security and Family Policy \nSubcommittee, we have not had a hearing on this. Win, lose, or draw, I \nwill promise one on this. It makes no difference what happens here. I \nthink we need to have a hearing on this to see that it comports with \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security.\n  The measure before us acknowledges that increases in the earnings \nlimit will itself worsen the solvency of Social Security, so the \noffsets are offered. First, of course, is the across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary funding. I have now information--I want to submit it for \nthe Record--I think it is very important that we have these figures, \nthat this measure cannot be scored as producing the necessary savings. \nThis is from Congressional Budget Office today.\n  This constitutes, thus, a violation of the Budget Act. This \nlegislation, according to CBO, would add $9.9 billion to the budget \ndeficit. That is a violation of the Budget Act.\n  I point out to my colleagues, even if this offset were to make up for \nthe projected increases in the deficit, it would not resolve the \nquestion of solvency in the Social Security trust fund itself. I hope \nyou hear that. That offset money is going to come from the general \nappropriated revenue. Thus, the balance sheet within Social Security \nwould not be improved, and that is what we have to improve if we are to \nmeet the sense-of-the-Senate recommendation. It would not be improved \nin any way.\n  Thus, I believe this offset would not meet the terms of that vote \nwhich we state we would only increase the earnings limit if--if--if the \nsolvency of Social Security were not adversely affected.\n  And finally, another proposed offset--and here is the one--you do not \nhave to listen to it, you do not have to do anything with it, pitch it, \nthrow it over the side of the ship, but the other proposed offset is a \ndevastating one. It increases the interest rates paid on obligations \nwithin the Social Security trust fund.\n  My understanding of this--and the Senator is here and can educate \nme--but my understanding of this measure is that it will provide a \nshort-term infusion of capital. It will do that. I will agree to that. \nI will agree that that is the case. But over the long term and the long \nrun, it would mean higher costs, higher outlays as the Social Security \ntrust fund is drawn down. In fact, this legislation goes so far as to \nincrease the interest paid, if I read it--and I need to know this--to \nincrease the interest rate paid on such bonds that have already been \nissued, effectively reissuing them at higher rates of return, with \npotentially severe consequences for the long-term solvency of the trust \nfund.\n  I am told that the increase in interest rates would bring the overall \nlong-term costs up toward--and, in some cases, even beyond--the so-\ncalled high-cost scenario which is used by the trustees of the Social \nSecurity system to measure the long-term solvency of Social Security. \nThey tell us where the high-cost scenario is, the low-cost, the mid-\ncost.\n  In other words, then, such a measure would move the crash date for \nSocial Security closer in time than it is under current policy. And \nremember where the crash date is today? It is 2029, crash date. Where \nwas it in the early 1980's, after Senator Moynihan and many others of \nour fine colleagues righted that listing program? It was 2063. Now it \nis 2029. In another year, I suppose they will move it up to 2025. Then \ncrater day will be 2020.\n  So I have also asked the Social Security actuaries to review the \nconsequences of the legislation and I expect to have that from them \nshortly. My mind is not closed on the subject. I will work with this \nfine friend and Senator, as chairman of the Social Security and Family \nPolicy Subcommittee; be pleased to have the Senator as a witness, hold \nhearings. He has been a leader. I know he will continue to be, and \nindeed he will.\n  But in the present moment I do not believe that in any sense we \nshould go forward. I think the Senate should sustain the budget point \nof order lying against this legislation. This is far too serious an \nissue to be dealt with in this way on the floor of the Senate. I hope \nthe Senate will not take an action which could conceivably worsen the \nlong-term outlook--I am talking about the long-term outlook for Social \nSecurity, or which will cause an increase in the outlays permitted to \nthe Finance Committee under the terms of the Budget Act.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent a letter dated today from \nJune E. O'Neill of the Congressional Budget Office, citing the figures \nand where we are with regard to this additional $9.9 billion, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1995.\n     Hon.

Bill status: As introduced on October 31, 1995, with \n     modifications that the sponsors expect to make prior to \n     action on the Senate floor.\n       4. Bill purpose: As modified, S. 1372 would increase the \n     exempt earnings amount for Social Security beneficiaries aged \n     65-69 in stages to reach $30,000 in 2002, change the interest \n     rate paid on Treasury securities held in the old-age \n     survivors insurance trust fund, and establish sequestration \n     procedures to reduce discretionary spending.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: S. 1372 would \n     provide ad hoc increases in the exempt earnings limit for \n     Social Security recipients who have reached the normal \n     retirement age such that, by 2002, the exempt amount would be \n     $30,000. Additional Social Security benefit payments would \n     total $392 million in 1996 and $9.9 billion over the 1996-\n     2002 period. The bill would attempt to compensate the old-age \n     and survivors insurance (OASI) trust fund by increasing the \n     interest payments made by the Treasury to the trust fund. \n     Consequently, the bill is estimated to increase the off-\n     budget surplus marginally and increase the on-budget deficit \n     by $11.7 billion over the next seven years.\n\n\n[[Page S 16587]]\n                                     BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 1372 AS AMENDED                                     \n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       1996       1997       1998       1999       2000       2001       2002   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                \n          Direct Spending                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                \nOff-budget:                                                                                                     \n    Benefit payments:                                                                                           \n        Estimated budget authority        392        920      1,241      1,490      1,753      1,988      2,138 \n        Estimated outlays.........        392        920      1,241      1,490      1,753      1,988      2,138 \n    Receipt of interest payments:                                                                               \n        Estimated budget authority       -908     -1,327     -1,498     -1,685     -1,882     -2,092     -2,318 \n        Estimated outlays.........       -908     -1,327     -1,498     -1,685     -1,882     -2,092     -2,318 \n    Net off-budget effects:                                                                                     \n        Estimated budget authority       -516       -407       -257       -195       -129       -104       -180 \n        Estimated outlays.........       -516       -407       -257       -195       -129       -104       -180 \nOn-budget:                                                                                                      \n    Interest payments:                                                                                          \n        Estimated budget authority        908      1,327      1,498      1,685      1,882      2,092      2,318 \n        Estimated outlays.........        908      1,327      1,498      1,685      1,882      2,092      2,318 \nTotal budget:                                                                                                   \n        Estimated budget authority        392        920      1,241      1,490      1,753      1,988      2,138 \n        Estimated outlays.........        392        920      1,241      1,490      1,753      1,988      2,138 \n                                                                                                                \n Authorizations of Appropriations                                                                               \n                                                                                                                \nOn-budget:                                                                                                      \n    GAO report:                                                                                                 \n        Estimated authorizations                                                                                \n         of appropriations........

Basis of estimate:\n\n\n                            direct spending\n\n       Off-budget.--Under current law, Social Security recipients \n     aged 65-69 can earn up to $11,640 in wages during 1996 before \n     facing a reduction in benefits. The exempt amount is \n     increased each year to reflect the growth in average wages in \n     the economy. S. 1372 would increase the exempt amount faster \n     than under current law during the 1996-2002 period. The \n     exempt amount would be increased to $14,500 in 1996 and to \n     $17,500 in 1997. The exempt amount would increase by $2,500 \n     annually for the next five years and reach $30,000 by 2002. \n     Indexing would resume in 2003. The changes would not apply to \n     blind recipients, who currently face the same earnings limit \n     as beneficiaries aged 65-69, nor would Social Security \n     recipients under age 65 be affected.\n       S. 1372 would raise the interest rates paid on the assets \n     of the OASI trust fund and would increase interest payments \n     to the fund by $908 million in 1996 and $11.7 billion over \n     the 1996-2002 period. These interest payments would be \n     reflected in the off-budget accounts as receipts or negative \n     outlays.\n       These two changes would increase the off-budget surplus by \n     $516 million in 1996 and by $1.8 billion over the seven-year \n     period.\n       On-budget.--The additional interest payments made by the \n     Treasury would contribute on-budget direct spending equal to \n     the amount of off-budget interest receipts. Thus, the on-\n     budget deficit is increased by $908 million in 1996 and by \n     $11.7 billion over the 1996-2002 period.\n\n\n                         discretionary spending\n\n       S. 1372 would establish a process by which discretionary \n     spending would be reduced in amounts equal to the additional \n     Social Security benefit payments. Changes in outlays from \n     future appropriations, however, are specifically excluded \n     from the pay-as-you-go procedures of the Balanced Budget Act.\n       In addition, the bill requires the General Accounting \n     Office to complete a report assessing the effects the \n     increase in the exempt earnings limit has on the economy.\n\n\n                                revenues\n\n       Increasing the amount of money that a Social Security \n     beneficiary may earn without having his or her benefit \n     reduced would increase benefits for some elderly people who \n     are currently working and have their benefits partly or \n     entirely withheld. Although the proposal would encourage \n     additional paid work by some elderly people, such an increase \n     in work would have a negligible effect on the amount of \n     Social Security benefit payments. Because the cost estimate \n     incorporates the economic assumptions in the budget \n     resolution, the estimate does not reflect any change in \n     economywide employment, compensation, or income and payroll \n     tax collections. Even if those additional revenues were \n     included in the cost estimate, however, they would offset \n     less than 20 percent of the additional benefit payments, \n     according to the Social Security Administration.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     direct spending or receipts through 1998. The pay-as-you-go \n     effects of the bill are as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   1996    1997    1998 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays...............................     908   1,327   1,498\nChange in receipts..............................

Madam President, I then respectfully render a point of \norder under section 302(f) of the Budget Act, and state that in formal \nfashion. Madam President, the pending measure increases outlays in 1996 \nand over the 5-year period 1996 to 2000 in excess of the Finance \nCommittee's allocation for these time periods. I therefore raise a \npoint of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act against this \nmeasure.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in a minute I will seek to waive the \nbudget point of order and would ask for the yeas and nays on that at \nthe time.\n  I also ask unanimous consent we would have a vote on that, and that \nvote take place followed by a return to the Rockefeller pending sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment.\n  So I guess my parliamentary request is, I request unanimous consent \nto temporarily set aside the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not require setting aside. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on this issue I have, of course, the \ngreatest respect and affection for the Senator from Wyoming. I deeply \nregret it is a Member of my party who is seeking to overturn what is \nclearly in the Contract With America, a mandate and promise that we \nmade to the American people in 1994.\n  On the subject of hearings, the Senator from Wyoming wants to have a \nhearing. While he is sitting there maybe he wants to read the hearing \nthat took place on March 1, 1995, and the hearing that took place on \nMay 24, 1994, last year and the six other hearings that took place on \nthis amendment and the seven or eight times I brought up this issue for \ndebate and discussion on the floor of the Senate. So I am a little bit \npuzzled when the Senator from Wyoming says we have not had a hearing on \nit, when on March 1, 1995, I see numerous comments on the issue by the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  I wonder, maybe I would ask him a question, if he remembers being at \nthe hearing in March 1, 1995, and at the hearing on May 24, 1994?\n  So we have had hearings on this issue. The issue is clear. It is not \ncomplicated. Are we or are we not going to lift the earnings test on \nworking Americans? The Senator from Wyoming makes a very compelling \ncase that the Social Security system is in trouble. Then what would be \na better cure, what would be a better cure, I ask the Senator from \nWyoming, than to allow people to work and help try to return the Social \nSecurity system back to the supplemental income it was originally \nintended to be, because right now there is no incentive for them to be \nworking?\n  Madam President, the CBO will certify that there will be actually \nmore \n\n[[Page S 16588]]\n\nmoney in the trust fund as a result of this. I appreciate the problem \nof the Senator from Wyoming with this money. I asked the Senator from \nWyoming, as a member of the Finance Committee, how come it was that on \nThursday and Friday of last week somehow they found $13 billion? They \njust found it because we had a problem. I do not know how they found \nit. Perhaps the Senator from Wyoming can tell me.\n  But now what we have is a proposal, which in the short term may cost \nsome money, but the Senator from Wyoming cannot find a single expert--a \nsingle expert--who will not say that once this earnings test is lifted, \nthere will be more revenues into the coffers in the form of taxes \nbecause more people will work.\n  The Senator from Wyoming knows that as well as I do because he was \npresent at these hearings.\n  The fact is, if we adopted this, the interest paid on the Social \nSecurity fund would be increased by 2.25 percent each year for the next \n7 years. But, also, this bill mandates that the GAO and the Comptroller \nGeneral analyze the actual effect on the Treasury of raising this \nearnings test limit, and we know what the result will be.\n  We know what the result will be. The result will be that the Social \nSecurity trust fund that the Senator from Wyoming is deeply concerned \nabout--and I share his concern--will be healthier as a result of \nlifting the earnings test. Everybody knows what the difference between \nstatic and dynamic budgeting is. Everybody knows that. If everybody \nbelieved in that, we would never cut the capital gains tax. We would \nnever cut it if you believe in static scoring of taxation around here. \nBut also everybody knows that, if you cut the capital gains tax, as we \ndid the time seriously under President Kennedy, we increase revenues \ninto our coffers.\n  As the Senator from Wyoming said, I have been working on this issue \nfor a long time. But so have our colleagues in the House. They passed \nthis bill three times. That is why they asked us to come over here. \nThey want us to fulfill the Contract With America. They want us to \nfulfill the promise that we made to them in the election in 1994. Right \nthere in the Contract With America was lift the earnings test.\n  I understand that the Senator from Wyoming did not sign the Contract \nWith America. But I did. So did a lot of other Republicans, and the \ntaxpayers of this country believe that we all did. That is why I am \ndisturbed that the Senator from Wyoming would be the one to oppose this \nbudget point of order.\n  Madam President, I ask to waive the budget point of order, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Arizona restate the \npoint of order, and was he seeking to waive?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe that the Senator from Wyoming made the point of \norder.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I made the formal point of order, Madam President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Wyoming made the point of order.\n  Madam President, I move to waive the point of order, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there is sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, as a matter of procedure, I believe \nthat point of order that I made was nondebatable but I was willing to \ngo forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 3 minutes to reply to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator the motion to \nwaive is debatable.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I am talking about the point of order. The point of \norder which I made is nondebatable, if I am not mistaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once a motion to waive is made, it is in order \nto debate it.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. At that time, let the record show that it was not \ndebatable. And I knew that, and I was willing to let my friend go \nforward. But let me just respond here.\n  Of course, we are not into ridiculous questions to shoot back and \nforth at each other. Ridiculous or sarcastic questions serve no purpose \nhere.\n  I was there. So was the Senator from Arizona. And I can tell you not \nonce did we ever discuss the long-term effects of Social Security on \nraising the interest rates on securities obligated to the trust fund, \nor to go back and reissue new interest rates on those. That I can tell \nyou never happened. So let us get that very clear.\n  We are not here to box each other around and whack on ourselves. We \nare here to try to get some reason on a very emotional issue which has \na tremendous impact on Social Security. If anybody believes that by \nfiddling with the interest rates on the obligations of Social Security \nto get a short-term result to get something that someone is pledged to \nget, then I want to know where the rest of them are going to be too \nwhen we do another part of the Contract With America which is to not \nback, to expose only 50 percent of Social Security benefits to tax \ninstead of 85 percent, and we will do that too. These are bills that \nnobody will vote against. That is part of the reason they come up. You \ndo not dare vote against this. But I cannot wait for that vote because \nyou know where the money is going to come from when we expose only 50 \npercent of this money, this benefit to tax instead of 85 percent. It \ncomes from part A, the health insurance trust fund. I hope everybody is \nready for that one. That will be contract day at the old ranch.\n  So, I was there. I remember what we did. I am fully aware that we had \nhearings. I am fully aware of what they were about. And I am fully \naware of what this one is about. It was not anything that we talked \nabout or had a single word about in a hearing, especially with regard \nto the interest rate on the bonds. We need to ensure that we do not in \ndoing this take actions that injure the long-term solvency of the U.S. \nSocial Security system, and increasing these interest rates could have \nconsequences of which we have no ability to determine. And we have not \nhad hearings on that issue; period.\n  I have only chaired this subcommittee for several months. If all \nthese things took place before, more power to them. I will get back and \nrattle around in them too. We will all look at them once again. We \ncannot change too much, and then we will go ahead and pass it.\n  And then people between 18 and 45, when they are my age, will look \naround and blink like a frog in a hailstorm, and they will deserve \neverything they get.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to say to the Senator from \nWyoming his point is well made. I apologize for saying that issue was a \nparticular part of this issue, as far as the long-term bonds are \nconcerned, that was brought up. It was not brought up, and he is \nentirely correct. And I apologize for insinuating that aspect of this \nlegislation had been discussed in the past.\n  The point is that this entire issue is very well known. And the point \nis that the Senator from Wyoming knows, as well as I do, that witness \nafter witness testified that, if we lift the earnings test, it will \nresult in a net increase in the Social Security trust fund because \nseniors will work, and seniors will pay more taxes. That is why we have \nin this bill that in 2 years the GAO and the Comptroller General must \nreport as to the actual effects of lifting the earnings test, which, as \nI say to any outside observer, will be an increase in funding.\n  So, if I intimated to the Senator from Wyoming that we had hearings \non the actual aspect of the funding, I apologize, and I understand how \nstrongly he feels about the Social Security issue. We share that \ncombative spirit, and I hope that once this amendment is passed that we \ncan work together in the future to solve the larger problem which the \nSenator from Wyoming articulates in a far more enlightening fashion \nthan anyone I know; and, that is, the problems that face Social \nSecurity in general. And our obligation is not only to represent \ngenerations of retirees but future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, I deeply appreciate those comments of \nmy friend, and they are sincere. I take them that way. I am just glad \nto set that record straight. The Senator from Arizona and I almost have \na signal on this issue. We will sit across the room and suddenly \nsomeone will mention \n\n[[Page S 16589]]\n\nsomething, and we just kind of go into a rigor and a catatonic state. \nThen we usually meet, he looking this way, and me looking this way. And \nI have found in life a very interesting thing; that oftentimes I see \nsomething in someone else that might irritate me. And it is most always \nsomething I do myself, that I do not handle very well in my own daily \ndoings. With John McCain of Arizona, I will just say it takes one to \nknow one. And we do. I commend my friend, and he is going to get a nice \nvote here. And he is going to be tickled to death. There you are.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Wyoming. He adds \nto this body in more ways than I am able to describe, especially not \nthe least of which was his brief recitation of his history of his \nvarious forms of employment.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support raising the Social Security \nearnings limit to allow Social Security beneficiaries now subject to \nthe limit to earn more income. However, I cannot support the motion to \nwaive the budget point of order on the legislation before the Senate \ntoday. Raising the earnings limit will draw increased payments out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. Any measure to raise the earnings limit \nmust pay for that change. The legislation before us does not adequately \nassure that this will be paid for in a manner which will not increase \nthe Federal deficit or in a manner which avoids further cuts in \ncritical education and health programs, including programs for seniors. \nI am hopeful that a better manner of paying for this change will be \ndesigned and that we will raise the Social Security earnings limit. \nThis one falls short.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion by the Senator \nfrom Arizona to waive the point of order. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield], the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], and the Senator from South Carolina \n[Mr. Thurmond] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Thurmond], would vote ``yea.''\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Hatfield] would vote ``nay.''\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, the Senate has spoken at this time. I want \nthe Senate to know that this is an important issue for seniors of \nAmerica. They are tired of this onerous, unfair, and outrageous tax.\n  I am sorry my friends across the aisle did not vote for it. They are \ngoing to have a chance to vote for it next week, the week after and the \nweek after, and seniors will let their views be known, and others \nacross America, as to how outrageous this vote was. I hope they \nunderstand that I am not going to quit on this issue until it is done, \nbecause the seniors of America deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Dole, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16585-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            POSITION ON VOTE\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from the \nSenate today, Thursday, November 2, 1995. During my service in the \nSenate, I have always taken my duty to represent the people of South \nCarolina seriously and have been absent from Senate business only when \nnecessary.\n  With regard to the vote on the motion to waive the Budget Act on S. \n1372, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, I am a strong supporter \nof increasing the earnings test and would have voted in favor of \nwaiving the Budget Act.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I understand and appreciate the \nconcerns of senior citizens about the Social Security earnings limit.\n  In the past, I have supported increasing the earnings limit for \nseniors who need to work, but it must be paid for responsibly. Today's \nproposal raised some questions for me. I was troubled by the effort to \nfurther cut domestic discretionary programs.\n  While cutting domestic discretionary programs sounds simple, cuts of \n$9 billion could hurt West Virginia families and even seniors. Many of \nthese programs that would be reduced under this proposal have already \nbeen cut severely. Plus the list includes fundamental programs for \nseniors themselves, like senior nutrition programs and the Low-Income \nEnergy Assistance Program which helps seniors in West Virginia and \nother northern regions keep the heat on during the winter months. \nCutting these programs could easily hurt the seniors that we say we \nintend to help by raising the earnings limit.\n  Also, as Senator Simpson mentioned in his remarks, it is also \ndifficult to determine what the effect might be of changing interest \npayments to the Social Security trust fund. Senator McCain acknowledged \nthat this aspect of his legislation has not been fully studied, nor was \nit the focus during previous hearings on the overall issue. When it \ncomes to the long-term solvency of the Social Security trust funds, I \nfirmly believe we must be thoughtful and cautious. Seniors depend upon \nSocial Security, and I want to ensure that they can continue to do so \nfor generations.\n  I voted for the point of order against Senator McCain's legislation \nbecause I believe that we must be cautious, consistent, and careful \nwhenever we deal with the Social Security trust fund. Each and every \naspect of this proposal should be fully considered by the Senate \nFinance Committee. We should not rush to judgment. We should not bend \nthe budget rules when it come to Social Security.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me first say I hope the Senator from \nArizona will not be discouraged.\n  I know a few votes would have made a difference, and I think if we \ncan find another way to pay for it, that will pick up additional votes, \nat least on this side, perhaps on the other side.\n  I want to make one announcement and a statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16589-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16589-S16590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I wish to commend the House of \nRepresentatives, which yesterday passed a ban on \n\n[[Page S 16590]]\n\nthe use of partial birth abortions by a margin of 288 to 139.\n  There are many issues which divide reasonable people on both sides of \nthe abortion debate. But use of this procedure, which occurs late in \nthe pregnancy--even in the ninth month--is horrifying to contemplate \nand completely indefensible.\n  I believe that people of good will, whatever their views on abortion \ngenerally, will agree that it is our obligation to act to defend the \ndefenseless in circumstances where we can. This is one of those \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, Senator Smith introduced a similar \nban on the use of partial birth abortions. It was placed on the Senate \ncalendar under Rule XIV. It is my intention to schedule the House-\npassed bill for floor consideration at the earliest possible \nopportunity. I trust the Senate will pass the bill quickly and send it \nto the President for his signature.\n  I have little doubt that certainly the President will sign a bill to \nend this kind of procedure, this kind of practice.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate so we can \nhear what the majority leader is saying? There are too many \nconversations going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will please \ncome to order. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we can no longer ignore the fact that \nteenagers across America are now resorting to illegal drugs in ever-\nincreasing numbers.\n  The most recent national household survey reveals that marijuana use \namong teenagers has nearly doubled since 1992, after 13 years of \ndecline. It also reveals that attitudes toward illegal drug use are \nsoftening; fewer and fewer teenagers now believe that using illegal \ndrugs is an activity that should be avoided.\n  Earlier today, the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug \nEducation [PRIDE], released its own annual survey of drug use by junior \nand senior high school students. According to the survey, not only are \nmore and more high school students smoking marijuana, they are using it \nmore frequently: one-third of high schools seniors smoked marijuana in \nthe past year and more than 20 percent now smoke it on a monthly basis. \nThe survey also shows that teenage use of hard drugs--cocaine and \nhallucinogens--is also on the rise. Since 1991, there has been a 36-\npercent increase in cocaine use by students in grades 9 through 12 and \nuse of hallucinogens has risen a staggering 75 percent since 1988.\n  Tomorrow, we will probably hear some more disturbing news. If \npreliminary reports are correct, the Dawn Survey, conducted by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, will show that emergency-room \nadmissions for drug overdoses are on the increase.\n  Although then-Governor Clinton boasted during the 1992 Democratic \nConvention that President Bush ``hasn't fought a real war on crime and \ndrugs * * * [and] I will,'' his record in office has not matched his \ncampaign rhetoric. Through neglect and mismanagement, bad policy and \nmisplaced priorities, the Clinton administration has transformed the \nwar on drugs into a full-scale retreat.\n  Drug interdiction is down. Drug prosecutions are down. The General \nAccounting Office tells us that the anti-drug effort in the source \ncountries is badly mismanaged. And, perhaps most importantly, the moral \nbully pulpit has been abandoned.\n  Regrettably, the administration's most prominent voice on this issue \nhas been a surgeon general who believes the best way to fight illegal \ndrugs is to legalize them.\n\n  Obviously, we cannot continue down this path. Failing to control \nillegal drug use has real-life consequences that affect not only the \nuser but the rest of society. Drugs and violent crime, for example, are \ninextricably linked. Forty-one percent of all reported AIDS cases are \ndrug-related. Drugs are a major contributor to child abuse. And past \nstudies show that heavy drug-users are twice as likely to be high \nschool drop-outs than those who do not use drugs.\n  So, Mr. President, we must ask ourselves: What can we do to jump-\nstart the fight against drugs?\n  For starters, we must restore the stigma associated with illegal drug \nuse.\n  Those of us in positions of authority--whether it is parents or \nteachers, religious leaders or those who hold elective office--must be \nwilling to repeat over and over again the simple message that using \ndrugs is wrong and that drugs can and do kill.\n  This message has worked before. It was called the Just Say No \ncampaign. Illegal drug use declined dramatically throughout the 1980's \nand early 1990's in large part because our culture stigmatized drugs \nand shamed those who used them. This message got through to millions of \nteenagers and saved thousands of lives in the process.\n  Perhaps one of the best kept secrets is that, between 1980 and 1992, \noverall drug use declined by 50 percent. Cocaine use dropped even \nfurther--by more than 70 percent. These successes were the result of \nmany factors, but perhaps the most important factor was the steady \nantidrug message that came out of Washington and through the media.\n  As Jim Burke, chairman of the Partnership for Drug-Free America, has \nexplained: ``Looking back at the progress made in changing attitudes in \nthe 80's, it is very clear that the media played a very important role \nin shaping children's antidrug attitudes. We need them now to again \nincrease their role in that regard.'' I agree.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today to do my own part, to help raise \npublic awareness about the disturbing increases in teenage drug use. We \nmust say ``enough is enough.'' Our children must understand that using \ndrugs is not only stupid but life-threatening. This is a message that \ncan never be repeated too often.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16589-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16590-S16591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LEGISLATION ON LATE-TERM ABORTIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the remarks of the \nmajority leader in which he stated that next week we will be taking up \nthe ban on late-term abortions. The point I want to make, because he \nreferred to President Clinton, is in a press release that was sent out \nby the White House. It is true that the House did vote yesterday to ban \nlate-term abortions. Unfortunately, they did not allow any amendments \nto the bill. And the bill makes no exceptions for life of the mother, \nfor serious health risks to the mother, or for cases of severe fetal \nabnormalities, such cases where there is such serious abnormalities \nthat organs are outside of the body.\n  The House did not want to have any reasonable amendments on that \nbill. It is a very radical bill, and the President restated his long-\nheld belief that though he does not want to see abortions, he wants \nthem to be legal and rare. But the fact is, in a late-term abortion, \nyou must consider the life and the health of the mother.\n  I feel it is very important that when this bill comes to the U.S. \nSenate, we have an opportunity to know what we are doing. For the first \ntime, the House has made abortion a criminal act. They would put a \ndoctor in jail, even if the doctor acted to save the life of a woman. \nNow, surely, we need to study that.\n  Surely, we should have some hearings in our Judiciary Committee, \nwhere we can bring forward the doctors, where we can bring forward the \nwomen who have gone through this hellish experience. The House makes up \na whole new term for these kinds of abortions. It is not a scientific \nterm. They made it up. I, for one, was not elected to be a doctor. I \nhave great respect for doctors. Many doctors oppose what the House did. \nI certainly was not elected to be God. I do not know how Senators feel, \nbut, for a moment, I would like them to think about if their loving \nwife came home to them and said: We have a horrific situation. If I \ncarry this pregnancy to term, I am going to die. I really think there \nare colleagues on the floor here that never think about this in \npersonal terms.\n  In the House, they did not allow people to vote a moderate approach \nto this issue. I think that is a grave injustice to women in this \ncountry, to families in this country, to doctors in this country, to \ncommon sense in this country. Frankly, it was a grave injustice to the \nMembers of the House, who had no opportunity to vote a moderate vote.\n  Life of the mother. Oh, they say in that bill a doctor could use it \nas a defense. He could go in front of a jury and \n\n[[Page S 16591]]\n\nbeg for forgiveness and say, ``I did it to preserve or protect the life \nof the mother.'' But, my goodness, what are we doing here? Why are we \nso radical when we could craft a bill that would be sensible? I think \nit is all about ideology, about contracts with America; it is not about \nreal people.\n  I say to my friends in the U.S. Senate, if your wife came home to you \nand you were facing losing her, you would say to that doctor, ``Save my \nloving wife.'' You would not want that doctor to be hauled off to jail.\n  I hope this Senate can take a more moderate course. I will stand here \nand fight for that moderate course for as long as it takes, because I \nthink this is a very important issue to real people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16590-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, in the reconciliation bill, the \nRepublicans have extended an open hand to powerful special interests \nand the back of their hand to the American people. Senior citizens, \nstudents, children, and working families will suffer so that the \nprivileged can profit.\n  Republicans are engaged in an unseemly scheme to hide what they are \ndoing from the American people. Their proposals are too harsh and too \nextreme. They cannot stand the light of day--and they know it.\n  The fundamental injustice of the Republican plan is plain. Mr. \nPresident, $270 billion in Medicare cuts that hurt senior citizens are \nbeing used to pay for $245 billion in tax cuts that help the wealthiest \nindividuals and corporations in America.\n  The Republican bills are also loaded with sweetheart deals for \nspecial interests, whose money and clout are being used behind closed \ndoors to subvert the public interest and obtain special favors. The \nsections of the legislation dealing with health care are packed with \npayola for the powerful.\n  The dishonor roll of those who will benefit from the giveaways in \nthis Republican plan reads like a ``Who's Who'' of special interests in \nthe health care industry.\n  The pharmaceutical industry--the most profitable industry in \nAmerica--benefits lavishly from the Republican program. The House bill \nrepeals the requirement that the pharmaceutical industry must give \ndiscounts to Medicaid nursing home patients and to public hospitals and \nother institutions serving the poor. The total cost to the taxpayers \nfrom these giveaways is $1.2 billion a year--close to $10 billion over \nthe life of the legislation.\n  The Democrats in the Finance Committee forced the elimination of this \ngiveaway in the Senate bill, and the amendment, which I intend to offer \nas instructions to the conference, is designed to ensure that it is not \nincluded in the conference report.\n  The American Medical Association also receives lavish benefits in the \nRepublican bill in return for its support of these excessive cuts in \nMedicare. The weakening of the physicians anti-fraud and physicians \nconflict-of-interest rules in the Republican program has been estimated \nby the Congressional Budget Office to cost taxpayers $1.5 billion over \nthe next 7 years.\n  Even more harmful to the Medicare patients is the elimination of \nrestrictions on billing, so that doctors will be able to charge more \nthan Medicare will pay, and collect the difference from senior \ncitizens.\n  Under current law, such billing is prohibited for Medicare patients \nenrolling in private HMOs or competitive medical plans--the only \nprivate plans currently allowed to contract to provide Medicare \nbenefits. The Republican Senate bill eliminates this prohibition for \nHMOs, and for every private plan. When the plan is fully implemented, \nsenior citizens could pay as much as $5 billion more for medical care a \nyear as a result of the elimination of these protections.\n  We had this as an amendment during the time of reconciliation. We \nreceived some assurance that the billing provisions had been addressed, \nthe double-billing provisions would be addressed, then under review of \nthe language of the reconciliation we find that no place in those over-\n1,000 pages could you find the kinds of protections that exist there \nunder the Social Security Act.\n\n  Our amendment directs the conferees to restore the limits on such \nbilling and maintain strong protections against fraud and abuse.\n  Another extreme provision of the House bill is its elimination of all \nthe Federal nursing home standards, a payoff to unscrupulous nursing \nhome operators who seek to profit from the misery of senior citizens \nand the disabled.\n  The Senate amendment adopted last Friday pretends to restore nursing \nhome standards to the Senate bill but, in fact, it leaves a loophole \nwide enough to permit continued abuse of tens of thousands of patients.\n  It allows State waivers that could weaken Federal standards and avoid \nFederal oversight and enforcement. Weakening current Federal standards \nis a giveaway to unscrupulous nursing home operators. This amendment \ninstructs the conferees to maintain the current strict standards.\n  One of the cruel aspects of the Republican proposal is its failure to \nprotect nursing home patients and their relatives from financial abuse.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is expired.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And I extend my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  How would it work around the country if we had 50 different sets of \nstandards, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, for how you would \nmanage the standards set for rest homes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has put his finger on something which is \nbasic to the Republican proposal because you would have 50 different \nstandards for nursing homes in the 50 different States, as you probably \nwould with regard to children and children's coverage, as well as the \ndisabled in various States.\n  Rather than having a national commitment to our seniors that is \nimplicit in the Medicare concept, Medicare is basically an \nunderstanding that as seniors get older their incomes go down and their \nhealth needs go up. That happens to seniors all over this country. \nMedicare recognizes that. What we are doing with the nursing home \nstandards is carving out an area where the Republicans fail to give \ncurrent protections to those senior citizens, but instead, gives \nprotections to the nursing homes--they will be protected.\n  For example, in my State of Massachusetts it costs $39,000 for \nnursing home care. If a senior qualifies for Medicaid--which \neffectively means they have no real further assets other than perhaps a \nvery marginal protection for the spouse which was addressed under a \ndifferent provision--and that individual is in a nursing home, the \nMedicaid payment is a payment in full.\n  Effectively under the Republican program, States may provide only \nabout two-thirds of the Medicaid money to nursing homes. The \nRepublicans are cutting out $180 billion out of Medicaid. We now spend \n$90 billion a year on Medicaid. They are cutting out $180 billion out \nof the program, which is the equivalent of 2 years of the 7, giving \nthat much less money to the States.\n  In my State I can understand the State saying we can only pay, \ninstead of the $39,000, maybe $25,000. What this legislation will say \nis, all right, the nursing home can try to sue that family for \nadditional money--not just the $39,000 but maybe $42,000 or $45,000 --\nand at the same time, the Republicans refuse to put in place the \nnursing home standards. The kind of standards which were developed in \norder to address the kinds of abuses that were so evidenced in the \nhearings which our good friend from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, and others \nwere involved in, in a bipartisan way, in 1987.\n\n[[Page S 16592]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask one additional question of my friend.\n  Is the Senator aware that in 1980, just a few years ago, 40 percent \nof the people who were in convalescent homes were restrained--that is, \nstrapped down with some type of narcotic, or they could not move; is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am aware that it was a practice that was used far more \noften than was necessary. Both the physical restraints and also the \nsedation, as well as the failure of adequate personal hygiene care for \nseniors.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware since the national standards were \nestablished, that figure has dropped dramatically?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is my understanding.\n  The indications are that since the enactment of the 1987 standards, \nthe overall health evaluation of seniors--basically we are talking \nabout parents and grandparents--in nursing homes has substantially--\nsubstantially--improved.\n  That has been referenced during the course of this debate. It has \nnever really been challenged.\n  I think not only have the improvements been affirmed by various \nstudies, but one thing that you cannot evaluate in terms of dollars and \ncents is relieving the families of the anxiety and the concern that \nthey have for their parents. When they visit and see how, in many \ninstances, the parents were treated prior to the 1987 provisions it \ngave them anxieties. At the same time they had those anxieties they \nwere out working, trying to provide for their children all the time \nwhile also worried about their parents.\n  They had some relief from that type of anxiety as a result of those \nstandards, and under the Republican bill those standards have been \naltered or changed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent because of my \ninterruption that the Senator from Massachusetts be allowed to finish \nhis statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Nevada has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican bill also wipes out the \nprotections that have been in Medicaid since 1965 that prevent States \nfrom forcing adult children to pay the cost of their parents' nursing \nhome bill.\n  The Republican bill even lets States put liens on the houses of \nnursing home patients, even if the spouse or children are still living \nthere. Obviously, Republican family values stop at the nursing home \ndoor.\n  The amendment instruction which I will offer with others will \neliminate these indefensible proposals from the bill.\n  What a travesty it is for the Republicans to call this a \nreconciliation bill. The only reconciliation involved is between the \nRepublican majority and their special interest lobbyist friends for \nwhom this bill has become one large feeding trough.\n  Who knows what additional giveaways will be cooked up behind the \nclosed doors of the conference committee? Adoption of the sense of the \nSenate which I will propose at the appropriate time is a needed step to \nexpose those sweetheart deals and eliminate them from the bill. I will \nurge the Senate to adopt it. I wish we had the opportunity to debate \nthis over the course of the week, but we have effectively been denied \nthat opportunity.\n  Mr. President, finally, last week, when I raised the issue of balance \nbilling on the Senate floor, the chairman of the Budget Committee \ncontended that the Senate finance bill preserved this protection in \nMedicare.\n  Let me cite the facts. Section 1876 of the Social Security Act \nclearly prohibits physicians who are part of HMOs or competitive \nmedical plan networks from making any additional charge to enrollees of \nthat organization. This is in the first part of an instruction I will \noffer.\n  It further prohibits charges beyond what Medicare would normally \nallow even for services provided by physicians not part of the network.\n  What does the Republican bill do? First, it establishes a whole new \ncategory of private plans that can contract with Medicare, the Medicare \nChoice plans. The limitations in section 1876 do not apply to these new \nplans. Then it repeals section 1876 effective January 1, 1997, so the \nexisting limitations do not apply to HMOs currently contracting with \nMedicare.\n  You can read all 65 pages of the subtitle of the bill establishing \nMedicare Choice. In fact, you can read all 2,000 pages of the Senate \nbill, and you will not find the applications that are there in section \n1876(j).\n  You will not find them because they are not there. In fact, just to \nmake the intentions of the authors of this program crystal clear, \nsection 189fC(d)(2)(B) of the new Medicare Choice program requires that \nenrollees be notified of their ``liability for payment amounts billed \nin excess of the plan's fee schedule.''\n  The Republicans trumpeted their achievement when they passed this \nbill, but they seem reluctant to go to conference. Do they want to \ndivert public attention from the contents of the bill? What do they \nwant to hide? I can understand their concern. There is much to be \nashamed of in it and nothing to be proud of. It is a cruel and unfair \nbill, it hurts families, senior citizens, and helps only the wealthy \nand the powerful.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this sense of the Senate \nat an appropriate time so the Senate itself can make a judgment as to \nwhether to endorse and support this sense of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16591-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16592-S16593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just join with the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and I am sure the Senator from Arkansas. We \nare ready for the debate. We have some amendments with some \ninstructions to conferees. I do not really understand what the majority \nparty is afraid of. I think we ought to have the debate now.\n  The more I analyze what happened with this reconciliation bill, the \nmore I begin to think about the importance of reform and making this a \npolitical process that is responsive to people in the country. I do not \nmean just the people who are the heavy hitters and the players and the \nbig givers.\n  It is pretty amazing. The pharmaceutical companies come out great, \nthe doctors come out great--though I want to make it clear there are \nmany doctors in my State, I am very proud to say, who do not go along \nat all with these draconian cuts in health care. They know the pain it \nis going to inflict across a broad segment of our population in \nMinnesota.\n  But at the same time as we have some special interests that come out \nof this just doing great, we have a whole lot of people that get hurt. \nI just want to focus on one other part of this amendment, the language \nthat will read that provisions providing greater or lesser Medicaid \nspending in States based upon the votes needed for the passage of \nlegislation rather than the needs of the people of those States, that, \nin fact, this will be eliminated.\n  I, again, refer to the dark of the night, back-room deal sometime \nbetween 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Friday evening, where there was wheeling \nand dealing and Senators in Republican caucus did something like \nleverage votes for money for States, some kind of process like that. \nBecause all of a sudden we saw a dramatic change in the formula of this \namendment. My State of Minnesota wound up with $520 million less \nbetween now and 2002 for medical assistance recipients.\n  In my State of Minnesota, and in every State across the land, when we \ntalk about medical assistance we are talking about senior citizens. \nTwo-thirds of the senior citizens in nursing homes in Minnesota rely on \nmedical assistance. And I would far prefer we get serious about real \nhealth care reform, and having had a dad with Parkinson's and a mother \nwho struggled with that as well, I am all for home-based care. I want \npeople to be able to live at home in as near normal circumstances as \npossible, with dignity. But sometimes, for people, it happens. It \nhappened with my parents, and we did everything we could to keep them \nin their homes, and we did for many \n\n[[Page S 16593]]\n\nyears. The nursing home at the end of their lives became a home away \nfrom home. For God's sake, who makes up those cuts?\n  In my State of Minnesota we are talking about 300,000 children; \n300,000 children. Medical assistance is an important safety net to make \nsure that children receive some health care. As a former teacher, I \nwant to make it clear to my colleagues: students--young students, \nchildren--do not do well in school when they go to school not having \nhad adequate health care. If a child has an abscessed tooth because \nthat child cannot afford dental care, that child is not likely to do \nwell in his or her elementary school class.\n  For people with disabilities, this is an unbelievably important \nissue. It is a life or death issue. Because, for families who want to \nkeep their children at home as opposed to institutionalization, the \nmedical assistance payments are critically important. And, for adults \nwho want to get up in the morning and be able to go to work and own \ntheir own small business, they need medical assistance for a personal \nattendant. That is a life with dignity. That is what medical assistance \nmeans to those people. So when we are talking about a formula and we \nare talking about statistics and we are talking about what happened to \nthe State of Minnesota in the dark of night, Friday evening, we are \ntalking about people's lives.\n  What this part of the amendment is going to say, when we give our \ninstructions to conferees, is that we should undo, reverse those \nprovisions which provided medical assistance spending to States based \nupon the votes needed for the passage of the legislation rather than \nthe needs of the people in those States. I would like to debate that \ntoday, I say to my colleague from Arkansas. I am ready for that debate. \nI am ready for people to tell me who made that decision between 6 p.m. \nand 9 p.m. What committee met in public? Who voted? Who is held \naccountable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I have 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What was the justification? I would like to hear a \ncareful policy justification. But, Mr. President, I will not. Because \nthere is none.\n  I know the pain this inflicts on citizens in my State and I intend to \nfight this all the way until we change this formula. And above and \nbeyond that, I intend to be a part of an effort in this Senate to make \nsure that we do deficit reduction but we do it on the basis of a \nstandard of fairness, not on the basis of responding to the people who \ngive the money and who have the clout and have their way and are not \nasked to tighten their belts. But it is the children, the elderly, \npeople with disabilities, the working families, the people who live in \nthe communities.\n  We are going to change that one way or another. We are going to \nchange that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16592-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16593-S16594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GATT AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on three previous occasions I have come to \nthe floor of the Senate to raise the issue that I wish to discuss \ntoday. Each time, I have laid out the facts of a particular problem--in \nfact, a loophole--which Congress created and which only Congress can \nfix.\n  Left uncorrected, that problem will cost the American consumer and \nthe American taxpayer several billion dollars and will unjustly enrich \na few pharmaceutical companies enjoying undeserved and unintended \nspecial treatment under the GATT treaty.\n  Over the next several days I intend to spend a few minutes to \nhighlight a different and disturbing aspect of this GATT loophole. Let \nme give a brief overview, if I might, for those who may not be quite so \nfamiliar with the issue, despite the recent attention it has received \nin the media.\n  There is a very simple way to describe this issue. It is like a \nperson walking down the sidewalk and finding a wallet. After picking it \nup, he learns it contains $100 and the rightful owner's name. His \nquestion is, ``Do I keep the money or do I return it to its rightful \nowner?''\n  In this case, this money clearly belongs to the American taxpayer and \nAmerican consumer. But the drug companies are saying ``OK, you made a \nmistake. But we want the money and we are going to try to keep it. \nDon't confuse us with the facts.'' That is what this issue is about.\n  I know that these companies have hired a swarm of lobbyists to come \nto Capitol Hill. I know today, in fact, that they are distorting the \ntruth and they are deceiving the public. This issue is all about \nwhether a handful of drug companies will be honest--whether they will \ngive the figurative wallet back to its rightful owner, the American \nconsumer and the American taxpayer.\n  Any fair-minded person will tell you that these drug companies are on \nthe wrong side of this issue. But with billions of dollars at stake, \nhow do you think they have responded? With a multimillion-dollar \nlobbying campaign. They are trying to pocket this undeserved profit.\n  It is difficult to believe the lengths they have gone to. They have \ndistorted the facts. They are deceiving the public, and their \nunvarnished greed is on display for all to see.\n  The only argument they can come up with is, ``Yes, we knew that a \nmistake was made. Yes, we haven't done a thing to deserve these \nbillions of dollars. And yes, we know you are trying to correct this \nmistake. But, hey, this fell into our laps. We're going to do \neverything we possibly can to keep these dollars.''\n  Mr. President, let me weave together the three pieces of this issue. \nIt is pretty simple. I think they lead to a simple conclusion. We need \nto fix this problem, and we will let our colleagues judge for \nthemselves as to whether they agree.\n  The first piece is the loophole itself. When Congress voted on the \nGATT treaty, we did two things. First, we extended all patents from 17 \nyears to 20 years. Second, we stated in that treaty that a generic \ncompany in any industry--not just the drug industry--could market their \nproducts on the 17-year expiration date if they had already made a \nsubstantial investment and were willing to pay a royalty.\n  Why did we do this? We did a favor to patent holders, but in doing \nso, moved the goalposts on generic companies of all kinds. So we \nthought this was a fair deal and a good balance of commercial \ninterests. It made sense and it makes sense today. Everyone bought onto \nit--the automotive companies, the computer companies, the high-tech \ncompanies, and yes, the drug companies.\n  Everyone said this is a fair way to solve this problem. We believed \nit to be fair. And we believed when we voted for the treaty that these \nprovisions covered every person and every product, every company and \nevery industry in the entire country. Everyone had to play by the same \nset of rules.\n  Let me emphasize: everyone includes our U.S. Trade Representative, \nMickey Kantor. He has attested time and again that this was the case. \nLetters from Ambassador Kantor to myself and my colleague, Senator \nChafee, are part of the Record.\n  But Mr. President, we were wrong. We made a mistake and accidentally \nleft the prescription drug industry out of the picture. Today, they get \nthe patent extension of 3 additional years. But the GATT loophole \nshields them from any generic competition whatsoever; in other words, a \nfree ride for an additional 3 years with no competition--a monopoly, \nand exorbitant prices. The rest of us are playing by one set of rules \nwhile these few companies enjoy special treatment because of our \nmistake.\n  That is part 1, Mr. President, and that is the loophole. Part 2 is \nthe windfall.\n  Mr. President, may I ask if there is additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I see no other \nSenator seeking recognition--that my time may be extended for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, part 2 is the windfall itself.\n  Remember: The drug industry is the only industry which enjoys special \nprotection because of this GATT loophole. \n\n[[Page S 16594]]\n\n As a result of that special protection, the American consumer is going \nto pay more for a handful of bestsellilng drugs--in fact, as much as $2 \nbillion to $6 billion more.\n  If we take Zantac, an ulcer drug as well as the world's best-selling \ndrug, for example, a consumer is going to have to pay twice as much for \nZantac.\n  If we take Capoten for hypertension, for example, we are going to be \npaying from 40 to 45 percent more for the next 2 or 3 years for Capoten \nthan we would if we corrected this mistake.\n  Here, for example, is a bottle of Zantac made by Glaxo Welcome. \nTypically, you can go to the retail pharmacy and spend $180 for a 2-\nmonth supply of Zantac. If we simply correct the GATT loophole, we \nwould have a generic drug out there within weeks, and the consumer \ncould be buying this same bottle of Zantac for no more than $90.\n  Mr. President, that is outrageous. We should be embarrassed. We \nshould be embarrassed if we do not correct this horrendous mistake. \nThere is no conceivable reason why we should allow this loophole to \nremain uncorrected.\n  Do you want a second opinion? Ask Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, as well as the Patent and Trademark Office or the Food \nand Drug Administration. Ask the people who know. All of them agree \nthat this provision should be fixed and that this loophole should be \nclosed.\n  The GATT negotiators, Mr. President, the people who personally \nnegotiated the treaty itself and who represented this country in those \ncomplex negotiations, say without question that a mistake was made.\n  Even the drug companies which benefit from our mistake and currently \nenjoy this undeserved profit admit it was all a mistake. In fact, one \nof their spokesmen, upon reading our legislative error--and realizing \nthey had gained a multibillion dollar windfall--said, ``Eureka.''\n  Mr. President, Congress is faced with a choice: Do the right thing, \nfix the legislative error and save the taxpayers and the consumers \nmoney, or cave in to the lobbying and to the deception of several \npharmaceutical companies.\n  Mr. President, that brings us to the third and the last part of the \nequation; that is, the solution. What is the solution?\n  Closing this loophole is very simple. It will not change our patents. \nIt will not violate the sanctity of our patent law. It will not alter \nour trade policy nor the GATT treaty. It simply applies GATT to those \nfree-riding drug companies the same way it applies to every other \ncompany and every other product in America.\n  This amendment would save consumers as much as $6 billion. The \nGovernment would save hundreds of billions of dollars. People are \ntalking about slashing Medicare and Medicaid, and here are billions of \ndollars that we could save if we would just fix a simple mistake.\n  Let me add that this is not a partisan issue. It never has been. I \nhope it will not be. It is about fixing a mistake, saving taxpayer \nmoney, and basically doing the right thing.\n  I know for a fact that many of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat \nalike, support our amendment. I also know that some of my colleagues \nhave come to me in the last 2 or 3 weeks especially, and have said, \n``Gosh, we want to vote with you. But we have a Glaxo factory, or we \nhave a Glaxo office, or we have a Glaxo facility in our State, and we \ndo not know if we can be with you or not.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that they will look at the overall picture. \nThere is only one possible reason to oppose this solution. You have to \nhonestly believe that these companies deserve a multibillion-dollar \nwindfall. I do not. You have to ignore the fact that this was a \nmistake. That is the truth. And you have to believe that the consumers \nshould pay more for those drugs because a legislative drafting error is \na sound basis for public policy.\n  Is that what we believe, Mr. President? I do not believe that is the \ncase in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have summarized the three pieces of this issue: the loophole, the \nwindfall, and the solution. But there is a dark side to this issue, a \nshadow cast by a few companies who will enjoy this multibillion-dollar \nwindfall. They have pulled out the stops. They have hired every \nlobbyist, law firm, and consultant inside and outside the beltway. \nTheir motto is, ``Don't confuse me with the facts, because on this one \nthere's just too much money at stake.''\n  This is how a newspaper headline read just last week: ``Money Greases \nMassive Effort to Protect Glaxo Windfall.''\n  Mr. President, Glaxo is the name of the company with the most at \nstake. They have hired the lawyers, they have hired the lobbyists, and \nthey are here right this minute. They make the No. 1 drug in the world, \nZantac. Last year, they sold $2.2 billion worth of Zantac. Every day \nGlaxo sells $6 million worth of this particular drug. That means the \nwindfall for this single company is absolutely enormous.\n  The amount of money Glaxo has at stake is $3.6 billion.\n  That doesn't include the $300 million for Squibb and the more than \n$100 extra million for Searle.\n  Mr. President, finally, does our proposed amendment violate the \nsanctity of patent rights? Of course, it does not.\n  Here is a letter of September 25, 1995, directed to our friend on the \nother side of the aisle, from Rhode Island, Senator John Chafee. It was \nsigned by Mickey Kantor, our U.S. Trade Representative. It says there \nis no way that it would violate the sanctity of patent rights. Why is \nthis a question at all? Because, with all of the simple facts against \nthem, Glaxo and its cohorts have had to create an issue out of thin air \nto lobby with.\n  Does our amendment curtail research dollars? Certainly not. In the \ncase of Zantac, all of the research on this particular drug was \ncompleted 20 years ago. Glaxo has had a 17-year monopoly to collect a \nfair and deserved return. And does anybody believe Glaxo will commit \nthis money to research? The fact is, the industry still spends more on \nadvertising than it does on research. And when was the last time \nsomeone invested money they don't deserve? Look under Glaxo's mattress \nand look at their campaign donations: that's where this money is going.\n   In fact, a lot of the underlying research on these products was done \nat taxpayer expense, not Glaxo's. We fund the National Institutes of \nHealth. We give the industry generous research and development tax \nwrite-offs. We protect them in Puerto Rico from paying income taxes by \nsection 936 of the Tax Code. And they still charge the American \nconsumer far more than they charge the overseas consumer.\n   And now we are about to allow Glaxo and other companies an \nadditional 3 years' worth of illegitimate monopoly. Remember, we are \ntalking about $6 million a day of competition-free cash on one, single \nproduct. Is that what we are all about in the United States Senate? \nHanding out $3.6 billion in consumers' hardearned money as an \nunjustified bonus?\n  The great Notre Dame football coach, Lou Holtz, formerly coached the \nArkansas Razorbacks. Coach Holtz was known for many things, but one \nthing that is indelible in my mind is his ``do-right'' rule. Coach \nHoltz had a rule that if something was not covered in the rule book or \nif it was a close question or what have you, he would just say, ``Let's \nuse the do-right rule.''\n  Mr. President, I think now is the time for the Senate to adopt a do-\nright rule--to protect the taxpayer and to protect the consumer from an \nunjustified, undeserved windfall for a few pharmaceutical companies.\n  On a few occasions in the near future, I will be discussing this GATT \nloophole again. I hope that my colleagues in this body will help us \ncorrect this absolutely unthinkable situation. I trust they will join \nme in correcting this loophole in the GATT treaty.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I see no others seeking recognition. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I want to welcome President Clinton to \nthe effort to deal with international organized crime. In his recent \nspeech to the United Nations, he noted the rising influence of these \ngroups worldwide and the cost they exact from all nations, costs that \nare borne most heavily by their unfortunate victims. In his remarks he \ncalled for greater international efforts to fight criminal \norganizations. In sounding this theme he is picking up on something \nthat Congress urged the administration to pursue over a year ago in a \nSenate resolution to the 1994 crime bill.\n  Whether it is trafficking in drugs or people. Whether through \nextortion, murder, and corruption. Whether it is the threat of \ntrafficking in chemical, biological, or nuclear agents. Or whether it \nis massive fraud aimed at banks, businesses, and governments, organized \ncriminal groups exact billions of dollars in damage. And the human \ncosts are even greater. The drug-blasted lives, the fear, the \ndistortion of economics, and the erosion of decent government in many \nparts of the world are the product of criminal gangs that have fastened \nonto social life like leeches. These facts have lead a number of \ngovernments to declare criminal organizations to be national security \nthreats. As the crises in Italy and Colombia, the challenges to \ndemocracy in Russia, and brazenness of Mexican Mafias show, no country, \ndeveloped or developing is immune to the cancer of criminal actions.\n  And these groups are developing a global reach. They have become \nmultinational thug empires that will stop at nothing to turn an illegal \nprofit. No single government is able to deal with these groups \nsinglehandedly, not even the United States. That is why the Congress \nhas held numerous hearings in the past several years on the threat from \nthese groups and has called upon the administration to take the problem \nseriously. If we are going to respond to these groups and to their \ncorruption of decent life, we must develop the range of responses that \ncan put these people out of business and in jail.\n  In this regard, we need the intelligence capabilities to target key \ngroups and their leaders. We need to help other countries strengthen \ntheir legal frameworks and their police capabilities to combat \ntransnational criminal groups. We need to tighten up our financial \ncontrol capabilities to prevent these groups from abusing our financial \nand banking systems. And we need international awareness and a common \neffort to bring these thugs to justice. That is why the Congress \nenjoined the administration last year to pursue an international \nconvention that would deny these groups safe havens and the benefits of \ntheir plunder.\n  President Clinton has indicated he believes we face a serious \nchallenge. If he intends to translate his rhetoric into deeds, then he \nwill find support in Congress for his efforts. I hope that we shall see \nserious proposals from the President that will move us down the path of \nmeaningful and sustained action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3044) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate recently received from the \nHouse H.R. 436, the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act. The bill would \namend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA-90. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which has exclusive \njurisdiction over OPA-90, I support the Senate's passage of H.R. 436 by \nunanimous consent without delay.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee at the time \nthe committee reported the bill that became OPA-90, I am well \nacquainted with the statute. As many of us will recall, the Congress \nenacted OPA-90 in the aftermath of the catastrophic Exxon Valdez \noilspill in Prince William Sound, AK.\n  One of the key elements of OPA-90 requires all vessels to demonstrate \na certain minimum level of financial responsibility to cover the costs \nof cleanup and damages in the event of an oil-spill. The intent behind \nthis requirement is to ensure that an entity that discharges oil into \nour natural environment pay for the costs and damages arising from the \nspill--not the U.S. taxpayer. This intent remains sound and should \ncontinue to inform the application of the statute.\n  In passing OPA-90, however, Congress did not intend to abandon the \nuse of common sense. As the act currently stands, there is no \ndistinction made in the financial responsibility requirements for oil-\ncarrying vessels, regardless of the kind of oil being carried. \nTherefore, a vessel carrying sunflower oil is held to the same \nrequirements under OPA-90 as a carrier of deep crude.\n  H.R. 436 simply recognizes that vegetable oils and animal fats are \ndifferent from petroleum oils. Most important, they are different in \nways that make it less likely that a spill of vegetable oil or animal \nfat will cause the same kind of environmental damage as would a \npetroleum oilspill. For example, vegetable oils and animal fats contain \nnone of the toxic components of petroleum oil.\n  This is not to suggest that a spill of vegetable oil or animal fat \nwill have no adverse environmental impacts. Experience has shown to the \ncontrary, especially in the case of the Blue Earth River spill in \nMinnesota in the mid-1960's. Here it is important to note that H.R. 436 \nwould not provide an exemption for carriers of vegetable oil or animal \nfats. They still would be subject to a mandatory minimum financial \nresponsibility requirement under OPA-90.\n  Thus, H.R. 436 will lend more rationality to the application of OPA-\n90 while maintaining the fundamental integrity of the act's purpose and \napproach. I commend my colleagues in the House for recognizing an \nopportunity to improve the implementation of an environmental statute.\n  Finally, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nlet me say that I appreciate the willingness of all Senators to \nexpedite action on this bill. Without unanimous consent, H.R. 436 would \nhave been referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. My \nreview of the bill has convinced me that it is a straightforward, \ncommonsense piece of legislation on which committee hearings are \nunnecessary and to which I can lend my support.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \npassage of H.R. 436, the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act. Passage of \nthis measure is long overdue.\n  The problem this measure would address is how Federal agencies \nregulate the shipment of edible oils, as compared with toxic oils. \nAction is needed because agencies currently do not make a distinction \nbetween these two kinds of oils. Unless we pass H.R. 436, we face a \npotential loss in agricultural exports and diminished farm income.\n  This issue is not new to this body. Last year, I joined Senator Lugar \nand Senator Harkin in sponsoring similar legislation that passed the \nSenate but did not become law.\n  As a result, earlier this year, I joined Senator Lugar and 14 other \nSenators in introducing S. 679, the Senate counterpart to H.R. 436. By \npassing H.R. 436, we immediately can clear this bill for the \nPresident's signature.\n  The bill is simple and very straight-forward. Under H.R. 436, \nregulatory agencies would be required to establish separate standards \ngoverning shipments of edible oilseeds and shipments of toxic oils, \nsuch as petroleum. Presently, Federal agencies enforce the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990 in a manner that treats animal fats and vegetable \noils in the same way as toxic oils.\n  Mr. President, this kind of enforcement was never congressional \nintent. The bill we are considering today would state clearly to \nFederal agencies that edible oils are not to be treated in the same \nmanner as toxic oils. However, let me be clear. Under no circumstance \nwould this bill change the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 as it relates to \ntoxic oils.\n  This bill has strong support. I ask unanimous consent that a list of \norganizations supporting the measure be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Organizations Supporting Animal Fat/ Vegetable Oil Amendment\n\n       American Bakers Association.\n       American Crop Protection Association.\n       American Feed Industry Association.\n       American Frozen Food Institute.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       Beer Institute.\n       Biscuit and Cracker Manufacturers' Association.\n       Chicago Board of Trade.\n       Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n       Corn Refiners Association.\n       Flavor & Extract Manufcturers' Association.\n       Food Industry Environmental Council.\n       Food Marketing Institute.\n       Fragrance Material Association.\n       Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n       Independent Bakers Association.\n       Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils.\n       Intenational Dairy Foods Association.\n       National American Wholesale Grocers Assn.\n       National Association of Margarine Manufacturers.\n       National Broiler Council.\n       National Cattlemen's Association\n       National Confectioners Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council of America.\n       National Cottonseed Products Association.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Fish Meal & Oil Association.\n       National Fisheries Institute.\n       National Food Processors Association.\n       National Grain and Feed Association.\n       National Grain Trade Council.\n       National Industrial Transportation League.\n       National Institute of Oilseed Products.\n       National Oilseed Processors Association.\n       National Pasta Association.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Renderers Association.\n       National Soft Drink Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       National Turkey Federation.\n       North American Export Grain Association.\n       Snack Food Association.\n       U.S. Canola Association.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The need for H.R. 436 is compelling. Without action, we \nare diminishing inadvertently agricultural exports. In addition, \nexisting regulations could have a chilling effect on the development of \nnew crops and new uses of crop production.\n  Farm exports are nearing all time highs. The future for oilseeds is \nequally bright. However, current enforcement of the Oil Pollution Act \nworks against this progress. It has become clearly evident that \nexisting regulations would seriously impact exports of U.S. \nagricultural commodities, especially vegetable oils and animal fats. \nUnless we pass this bill, the U.S. animal fat and vegetable oil \nindustries are faced with lost export sales of more than $125 million. \nIt is a critical time for oilseed crushers, who are operating at peak \ncapacity with the new oilseed crop. Losing export markets could lead to \nan oversupply situation that could cut the \n\n[[Page S 16619]]\n\nvalue of the U.S. soybean crop by more than $1 billion.\n  New crops and new industrial uses for agricultural raw materials mean \ngreater demand for farm commodities. New industrial crops allow farmers \nto diversify their farming systems and income sources, improve crop \nrotations and reduce reliance on government commodity programs.\n  Jobs and income would be generated as new crops are taken from the \nfarm gate to the processors and on to the wholesalers and retailers. \nThe predominant post-farming activity would be in the transportation, \nmanufacturing, distribution and support sectors of farm states.\n  New crops to grow in South Dakota are likely to be edible oilseeds. \nThe most likely candidates are crambe, industrial rapeseed and canola. \nThey could compliment South Dakota's production of sunflowers, which is \na major industry in my state. Production in 1994 was valued at nearly \n$150 million. Most of the sunflower production in South Dakota is for \noil, and at least 40 percent of the sunflower production in South \nDakota is exported.\n  In summary, Mr. President, there is a great need for this bill to \nbecome law. The bill simply would put common sense into existing \nregulations and would help those regulations come into line with \nCongressional intent. And the winners out of all this are our farmers \nand ranchers. I urge passage of H.R. 436.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of \nlegislation to encourage regulatory common sense. Senators Pressler, \nHarkin, and others joined me in introducing the Senate version of the \nEdible Oil Regulatory Reform At (S. 679) on April 5. I am pleased that \nthe House approved its version of this bill (H.R. 436) on October 10, \nand urge my colleagues to support Senate passage.\n  This legislation will correct two problems: First, the regulation of \nedible oils in a manner similar to toxic oils like petroleum, and \nsecond, the requirement that Certifications of financial Responsibility \n[COFR] accompanying vessels carrying edible oils equal those of vessels \ncarrying toxic oils. This bill is similar to legislation which passed \nCongress last year, but was not given final approval.\n  In response to the Exxon Valdez oil-spill in 1990, Congress passed \nthe Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which requires several Federal agencies \nto enhance regulatory activities with regard to the shipping and \nhandling of hazardous oils.\n  In 1993, the Transportation Department proposed regulations to guard \nagainst oil spills, and require response plans if spills did occur. DOT \nproposed to treat vegetable oils--that is, salad oils--in the same way \nas petroleum. Among other things, salad oils would have been officially \ndeclared hazardous materials, with all the regulatory requirements and \nextra costs which that designation entails.\n  This was a classic example of regulatory overreaching. Vegetable oil, \nof course, is different from petroleum. Vegetable oil processors \nthought it entirely appropriate that they undertake response plans to \nguard against major spills.\n  The industry did not argue that they should be example from \nregulation. The industry argue that regulators should take into account \nobvious differences--in toxicity, biodegradability, environmental \npersistence and other factors--between vegetable oils on the one hand, \nand toxic petroleum oils on the other.\n  Secretary Pena eventually agreed with us and prompted modification of \nDOT's position. However, he does not have jurisdiction over all \nagencies with a role in regulating oil spills. More recently, the \nindustry has been working with other agencies which have a role in \nregulating oils and ensuring adequate financial responsibility in the \nevent of a spill.\n  No one is any longer proposing to call salad dressing or mayonnaise \nhazardous material, but agencies are requiring that spill response \nplans for vegetable oils be quite similar to those for petroleum.\n  The most recent problem arose in December, 1994, when Coast Guard \nregulations subjected vessels carrying vegetable oil to the same \nstandard of liability and financial responsibility as supertankers \ncarrying petroleum. On December 28, 1994, the Coast Guard began \nrequiring the same standard--a $1,200 per gross ton or $10 million of \nfinancial responsibility--on vessels carrying vegetable oil and \npetroleum oil in U.S. waters or calling at U.S. ports. On July 1, \nsimilar standards were phased in on barges operating on U.S. navigable \nwaterways.\n\n  Prior to December 28, a COFR requirement of $150 per gross ton \napplied to all vessels regardless of the hazardous nature or toxicity \nof the cargo. The vegetable oil industry does not seek a return to this \nearlier standard, but seeks regulation under a $600 per gross ton COFR \nrequirement that Coast Guard regulations apply to vessels carrying \nother commodities. It is worth noting that this new financial \nresponsibility standard for edible oil would be four times the COFR \nrequired on toxic petroleum oils prior to December 28, 1994.\n  Application of the most stringent standard to vessels carrying \nvegetable oil adds to the cost of transporting U.S. vegetable oil to \nforeign markets. The additional costs of these burdensome regulations \nare passed back to farmers in reduced prices for commodities. Consumers \nmay also bear a burden in higher food prices. In addition, there have \nbeen instances in 1995 where this unjustified additional cost has made \nU.S. vegetable oil uncompetitive and has resulted in lost exports.\n  H.R. 436 would not exempt vegetable oil shipments from COFR \nrequirements or regulation. It would only apply a more appropriate \nstandard of financial responsibility to vegetable oil, similar to that \napplied to vessels carrying other commodities.\n  The scientific data collected to date indicate that the animal fats \nand vegetable oils industry has an excellent spill history justifying \ndifferentiation of these edible materials from toxic oils. \nSpecifically, these products account for less than one half of one \npercent of all oil spills in the U.S. In addition, most spills of these \nproducts are less than 1,000 gallons.\n  The industry seeks a separate category for vegetable oils. This is as \nmuch because of scientific differences in the oils as it is for \neconomic reasons. There is no reason why non-toxic vegetable oils must \nbe in the same category as toxic oils.\n  Second, the industry seeks response requirements that recognize the \ndifferent characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils within this \nseparate category. A separate category without separate response \nrequirements reflecting different toxicity and biodegradability is \nnothing more than a hollow gesture.\n  The Senate and House of Representatives last year passed virtually \nidentical legislation on different legislative vehicles to ensure that \nboth of these objectives are accomplished. Under H.R. 436, the \nunderlying principles of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 would remain \nunchanged with the language to require differentiation of animal fats \nand vegetable oils from other oils. The House approved this language \ntwice last year as part of H.R. 4422 and H.R. 4852. The Senate passed \nthe bill as S. 2559. Since final action on this legislation was not \ncompleted in the last Congress, it is before the Senate again.\n  This bill does not tell the Coast Guard or any other agency what it \nmust put into regulations. The legislation simply says that in \nrulemaking under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, these agencies must differentiate between \nvegetable oils and animal fats on one hand, and other oils including \npetroleum on the other.\n  The bill specifies that the agencies should consider differences in \nthe physical, chemical, biological or other properties and the effects \non human health and the environment effects of these oils.\n  This bill does not exempt vegetable oils from the Oil Pollution Act \nof 1990. It is a modest effort to encourage common sense in an area of \nregulation that has not always been marked by that characteristic. I \nhope my colleagues will support the legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have been able to \nwork out the details on this legislation to clear the way for its \npassage today. It seems that we have been working on this issue for \nquite a long time, and it is gratifying to reach this resolution. \nCertainly this bill will provide a significant measure of regulatory \nrelief to \n\n[[Page S 16620]]\n\nthose in the food and agriculture industry who have been affected by \nthe imposition of regulations on the storage, transportation, and \nhandling of edible oils that are really designed for hazardous \npetroleum oils.\n  Senator Lugar and I introduced legislation to resolve this instance \nof unnecessary regulation a year and a half ago. Unfortunately, we were \nnot able to get the measure passed in the same bill by both the House \nand Senate last fall, although it did pass both houses in different \nbills. I was pleased to join Senator Lugar again this year in \nreintroducing the legislation along with Senator Pressler. I am also \ngrateful for the help provided by Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus in \nworking out modifications to the bill to ensure that it will adequately \naddress the problems we are seeking to solve without potentially \ncreating unintended or unforeseen problems.\n  This legislation is simply designed to bring common sense to Federal \nregulations involving the transportation, handling, and storage of \nedible oils. Common sense tells us regulations pertaining to these \nsubstances need not, and should not, be as stringent as those \napplicable to other oils, such as petroleum oils or other toxic oils, \nwhich pose a far more significant level of health, safety, and \nenvironmental risk in the event of a spill, discharge, or mishandling. \nAnimal fats and vegetable oils are essential components of food \nproducts that we consume every day. The scientific evidence indicates \nthey are not toxic in the environment, are essential nutritional \ncomponents, are biodegradable, and are not persistent in the \nenvironment.\n  Regrettably, a commonsense approach to regulation of animal fats and \nvegetable oils has been more difficult to achieve than one might think, \nas the experience under implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \ndemonstrates. Although some of the problems have been worked out, there \nstill exists in the industry substantial uncertainty whether regulators \nwill properly differentiate edible fats and oils from petroleum and \nother toxic oils. This legislation will resolve the uncertainty and \neliminate the costs associated with this kind of unnecessary \nregulation.\n  The bill will not exempt edible oils from regulation, but will only \nrequire that regulators differentiate animal fats and vegetable oils \nfrom other oils, including petroleum oil, considering differences in \nphysical, chemical, biological, and other properties, and in the \neffects on human health and the environment, of the classes of oils. \nThe bill will do no more than alleviate the substantial threat of \noverregulation of animal fats and vegetable oils in ways that clearly \ncould not have been intended by Congress. It will bring some \nreasonableness and clarity to issues that are now characterized by \nconfusion and uncertainty.\n  Mr. DOLE.

A bill to combat public corruption, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the anti-corruption act of 1995\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Corruption \nAct of 1995, a bill which will strengthen the ability of Federal law \nenforcement officials to combat election fraud and public corruption by \nState and local officials. A few excerpts from recent news articles \nwill demonstrate the need for this bill:\n  The San Diego Union-Tribune writes on October 1 of recent reports,\n\n       [T]hat cats and dogs are on the state's voter rolls, that \n     God is registered to vote in Hollywood, and that a San \n     Francisco man who died in 1982 has consistently voted for the \n     past decade.\n\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports on the same day of the city \ncomptroller who, a few days earlier, pleaded guilty to--\n\n       [I]ncome tax evasion in exchange for dismissal of charges \n     that he conspired with others to defraud voters in the \n     comptroller's election two years ago.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News reports on September 30, of citizens in rural \nCostilla County, CO, who,\n\n       [S]purred an investigation by the state attorney general \n     that led to a raft of indictments and guilty pleas for \n     election fraud [and p]rompted a second investigation by the \n     attorney general that found fraud and embezzlement by county \n     officials.\n\n  The Hartford Courant reports on August 28, of new efforts to combat \nvoter fraud because of irregularities, including,\n\n       [T]wenty-seven felons who voted in 1994 in the race for the \n     2nd District Congressional seat.\n\n  It is no wonder the American people become more disgusted with our \nsystem every day. Allegations of vote buying and cries of ``voting \nirregularities'' pervade every close election.\n  We would like to think that the losing candidates are only motivated \nby sour grapes. But too often, investigations turn up cases where a \ndead, nonetheless patriotic, American manages to roll out of his \neternal slumber to do his or her civic duty before the polls close.\n  Americans' faith is further eroded by daily scandals involving public \nofficials reported in their local paper. This past summer, officials \nformally closed a nearly 5-year corruption investigation that rocked my \nown State of Kentucky. Operation BOPTROT resulted in more than a dozen \nconvictions of State legislators, appointed State officials and \nlobbyists. The BOPTROT sting operation involved bribery and influence \npeddling at the highest level of Kentucky State government. Although \nthe BOPTROT investigation was closed in early August, FBI officials \nmade it clear that the State has not yet been cleansed of public \ncorruption: ``Public corruption remains the FBI's No. 1 priority in \nKentucky,'' according to the lead FBI investigator.\n\n[[Page S 16622]]\n\n  A central problem in preventing corruption in elections and \ngovernment operations is a lack of Federal guidelines defining what is \nillegal. Another problem is the jurisdiction over this illegal \nactivity. This bill I am introducing aims at correcting both of these \nproblems.\n\n  The bill simply states that if anyone engages in any activity to \ndeprive people of the honest services of their public officials, they \nwill be fined and face a possible 10-year sentence in Federal prison. \nThis includes rigging elections, intimidating voters, buying votes, and \nbribing officials.\n  And, this bill makes every act of elections fraud--at every level of \ngovernment--a Federal offense. It gives Federal prosecutors the \njurisdictional authority they need to investigate and prosecute \nentrenched local corruption.\n  We have made dramatic changes to the voter registration laws; while \nit is easier to register and vote, it is also easier to commit election \nfraud. This bill is needed to discourage those who would seek to \ndefraud the government and abuse the public trust.\n  Moreover, as we ask the States to assume more responsibility for \nproviding government services, we must ensure that we possess the tools \nfor weeding out and punishing corrupt practices.\n  The bill also addresses public corruption as it relates to drug \ntrafficking. The facilitation by public officials of drug trafficking \nwould be classified as a class B felony under title 18 of the United \nStates Code.\n  And, anyone attempting to bribe or actually bribing a public official \nfor help in drug trafficking would be guilty of a class B felony.\n  Drug use and drug trafficking are back on the rise. It is a lucrative \nbusiness. Aiding and abetting it can offer a huge stipend to public \nofficials, worth many times their government salaries. This bill would \nmake drug stings sting a lot more--for the pushers and for corrupt \npoliticians.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken out repeatedly over the years on these \nissues and on this specific piece of legislation. In past years, this \nbill, included as an amendment to other pieces of anticrime \nlegislation, has passed the Senate with overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport. But it has never made it to the final conference report.\n  The bill has also had wide support among the U.S. attorneys, who \nwould be on the front lines prosecuting these crimes. In fact, two \nformer U.S. attorneys in Kentucky have endorsed this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letters in support \nof this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Robinson & McElwee,\n\n                                  Lexington, KY, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing in support of the \n     Anti-Corruption Act you are introducing. As you know, \n     Kentucky has been victimized by public corruption at the \n     highest levels of state government. My first-hand experience \n     in Operation BOPTROT, resulting in the conviction of almost \n     two dozen officials, made me aware of the gaps in federal law \n     and jurisdiction over influence peddling and corruption.\n       Your bill would provide federal law enforcement officials \n     with the necessary tools to fight these plagues on the \n     taxpayers. And, it would send a message to public officials \n     everywhere that there will be grave consequences for failing \n     to uphold the public trust.\n       The American people grow more and more cynical about our \n     government and much of the blame can be laid at those who \n     breach the confidence placed in them by the voters. Your bill \n     will help restore the faith citizens should have in our great \n     system.\n       I am confident your bill will be widely supported among \n     your colleagues and I wish you every success in speedy \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karen K. Caldwell.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            Joseph M. Whittle,\n\n                                   Prospect, KY, October 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am pleased to write in support of \n     your Anti-Corruption Act, a bill you have introduced in \n     previous Congresses and which has been adopted by a majority \n     of the Senate.\n       Since the bill addresses election fraud and corruption by \n     government officials, it is of particular importance to \n     Kentucky in view of the 5-year Operation BOPTROT effort. My \n     involvement in Operation BOPTROT made me aware that current \n     federal law is not fully adequate to deal with public \n     corruption. This bill will give federal law enforcement \n     agents the power and authority to vigorously fight election \n     fraud, influence peddling and public corruption.\n       Most of all, your bill will help restore confidence the \n     American people should have in their government and public \n     servants.\n       I wish you success in getting the bill passed. I know it \n     has enjoyed wide support in the past, and I am confident that \n     the bill will continue to have support among your colleagues.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Joseph M. Whittle.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am confident this bill will gain the \nsupport of the Attorney General.\n  I am certain that in our renewed effort to gain the public trust, \nthis legislation will be received with resounding approval. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1378\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make technical amendments to the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n       the fair debt collection practices amendments act of 1995\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation to make technical amendments to the Fair Debt Collections \nPractices Act.\n  The original act was passed in 1977 to stop the abusive debt \ncollection practices of third-party debt collectors. In that regard, it \nhas worked well.\n  Debt collectors were told that if they ran honest, ethical operations \nthey would not have problems with the act--that only the lawless \ncollectors would be penalized. The law-abiding among them would thus \nnot need to worry nor would they have to hire lawyers to interpret the \nact.\n  In that regard, the act may well have reached too far. Certainly, \nunscrupulous collectors have been forced to play by the rules, but may \nlaw-abiding collectors have found themselves unjustly burdened by many \nminor provisions found in the act. There have been hundreds of lawsuits \nbased on technical and totally unintentional violations of the act.\n  We should remember that collection agencies are, in most cases, the \nsmallest of small businesses. Also, some 38 percent are owned or \noperated by women, one of the highest of such percentages in all \nbusiness categories.\n  These companies cannot afford huge legal bills and they certainly \ncannot get free legal representation. Because of the large increase in \nthe number of such lawsuits, many collection agencies have seen huge \nincreases in their insurance premiums.\n  The most distressing result is that small and highly dedicated group \nof attorneys is using the act to extort money from collection agencies. \nFor example, the act has a $1,000 minimum statutory damage provision, \neven for the smallest, technical violation. These attorneys will comb \ncollection files to find the smallest violation and then sue collection \nagencies for the $1,000 amount. The agency is usually forced to pay a \nsettlement because, even if they have done nothing wrong, the legal \nfees required to defend such an action will run many thousands of \ndollars. Some agencies have even set aside money each month to pay off \nthe demands of these lawyers, even though the company knows it has not \nviolated the spirit of the act.\n  Let me cite some examples of ridiculous lawsuits that would be \neliminated under this legislation.\n  A Nevada agency was sued for allegedly violating the prohibition \nagainst third-party contacts after the agency sued the debtor in court \nto obtain a judgment. The consumer attorney felt that communicating \nwith the court was a third-party violation.\n  An agency that collects students loans for the Department of \nEducation was similarly challenged in court. At issue was the language \nused by the agency in its letters as required by the Department. The \nlanguage stated that no legal action is required for the Department to \nenforce an administrative garnishment against a debtor. The attorney \nargued that the notice was deceptive because it did not state that the \ndebtor has a right to a hearing before the garnishment is enforced.\n  What about the collectors who are big enough to fight back? In many \ncases, collection agencies that can afford this costly litigation are \nnot bothered by claimant attorneys. So effectively, the act has served \nto selectively penalize the small collector. To compound confusion, \ndifferent courts have handed down totally contradictory decisions and \nopinions regarding the provisions of the act. Thus we have a Federal \nlaw requiring collectors to follow procedures that vary from State to \nState. The situation has become so confusing that the Federal Trade \nCommission has asked Congress to clarify the opposing court decisions \nand that, in part, is one of the purposes of this legislation.\n  In addition, the bill gets rid of the $1,000 statutory damages \n``carrot'' that has, through its misuse, become a winning lottery \nticket for some lawyers. Certainly a debt collector who wrongfully \ndamages a debtor should be required to pay for those damages--and the \nlegislation will preserve such compensation. A collector will be held \nresponsible for actual damages, but not for an arbitrary standard that \nis not imposed by most other consumer laws.\n\n  Additionally, when Congress passed the Truth in Lending \nSimplification Act in the 1980's, it cleared up a major problem in \nclass action lawsuits by limiting the total damages and number of such \nsuits that could be filed against one defendant. Because of an \noversight, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act was not made part of \nthe legislation and today debt collectors face a legal financial burden \nthat other companies covered by consumer protection enforcement laws \nare protected against. This legislation corrects that oversight.\n  The legislation would allow judges to award defendants the cost of \ntheir actions plus legal fees if one of these suits is brought in bad \nfaith. Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would now apply \nto lawsuits associated with the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. \nUnder that standard, when a defendant offers a settlement and the \nplaintiff refuses, if the ultimate court award is equal to or less than \nsuch an offer, the plaintiff has to pay the defendant's legal costs. \nThis rule has worked well and should help end technical lawsuits.\n  Collectors are also being attacked by another class of attorneys--\ndistrict or county attorneys who are setting up ``for profit,'' \ncollection agencies that compete directly with private enterprise. \nUnder a very narrow reading of the act, these State and local officials \ncontend they are not covered by the legislation. In some areas, these \npublic officials are telling merchants that they will not accept debts \nfor collection if they have previously been turned over to a private \ncollection agency. At present, the local government collection agencies \nare only collecting bad checks but they may well branch into other \ncollection fields. Do not be fooled. These public officials are not \ncollecting bad checks as part of their government function. No, only \nmerchants who join the program can get this type of law enforcement. \nIndividuals who have received bad checks cannot use the service. This \namounts to law enforcement judged by the size of your wallet.\n  This legislation would still allow local officials to operate such \ncollection activities but they would have to comply with the Fair Debt \nCollections Practices Act. No longer would such operations be able to \ncharge a consumer $120 for a $5 returned check as has happened in some \ncases.\n  The legislation does not remove any of the other basic consumer \nsafeguards that are in the act. Still in place are the restrictions \nagainst harassment by collectors, calls in the middle of the night, \ninforming employers about debts and the all important safeguard that \nmakes it illegal for a collector to do anything in a deceptive manner.\n  Mr. President, the amount of debt owed to American businesses that \ngoes unpaid is skyrocketing. In the latest figures available, 226.2 \nmillion accounts totaling $79 billion were turned over to third-party \ncollection agencies in 1993. It is estimated that bad debt cases cost \nevery man, woman, and child in America $250 per year. That means that a \nfamily of four will pay $1,000 more for goods and services during each \nyear. The figures for bad checks are even more staggering. On average, \nAmericans write more than 1.5 million checks a day that are \nsubsequently dishonored by U.S. banks.\n  In 1992 some 533 million checks totaling $16 billion were returned to \nU.S. banks. Projections for 1995 estimate that 619 million checks will \n``bounce.'' By the year 200 the estimate is that 731 million will be \nreturned. Our Nation's economy can't afford such losses and businesses \ndeserve the services of an affordable collection industry that is not \nbogged down by the technical and nuisance lawsuits.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1380. A bill to require forfeiture of counterfeit access devices, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         forfeiture legislation\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nclose a \n\n[[Page S 16625]]\n\nloophole which has proven to be a bonus to counterfeiters and a \ndetriment to law enforcement. Simply stated, this legislation allows \nequipment used to counterfeit access devices to be treated like any \nother contraband and forfeited.\n  Currently under law, certain items are designated as contraband. \nNarcotics, illegal firearms, and counterfeit currency often come to \nmind when the issue of contraband is raised. Contraband also includes \nproperty designed or intended as the means of committing a criminal \noffense. Since narcotics are contraband, illegal drugs can be seized \nfrom a suspected drug dealer, as well as the vehicle in which the drug \ntransaction occurred.\n  This bill would allow counterfeit access devices to be treated as \ncontraband. Access devices are the means in which the account owner can \naccess his or her own account, including credit cards and cellular \nphones. Counterfeiters can gain entry to this account and, in a matter \nof minutes, reach the owner's cash or use the owner's service. \nCriminals who perpetuate credit card fraud use equipment, such as an \nembosser and encoder, to imprint new numbers onto a piece of plastic. \nThey are then able to use the credit cards to the limit for cash \nwithdrawal using a valid credit card number. In telecommunications \nfraud, the offender can use an electronic serial number reader [ESN] to \nattract cellular phone numbers and store them for unauthorized use. By \nusing a computer and a device called an E-chip, the offender can \nreprogram any cellular phone to call on another person's bill. Once the \nlegitimate owner of the stolen cellular phone number realizes that \ntheir phone has been used by a criminal, the criminal is using another \ninnocent owner's cellular number.\n  Law enforcement agencies do all they can to catch the offenders. The \nNew York Times reported on an imaginative operation devised by the U.S. \nSecret Service to find perpetrators of cellular phone fraud, through \nthe use of a computer bulletin board. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of this article be included in the Record, Mr. President, and I \nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secret Service \nfor working to end fraud on this and other fronts.\n  The problem, however, is that when the perpetrators of credit card \nand cellular phone fraud are apprehended, and even convicted, the \nequipment used by the offenders is often returned to them after their \nsentence is served! Although this process seems preposterous, it is \nreal. A credit card counterfeiter frequently receives his or her \nembosser and encoder once released from custody. The apparatus used to \ncommit the cellular phone theft of services is also frequently remitted \nto the user, even if he or she was convicted. With their equipment \nintact, they are ready to commit fraud again if they so desire. The \nproblem of counterfeit access devices costs the cellular phone \ncompanies and the banks billions of dollars every year. These costs get \npassed on to the customer.\n  Remittance of equipment used in counterfeiting access devices is \ncertainly not the intent of law enforcement or prosecutors. These \ndedicated officials work tirelessly to do the right thing. Why is it \nthat the devices are not forfeited? It is simply because the law has \nnot been updated to keep up with technology.\n  The process is already in place for other contraband, such as \nnarcotics, counterfeit currency and illegal firearms. It should not be \ntoo much of a stretch to extend the same procedures and safeguards that \nare available for these contrabands to counterfeit credit cards and \ncloned cellular phones.\n  This legislation will not end the counterfeiting of access devices \nbut it will end the practice of returning tools to those who may use it \nfor illicit purposes.

Levy)\n\n       It was a classic sting operation, the kind of undercover \n     gambit that has nabbed bad guys for decades: Federal agents \n     disguised as big-time thieves set up shop and put the word \n     out on the street that they were eager for business. Soon \n     shifty characters were stopping by, officials said, peddling \n     stolen goods that were worth millions of dollars.\n       But as the agents revealed yesterday, the meeting place for \n     this subterfuge was not some grimy storefront. It was a \n     computer bulletin board that the United States Secret Service \n     has rigged together to troll for people who are illegally \n     trafficking in the codes that program cellular phones.\n       The ``computer service,'' which led to the arrests of at \n     least six suspected hackers and the possibility of more, is \n     the latest indication that law enforcement agencies are being \n     forced to try novel strategies to keep up with the startling \n     growth in computer-assisted crime. Cellular-phone fraud alone \n     cost companies $482 million last year, the cellular-phone \n     industry estimates.\n       According to the criminal complaint in the case, a Secret \n     Service agent used the Internet, the global computer network, \n     to announce that the bulletin board catered to those involved \n     in breaking into computers and in cellular-phone and credit-\n     card fraud.\n       ``People all over the country responded,'' said Peter A. \n     Cavicchia 2d, the special agent in charge of the Newark \n     office of the Secret Service, which ran the investigation. \n     ``They felt they could do this with impunity.''\n       The Secret Service, which is the Federal agency charged \n     with going after cellular phone and credit card fraud, has \n     long been known to monitor commercial computer on-line \n     services like Prodigy and America Online, as well as smaller, \n     private computer bulletin boards, for illegal activities.\n       But officials said this case represented the first time \n     that the Secret Service had created an entirely new computer \n     bulletin board, which is basically a system that links \n     different computer users, allowing them to chat with and \n     leave messages for each other. There have been a few \n     instances of other law enforcement agencies creating bulletin \n     boards for investigations.\n       ``If they are selling the stuff in cyberspace, law \n     enforcement has to be willing to go there,'' said Donna \n     Krappa, an assistant United States Attorney in Newark, who \n     is on the team prosecuting the case. ``And the way to do \n     that is to have a fence in cyberspace.''\n       As Federal law enforcement officials detailed it, the \n     investigation unfolded much like a traditional sting that \n     draws in people hawking stolen televisions, jewelry or cars. \n     The agents made contact with the suspects, then worked to \n     gain their confidence and allay their suspicions.\n       The difference, of course, was that most of these \n     discussions were conducted with computers talking over \n     telephone lines.\n       Last January, a Secret Service special agent, Stacey \n     Bauerschmidt, using the computer nickname Carder One, \n     established a computer bulletin board that she called Celco \n     51.\n       It is relatively easy to put together a private computer \n     bulletin board, requiring only a computer, a modem, phone \n     lines and communications software. Special Agent Bauerschmidt \n     was assisted by an informer with experience as a computer \n     hacker, officials said. The equipment and phone line for the \n     scheme were located in a Bergen County, N.J., apartment \n     building.\n       After buying hundreds of the stolen phone codes, the Secret \n     Service conducted raids in several states late last week, \n     arresting the six people and seizing more than 20 computer \n     systems, as well as equipment for making cellular phones \n     operate with stolen codes, said the United States Attorney in \n     Newark, Faith S. Hochberg.\n       Officials said that of those arrested, two of them, Richard \n     Lacap of Katy, Tex., and Kevin Watkins of Houston, were \n     particularly sophisticated because they actually broke into \n     the computer systems of cellular phone companies to obtain \n     the codes.\n       It is more common for thieves to steal the codes by using \n     scanners that intercept the signals that the phones send when \n     making calls.\n       ``We consider this to be one of the most significant of the \n     wireless fraud busts that have come down so far,'' said \n     Michael T. Houghton, a spokesman for the Cellular \n     Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade group. \n     ``These guys took it another degree.''\n       The others arrested were identified as Jeremy Cushing of \n     Huntington Beach, Calif., Al Bradford of Detroit, and Frank \n     Natoli and Michael Clarkson, both of Brooklyn.\n                                 ______\n\n                                 \n[[Page S 16626]]\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1381. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals who are involuntarily unemployed to withdraw funds from \nindividual retirement accounts and other qualified retirement plans \nwithout incurring a tax penalty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               individual retirement accounts legislation\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to allow persons who are involuntarily unemployed to \nwithdraw funds from individual retirement accounts [IRAs] and other \nretirement plans, without the tax penalty that would otherwise apply.\n  Mr. President, over 7.5 million people were unemployed in September, \nwhich translates to an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent. Many of the \nunemployed will find themselves with no income, substantial fixed \nexpenses, and severely impaired ability to make ends meet.\n  In most cases, these Americans have been laid off not because they \nare poor workers, or because they do not try hard enough. They are \nsimply the innocent victims of corporate down-sizing, or other forces \nlarger than themselves.\n  For those unlucky enough to be laid off when business slows, the \nexperience is often traumatic. There is a sense of rejection and \nbetrayal. There is anger. And perhaps most importantly, there is fear--\nfear for oneself, and for one's family.\n  The fear is understandable. While their short-term employment \nprospects are often bleak, the unemployed face enormous financial \npressures. As mortgages and rent payments come due, and bills pile up, \nmillions of American families find themselves trapped by high fixed \nexpenses, and without a paycheck to make ends meet.\n  Unemployment insurance can help, but it often falls far short of \nfamilies' real needs, particularly in areas like my home State of New \nJersey, where the costs of housing and other basic necessities are \nunusually high. Even if a family manages to survive on unemployment \ncompensation, there may not be enough to overcome joblessness by \nrelocating, or training for a new job. Compounding matters, the \nbenefits of the long-term unemployed often expire.\n  Yet in many cases, Mr. President, the unemployed do have their own \nsavings in an IRA or other retirement plan. These savings can provide a \nfinancial life raft to get through this unexpected financial storm. \nUnfortunately, it is a life raft with a large hole, because, for those \nunder age 59\\1/2\\, withdrawals generally trigger a stiff, 10-percent \ntax penalty.\n  Mr. President, Americans do not believe in hitting people when they \nare down. And I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with \nimposing a heavy penalty on those who want to gain access to their own \nmoney to cope with unemployment.\n  The bill I am introducing proposes to eliminate the 10-percent \npenalty for people who have been laid off and who are trying to find \nwork. It is targeted to people who need it--those who have been \neligible for unemployment compensation for at least 30 days.\n  I think that is only fair.\n  Mr. President, while the bill's primary purpose is to provide relief \nto the unemployed, it would also provide at least two additional \nbenefits.\n  First, it should increase the savings rate, by encouraging Americans \nto participate in IRA's and other retirement plans. Currently, many \npeople, particularly young people, are reluctant to tie up their money \nfor decades in a retirement plan. They're concerned, understandably, \nthat their savings would be inaccessible in an emergency, such as an \nunexpected period of unemployment, without the imposition of a heavy \npenalty.\n  Allowing greater flexibility during periods of involuntary \nunemployment, Mr. President, should reduce this concern, and that \nshould lead to increased savings.\n  The bill also should provide another indirect benefit. By unlocking \nsavings and injecting money into the economy during periods of high \nunemployment, the legislation would provide a modest countercyclical \nstimulus. This would help revive a slow economy to the benefit of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, the concept of allowing early withdrawals from \nretirement plans for specific compelling reasons is not new. In fact, I \nfirst introduced this proposal a few years ago, and it has been \nincluded in previous legislation adopted by the Senate.\n  In sum, Mr. President, this bill would provide relief to the \nunemployed, increase our Nation's savings rate, and provide an \nautomatic stimulus to the economy during slow periods.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY DURING \n                   PERIODS OF INVOLUNTARY UNEMPLOYMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 72(t) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exceptions to 10-\n     percent additional tax on early distributions from qualified \n     plans) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Distributions for persons who are involuntarily \n     unemployed.--Any distributions which are made during any \n     applicable involuntary unemployment period.

Mr. President, today I am introducing separate \nbills to provide certificates of documentation for the vessels \nWestfjord and God's Grace II.\n  The Westfjord, hull number X-53-109, is a 53' Chris Craft \nrecreational vessel owned by Gary and Neoma Scheff of Craig, AK. It was \nbuilt in Algonac, MI in 1954. Because records of the vessel have been \nlost, it has been determined to be ineligible to be documented for use \nin the coastwise trade. The Scheffs intend to use the vessel as a \ncharter vessel.\n  The God's Grace II, Alaska registration number AK5916B, is a 32' \ncommercial fishing vessel owned by Winston Gillies of Kenai, AK. It was \nbuilt in North Vancouver, BC in 1965. The vessel was originally built \nfor one of the Kenai packing companies and has been used for fishing \noff Alaska for 30 years.\n  Because the God's Grace II is less than 5 gross tons, Mr. Gillies has \nbeen able to operate the vessel in the coastwise trade without \ndocumentation. Mr. Gillies would now like to extend the boat to 36' in \norder to be able to fish in the Class C, 35- to 60-foot, category of \nthe halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota [IFQ] program. If he \nextends the vessel, the vessel will exceed 5 tons and he will be \nrequired to have documentation.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that these two bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United State Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, \n     1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsements for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel Westfjord (Hull number X53-109).\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  \n[[Page S 16627]]\n\n\n                                S. 1384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsements for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel God's Grace II (Alaska registration number \n     AK5916B).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1385. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of periodic colorectal screening services under \npart B of the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the colorectal cancer screening act of 1995\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce a measure that I \nbelieve should garner widespread support in both parties. The \nColorectal Cancer Screening Act of 1995 would provide screening under \nMedicare for the third most prevalent type of cancer, cancer of the \ncolon and rectum, which will strike 138,200 Americans this year. The \nbill would provide screening in a cost-effective manner which would \nensure that doctors and their patients, not the Federal Government, \ndecide which of the several recommended screening procedures are used. \nI am joined by Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Kerrey, Daschle, and Hollings.\n  Let me share with you some of the frightening facts about colorectal \ncancer. According to the American Cancer Society, 55,300 Americans will \ndie this year from this disease. Of the 138,200 new cases that will be \nreported, about half will be among men--70,700--and half among women--\n67,500. Only lung and prostate cancer attack more Americans. In my own \nState of Louisiana, 2,000 citizens will get this type of cancer this \nyear.\n  As with most cancers, early detection is key to surviving colorectal \ncancer. About 90 percent of colorectal cancer victims whose cancer is \ndetected in an early localized stage survive beyond 5 years. That \nnumber drops to between 50 and 60 percent when the cancer has spread \nregionally and to less than 10 percent when it has spread more widely.\n  Mr. President, colorectal cancer is a major cost to the Medicare \nProgram. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 168,000 seniors \nwere hospitalized with colon or rectum cancer in 1991--the most recent \nyear for which data is available. The average hospital stay for these \npatients was 16 days.\n  While private health plans are beginning to provide coverage for \ncolorectal cancer screening, Medicare--which serves older Americans who \nare most at risk--does not. According to a report from the \nCongressional Officer of Technology Assessment released earlier this \nyear, screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than many \nof the other procedures the Medicare Program already covers. Screening \nprovides benefits at a cost of about $13,000 per life-year saved, \nversus $40,000 to $50,000 per life-year saved for some preventive and \nother services that Medicare already covers. At a time when we are \nlooking for ways to control the overall cost of the Medicare Program, \nwe must continue our efforts to use those limited funds in ways that \nare cost-effective.\n  Mr. President, I know that other Members of this body have introduced \na bill to provide for colorectal cancer screening. This measure differs \nfrom theirs in only a few ways. First, this bill is not procedure-\nspecific. It would provide Medicare coverage for all of the colon \ncancer screening recommended by the American College of Physicians and \nwhich the Office of Technology Assessment found to be cost-effective. \nSecond, the would allow the Secretary to add new procedures once they \nare developed. This is critically important to encouraging innovation \nand research in this area. As a number of medical companies have \nexplained in recent correspondence, legislation that ``limits Medicare \nreimbursement to only a few of the current screening technologies does \nnot allow for the development and diffusion of new medical procedures \nwhich might ultimately prove more effective and cost-efficient in the \ndetection of colorectal cancer.'' Mr. President, I believe Medicare \nshould cover all types of recommended screening and let the patient and \nhis doctor, not the Federal Government, decide which one is \nappropriate.\n\n  This bill would follow the guidelines approved by the American \nCollege of Physicians on April 23, 1990, which read as follows:\n\n       Recommendations:\n       1. Screening with fecal occult blood tests is recommended \n     annually for individuals age 50 and older.\n       2. Screening with sigmoidoscopy is recommended every 3-5 \n     years or with air-contrast barium enema every 5 years for \n     individuals age 50 or older.\n       3. For individuals age 40 and older who have familial \n     polyposis coli, inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of \n     colon cancer in a first degree relative, i.e., parent or \n     sibling, screening with air-contrast barium enema or \n     colonoscopy in addition to annual fecal occult blood tests, \n     is recommended every 3-5 years.\n\n  For individuals over the age of 50 who are on Medicare and at average \nrisk of colorectal cancer, this bill would allow payment for: every 12 \nmonths, a fecal blood test; and every 5 years, a sigmoidoscopy, barium \nenema, or other procedure approved by the Secretary. For individuals at \nhigh risk of colorectal cancer, the bill would allow Medicare \nreimbursement for: every 12 months, a fecal blood test; and every 2 \nyears, a colonoscopy, barium enema, or other procedure approved by the \nSecretary.\n  Here's how the American Cancer Society described these different \nprocedures in its 1995 Cancer Facts and Figures report:\n\n       The stool blood test is a simple method to test feces for \n     hidden blood. The specimen is obtained by the patient at home \n     and returned to the physician's office, a hospital, or a \n     clinic for analysis. The Society recommends annual testing \n     after age 50.\n       In proctosigmoidoscopy, the physician uses a hollow lighted \n     tube or a fiberoptic sigmoidoscope to inspect the rectum and \n     lower colon. To detect cancers higher in the colon, longer, \n     flexible instruments are used. The American Cancer Society \n     recommends sigmoidoscopy, preferably flexible, every 3 to 5 \n     years after age 50.\n       If any of these tests reveal possible problems, more \n     extensive studies, such as colonoscopy (examination of the \n     entire colon) and barium enema (an x-ray procedure in which \n     the intestines are viewed), may be needed.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are to provide screening for colorectal cancer, \nwhich I believe is desperately needed, we should allow all types of \nprocedures recommended by the American College of Physicians and \ndescribed by the American Cancer Society. This bill would do just that. \nI know that other Members of this body have indicated their support for \ncolorectal cancer screening under Medicare. My hope is that we can all \njoin together on a proposal that will give seniors and their doctors \nthe maximum choice and protection from this dreaded disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Colorectal Cancer \nScreening Act of 1995 and the recommendations from the American College \nof Physicians on screening for colorectal cancer be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Progression \n     from adenoma to invasive cancer takes about five years.\n       Colorectal cancer accounts for 150,000 new cases each year \n     and 61,000 deaths. It is the second most common form of \n     cancer in the US. On the average, it deprives patients of \n     nearly 10 percent of their expected life span.\n       Risk factors for colorectal cancer include inflammatory \n     bowel disease, familial ployposis syndromes, family history, \n     and a previous history of noeplasms. A diagnosis of familial \n     polyposis syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease requires \n     monitoring.\n\n\n                           Screening Test(s)\n\n       Several tests and procedures have been proposed for \n     colorectal cancer screening; the most common are digital \n     examination, fecal occult blood tests (FOBT), and \n     sigmoidoscopy. Air-contrast barium enemas and colonoscopy \n     have been proposed for screening individuals at high risk of \n     developing colorectal cancer.\n       The digital rectal examination entails a manual exploration \n     of the rectum.\n       Fecal occult blood tests entail smearing a stool specimen \n     on a slide and submitting the specimen for analysis. \n     Recommended practice is to take two samples on each of three \n     consecutive days, while on a diet designed to reduce the \n     frequency of false positives.\n       Sigmoidosocpy is the inspection of the interior of the \n     colon through an endoscope inserted via the rectum. \n     Sigmoidolscopes vary in length and may be rigid or flexible. \n     When available, use of a flexible scope is preferred; \n     otherwise, a rigid scope is acceptable.\n       Air-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy allow the \n     inspection of the entire colon. The former involves the \n     administration of barium into the rectum, followed by x-ray \n     study of the entire intestine; the latter introduction of a \n     fiberoptic instrument.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n       1. Screening with fecal occult blood tests is recommend \n     annually for individual age 50 and older.\n     \n[[Page S 16629]]\n\n       2. Screening with sigmoiodoscopy is recommended every 3-5 \n     years or with air-contrast barium enema every 5 years for \n     individuals age 50 and older.\n       3. For individuals age 40 and older who have familial \n     polyposis coli, inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of \n     colon cancer in a first degree relative, i.e., parent or \n     sibling, screening with air-contrast barium enema or \n     colonoscopy in addition to annual fecal occult blood tests, \n     is recommended every 3-5 years.\n\n\n                               Rationale\n\n       Although there is little direct evidence of the \n     effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening, there is \n     indirect evidence, based on the natural history of the \n     disease and the effectiveness of screening tests, that \n     screening should reduce colorectal cancer incidence and \n     mortality.\n       Risks associated with colorectal cancer screening include \n     perforations from sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and barium enema \n     and the extensive diagnostic tests associated with false-\n     positive results of fecal occult blood testing.\n       Individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer due to \n     familial polyposis coli or inflammatory bowel disease, a \n     history of colorectal cancer in a first degree relative \n     should be encouraged to have a complete examination of the \n     colon. Factors influencing the choice between air contrast \n     barium enema and colonoscopy include cost and access to \n     qualified physicians able to perform safe and accurate \n     studies.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NUNN:\n  S. 1387. A bill to provide for innovative approaches for \nhomeownership opportunity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n       the homesteading and neighborhood restoration act of 1995\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of our Nation's \nmost critical problems--the lack of affordable housing for low income \npeople. As my colleagues know, housing is one of the most basic human \nneeds. Lack of it is a problem which plagues every State, in both urban \nand rural areas. Today I would like to remind my colleagues of an \norganization founded on the belief that this is unacceptable. This \norganization is Habitat for Humanity International.\n  Habitat is a nonprofit, ecumenical Christian housing ministry founded \nin 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller and based in Americus, GA. Its \nambitious goal is nothing less than to eliminate poverty housing and \nhomelessness from the world. Since 1976, Habitat has constructed 40,000 \nhomes worldwide, in every U.S. State and in 45 other countries. As a \nresult of Habitat's efforts, a quarter of a million people worldwide \nare living in safe, decent, and affordable housing.\n  Though Habitat has chapters all over the globe, its work is done on a \ntruly grass roots, individual basis. Through volunteer labor and tax \ndeductible donations of money and materials, Habitat joins with the \npartner family to build or rehabilitate a house. Habitat houses are \nthen sold to partner families at no profit, financed with affordable \nloans with no interest. The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments go \ninto a revolving fund which finances the building of more houses.\n  As the numbers I mentioned a moment ago demonstrate, this has been a \nfantastically successful concept. In my view, though, the idea at the \nheart of Habitat's success is the idea of ``sweat equity.'' Part of the \ndeal presented to a potential homeowner is that they must contribute \ntheir own hard work and sweat to the construction of their home and the \nhomes of others. In this way, the family builds a tangible bond to the \nfinished product, and therefore has a strong interest in maintaining \nit. In addition, the contribution of sweat equity leads new homeowners \nto a stronger sense of community responsibility--contributing to the \ndecency and safety of their street and neighborhood.\n  In this way, Habitat not only builds new homes, it also helps rebuild \nthe internal sense of community that has declined in our Nation. By \ngiving families a home--not a handout from a faceless Government \nbureaucrat, not a benefit check, but an opportunity to dedicate their \nhard work to owning their own home--Habitat helps to combat the despair \nand apathy evident in so many of our communities.\n  For these reasons, I am introducing today the Homesteading and \nNeighborhood Restoration Act of 1995. This legislation, which is \nsupported by such diverse interests as former President Carter, Speaker \nGingrich, and HUD Secretary Cisneros, directs the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development to reprogram $50 million in existing HUD funds \ninto a grant program for Habitat for Humanity and other low cost \nhousing organizations. In keeping with Habitat's policy of refusing to \naccept Government funds for actual construction work on dwellings, the \nfunds could only be used for land acquisition or infrastructure \nimprovements, and only in the United States. The bill directs that half \nof the reprogrammed dollars would be granted to Habitat, and the other \nhalf would be held in reserve for other similar organizations to \ncompete for. Any funds not claimed by qualified organizations would be \ngranted to Habitat.\n  My estimates indicate that the funds included in this legislation \nwould allow Habitat to begin construction on 5,000 new dwellings across \nthe Nation immediately. Additionally, as new homeowners begin to pay \nback their loans, the money would be recycled to build even more homes.\n  So many times we in Congress must allocate Government dollars based \non a sense of trust--with very little assurance that the taxpayers' \nfunds will actually yield any results at all. Thankfully, this \nlegislation does not necessitate Congress taking such a leap of faith. \nThe successes of Habitat for Humanity are standing already in brick and \nmortar in 40,000 places around the world. This legislation will enable \nthem to expand their successes to many more locations. This is a \nprivate initiative that really works, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Johnston):\n  S.J. Res. 42. A joint resolution designating the Civil War Center at \nLouisiana State University as the U.S. Civil War Center, making the \ncenter the flagship institution for planning the sesquicentennial \ncommemoration of the Civil War, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 u.s. civil war center joint resolution\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I am introducing a joint \nresolution on behalf of myself and Senator Johnston to designate the \nU.S. Civil War Center as the flagship institution charged with planning \nand facilitating the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War in \n2011.\n  While the date may still seem far off, it is important to remember \nthat this will be a particularly important anniversary as it will be \nthe last opportunity for most of us to commemorate the Civil War. The \nCivil War Center at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA, \noffers the most appropriate setting for the organization of this \nremembrance. There is no other center in the United States that \ncurrently studies the war from the perspective of every conceivable \ndiscipline, profession, and occupation. The center will be able to \ncoordinate with the numerous Civil War commemorative organizations \nthroughout the Nation. Funding for the activities throughout the \nsesquicentennial will come from private donations and grants.\n  Since the end of the commemoration of the centennial of the war in \n1965, the United States has come a long way toward healing some of the \nlingering wounds of the war. Recent events have emphasized that many of \nthem still must be addressed, as racism, violence, and regional \neconomics remain problems in our united Nation. If we are to continue \nto learn from our differences, the commemoration of the \nsesquicentennial offers the opportunity to reflect on where we once \nwere and where we will next go.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the designation of the U.S. Civil \nWar Center as the flagship institution for the sesquicentennial.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution and the letter of support from the center's advisory board \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 42\n\n       Whereas the sesquicentennial of the beginning of the Civil \n     War will occur in the year 2011;\n       Whereas the sesquicentennial will be the last significant \n     opportunity for most Americans alive in the year 2011 to \n     recall and commemorate the Civil War;\n       Whereas the Civil War Center at Louisiana State University \n     in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, \n\n[[Page S 16630]]\n\n     has as principal missions to create a comprehensive database \n     that contains all Civil War materials and to facilitate the \n     study of the war from the perspectives of all ethnic cultures \n     and all professions, academic disciplines, and occupations;\n       Whereas the 2 principal missions of Civil War Center are \n     consistent with the commemoration of the sesquicentennial; \n     and\n       Whereas advance planning to facilitate the 4-year \n     commemoration of the sesquicentennial is required: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Burma is \n     the world's number one heroin producer and sixty percent of \n     the heroin that comes to the streets of the United States \n     originates in Burma. The Administration must have the \n     opportunity to work against a problem which affects the daily \n     lives of the American people in such a harmful way.''\n       The Department's opposition to legislative restrictions on \n     counternarcotics aid to Burma remains unchanged.\n       I trust that this information is responsive to your \n     inquiry.

Mr. President, I was greatly disappointed by the \nvote of the Senate last Friday to open the ANWR to oil exploration. \nThis was a tremendous mistake that, if uncorrected, will be a \nsignificant blow to the environment.\n  Mr. President, it is time for government to practice fiscal \nresponsibility. However, we should not destroy the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge [ANWR] in an effort to balance the budget. Our children \ndo not deserve to inherit a huge debt. However, they do deserve to \ninherit our Nation's abundant wildlife and wilderness in the same or \nbetter condition as we did. Cheating our children of this inheritance \nis not sound fiscal policy.\n  The attempt to open the ANWR for the exploration of oil is not \nsomething new. In fact, a battle has been developing for over 15 years. \nCongress has voted to protect this area in the past and must continue \nto fight this battle and preserve the ANWR in the future.\n  The Budget Committee claims that opening the ANWR for oil exploration \nmay generate $1.4 billion in leasing revenues during a 4-year period. \nThis sounds like a lot of money and is a lot of money. Yet, this figure \nrepresents a mere two-tenths of 1 percent of the budget deficit. Should \nwe sacrifice a unique ecological environment whose value is priceless \nin order to pay off less than one-half of 1 percent of our total debt? \nThis just does not make sense.\n  Oil is valuable and can be priced. But how can we price the 150,000-\nmember porcupine caribou herd that migrates \n\n[[Page S 16632]]\n\nto the ANWR each year to give birth to their calves? How can we price \nthe culture of the Gwich'in people who have been in northeast Alaska \nfor 20,000 years? How can we price an entire ecosystem that is the life \nsupport of over 165 different species?\n  Mr. President, inclusion of the ANWR provision in our budget \nreconciliation plan is unacceptable. It is not fair to our children and \nfuture generations to come. I urge the conferees to drop this ill-\nadvised antienvironment provision from the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16631-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL ROULETTE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached article be printed in the Congressional Record at the \nappropriate place.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 1995]\n\n                            Social Roulette\n\n       The spread of legalized gambling is the political issue \n     that has yet to roar, but may do so soon--and should. In a \n     decade, casino gambling has spread from two states to at \n     least 35. Gambling is done on riverboats, on Indian \n     reservations, in well-established downtowns. Native American \n     tribes (including some that have rediscovered their existence \n     for the primary purpose of setting up casinos) are the best \n     publicized entrepreneurs in this field, partly because they \n     can operate free of many regulations. Estimates on how much \n     money is involved here are all over the lot, depending on \n     what sorts of gambling are counted in, but a study by U.S. \n     News & World Report concluded that counting state lotteries \n     and the like, $330 billion was wagered legally in 1992, up \n     1,800 percent since 1976.\n       Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), along with Sens. Paul Simon (D-\n     Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), thinks the country ought to \n     take a long look as it hurtles toward turning itself into one \n     gigantic open town. They have introduced useful bills to \n     create a national commission that would undertake, as Mr. \n     Wolf puts it, ``an objective, credible and factual study of \n     the effects of gambling'' on communities, including its \n     impact on crime rates, political corruption and family life, \n     and also to examine its economic costs and benefits.\n       Those pushing casinos into communities make large claims \n     about their economic benefits, but the jobs and investment \n     casinos create are rarely stacked up against the jobs lost \n     and the investment and spending forgone in other parts of a \n     local economy. The Commission's study could be of great use \n     to communities pondering whether to wager their futures on \n     roulette, slot machines and blackjack. The Wolf bill wants a \n     report from the commission in three years; the Simon-Lugar \n     bill wants it in half that time. We're inclined to think the \n     quicker the better.\n       The ``gaming industry,'' as it calls itself, is fighting \n     these proposals. One hopes that at next week's House \n     Judiciary Committee hearing on the Wolf bill, gambling's \n     representatives will be asked why they fear a national \n     commission. If all their claims about gambling's beneficial \n     effects are true, a commission would presumably verify them. \n     If critics of gambling are wrong in seeing it as being linked \n     to crime, corruption and social breakdown, the commission \n     would presumably find that out too. Could it be that those \n     with an interest in the spread of gambling fear what a fair \n     study will find?\n       True to form, gambling now has its own trade association, \n     and gambling interests--tribal and others--have stepped up \n     their campaign contributions to both parties. To pick a few \n     examples: Golden Nugget, the well-known Las Vegas casino, \n     gave $230,000 in ``soft money'' to the Republican Party last \n     year; Frank Fertitta Jr., chairman of Station Casinos Inc., \n     also gave $230,000 to the GOP; the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe \n     gave $365,000 to the Democrats in the 1993-94 election cycle \n     and covered its bets with $100,000 to the Republicans in \n     November of 1994.\n       The country is in the presence of a powerful and growing \n     industry and an important social phenomenon. At the least, \n     the federal government should help the country figure out \n     what is going on, which is why what Mr. Wolf, Mr. Lugar and \n     Mr. Simon are doing is so important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16632-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MILLION MAN MARCH\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the significance of the Million Man \nMarch in Washington will be debated a year from now, and perhaps then \nwith greater understanding. But we should not wait a year to learn from \nit.\n  From my perspective there was both good and bad to the assemblage. \nThe good included:\n  Hundreds of thousands--the latest estimate is 800,000--of African \nAmerican men came to Washington to send a message to the Nation and to \ntheir black male counterparts. To the Nation the message of the \ngathering was simple: There is still too much racism and injustice. To \nother African American men: We must do better.\n  To have close to a million men as part of a demonstration and not \nhave a single incident that called for police action is a tribute to \nparticipants and to those staging the event.\n  Those cleaning up the inevitable debris from such a huge gathering, I \nam told, found not a single beer can. These were men gathered for a \nmission, not a party.\n  The size of the crowd, coupled with the decision in the recent O.J. \nSimpson trial and the Rodney King episode, has the Nation talking about \nrace more candidly, though the barriers of prejudice or embarrassment \nor awkwardness make candid talk between whites and blacks less common \nthan it should be.\n  Inevitably, comparisons are made with the 1963 throng that Martin \nLuther King addressed. The 1963 gathering had these advantages over the \nrecent gathering:\n  It was inclusive. It was a call for the Nation to come together. Both \nthe crowd and the message were impressive. And partly as a result of \nthat gathering, great strides were made against the cruder forms of \nsegregation and injustice. In a brief message, Dr. King called upon all \nof us--across the barriers of race and sex and religion and ethnic \nbackground--to do better.\n  The anti-Jewish message that Minister Farrakhan has delivered--though \nnot at this gathering--should be offensive to all thoughtful people.\n  I am old enough to have been part of the civil rights efforts of the \n1950s and 1960s. The whites who were with us disproportionately in that \nstruggle to secure opportunity for African Americans were not Lutheran, \nwhich I am, not Catholic, which my wife is, nor Methodist nor \nPresbyterian nor Baptist, but Jewish. The Jews have experienced \ncenturies of discrimination, and rose in significant numbers in behalf \nof others discriminated against. It is ironic that people of little \nunderstanding but large ambition have mistakenly believed that you can \nbuild blacks up by tearing Jews down.\n  My son is a professional photographer. He took pictures at this \nevent, and when one of the marchers saw his credentials and read the \nname ``Martin Simon,'' he asked my son: ``You're Jewish, aren't you?'' \nAnd not in a tone of pleasant inquiry. We are not Jewish, but what if \nwe were? Should that make any difference?\n  In contrast to Martin Luther King, Minister Farrakhan delivered a \nlengthy speech with no coherence. He had an opportunity to ask the \nnation for two or three things of importance, but he muffled the \nopportunity. That he is a person of considerable ability, no one can \nquestion. Like all of us, he can grow in the future--away from some of \nhis prejudices. He accurately sensed the dissatisfaction level among \nAfrican American men. The 1963 gathering will be remembered for the \nhuge crowd and the message. The 1995 gathering will be remembered for \nthe huge crowd.\n  One other concern: The anti-white and anti-Jewish inflammatory \nrhetoric of some of the pre-march rallies led by Minister Farrakhan's \nfollowers will do nothing for either blacks or whites. At one meeting, \nwhich David Jackson, a white reporter for the Chicago Tribune, \nattended--and was the only white at the gathering--a speaker said, ``We \nought to just turn the lights out and boot your * * * out.'' A small \ngroup grabbed him and roughly threw him out of the meeting. That type \nof conduct does no one any good.\n  Let me add, I am not anti-Muslim. I sponsored the first Muslim to \nlead the Senate in prayer. I recognize the discrimination that Muslims \nencounter, and like all forms of discrimination, it is wrong.\n  What all of us must do: Talk candidly about the injustices that still \nexist in our society. And talk not just with ``our'' group.\n  Recognize that U.S. poverty exceeds that of any other Western, \nindustrialized nation. Poverty falls disproportionately on minorities \nand women. We act as if being poor was an act of God, rather than what \nit is, flawed policy.\n  Support those who would bring us together as a Nation, and be wary of \nthose who would further divide us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16632-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S 16633]]\n\n\n       THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 35 years ago, the American \nCouncil for the Arts [ACA] was established under the name Community \nArts Councils, Inc., as an organization supporting the arts and artists \nin this country. Over the three-and-a-half decades since its founding, \nthe American Council for the Arts has played a major role in the \ndramatic increase in the availability of the arts to the American \npeople.\n  In the early 1960's, ACA served as one of the earliest advocates for \nthe creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities. Nancy Hanks served as one of ACA's first \npresidents before becoming Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts \nin 1969. Over the years, ACA board members have included David \nRockfeller, Jr., Joanne Woodward, Jane Alexander, Harry Belafonte, \nRalph Ellison, Colleen Dewhurst, Joseph Papp, Lane Kirkland, and Kitty \nCarlisle Hart, among others. In the 1970's, due to the broadening of \nACA's objectives and the increasing demand for special constituent \nservices, two separate organizations were spun-off from ACA: the \nNational Assembly of State Arts Agencies and the National Assembly of \nLocal Arts Agencies.\n  From arts advocacy to publishing, from founding the National \nCoalition of United Arts Funds, to working on behalf of arts education \ninitiatives, ACA has worked tirelessly on behalf of the arts and \nculture of this Nation. Every spring, ACA mounts Arts Advocacy Day and \nthe Nancy Hanks Lecture on the Arts and Public Policy in Washington, \nDC. Advocacy Day brings together arts advocates from across the country \nto work on behalf of a strong Federal role in funding the arts and \nculture, and the Nancy Hanks Lecture, now in its 9th year, has quickly \nbecome one of the most important public forums on the relationship \nbetween Government and the arts. Nancy Hanks Lecturers have included \nArthur Schlesinger, Jr.--1988, Leonard Garment--1989, Maya Angelou--\n1990, John Brademas--1991, Franklin Murphy--1922, Barbara Jordan--1993, \nDavid McCullough--1994, and Winton M. Blount--1995. The 1996 lecturer \nwill be Carlos Fuentes.\n  ACA's National Arts Clearinghouse contains a wealth of arts policy \ninformation, and other arts studies, magazines, journals, and \ndocuments--an invaluable resource for the study of arts policy. Over \nthe years, ACA has commissioned studies and produced books for artists, \narts administrators, policymakers, students, educators, and others. ACA \ncommissioned the first Lou Harris poll on ``Americans and the Arts'' in \n1973 and has recommissioned the poll five times.\n  ACA has made an enormous contribution to the wealth and vitality of \nour great Nation. Please join with me in celebrating ACA's 35 years of \nservice to the arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16633-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CULTURAL DIVERSITY VERSUS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that a \nrecently published book, ``Managing Plurality: Beyond Diversity to \nEffective Organizational Changes,'' by the past president of the \nAmerican Psychological Association, Dr. Donald E. Fox, and his \ncolleague, Dr. J. Renae Norton, sensitively explores issues relating to \ndiversity in the labor force and affirmative action. I agree with their \ncontention that affirmative action is not really the problem; but, \nrather it is the manner in which it is implemented and managed that \nseems to cause the most difficulties.\n  I have observed over the last 3 or 4 years that criticisms of \naffirmative action programs have increased and some people are even \ncalling for their complete elimination. Historically, affirmative \naction has been particularly beneficial in bringing women and \nminorities into the work place. Today affirmative action is needed more \nthan ever to insure that all individuals have equal access to \nopportunities for advancement and positions of more responsibility.\n  We would all readily admit that when affirmative action is \nimplemented as a numbers game that merely counts how many women or \nminorities are employed, it works against the needs of business as well \nas the people it was designed to help. However, our society is changing \nso rapidly that a diverse work force is becoming the rule rather than \nthe exception. For example, it is estimated that in the very near \nfuture, 85 percent of the new jobs in the labor force will be filled by \nwomen, minorities, and immigrants. Organizations that are looking to \ntheir future will have to evaluate the impact that diversity in our \nsociety will have on the marketing of their products or services. What \nbetter way for an organization to ensure innovation than through the \ncultivation of a diverse work force. For example, in my own State of \nHawaii, cultural diversity is the rule, not the exception. This \ndiversity is not only accepted, but sought after by organizations \nseeking to compete in the international market.\n  Projections show that as the labor pool becomes more diverse, the \nnumber of people with technical skills will shrink. It would, \ntherefore, seem logical that the contributions of every employee should \nbe maximized. Organizations would benefit from recruiting and retaining \nthe best and the brightest employees that are in the available labor \npool. It should then be easy to see that diversity is not something \nthat organizations create, but something that occurs naturally in every \norganization.\n  Frequently, when organizations introduce programs to manage or value \ndiversity, the programs have a tendency to promote group differences \nrather than exploring the mutual interests of the individuals within \nthe organization. Although I am not a psychologist, in my judgment, it \nwould seem that an organization would do substantially better if they \nwould encourage individuals to maintain their cultural differences and \nindividuality while participating in and contributing to the goals of \ntheir organization, and thus hopefully creating a pluralistic work \nenvironment. If the organization uses its diversity to its benefit by \nmanaging plurality, it can focus on common goals and experiences rather \nthan on the differences among groups, and at the same time address \nbottom-line business issues. The experience of the military over the \npast 40 years has, I believe, demonstrated the value of cultural \ndiversity--especially as the military deploys into nations throughout \nthe world on various missions. So, simply stated, it makes eminent \nsense to me that with proper management, diversity is an asset to the \norganization and affirmative action is a part of the solution, not the \nproblem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16633-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16633-S16634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR BYRNE GRANT FUNDING\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Edward Byrne Grant Program is \none of the most successful Federal-State crime prevention efforts ever. \nWorking in partnership with State and local governments, the Byrne \nProgram helps local law enforcement improve their criminal justice \nsystems and make communities safer by helping to prevent crime.\n  Law enforcement officials all across Iowa have told me of the success \nthey have had as a result of these funds. Drug enforcement task forces, \nimproved law enforcement technology, the DARE Program, domestic \nviolence intervention, and countless other valuable antidrug and \nanticrime efforts have been possible because of the Byrne Grant \nProgram.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, violence, like a communicable disease, \nhas spread to every part of our country and our State. To eradicate \nthis epidemic of violence we must attack both the problem and the \nsymptoms. While the Federal Government cannot have all the answers, the \nByrne Program is an important part of the solution. Byrne funding \nenhances law enforcement initiatives focused on battling criminals \nalready invading our streets, as well as aiding law enforcement in \ntheir ongoing efforts to help communities prevent crime before it \nhappens.\n  The Byrne Program also promotes cooperation among State and local law \nenforcement agencies to improve the efficiency of their criminal \njustice systems. A shining example in Iowa is the multijurisdictional \ndrug task forces that form the backbone of Iowa's effort to combat drug \nrelated crimes. These task forces are composed of State and \n\n[[Page S 16634]]\n\nlocal law enforcement officers as well as State and local attorneys. \nThey cover almost 70 of Iowa's 99 counties. Officers pool resources and \nequipment to carry out drug investigations and the attorneys provide \nlegal advice to ensure a sound drug investigation. In Waterloo, IA, the \nState and local task force even works with the U.S. attorneys office to \nform a Federal, State and local crime fighting team.\n  And Mr. President, like a one-two punch, the Byrne Program's special \nemphasis on drug abuse prevention gets to the heart of the problem and \nmoves us toward a long-term solution to crime prevention. Violent \ncrimes committed by youth have increased over 50 percent from 1988 to \n1992 and drugs are a major factor in many violent crimes. DARE--drug \nabuse resistance education programs, put police officers in schools \ntalking to kids about drug abuse. DARE programs serve 70,000 Iowa \nstudents. Traditional drug abuse programs dwell on the harmful effects \nof drugs. Iowa's DARE programs help students recognize and resist the \nmany subtle pressures that influence them to experiment with alcohol \nand other drugs.\n  Violence in this country will be reduced because of officers on the \nfront line making a difference in their community and getting the \nresources they need to do the job. The Byrne Grant Program is a \ncritically important component in halting the increased incidences of \ncrime and violence in our society.\n  I was pleased that our push for increased funding for the Byrne Grant \nProgram paid off. The fiscal year 1996 Commerce, State, Justice bill \npassed by the Senate, provides a $25 million increase over last year's \nfunding. We need to build on the progress we have made in our fight \nagainst crime and continue to support successful and effective programs \nsuch as the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement \nAssistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16633-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LAWSUIT ABUSE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I proudly acknowledge a group \nof citizens in West Virginia who are hard at work to address an issue \naffecting every citizen of our State: Lawsuit abuse.\n  In many areas of West Virginia, local citizens are getting involved \nwith a group they call Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, with the goal of \nmaking the public more aware of the costs and problems stemming from \nexcessive numbers and kinds of lawsuits.\n  The CALA effort focuses on education. These citizens are speaking out \nabout an issue that has statewide and national consequences. The costs \nof lawsuit abuse include higher costs for consumer products, higher \nmedical expenses, higher taxes, and lost business expansion and product \ndevelopment.\n  The mission of Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse is to curb lawsuit \nabuse. Here is an example of West Virginians devoting energy and effort \ntowards solving problems that cost our State jobs, profits, and \nopportunity.\n  My own work in this has focused on the problems of our product \nliability system, and I got involved when I saw the terrible \nconsequences of the country's confusing, patchwork, slow, and often \nunfair system of product liability rules that badly need reform. The \nhelp of individuals, including members of the legal profession, \ninvolved in Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse in West Virginia, has been \ncrucial to the legislative success we are finally with the product \nliability reform bill that I introduced once again early in this \nCongress. In May, working closely with Senator Gorton of Washington \nState, we succeeded in winning Senate approval of our bill and we are \nnow hoping to engage in a conference with the House of Representatives \nto develop a final bill for the President's signature.\n  Legal reform of any kind is not a simple issue. The legal system must \nfunction to provide justice to every American. But that does not mean \nthat the status quo is necessarily perfect. When lawsuits and the \ncourts can be used in excess or result in imposing costs on other \nparties, from individuals to non-profit agencies to businesses, without \nreason, the system should be reviewed and reformed if possible.\n  Through CALA in West Virginia, nonprofit groups have raised local \nfunds to run educational media announcements and are speaking to local \norganizations and citizens groups across the State to raise public \nawareness on the lawsuit abuse issue.\n  Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared October 30 \nthrough November 3, 1995, as ``Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week'' in West \nVirginia.\n  I want to commend these citizens for their dedication and commitment \nand to acknowledge this week as a time of public awareness on the \nserious issues associated with lawsuit abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16634-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16634-S16635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A DEEPLY FLAWED IMMIGRATION BILL\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, now that the House Judiciary \nCommittee has passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation, many \neyes will be turning to the Senate to see what efforts in this area \nwill take place here.\n  One fundamental question facing the Senate is whether to address \nillegal and legal immigration reform in the same legislation. Though \nthe House has thus far chosen this path, I do not think the Senate \nshould follow its example. At the very least, we in the Senate ought to \nlimit the drastic and unwarranted cuts in legal immigration that appear \nin the legislation passed in the House Committee, and should approach \nthe issue of backlogs in family categories with the fairness on which \nwe pride ourselves.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record an October 23, 1995, editorial in \nthe Chicago Tribune entitled ``A Deeply Flawed Immigration Bill.'' The \neditorial aptly notes that while Congress should take decisive and \nquick action to enforce our laws against illegal immigration--such as \nthose endorsed on an unprecedented basis by the Clinton administration, \nit ``can approve those without agreeing that legal immigrants are a \nproblem in need of such harsh solutions.'' I agree with the Tribune's \nposition, and urge my colleagues not to penalize those who have played \nby the rules for the conduct of those who have chosen not to play by \nthe rules.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Oct. 23, 1995]\n\n                    A Deeply Flawed Immigration Bill\n\n       Since its creation, the United States has been a country of \n     immigrants that welcomed new immigrants. But if Republicans \n     on the House Judiciary Committee get their way, as they seem \n     likely to do, the welcome will be quite a bit chillier for \n     many foreigners who would like to come here legally and \n     become part of America.\n       This is being done partly in the name of combating illegal \n     immigration, which most Americans rightly think is warranted. \n     But the bill being debated in the Judiciary Committee treats \n     both legal and illegal immigrants as undesirable and out of \n     control.\n       On illegal immigration, the measure sponsored by Rep. Lamar \n     Smith (R-Tex) has much to recommend it. It authorizes the \n     hiring of more Border Patrol agents and Labor Department \n     inspectors to police the border and the workplace, raises \n     penalties for the use of phony documents, provides money to \n     build fences between the U.S. and Mexico, and streamlines \n     deportation procedures for foreigners who arrive without \n     proper documents.\n       It also attempts to crack down on employment of illegals by \n     establishing a telephone registry to let employers verify \n     that new hires are cleared to work. The registry, supposedly \n     a pilot project, is probably too ambitious for a useful \n     experiment, since it would affect all employers in five of \n     the seven states getting the most foreigners--California, \n     Texas, Illinois, Florida, New York, New Jersey and \n     Massachusetts. But a smaller undertaking, as suggested by the \n     Clinton administration, could yield valuable lessons.\n       The real problem lies in the proposed treatment of legal \n     immigrants. First, the bill would drastically reduce the \n     number allowed in, cutting the annual intake from 800,000 to \n     fewer than 600,000. This approach presumes that people who \n     come here legally are a burden, instead of the enriching \n     source of renewal they always have been.\n       Second, among the categories of people who now get \n     preference in the immigration queue are brothers and sisters, \n     adult children and parents of citizens and legal permanent \n     residents. The Smith bill would eliminate these explicitly or \n     in effect, limiting ``family reunification'' to spouses and \n     minor children of those already here.\n       This new priority does not seem misguided. But it can be \n     legitimately criticized on grounds that it would leave in the \n     lurch thousands of people who applied under the old rules and \n     have waited to be admitted--some of them 10 or 15 years.\n\n[[Page S 16635]]\n\n       Barring new applicants in these categories is not \n     unreasonable, but rejecting those already waiting would be \n     callous in the extreme. Yet last week the committee balked at \n     even refunding the $80 application fee these aspiring \n     immigrants have each paid. Slam the door in their face, but \n     only after taking their money--it's not exactly the American \n     way.\n       Members of Congress from both parties should have no \n     trouble with the bill's resolute measures to fight illegal \n     immigration. But they can approve those without agreeing that \n     legal immigrants are a problem in need of such harsh \n     solutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/02/senate-section/article/S16634-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
