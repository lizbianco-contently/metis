Mr. President, I do not see other Senators wishing to speak \nat this time, so I would like to be recognized for 5 minutes on my own \ntime, not out of leader's time.\n  I do hope the Senate will think carefully about this vote at 12:30 \ntoday. The District of Columbia is in dire straits. We may not approve \nof the way they do business, or what their plans are for the future, \neven. However, it is our Nation's Capital. They need this \nappropriations conference report to be resolved, and resolved right \naway.\n  The problem is there is some language in this conference report using \nvouchers for children in the District of Columbia that have remedial \nreading problems, or tuition vouchers for them to be able to go to \nother schools. It has a lot of flexibility built into it.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, has worked very hard to \ncome up with a reasonable compromise. These vouchers will not be \navailable, as I understand it, if the District of Columbia decides \nagainst it. Why should not the Congress at least give them that option? \nWhy do we resist allowing children that need remedial help in reading, \nfor instance, being able to get this opportunity to go where they can \nget the help they need--perhaps after the regular school hours. Why \nwould we want to lock children in the District of Columbia into schools \nthat are totally inadequate, but their parents are not allowed to or \ncannot afford to move them around into other schools or into schools \neven in adjoining States?\n  It is a question of choice and opportunity. We are saying we should \nat least give the District of Columbia the opportunity to consider \nwhether or not they want to allow these children to have this option. \nThe Members of the Senate, the Democratic leadership, the Senator from \nMassachusetts says, no, we will not even allow this option to be \nconsidered. We will vote against this conference report because of this \none point. I do not understand it.\n  We all say we are concerned about education in America, learning and \nchildren, but we do not want to give the children in the District of \nColumbia that option, even? I would urge my colleagues here in the \nSenate to vote for this conference report. If we do not do it, we are \ngoing to wind up at some point--in a week, or two, or I do not know how \nfar down the road--with a continuing resolution for a few weeks or a \ncouple of months or maybe even the remaining 5\\1/2\\ months of this \nyear, or maybe it will wind up in some omnibus appropriations bill, but \nI can tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle it will be \nfunded at less than is in this conference report, probably.\n  I just think that the Senate looks very bad in refusing to vote \ncloture so that we could even debate this appropriations conference \nreport. I hope we will have additional votes for cloture today. I think \nwe will pick up some. If we do not succeed today, I hope we will try \nagain next week, and I hope the Senate will find its way clear to vote \n\n[[Page S1400]]\nfor what I think is the right thing in invoking cloture. You can still \nvote against the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia if \nyou think it is too much money and not done in the right way, and I \nmight do that, but allow us to bring it up for consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1399-5", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, today is not a particularly busy day in \nthe Senate, as everyone can see. The Senate is not scheduled for action \nfor a bit. We have one vote scheduled, and I think probably not much \nbeyond that for the rest of the day. I had asked yesterday to take some \ntime to discuss an issue today on the subject of international trade.\n  I noticed in this morning's paper, the Washington Post, an article \nthat says ``Trade Deficit in '95 Worst in 7 Years.'' This was not on \nthe front page, but in the business section of today's paper.\n  I have talked on the floor of the Senate many times in the last 2 \nyears on the subject of international trade. The reason I came to the \nfloor today was not only because we were going to have the figures on \nwhat last year's trade deficit was in this country but also because \nthere is in the party of the Presiding Officer an aggressive, raging, \nfascinating debate these days about trade issues. One candidate who is \nout on the hustings campaigning for votes is talking about trade in a \nparticular way, and then several others are responding to it. It is \nsomehow as if this were the first time trade was being discussed in \nthis country.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate at least 10 or 12 times in the \nlast 2 years talking about international trade. There are some trade \nmyths that I want to talk about today. This will be the first of a \nseries of presentations which I intend to make on trade. Today I will \nbe dealing with the overview, and then in subsequent days I will be \ndealing with the problems that cause the trade deficit.\n  The reason I come to the floor is the myths that exist on trade that \nare now being perpetuated in the Presidential campaigns. These are \ngenerally myths spread around this town that are held dear by many \npeople in this town:\n  First, ``Balancing the Federal budget is important; reducing our \nNation's trade deficit is not.''\n  We have two deficits in this country. We have a budget deficit in the \nFederal Government. It hurts this country, and we ought to deal with \nit. People on both sides of the aisle are wrestling with the priorities \nof how do you solve the budget problem and put our budget in balance.\n  I know some on the other side say, ``Well, we have all the answers,'' \nand some here say, ``No; we have all the answers.'' The fact is \neveryone would like to do it the right way. We should balance the \nFederal budget, and we should do it with the right set of priorities. \nBut, it is not the only deficit that matters. We have a trade deficit \nin this country that is very serious and that has been growing. As we \naddress the budget deficit, we must also address this burgeoning trade \ndeficit.\n  The second myth is that more free-trade agreements will eventually \neliminate the trade deficits.\n  The more free-trade agreements we have, the higher the deficits have \nbeen. It is not more agreements that matters. It is the kind of \nagreements that counts. Are these trade agreements fair so that \nAmerican workers and producers can compete and have an opportunity to \nwin in international trade competition?\n  Another myth is that there is a common solution for our trade deficit \nproblems with our trading partners: free trade.\n  There is not one common solution. Free trade is irrelevant if the \ntrade is not fair.\n  Fourth is that trade deficits are not very important factors in the \nU.S. economy.\n  Trade deficits are critically important factors in our economy. They \nrelate to what we produce. Those folks in America who measure our \ncountry's progress by what we consume rather than what we produce do \nnot understand this. What an economy will be in the future is related \nto what it produces. The production of real new wealth is the source of \nthe engine of progress for the future.\n  And, finally, the fifth myth is that seeking fair trade for America \nand a level playing field for our country equals protectionism.\n  I am not a big fan of Pat Buchanan. He is raising trade issues. \nPerhaps he is raising them in some ways I would not. Some parts of his \nargument have some dark edges that I do not like. Yet the fact is every \ntime someone raises the question of the trade deficit in this country, \nthey are called a xenophobic protectionist stooge of some type. They \nare accused of wanting to build a wall around America, or labeled as \none of a bunch of isolationists.\n  What a bunch of nonsense. You can stand up for the economic interests \nof this country, you can stand up for American producers and American \nworkers, and you can stand up for the symbols and the reality of fair \ntrade without being isolationist or protectionist.\n  I would like to run through a series of charts and talk about where \nwe are.\n  The first chart is a chart which talks about the trade deficit and \nthe Federal budget deficit. Actually, this is the Federal budget \ndeficit that is listed both by the President and by the Congress. The \nbudget deficit actually is higher than this because this includes the \nSocial Security revenues. Yet, they advertise the budget deficit as \n$164 billion last year. The merchandise trade deficit is $174 billion. \nOur total trade deficit is slightly lower than that. The merchandise \ntrade deficit to me represents the important aspect because it is what \nwe produce and what we manufacture. This critical sector of our economy \nhas a $174 billion trade deficit.\n  We cannot solve the problems of the budget deficit or the trade \ndeficit without understanding how they relate to each other and how \nthey relate to our national economy.\n  Both of the deficits undermine our country's economy. The budget \ndeficit does. And, so does the merchandise trade deficit. Both are \neconomic warning flags that our country needs to do a better job in \ngrowing our national economy. Both mean we have to give special \nattention to our wage base and to our productive sector.\n  We had a budget deficit--which is really not measured appropriately--\nof $290 billion in 1992. That is down to $164 billion now under this \nmeasurement. But the merchandise trade deficit at the same time is \ngoing up. It is up to $174 billion.\n  Now, that represents a loss of jobs and a loss of production \nfacilities in our country. I noticed in the article today, the trade \nofficials said, ``Well, gee. We exceeded all previous years in our \nexports of goods from our country.'' Yes, that is true. We also \nexceeded all previous years and previous expectations of the import of \nmanufactured goods into our country. The imported goods we bring in \nthat are manufactured in other places around the world represents \nnearly one-half of what we manufacture in America today.\n  Let me go to another chart that deals with our trade deficits. Again, \nno one wants to talk about this. Nobody will talk about it. Nobody \ncomes to the Senate floor and talks about trade very much. \n\n[[Page S1401]]\n\n  These red lines represent America's trade deficit. These red lines \nrepresent the choking of enterprise in this country and represent the \nmovement of jobs elsewhere.\n  This is the second straight year of records in trade deficits. It was \nnot too long ago when we would have trade deficits of $5 or $10 billion \nin a year. At that time back in the 1970's we had Members of Congress, \nincluding some chairmen of committees, talking about emergency \nlegislation to impose tariffs on this and that and the other thing. Now \nour trade deficit is burgeoning and nobody seems to care at all.\n  Well, the simple fact is that these red lines mean American jobs and \nAmerican factories are moving outside our country. They are moving from \nAmerica to other countries.\n  There are a lot of reasons for this. Some of them are probably our \nfault but most of the trade deficits that we experience are not. If you \nwould look at this chart which shows the countries with which we have \nthe largest trade deficits.\n  First, there is Japan. We have nearly a $60 billion trade deficit \nwith Japan. This has been going on year after year after year. I am \ngoing to come to the floor and make a special presentation just on our \ntrade deficit with Japan.\n  Some say, ``Well, we have to be more competitive.'' Competitive how? \nHow can you compete if you cannot get into a market? It is unforgivable \nfor us to not do something to bring this trade imbalance down. We ought \nto have balanced trade to Japan. We ought not have a $60 billion \ndeficit.\n  With China we have a $34 billion trade deficit. And, it is ratcheting \nup year after year after year. Our country is a virtual cash cow for \nChinese hard currency needs. Because of these trade deficits, it means \njobs are leaving America and being displaced by imports from Japan and \nChina.\n  With Canada we have an $18 billion trade deficit. With Mexico it is \n$15 billion. That is a combined trade deficit of over $30 billion with \nour neighbors with whom we have an agreement called the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement [NAFTA]. And that trade is moving in the wrong \ndirection, too. It has been spiking way up.\n  In fact 2 years ago we had a $1 billion trade surplus with Mexico. \nNow it is a $15 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Can anyone \nreasonably stand and say that this makes sense? First, we pass NAFTA. \nThen, we go from a trade surplus of $1 billion to a trade deficit of \n$15 billion.\n  Then there is Germany with which we have a $15 billion trade deficit.\n  You can see what is happening with these trade deficits. I intend to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and talk about each of these countries. \nWe need to discuss our trade situation with Japan, with China, and the \ncombined deficit with Canada and Mexico. We need to discuss what causes \nit, and what we can do to deal with it. We ought to have balanced \ntrade. We ought to have aggressive and robust trade between our \ncountries. I would never suggest that we put walls around our borders \nor that we would in any way decide that we will not compete. But, I am \nsick and tired of people suggesting that those of us who are concerned \nabout our trade deficit are somehow protectionists who are not \ninterested in the well-being of our country or who want to put a wall \naround our country.\n  That is not the case at all. What I want is to stop having our \nproducers have their arms tied behind their backs when they are \ncompeting in other countries.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about what these trade deficits mean. \nThe common denominator is that every $1 billion in exports means 20,000 \nnew jobs in America. You can also compute that to the displacement of \nexports by imports coming in. What does it mean when goods are \nmanufactured elsewhere and are no longer manufactured here?\n  Our merchandise trade deficit this year means a loss of 3.5 million \njobs in this country. Most of these are manufacturing jobs, and most of \nthese manufacturing jobs are the better paying jobs in this country. \nJust the increase in the trade deficit from 1994 to 1995 is a loss of \n166,000 jobs. That is just the increase.\n  Now, we can see a lot of press reports and a lot of newspapers talk \nabout how many jobs exports create. But, have you seen a press report \nthat talks about losing 166,000 jobs just because of the increase in \nthe trade deficit this year versus last? I do not think so. You do not \nsee many reports about this problem.\n  Yet, this is a problem that relates to every family in this country. \nThese families sit around their dinner tables and ask themselves \nwhether life is better or is it tougher. And what they say in 60 \npercent of the American families these days is that they are working \nharder. If you adjust for inflation they make less money than they made \n20 years ago, and they have less job security.\n  The anxiety in this country is not misplaced. People know. People \nknow why they are anxious. They are anxious because they see jobs \nleaving and they see their opportunities here to be less secure. The \njobs they have had for 20 years with the same company are less secure. \nThey know that they work harder. Their families have not kept pace with \ninflation and they are actually making less money. Is there any doubt \nabout the reason that workers in this country are angry?\n  What do we do about that? Well, what we do is decide that this \ncountry cannot do what it did 30 years ago when our trade policy was \nforeign policy. I grew up in a very small town. Every day when I went \nto school. I walked to school and understood just viscerally that \nAmerica was the biggest, the best, the strongest, the most, and we \ncould beat most any economy in international trade with one hand tied \nbehind our back.\n  That is not true anymore. Today we face shrewd, tough international \neconomic competitors. We ought to face them in fair competition. I do \nnot mind that. We can win that competition.\n  But, we cannot win competition with Japan when their markets are \nclosed to our goods. We cannot win in competition with China when they \ndo not see and understand that when they ship all their goods to us, \nthey have a reciprocal responsibility to buy their major supply of \nwheat from us. It does not make any sense to me, when I look at these \ntrade relationships.\n  Somehow, I think the construction of our trade policy is for large \ncorporations who no longer say the Pledge of Allegiance, and do not \nsing the national anthem. By American law they are artificial people. \nThey can sue and be sued. They can contract and be contracted with. \nAnd, God bless them, they have created a lot of wonderful things in our \ncountry.\n  Today many of them see their role other than as an American \ncorporation. They, with others, are now economic international \nconglomerates interested in profits. What they decided to do is to \nconstruct a new economic model. That model says, let us produce our \ngoods where we pay 14 cents an hour to a 14-year-old worker, 14 hours a \nday, and ship them to Fargo or Tulsa or Cheyenne and have an American \ncustomer buy them.\n  That may sound good because in the short term, it might give the \ncustomers a good deal. But what it really means in the short, \nintermediate and long term is that jobs that were producing in this \ncountry are now in Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh \nand China, and all around the world.\n  The American consumer also plays a role in this. All of us have \npeople come up to us who are wearing shirts made in China, shoes made \nin Italy, shorts made in Mexico, driving cars made in Japan and \nwatching television sets made in Taiwan, and ask us, ``When are you \ngoing to do something about these jobs in America? Why are so many jobs \nleaving our country?'' Well the answer is because we have circumstances \nof trade that allow our market to be wide open to virtually anyone in \nthe world who wants to produce under any set of circumstances.\n  We fought for 75 years on the question of what is a living wage and \nwhat is a fair wage. What about safety in the workplace? What about \nchild labor laws? Some corporations have decided we can eclipse all of \nthose meddlesome issues with one hop. We can avoid all the questions of \nhiring 12-year-olds by producing in some country that allows it. We can \navoid all the problems of not being able to pollute the air and water \nin the United States by going to produce in a country where you can \npollute the air and the water. \n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n  We can resolve all the questions of what is a living wage by deciding \nnot to pay a living wage in some other country where the political \nleadership does not care. You can hire 14-year-olds and you can pay \nthem 14 cents an hour. That is not, under any standard, fair trade, and \nit should not be allowed.\n  The production from those circumstances of trade ought never come \ninto this country. They should compete with American men and women, \nworking day after day in factories in this country, who expect to \ncompete but expect the competition to be fair.\n  My intention in the coming weeks is to make a series of presentations \nabout where we are in international trade and what we ought to be doing \nabout it.\n  First on the agenda that we ought to have is to hold NAFTA \naccountable to its promises. You cannot pass a trade agreement that had \nbountiful promises of massive new jobs only to discover that we have \nlost a massive amount of jobs in our country--and then say, oh, that \ndid not matter. It does matter. Let us make sure these trade agreements \nare made accountable. If they are not, let us change them.\n  Second, let us at least stop subsidizing plants that close in this \ncountry and move overseas. We had one vote on that last year. I offered \nan amendment. It was voted down. I tell you it does not require much \nthinking to understand that if you do not stop the bleeding, you cannot \nsave the patient.\n  No country ever ought to have a circumstance in which their tax code \nsays, ``We'll give you a good deal. If you stay here, you'll pay taxes, \nbut if you close your plant, fire your workers, and move your jobs \noverseas, guess what, we'll give you a tax break, we'll give you a big, \njuicy tax break; $300 million, $400 million a year we'll give you to do \nthat. Close your American plant and move it overseas.''\n  If we cannot shut that insidious provision in our Tax Code down, \nthere is something wrong with us. I am going to give everybody in this \nChamber a chance to vote on this a dozen more times until we get it \npassed. I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Let us enforce existing trade agreements. Let us stop the dumping of \nproducts into this country that, by their cost, drive American \nproducers out of business.\n  It is sad that we do not stand up for this country's economic \ninterests. That has been true of Republican administrations and \nDemocratic administrations. It has been true for 20 to 30 years.\n  Let us stand up for this country's economic interest to say that fair \ntrade must be enforced. Let us enforce trade rules.\n  Let us develop a national trade deficit focus. Yes, let us worry \nabout the budget deficit and let us together solve that problem. But \nalso let us together in the coming months decide the trade deficit is a \nserious national problem that erodes the economic strength of this \ncountry. Let us get together and decide to do something about it.\n  Let us organize a worldwide conference to decide it is time for a new \nBretton Woods Conference and talk about the new financial markets and \nthe new trade relationships that will take us into the next century. \nLet us be frank. We cannot afford what has happened in the last 50 \nyears.\n  Let me show you the final two charts. This chart shows that foreign \nimports now take over one-half of the manufacturing gross domestic \nproduct in this country. That is a very serious problem. If you do not \nhave a strong manufacturing base, you will not long have a strong \neconomy in a country like ours.\n  Second, let me show you this chart. If anyone doubts the problem, let \nme show you a chart that shows the 50 years post Second World War.\n  In the first 25 years, as I said, we could compete with one hand tied \nbehind our back. Our trade policy was foreign policy. Everybody knew \nit, everybody understood it, and everybody accepted it. In the last 25 \nyears our competitors have been tough, shrewd, and often they have \nbeaten us to the punch.\n  Yes we still have a trade policy that is first a foreign policy. It \nis one that too often is a giveaway of American jobs to other \ncountries. And you see what has happened. While we have a trade \ndeficit, the other countries have a surplus.\n  This chart simply shows that Japan, Germany, and other countries in \nthe last 25 years have a surplus and the United States has a deficit.\n  How do American workers feel about this? They had enormous wage gains \nin the first 25 years, post Second World War. In the last 25 years they \nhave suffered wage losses. And it is because of this. This is something \nwe can address and fix.\n  I, Mr. President, appreciate your indulgence and the indulgence of my \ncolleagues. I intend to come to the floor in the coming weeks with four \nadditional presentations, the deficit with Japan, China, Canada, \nMexico, and Germany. I will discuss what it is, what we can do about \nit, and what does this country have a responsibility to do to address \nthese issues?\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is advised we are in \na period of morning business until noon. The Senator shall have 5 \nminutes to speak.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I was interested in our colleague's remarks. Certainly \nhe talks about a very important issue. There are a number of things we \nneed to consider. One of them, of course, is what we continue to do to \nmake business more and more expensive in this country making it more \nand more difficult for us to compete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1400-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1402-S1403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AGENDA FOR THE NEW YEAR\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk more specifically about \nthis coming year, and, frankly, some about the past year, this coming \nyear in terms of the agenda that is set for this country, the agenda \nthat is set for this Congress, more specifically for the Senate, the \nagenda that is set for the American people and the things that need to \nbe a priority for us as we move forward in this important, important \nyear.\n  Last year, we talked about a number of things. We talked about a \nnumber of issues, largely as a result of, I think, what the voters had \nsaid to us in 1994. They said the Federal Government is too large, it \ncosts too much, and we are overregulated. Obviously, that is a \nsimplistic analysis, but I think it is true. I just spent 2 weeks in my \nState of Wyoming, as you have, Mr. President, and I think that message \ncontinues to resonate.\n  We are talking about doing things that are important for American \nfamilies. We are talking about doing things that will help bring up the \nwages and the level of living of Americans, which has slowed. We are \ntalking about balancing the budget, because balancing the budget is the \nmoral and fiscal thing to do, it is the responsible thing to do, but it \nalso has results. It lowers interest rates. It helps create jobs, so it \nhas an impact on each of us.\n  We are talking about reducing spending. Certainly, most everyone \nwould agree that this Government has expanded far beyond what we ever \nthought it would. We celebrated Abraham Lincoln's birthday over the \nlast several weeks. One of the things that President Lincoln said is \nthat the Federal Government ought to do for the people those things \nthey cannot better do for themselves in their own communities, and that \nis still true. We need to evaluate what we do and see if we have gotten \naway from that concept.\n  We need to talk about regulatory reform. The Senator from North \nDakota was talking about the difficulty of competing in the world. Part \nof that is because we have made doing business so very expensive. It is \nnot that we want to do away with regulatory protection--we can do \nthat--but we can do it much more efficiently and do it in less costly \nways.\n  We need to talk about welfare reform, partly because of the costs, \npartly because all of us want to help people who need help, but we want \nto help them help themselves and do it in the most efficient way that \nwe can.\n  So, Mr. President, I guess what I am saying is that those concepts \nstill \n\n[[Page S1403]]\nexist, and we need to continue to push to do that. We have not been \nable to bring to closure some of these things that we have tried to do \nover the past year, largely because most of them have been vetoed by \nthe White House. Many of them have been opposed by our friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Balancing the budget: We came within one vote of getting a \nconstitutional amendment to ensure that the budget would be balanced. \nWe need to continue to do that. I think that is a critical item for our \nfuture, for our kids and for our grandkids.\n  We have made some progress in reducing spending, but we need to tie \nthat in to the future so that through the changing of entitlements that \nwill continue. If we do not do it, it will be right back up.\n  Regulatory reform passed this Senate. We have not been able to get it \npast the White House.\n  So the results, Mr. President, have been that we have had slower \ngrowth. Unfortunately, we hear these reports in the State of the Union \nthat this is the best economy in 30 years. Sorry, but when you examine \nit, it is not very good. We had 1.9 percent growth last year. In the \nlast quarter, we had a .9 percent growth.\n  If I had charts like the Senator from North Dakota, I could show you \nthe earlier years, in the eighties and prior to that, growth was more \ncommonly in the neighborhood of 3.5 to 4 percent. That reflects in the \nability of families to earn a living, a living with which they can \nsupport their families.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can establish a priority, an agenda for \nthis year, and I hope that we can spend our time on that; that we can \nmove forward.\n  I am not discouraged by the fact that we did not come to closure last \nyear. On the contrary, I am encouraged with the fact that we are now \ntalking about a balanced budget. Two years ago, we were talking about a \nbudget that had a $200 billion deficit, as far out as you could see. We \nhave not talked about regulatory reform before. We are now talking \nabout that.\n  So we have changed the discussion in this body, and I think we need \nto pursue that. I think we need to do it for economic growth. We need \nto do it so that people in this country and wage earners can enjoy the \nsame kind of prosperity that we have had in years past. We do that, I \nthink, by some tax relief, capital gains tax relief that encourages \ninvestment and encourages the economy to grow. We need to do it by \nregulatory relief so that businesses will have more money to pay. There \nwill be more jobs and more competition, which causes wages to go up. We \nneed to have a balanced budget so we are not only fiscally responsible \nbut so we can bring and keep interest rates down so there will be \nencouragement for investment.\n  After all, the real role of economics in this country is for the \nFederal Government to establish an environment in which the private \nsector can function. That should be our priority for this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1402-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1403-S1406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2546, the D.C. appropriations bill.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2546) making appropriations for the government of the \n     District of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole \n     or in part against the revenues of said District for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     House this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, once again we are here debating the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill for the current fiscal year, \nwhich is now fully 5 months old. The city began the year strapped for \ncash and it has not received $254 million of Federal funds that will be \navailable once this bill is enacted.\n  The kids in the public schools are still faced with a community and \nsystem that has not made them a priority. The Committee on Public \nEducation, known as COPE, is a group of local civic and business \nleaders who have spent nearly 6 years studying the D.C. public schools. \nIn its report a year ago is stated that too many remain too invested in \nthe status quo. COPE also found that the District has not really tried \nreform.\n  The kids in many District public schools continue to attempt to \nprepare for life in the next century in school buildings that were \nbuilt in the first half of this century, and are in deplorable physical \ncondition. Many schools lack the infrastructure to accommodate the same \ntechnology that the neighborhood grocery store employs.\n  If we do not begin the process of educational reform and fiscal \nrecovery by passing this conference agreement we can never hope to \nachieve the goals we, the Congress, set for ourselves last year. A \nfinancially fit and economically stable Nation's Capital that is able \nto attract businesses, jobs, and people to support a tax base that will \nenable a public education system that prepares our kids for the future \nis an absolute necessity for this community and for our Nation. If we \ncannot do it in the District, where can you?\n\n  Mr. President, we have a limited amount of time for debate and I do \nnot intend to restate the arguments that were made on Tuesday. But it \nis important to restate that this scholarship program, limited, in both \ntime and scope, is not the occasion for a national debate on the \nquestion of private school vouchers. We have an appropriations bill \nthat should have been enacted months ago. We resolved most of the \nissues, some of which were controversial and the subject of intense \ndiscussion, including the other education reform initiatives, in \nrelatively short order. But we had great difficulty finding common \nground on a scholarship program, which had to be a part of this \nconference agreement with respect to the interests of the House.\n  Mr. President, I hope that Senators will consider the financial \nplight of the District government and the educational future of D.C. \nkids when they cast their vote today and not the fears of a few who are \ninvested in the status quo. I ask Senators to vote for cloture and \nallow the city to get on with its important rebuilding work.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly mention again two other issues. We have \ngone over the abortion issue many times, and about what was reached as \na compromise between what the Bush and Clinton administrations did. I \ntalked to you yesterday and, hopefully, removed from your mind any \nconcerns about Davis-Bacon problems. If there are concerns under the \ninterpretation, we are ready to take care of that before this goes into \nlaw.\n  So I urge Senators, please, review what was said yesterday and please \npass this conference report by allowing us to have cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, just 2 days ago, on Tuesday of this week, \nthe Senate failed to invoke cloture on the conference report H.R. 2546, \nthe District of Columbia appropriations bill. The vote was 54 to 44. \nFor the benefit of Members who may have turned their attention to other \nmatters, let me inform the Senate that we are about to repeat Tuesday's \nvote. However, and unless Chairman Jeffords otherwise indicates, I am \nunaware of any developments affecting the issues that led the Senate to \nreject the first cloture motion. My position therefore remains the \nsame, and I urge Members to vote against the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Although I am urging Members to oppose the motion at hand, I do so \nwith great reluctance. As Chairman Jeffords and I have already \nindicated, the District is in dire financial straits. The \n\n[[Page S1404]]\nChairman of the Control Board, the Mayor, and other officials agree \nthat the city will run out of cash if the balance of the Federal \npayment--some $212 million--is not released within the next several \nweeks. We need to act, not to debate. With respect to the voucher \nprogram set forth in the conference report, the Senate has spoken. We \nneed to respect the decision of this body and move forward to develop a \nlegislation that will allow the city to pay its bills and operate in an \norderly fashion.\n  Mr. President, the Senators who voted against cloture on the \nconference report are not satisfied with the status quo in the D.C. \npublic school system. In my opinion, it is a national disgrace that \nchildren in our Nation's Capital do not have access to schools that \nprepare them to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy. \nI believe that all of us agree that District schools need to change, \nand that they will be changed. The conference report includes a broad \narray of reforms that received bipartisan support. These reforms \naddress many of the shortcomings in the District's schools and I urge \nmy fellow conferees to work with congressional leadership to find a way \nto enact them.\n  Mr. President, I know other Senators would like to address the Senate \nso I will yield the balance of my time to Senator Kennedy. Thank you \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin and also the Senator from Vermont for understanding that if \nwe did not have these three inappropriate sort of riders that have been \nplaced on the conference report, this legislation would go through in a \nmoment by a voice vote. But it has been the judgment of the House of \nRepresentatives to add three different measures--one dealing with \nDavis-Bacon, in order to depress the wages of workers in the District; \nsecond, in restricting even private funds that could be used to help \nand assist a woman if she makes a judgment and determination for \nabortion; third, the issue on the vouchers in an appropriations bill \nthat reduces the total funding, cuts back $11 million, but provides $5 \nmillion for vouchers.\n  Now, Mr. President, just at the outset of this discussion, we have to \nunderstand that there are certain issues where there is a public \nresponse and a recognized public obligation. We have recognized that \nwith regard to national security. We have recognized that with regard \nto electricity, for example. And we have recognized that with regard to \nthe Postal Service. Nobody would say we ought to have just the market \nof electricity and postal. Why? Because we know that the houses at the \nend of the street would not receive it, or those houses at the end of \nthe street would not receive their mail.\n  As a nation, for education it will require public investment of \nfunds, and it will be compulsory. We are asked to accept this \nparticular amendment because we are told that it will be an experiment, \nbut it is not an experiment, Mr. President, because what you are doing \nis rigging the system at the very outset. What you are not giving is \nthe choice and decision for the independent student to make a judgment \nto go to a private school. What you are basically doing is taking \nscarce resources from the local community and transferring them to the \nschool. The school makes the judgment as to which young person it is \ngoing to select. It is not the individual, it is the school that makes \nthat judgment. It is not choice for the individual or the individual \nparents, it is choice for the school.\n  What are we going to learn from this? If the school system accepts 2 \npercent of the 80,000 students in the District and are able to educate \nthem, are we supposed to assume that because they can, in effect, skim, \nthey do not have to meet other responsibilities or requirements in \naccepting students that may have some language difficulties, or may be \nhomeless, or have other kinds of difficulties? Are we going to say, \nwell, it is a great experiment? Well this has been rejected by 16 \ndifferent States. The only city that has tried that has been Milwaukee, \nand any fair evaluation would show that it is not successful.\n  We do not reject innovative, creative ways at the local community to \nenhance the achievements of education, and we have included and \nsupported many of those proposals in the Goals 2000 legislation and \nother proposals.\n  Basically, those people who are supporting this system said, ``Let's \nhave a competition.'' What happens in the United States when you have a \ncompetition, you have winners and you have losers. What happens on the \nstock market, you have those that make money and those that close their \ndoors.\n  That should not be the test for education in America. We are not \nsaying you will have winners and losers. We are saying that those \nchildren who have those needs ought to be educated in our society, and \nthat reaches the fundamental objection to this proposal. Effectively, \nwe are saying, OK, the 2 percent will be winners, they will be able to \ngo ahead in terms of a private school system, and we are basically \nabandoning all the other children with scarce resources.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very clear what the will of the people \nin the District of Columbia is. It has been so interesting during the \ncourse of this debate and other debates. We hear the statements that \nWashington does not know best. We have here an issue that was rejected \n8 to 1 by the District of Columbia and is being jammed down the throats \nof the people of the District of Columbia. They do not want it. The \nvery way it is constructed in this conference report says that, if they \ndo not use it, they do not get the money. That is a fine choice. That \nis a fine choice to give the people in the District of Columbia. We do \nnot here know what is best. The people in the District of Columbia have \nrejected it and 16 other States have rejected this, but we, in our \nalmighty knowledge, are saying you will have to take it, people in the \nDistrict of Columbia, or otherwise we will not provide these resources.\n  It is an unwise education policy. It will not demonstrate any \ndifferent kind of factors in terms of schools. It is so interesting \nthat those who make the argument talk about what is happening in the \nschools. Give the children an opportunity to escape from crime and \nviolence. At the same time we are reducing the support for drug-free \nschools by 50 percent. Give those children a chance to learn. And at \nthe same time we are reducing our commitment to give those children the \nadvancements in the title I programs and math and science and other \nliteracy programs.\n  What is happening, Mr. President, is a choice. Now, are we going to \nabandon the children of the District of Columbia? I say we should not. \nBy doing so, we will vote ``no'' in terms of the cloture vote.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Massachusetts. The truth of the matter \nis that this is really a dirty trick on the schoolchildren of the \nDistrict. Mr. President, 51 schools are in the District of Columbia, \nand only 8 of the 51 qualify for this so-called $3,000 scholarship. Mr. \nPresident, seven of the eight are religious schools. The $3,000 \nscholarship is not going to get them into schools. They will get them \ninto the courts. It is a dirty trick. It is throwing a 50-yard line to \nthe child 100 yards offshore and telling them to swim for it.\n  Most of all, the very crowd that is sponsoring this nonsense--here I \ncall it nonsense. We are not living up to the needs of public \neducation. The fact is, in order to get this, this year, this Congress \nwould be going into the $5 million a year program, cut $3 billion from \npublic education. It is unheard of to try to start a private program. \nAnd the very crowd that sponsors this nonsense is a group that comes \naround here and beseeches us about balancing the budget and \nconstitutional amendments to balance it and everything else of that \nkind. We are without money, running a $286 billion deficit last year, \n1995. We do not have the money for this, and we are going to start a \nmultibillion-dollar spending program?\n  I said that was my suspicion earlier this week. Now I find it to be \nthe fact, looking at the ``Education Daily,'' and the plan of \nRepresentative Steve Gunderson, Republican of Wisconsin, saying the \nnational program authorizes the spending of up to $1 billion a year for \nvouchers. The $5 million program \n\n[[Page S1405]]\nover the 5 years, in a few days' time, has already gotten to $5 \nbillion. Suppose the program works? Where is the money? Where is that \ncrowd that is going to come up now and start talking about balancing \nthe budgets?\n  Yes, we have to cut spending; yes, in this Senator's opinion, we have \nto increase taxes in order to pay for what we get--not cut taxes. More \nthan anything else, we should not start off on fanciful programs not \nthe responsibility beyond the constitutional function of this Congress \nthat will cost billions more. Do not have this group saying they want \nto balance budgets and in the same breath start $5 billion programs for \nprivate endeavor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my \nfriend and colleague from Vermont. Here we are again. Here we go again. \nI do not know whether we will change any minds, but I do think this is \nan important issue to debate and an important vote.\n  I am disappointed by the extent of opposition to this bill that is \ndesperately needed by the District of Columbia apparently primarily \nbecause of the portion that would establish a scholarship fund for poor \nchildren. I do not get it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nMayor Marion Barry dated February 23, 1996.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The District of Columbia,\n\n                               Washington, DC., February 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: As a member of the Democratic \n     Party, supporter of the District, and a champion of \n     progressive and democratic principles, policies, and ideals, \n     I want to appeal to you to assist the District on our FY 1996 \n     Budget. The Senate is scheduled to vote on cloture for the \n     District of Columbia Appropriations bill, HR 2546, on \n     Tuesday, February 27th. I urge you, in the strongest terms, \n     to support cloture and conclude this long delayed District \n     business.\n       Two hundred forty-seven million dollars ($247) of the \n     District's Federal payment, the compensation that attempts to \n     make up for the significant Congressional limitations on \n     local revenue sources and governing authority, are still \n     unavailable because the appropriations bill, almost 5 months \n     after the start of the fiscal year, has still not been \n     finally approved. The needs of hundreds of thousands of \n     District residents are being held hostage to this delay.\n       Fiscally speaking, we can wait no longer for our Federal \n     payment. We have just completed our 1995 audit showing that \n     we have significantly cut spending in 1995 by $281 million \n     and decreased payroll by over 3,000 employees. The FY 1996 \n     budget emphatically shows that we have stopped the \n     hemorrhaging of spending and reversed the tide. Last week, I \n     released my transformation document and the FY 97 budget \n     which shows a decrease of 10,000 employees by year 2000 and a \n     radical transformation of the D.C. Government. However, this \n     transformation and FY 97 budget is predicated on the FY 96 \n     budget and the full Federal payment. Our radical savings in \n     1997, 98 and 99 are integrally related to this Federal \n     payment in 1996.\n       The District is significantly cash short. We are in a \n     desperate situation. If we do not obtain our $247 million in \n     Federal payment now we will run out of cash by the end of \n     March. We have urgent needs for these delayed funds. Although \n     the Federal payment is less than 20% of the General Fund, it \n     is a critical resource. Our cash flow depends on the $660 \n     million in Federal payment that we should have received on \n     October 1, 1996. Unlike the Federal Government, we cannot \n     borrow right away.\n       Public safety is our top priority yet the delayed Federal \n     payment is hampering our crime fighting capabilities. We have \n     business vendors that are going out of business because of \n     our delayed payments to them. Businesses are laying off \n     employees, closing their doors and vowing never to do \n     business in the District again. School books and building \n     repairs are not possible due to lack of funds. Trash pickups \n     suffer because equipment is old and cannot be repaired. We \n     are 3\\1/2\\ months behind in our Medicaid payments. Our \n     situation is desperate. We need this money immediately.\n       In addition, it is incredible that we have begun the budget \n     process for Fiscal Year 1997 without having Fiscal Year 1996 \n     resolved. We are just beginning our local Council hearings on \n     the FY 97 budget yet we have no FY 96 budget. This situation \n     makes accurate budget determination impossible.\n       I know that many Senators rightfully have serious problems \n     with the voucher programs established in the appropriations \n     bill. So do I. I have disdain for vouchers and have opposed \n     them at every turn in the District. This Appropriations Bill \n     is not a vouchers bill: it does not authorize the District to \n     initiate vouchers, it only gives local officials the option \n     to do so if they chose. As much as I dislike the voucher \n     issue, I cannot go another week without our full Federal \n     payment. Real human suffering is at stake.\n       I urge you to vote for cloture. It is crucial that the \n     District of Columbia be fully funded, as it should have been \n     months ago. Senate Democrats need to allow the District's \n     appropriations Conference Report to be considered so that the \n     District can finally receive its fiscal 1996 appropriations. \n     You have been supportive of the District in the past and I \n     thank you for your support. Today I ask for your support \n     again. I urge you to release this budget and allow us to get \n     on with the business of radically transforming the D.C. \n     Government and providing our residents with the services they \n     deserve. If you have any questions, please call me at 727-\n     6263.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Marion Barry, Jr.,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In this letter, Mayor Barry literally pleads for us, \nfor the sake of fiscal continuity of the District of Columbia, that we \npass this bill. In it he says:\n\n       I know that many Senators rightfully have serious problems \n     with the voucher programs established in the appropriations \n     bill. So do I. . . . This appropriations bill is not a \n     vouchers bill . . . it only gives local officials the option \n     to do so [which is to say initiate a voucher program] If they \n     choose.\n\n  Then he says, ``As much as I dislike the voucher issue, I cannot go \nanother week without our full Federal payment. Real human suffering is \nat stake.''\n  What is stopping us? It is the voucher program. We all know this is \ncontroversial. I notice in the paper that some of my friends from the \nNational Education Association claimed victory on the vote the other \nday, one saying, ``This is much bigger than D.C.''\n  The big point here is the District of Columbia and its future. I \nthink maybe there is something bigger involved in the voucher program, \nbut it is just a question of whether we are going to feel obliged to \ndefend the status quo and the American public education system, which \nwe know is not working for a lot of our children, or whether we will \nexperiment, a very, very small amount of money compared to the billions \nspent on public education, to test what is going to happen to the kids, \npoor kids, whose parents decide they are trapped by their income in \nschools that are not educating them, schools in which they are \nterrorized very often, tragically, the ones who want to learn, by young \nhoodlums, stating it specifically. This program would allow them to \nbreak out of that. Let us see what effect it would have on those kids, \nand let us see what effect it would have on the public schools in the \nDistrict.\n\n  My mind is open. I have been a supporter of this voucher or \nscholarship program, but if these cuts occur and they occur more \nbroadly than contemplated in the bill Senator Coats and I introduced, \nand somehow we find they cripple the public school system, we will step \nback and decide maybe it was not a good idea, was not worth it.\n  I doubt that will happen. I think what is going to happen is we are \ngoing to create some opportunity for kids to break out of the cycle of \npoverty and maybe we are all going to learn a little bit, including the \npublic schools, about how to better educate our children. There are \ntens of thousands of heroes working in our public school system. That \nis the heart of our hopes for the future of our children, the public \nschool system. But it is just not working for a lot of our kids.\n  I really appeal to my friends in the teachers organizations: Do not \nbe defensive about this. You are strong. The public education system \ngets so much of public investment. I so actively support all the \nefforts to reform our public schools. This is not an either/or. If you \nare for the scholarship bill, it does not mean you are against public \neducation.\n  The fact is, what we have to focus on here is the kids. What is best \nfor our children? Is there only one established way to educate them and \nbrighten their future, or can we try another one, without doing damage \nto that?\n  I am not hopeful about the outcome of the vote, but I appeal to my \ncolleagues here. Listen to Mayor Barry's appeal to pass this bill and \ngive this alternative and these 11,000 poor kids in the District a \nchance for a better education and a better life.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time is left? \n  \n[[Page S1406]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains on the time of the Senator from \nVermont, 5 minutes and 50 seconds. The opposition time is 3 minutes and \n17 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will proceed, then.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator wants to make a final \nremark, out of courtesy he is entitled to it. I would make just a brief \nresponse, but I intend to use the 3 or 4 minutes that remain. So, \nwhatever is agreeable to the floor manager.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would prefer--if the Senator would like to proceed at \nthis point, I will allow him to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a final few facts. It has been the \nRepublican Congress that cut back $29 million last year from funding, \npublic support for schools and schoolchildren in the District. They are \ncutting back $15 million this year and giving the $5 million as a bonus \nprize that if the school districts are going to use the voucher system, \nthey can get it. If they do not, they will not. It is legislative \nblackmail, using the worst form of legislative blackmail by using the \nchildren of the District of Columbia as pawns.\n  There is not a person in this body who has not said they would vote \nfor this D.C. appropriations bill, if these three amendments were \nremoved, by voice vote. We can do it now. We can do it this afternoon.\n  This concept has been rejected about trying to jam vouchers down the \nthroat of the District of Columbia. It has been rejected by them 8-to-1 \npreviously. Why do we know better, we here? We could pass the D.C. \nappropriation this afternoon by voice vote in a matter of minutes. But, \nno. They say, even though we have had the vote in the U.S. Senate and \neven though their position has been rejected, we are still going to \nplay the card of ``we are on the side of the District of Columbia's \nchildren, and those that will not permit this to go through are not.''\n  Mr. President, the parents of the District of Columbia ought to know \nwho has been standing by them, not just on this legislation but \nhistorically--historically. We reject that. We believe the time for \npolitical blackmail is over. Let us drop these three provisions, voice \nvote that, get the money and the resources in the District and fight \nfor them to try to get some additional resources to enhance educational \nachievement and accomplishment for the children of the District of \nColumbia.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. All those comments and dire remarks he made would \nhave been perfectly appropriate if we had been talking about the \noriginal House provisions that were in the bill. But that was before \nthe conference report. We are not dealing with the problems that have \nbeen referred to by my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Let me go through this. There is no jamming it down anybody's throat. \nThat comment was made. The District council can refuse to spend a \nsingle penny on tuition scholarships--not a penny. If they do, the \nmoney may be lost if there is no agreement with the scholarship \ncorporation, but there does not need to be a cent spent unless the city \nagrees to spend it.\n  There is a corporation set up which, must agree with the city \ncouncil. The corporation will approve all applications for \nscholarships. In other words, it is not a helter-skelter, ``Here is a \ntuition payment and you can go anywhere you want.'' It has to be \napproved by the scholarship corporation, which must also be reviewed by \nthe District council.\n  Under the conference agreement, not the House version, schools \nenrolling scholarship students must conform to all of the \nconstitutional protections. The disbursal of the funds must be balanced \neconomically. The disbursal of the funds must be balanced \neducationally, so we do not get a disparate amount of money being spent \ntowards those who are better off, even among those who are eligible for \nscholarships--it is all low income--just that they are the economically \nrelatively well-situated.\n  Second, there are two sets of scholarships in the bill. All of the \nmoney can be spent on remedial scholarships, which everybody agrees to. \nThe worst problem the city has right now is we have 20,000 or 30,000 \nyoung people going through the system who are going to either graduate \nfunctionally illiterate or drop out. Those are the ones we are focusing \non in all of the educational reform. The city council priority, I am \nsure, and the pressure of the city, I am sure, will be to spend all of \nthat money or almost all of it on the scholarships which are for \nremedial use, after-school use, or other programs so these kids can be \nbrought up to the status where they can be functionally literate.\n  Also, we must consider what may happen, and I hope does not happen, \non the House side. We have been told that if this loses here, this very \nscaled-down proposal that we are voting on here, not the one that has \nbeen described--if this fails, if this modicum of tuition scholarship \nfails, then we may lose the whole educational package. That would be a \ntravesty; hopefully that will not be the case if we do fail here today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time for just a very brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will suspend at this point for the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just on that reference, as I understand it, under the \nconference committee it creates five new boards, five new boards, and \ndefunds the elected school board of the District of Columbia. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No, the Senator is not correct. This was not the \nintention of the bill, and that will be rectified. But, because the \nDistrict council reduced the budget for the board's staff and \noperations, after the conferees had agreed to this provision, that is \nthe way it could be interpreted. We are willing to reprogram some of \nmoney in this bill for purposes of the board.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But as it stands in this bill, you have funded five new \nboards and failed to fund the school board, as I understand it?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On Tuesday the Senator from Wisconsin and I had a \ncolloquy to clarify the status of the board. Yes, there are other new \nboards that are created for the purposes of educational reform. That is \ncorrect.\n  May I inquire how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and 53 seconds \nremaining. Your opponents have 21 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield whatever time I have.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to close here. I hope this is \nvery clear to my colleagues, and I will make sure they know what we are \nvoting upon today. I hope you would concentrate on what the actual \nsituation is as to the tuition scholarships. There may be not a single \npenny spent unless the city council agrees to it. Keep that in mind. It \nis all local control. The Mayor says it is fine with him because it is \nall local control. So I urge my colleagues to support cloture. I yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1406-S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 52, the nays are 42. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues here wish \nto make a few remarks. I hope that everyone over the coming days, \nbefore we face this issue again, whether it is on another vote to \ninvoke cloture or whether it is on another vote --I think it is wise \nfor all of us to take a look at what must be done if we are going to \nreach a consensus on many issues in this body.\n  As I have tried to let my colleagues know, we worked long and hard, \n90 days, on reaching a compromise with the House. The House is very dug \nin on this issue. We had to make incredibly difficult changes that they \nwould agree to to bring us to a position where I thought we had a bill \nthat could pass the Congress and win support in a highly Democratic \ncity, a highly unionized city, with a very Democratic mayor. I thought \nthat they would agree with the compromise that we reached.\n  It seems difficult for me to perceive or understand as to why this \nbody would disagree with that compromise. If we cannot find a consensus \non this issue, what is going to happen when we get to the three major \nappropriations bills that we still have not dealt with? Are we somehow \ngoing to be able to reach a consensus among the House and this body and \nthe White House? We also have other issues with respect to welfare, \nMedicaid, and all the other issues that are in addition to the \nappropriations bills, which to me are so much more difficult. If we \ncannot reach a consensus on this bill, I do not know what the hope is \nfor the future.\n  I have been in the Congress now for 22 years. During that length of \ntime, I have been on many committees under many different circumstances \nwith respect to which party controls the committees. Many, many \ndifficult issues have been faced during that period of time, and just \nby virtue of the committees I have been on, I have been in the center \nof those.\n  I mentioned ``in the center'', for instance, because if one takes a \nlook at the recent ratings, I am the most liberal Republican Senator \nbut I am more conservative than many Democratic Senators. So where does \nthat put me? It puts me right in the middle. Over the course of time I \nhave found myself in that position and have been able to assist in \nworking out the compromises by my ability to see both sides of the \nissue.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I will reminisce for just a moment. I \nremember at a critical moment during the Reagan administration we were \ndealing with a controversial bill, an employment training bill. I was \nserving in the House, and I got a call from one of the Members of this \nbody who said, ``Jim, we know how hard you worked on this bill, but \nwhen we go to the White House, would you tell them how bad it is, \nbecause if you tell them how bad it is, I think they will accept it?''\n  So I went down to the White House and I made a pitch by saying, ``Oh, \nmy God, it goes too far this way and goes too far that way.'' I got a \nphone call back from that Senator commending me and offering me an \nAcademy Award for my performance. And we reached a consensus. That is \nhow far I would go. Yes, I would have liked to have seen it different, \nbut I was willing to make the compromises that were important to get \nthat bill through.\n  We have to learn how to do that here. I hope in the interim, before \nwe take another vote, that everyone will take a look at what the real \nissues are here.\n  So many of the statements that were made would be true if this was a \nnational proposal to deal with vouchers or even if it was a D.C. \nproposal to have a mandated voucher program for the city. But it is not \nthat.\n  So I urge my colleagues in this interim time, if we cannot reach \nconsensus here, where will we ever do it? If we do not do it with the \nHouse, which has come a long way, in my mind, in reaching consensus \nhere--they had dug their heels in--we run the risk of losing all the \neducational reform that is in the bill, all of which is incredibly \nnecessary for the District. We may even lose the ability to provide \nthem with the $254 million in additional Federal funds which they are \nentitled to under this agreement.\n  So I urge my colleagues to take a close look before we vote again, \nwhenever that may be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \nminority's refusal to allow the Senate to consider the resolution that \nI just offered. This resolution would provide additional funds for the \nWhitewater Special Committee. It would allow the Senate to fulfill its \nobligation to the American people to obtain the full facts about \nWhitewater and related matters.\n  Make no mistake about it, this debate is not about money, it is not \nabout deadlines, it is about getting the facts. That is our job. We are \ncommitted to getting all the facts about Whitewater. It is now quite \nclear that the minority is not. With its actions today, and over the \npast few days, the minority has sent the unmistakable message that it \nwants to prevent the American people from learning the full facts about \nWhitewater. That is wrong. What is the minority concerned about?\n  From the beginning, I have said that our committee must get the facts \nand we must let the chips fall where they may. If the facts exonerate, \nthen so be it. That is good. Again, let the chips fall where they may.\n  If the facts, on the other hand, reveal improper conduct by anyone, \nthe American people have a right to know that as well. Our committee \nwants the facts. The American people are entitled to the facts.\n  Two days ago, we attempted to move to consideration of a resolution \nthat would have funded Whitewater. But the minority invoked Senate \nrules to block floor consideration of that resolution. That is their \nright. But, as the New York Times wrote in a syndicated editorial, \n``The committee, politics notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite \nextension. A Democratic filibuster against it would be silly \nstonewalling.''\n  That, Mr. President, is from an editorial in yesterday's New York \nTimes. That is not a partisan spokesperson, nor a partisan policy \npaper. I will come back to this editorial again. I will ask at this \ntime that the full editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 28, 1996]\n\n                     Extend the Whitewater Inquiry\n\n       Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, reluctantly \n     agreeing to renewal of the Senate Whitewater Committee's \n     expiring mandate, suggests limiting the extension to five \n     weeks, ending April 3. Along with the minority leader, Tom \n     Daschle, and other leading Senate Democrats, Mr. Dodd told \n     reporters yesterday that they were prepared to filibuster \n     against any extension beyond early April.\n       Their position is dictated by worry about the 1996 \n     campaign, and it is understandable that Mr. Dodd, as chairman \n     of the Democratic National Committee, would hope that the \n     public has an endless tolerance of Whitewater evasions. Mr. \n     Dodd has a point in noting that this is a campaign year. It \n     is impossible to separate this matter entirely from partisan \n     pressures. He wants to protect President and Mrs. Clinton \n     from the embarrassment that the chairman of the Whitewater \n     Committee, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, would be pleased to heap \n     upon them.\n       But Senator D'Amato, who by and large has curbed his \n     customary partisan manner, has a stronger point. The Senate's \n     duty cannot be canceled or truncated because of the campaign \n     calendar. Any certain date for terminating the hearings would \n     encourage even more delay in producing subpoenaed documents \n     than the committee has endured since it started last July. \n     The committee has been forced to await such events as the \n     criminal trial next week of James McDougal, a Clinton \n     business partner in the failed Whitewater land venture.\n       No arguments about politics on either side can outweigh the \n     fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full facts \n     about the land venture, the Clintons' relationship to Mr. \n     Douglas banking activities, Hillary Rodham Clinton's work as \n     a lawyer on Whitewater matters and the mysterious movements \n     of documents between the Rose Law Firm, various basements and \n     closets and the Executive Mansion. The committee, politics \n     notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite extension. A \n     Democratic filibuster against it would be silly stonewalling.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let us be clear. All of my colleagues \nhave a right, Democrat or Republican, to utilize all the rules of the \nSenate as it relates to sustaining their position. I certainly do not \nhave a quarrel with that. But I am concerned as it relates to what the \nunderlying objective is. The underlying objective is to prevent the \ncommittee from doing its work, from being the factfinders. That is our \njob. That is a clearly different job from that of the independent \ncounsel or special prosecutor, clearly different. The independent \ncounsel's job is to ascertain whether there was criminal conduct. He \nuses a grand jury, secret proceedings. We are not entitled to know, nor \ndo we know what facts are uncovered. That is a big difference. People \nhave very particular roles, interests, and needs. Witnesses are \nprotected. They are given absolute constitutional guarantees. That is \nas it should be. Most of the discovery of the information and facts is \ndone in camera, secretly. That is a far different role than that of \ncongressional investigatory committees. Let us understand that.\n  There are those who say, ``Why, when you have a special counsel, do \nyou have this committee?'' It is because it is our duty to ascertain \nwhat, if anything, the White House or the administration may have done \nto impede an investigation, which may or may not have criminal \nimplications. It very well may not. But it is our duty to gather those \nfacts. It is our duty to gather the facts as they relate to what, if \nanything, took place, whether proper or improper. The facts may not \nhave criminal implications as they relate to the events that transpired \nin Little Rock, AR. The two investigations are distinct. They are \ndifferent.\n  Indeed, this is not the first time in the history of this country \nthat we have had investigations by congressional committees and, at the \nsame time, by an independent counsel, a special prosecutor. Indeed, we \nhave taken precautions so as not to impede upon the work and make it \nmore difficult for the independent counsel to conduct its work. And it \nis fair to say that much of the delay as it relates to the committee's \nwork has not been created by partisan politics, by Democrats, by the \nWhite House, or others acting in their interests. Let us be fair about \nthat. A good deal of the delay has been occasioned, both for the \nprevious committee that undertook this mission and by this committee, \ndue to our legitimate concerns about the work of the special counsel.\n  Indeed, we have agreed in the resolution that we would not grant \nimmunity where the independent counsel objected. Indeed, we have, \npainstakingly, gone out of our way, notwithstanding our own \nconstitutional responsibilities, not to willy-nilly insist that we get \nour way as it relates to subpoenaing of records, documents, and \nwitnesses. On a number of occasions, we have withheld enforcement of \nsubpoenas for documents because we were advised that it would have an \nimpact on the criminal trial, which will start this Monday in Little \nRock, AR. The defendants in this trial are the present Governor, Jim \nGuy Tucker, and Susan and Jim McDougal, the business partners of the \nClintons.\n  We agreed, Republicans and Democrats, to withhold enforcement of \nthese subpoenas. We have, I believe, made the sensible choice in not \nattempting to force key witnesses to come before this body. When I say \n``this body,'' I am \n\n[[Page S1409]]\ntalking about the committee in its fullest sense, which is \nrepresentative of the Congress of the United States, and more \nparticularly of the Senate of the United States.\n  Although there are key witnesses, I believe it would be irresponsible \nto simply put aside the concerns of the independent counsel and call \nthese witnesses just so that they can give us information. Some of \nthese witnesses have been defendants and have already pled guilty to \nvarious crimes and their testimony may be necessary as it relates to \nthe criminal prosecution which the special counsel, Mr. Starr, is now \nundertaking in Little Rock.\n  We have always maintained that there may come a time when we may have \nto insist upon our prerogatives, we have certain constitutional \nobligations. Even though the independent counsel has his obligations we \nnever agreed that we would at all times forgo calling various \nwitnesses. Indeed, it was the wish and the hope of this Senator, and I \nthink of the majority of the committee, both Democrats and Republicans, \nto have one of the key witnesses, Judge David Hale testify. Judge Hale \nhas apparently made statements, most of them through other people, that \nindicate that he was asked, by the then-Governor of the State to make a \nloan of as much as $300,000 to Mrs. McDougal.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me be clear: I do not know nor do I subscribe \nto the truth or the falsity of that statement. I do not say it to be \nsensational. This has been published. This has been published. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans have been interested in bringing Judge Hale \nbefore the committee.\n  Let me say I think we acted in a responsible way. We attempted to \nmake, and did make contact with his attorney. We were advised that his \nattorney was engaged in a number of matters before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States, and indeed we ascertained that he was; further Judge \nHale's attorney could not even consider these matters until he had \ndisposed of his arguments. While Judge Hale's attorney did recently \ndispose of his last argument--sometime I believe in late January or \nearly February--it was, unfortunately, too close to the approaching \ntrial to call Judge Hale before the committee.\n  I believe, and I was not able to share, through counsel, what his \ndefinitive thinking was, that Mr. Hale was not made available. We were \nled to believe that if we insisted and issued a subpoena, that not \nunlike several other witnesses, Judge Hale's attorney would indicate \nthat his client would raise an issue of privilege, asserting a \nprivilege against self-incrimination.\n  Once this privilege is asserted the Senate rules or the congressional \nrules are quite clear that you can no longer even call the witness to \ntestify. We recall the days gone by when witnesses were called in and \nasked questions and they asserted, under oath, their right not to \nincriminate oneself under the fifth amendment. At some point in our \nhistory, and I do not have the exact date, the Congress decided that \nwas not how the Congress should conduct itself. When Congress is \nadvised, by counsel, that a witness would, assert the privilege of \ntaking the fifth amendment, it no longer could bring the witness in \njust to have a show. To do so would simply appear to be a show where \nyou brought someone in, you asked him a question, he repeated to every \nquestion that he was asserting his rights not to incriminate himself or \nherself.\n  That is the dilemma that we have faced. Otherwise, I want to assure \nthis body it would have been the intent of this Senator, and I believe \nof every member of the committee, to bring Judge Hale forward and to \nfind out what, if anything, he could share. What information he had, \nwhat were the facts to assert. We were unable to do that. We have been \nunable to do that with maybe 11 or 12 various witnesses that are \nconnected with the trial, which will start this coming Monday. Those \nwitnesses are key to our getting the facts, the whole picture.\n  Again, I am not in a position to offer a judgment with respect to \nwhat they may or may not testify to. The information they give to us \nmay be absolutely exculpatory and clear away the cobwebs. They may \ndemonstrate clearly there was no wrongdoing. It may not. But, by gosh, \nwe have an obligation to get the facts.\n  Now, I am going to refer to the New York Times editorial of February \n28. This is an editorial position that has been shared in whole or in \npart by just about every major newspaper. I am talking about the main \neditorial of the New York Times, not a letter to the editor, not \nsomething written by a partisan on one side or the other. The New York \nTimes:\n\n       The Senate's duty cannot be canceled or truncated because \n     of the campaign calendar. Any certain date for terminating \n     the hearings would encourage even more delay in producing \n     subpoenaed documents than the committee has endured since it \n     started last July. The committee has been forced to await \n     such events as the criminal trial next week of James \n     McDougal, a Clinton business partner in the failed Whitewater \n     land venture.\n       No arguments about politics on other side can outweigh the \n     fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full facts \n     about the land venture, the Clintons' relationship to Mr. \n     McDougal's banking activities, Hillary Rodham Clinton's work \n     as a lawyer on Whitewater matters and the mysterious \n     movements of documents between the Rose Law Firm, various \n     basements and closets and the Executive Mansion. The \n     committee, politics notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite \n     extension. A Democratic filibuster against it would be silly \n     stonewalling.\n\n  Mr. President, again, as I have said to my friends and colleagues, \nany colleague, on any side of an issue, of any party has a right to \nraise whatever rules or procedural questions that they deem \nappropriate. I respect everyone's view on this. They have a right. It \nwas never my intent nor did I believe we would be debating this issue \non the Senate floor without having completed or essentially completed \nour work. I did not anticipate, nor do I think the committee \nanticipated, that those delays would take place; some delays may have \nbeen occasionally deliberate; some, perhaps negligent.\n  I am willing to accept the fact that there have been key documents, \nwe wanted from very important people, that were delayed for whatever \nreason. In some situations because a person left and went from one \noffice to another; in another, someone took one position and thought \nthe papers would be turned over; or one attorney thought another \nattorney had turned over papers. I am willing to accept that.\n  But the fact of the matter is that those delays have occasioned the \nproblems that we have. Suppose they were accidental, all of them. \nAccepting that, here is where we are: We have dozens of witnesses yet \nto be examined. It is not because the committee has not been diligent. \nWhile there are those who can come and say, ``You have only met 1 day \nor 3 days,'' that is a bit disingenuous when one understands the \nschedules we have. One must take into consideration the scheduling \ndifficulties the committee faces, first; there are witnesses that we \nhave to accommodate for depositions and testimony; the fact that there \nare at this time, key witnesses that we have been asked not to \nexamine--some because of physical problems, some because of attorneys' \nschedules. We should be candid about this. Let us try to be forthright. \nI do not think we do the process any good by attacking one another, \napplying political labels, indicating that the chairman or anyone else \nis undertaking this because of partisan politics.\n\n  Of course, there are political overtones to this. Everyone \nunderstands that. But, by gosh, we have a duty to get the facts, and we \nshould do it as expeditiously as possible.\n  Under ordinary circumstances I would think we could accomplish this \ntask, if we had access to all of the witnesses and all of the \ndocuments, within a period of 10 weeks or 12 weeks. That should be a \nreasonable period. But I cannot say that. I am not going to be able, \nnor will the committee be able, to ascertain with certainty when we \nwill have completed our business. And let me say this, with all honesty \nand candidness, I know this is a tough debate and I know certain people \nwill be compelled to say certain things. I hope we will not engage in \nthat kind of rhetoric. I have attempted to be moderate. I have really \nattempted to frame this debate in a manner both sides can participate \nin reasonably.\n  I understand the concern of my colleagues when they say, let us not \nrun this investigation into September or October. That is not the \nintent of this Senator. The intent is to get the facts, and I will work \nto do it in a thorough, coordinated, expeditious manner with my \ncolleagues. \n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\n  But the trial of a key witness starts Monday. It may go 4 weeks, 6 \nweeks, 8 weeks. I hope it will end sooner rather than later.\n  The committee must have the opportunity to examine key witnesses and \ndocuments--documents, at the very least, that we should have access to, \nand cannot have access to unless we seek enforcement of the subpoena. \nLet me ask, should we have insisted that documents from various \nwitnesses be produced, notwithstanding the concern of the court--we had \na right to do it, constitutionally. We could have ordered enforcement \nof those subpoenas. But we decided together, Democrats and Republicans, \nthat it would not be in the interest of this body to delay that \nprosecution. If we enforced the subpoenas the defendants rightfully, \ncould ask,--and we were advised through their attorneys, would ask--to \nput that case off.\n  We withheld. I think that was the prudent action. We could have \ninsisted on enforcing the subpoena. I do not think we would have met \nthe mandate under that resolution because the resolution was quite \nclear. The leaders, Democrat and Republican, were concerned that we not \nimpede the independent counsel.\n  We had other questions, as it related to Iran-Contra, whether or not \nimmunity should or should not be granted. This committee never even \ncrossed that bridge. We could have asked the Senate to consider, or the \ncommittee to consider, granting immunity. I think it would have been \nirresponsible. I think the committee would have decided against it, \nparticularly in light of the objection that would have come.\n  I am not going to characterize the suggestion that was put forth by \nmy Democratic colleagues as anything but a sincere attempt to establish \na timeframe so that we could wind up the business of the committee. It \nwas a bona fide offer. I will accept that. But I have to tell you, \nthen, and we say it publicly, that I hope you will understand why, \nnotwithstanding the good intention or motivations, that my colleagues' \noffer was impossible to accept.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No. I would like to complete my statement. I certainly \nwill yield for questions. And I assure my colleague he will have an \nopportunity to make whatever observations he wishes.\n  I cannot accept my colleagues offer simply because we would not even \nbegin to have access to key documents and key witnesses until after \nthat trial. We may never get them and if we do not get them, then we \nwill have to wind up, and we will.\n  It is the hope of this Senator, without setting a specific time \nlimit, that we can conclude the business of this committee within 6 to \n8 weeks after the conclusion of that trial--I say conclude the business \nof this committee in a way that makes sense--quickly and expeditiously, \nbut only after we have either gathered all of the facts or made every \nreasonable and possible effort to have those facts.\n  Let me tell you the problem in agreeing to a time limit. It is \nspelled out in a book called, ``Men Of Zeal.'' This book was coauthored \nby two of our distinguished colleagues, two of our most distinguished \ncolleagues, both of them from Maine, the former Democratic majority \nleader, Senator George Mitchell, and our own colleague, Senator Bill \nCohen. In ``Men Of Zeal'' they talk about ``a candid inside story of \nthe Iran-Contra hearings.'' I turn to one of the observations that was \nmade, as it fits the situation and the dilemma that we have here now, a \nbona fide dilemma. Some can say, ``Senator D'Amato, you are a proponent \nof Senator Dole. You are on his campaign team. Therefore, you have a \nreason and the occasion, to make this go longer.'' That is not true.\n  I do support Senator Dole. By the way, it is a constitutional right \nof every citizen to support whomever he chooses. And I hope, when we go \nin to do the business of the committee--we understand that we have \ndifferent political philosophies, that we can support different \ncandidates. I respect that right of all of my colleagues. But to simply \nsay that because you are campaigning on behalf of one candidate, then, \nyou cannot discharge your duties, I think is rather illogical. We would \nwipe out everybody.\n  All of my friends on the Democratic side, I think with very few \nexceptions--I can think of only one, whose remarks may not have been \ninterpreted as fully supportive of the President of the United States--\nare fully supportive of the President and the leader of their party. \nDoes that mean they should all, therefore, be disqualified? That they \ncannot make rational judgments? Or that all of their judgments will be \nmade just simply on a partisan basis? I hope that is not the case.\n  I do not think that it is right to then apply that logic to a Member \nor Members of the Republican side, to say you cannot make judgments \nbecause you support this candidate, you are in a key position, and \ntherefore you are not going to be able to be impartial and fair.\n  I have attempted to discharge my duties in a fair and even-handed \nway. I have attempted to do that. I am not going to tell you that I \nhave not made mistakes. But certainly I hope that the minority will \nacknowledge that we have attempted to run this committee in a fair \nmanner; wherever possible, and in 90 percent of the cases, subpoenas \nthat have been issued in a bipartisan manner; in terms of working out \nproblems--even when we have had some of the most rancorous \ndisagreements, we have eventually been able to settle them.\n  I am not going to be able to, nor will I attempt to, say who has been \nright and who has been wrong. Sometimes we may have asked for \ninformation in an overreaching way. And my colleagues rightfully have \nsaid, ``Wait a second.'' And we have attempted to accommodate their \nconcerns.\n  There was only one instance when we came to the floor of this Senate, \nwhere we could not reach an agreement, and even in that case eventually \nwe did. And the information that we sought-- let me go right to the \nheart of it, the notes of one of the White House employees, Mr. \nKennedy--was found to be appropriate. I ask anybody if they thought we \ngot information we were not entitled to? Of course we were entitled to \nthat information. You cannot on one hand say we are being cooperative, \nwe will not raise the privilege issue, executive privilege, and then on \nthe other withhold. So we even in this case; but again the important \nthing is that we came to a definitive termination that avoided a test \nin the courts. Those famous notes revealed a series of meetings. They \nrevealed the question of the Rose Law Firm and, of course, even now is \nopen to interpretation as to a question of what they mean by a \n``vacuum'' in the Rose files. Reasonable people might disagree on that. \nI would find it hard to give one interpretation. But that is honest \ndisagreement.\n\n  One of the reasons that our colleagues find that we are in this \nposition today is because we did not think--nor did I believe--that \nthere would be these delays. It was my hope that we would wind these \nhearings up before we got into this session. It was always my hope. \nWhen I say session I am talking about and I should say season; the \npolitical season that is upon us but still has not come upon us as it \nrelates to the general election. And again, I hope that we can bring \nthese hearings and get the facts sooner rather than later. I am not \nlooking to run this thing. I say that to my friend and colleague, \nSenator Daschle, and other colleagues.\n  But here is the problem that I have and I think we legitimately have. \nAnd it is not something that is new. It is not novel. It did not just \nbecome visited upon us. And our colleagues in their book, again, ``Men \nof Zeal,'' by Senator Cohen and former majority leader, Democratic \nmajority leader, Senator Mitchell, said finding the committee's \ndeadline--talking about the Iran-Contra, and the deadline that they had \nfixed to the committee to finish its work--``provided a convenient \nstratagem for those who were determined not to cooperate. Bureaucrats \nin some agencies appeared to be attempting to thwart the investigative \nprocess by delivering documents at an extraordinarily slow pace.''\n  This was their observation about what took place during these \nhearings less than 10 years ago; during their problems. Listen to that. \n``Bureaucrats in some agencies appeared to be attempting to thwart the \ninvestigative process by delivering documents at an extraordinarily \nslow pace.'' \n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  I mean as much as things change they never change, when you set a \ndeadline on these kinds of things, as our colleagues are calling for. \n``But, perhaps most importantly, the deadline provided critical \nleverage for attorneys of witnesses in dealing with the committee on \nwhether their clients would appear without immunity and when in the \nprocess they might be called.''\n  I have to tell you that we have been experiencing that. That is not \nbecause of the ill will of my Democratic colleagues. I do not say that \nis a cabal that has been hatched by the Democratic Party, or their \nstratagem. I just say if you are an attorney representing your client \nand you are going to do what you can to protect the client--and it may \nbe that you are going to assert various privileges--It may be that you \nare going to do whatever you can to get past a particular time or \ndeadline. That is a fact.\n  Let me go to one of the conclusions again, and it is important to \nknow that these men--colleagues of ours, distinguished colleagues of \nours, the former Democratic leader writing this to share with us their \ninsight, candid inside story, of not only the events that transpired, \nin the attempt to leave us a blueprint for what we should or should not \ndo and some of the problems attendant--in their conclusions they say, \n``Setting fixed deadlines for the completion of congressional \ninvestigations should be avoided.''\n  This is not Senator D'Amato. They go on to say, ``Such decisions are \noften dictated by political circumstances and the need to avoid the \nappearance of partisanship.''\n  I suggest to you that is one of the reasons we originally set a time \nlimit because we wanted to avoid that. It is exactly on point, and it \nis the intent of this Senator--and it is still the intent of this \nSenator--to keep this out of the partisanship. The Banking Committee, \nwhich essentially serves as the mainstay of this Whitewater committee, \nhas acted in a bipartisan manner, I have to tell you, in 90 percent of \nour undertakings.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about that. It is not the intent of the \nchairman of that committee to bring us into a situation that is not \ngoing to reflect well upon Republicans or Democrats--the work of the \ncommittee, both the Banking Committee and now as a Whitewater \ncommittee. It is not my intent. Indeed, it was with that intent in mind \nthat we worked out a date for attempting to finish--listen to the words \nwhich are prophetic. I wish my colleagues, when we were attempting to \naffix a time limit to this that would have been cognizant of this \nwarning because that is what it is. ``Setting fixed deadlines for \ninvestigations should be avoided.'' And it goes on to say again with \ngreat clarity, ``But such decisions are often dictated by political \ncircumstances, and the need to avoid the appearance of partisanship.'' \nThat is how it is that we came to this situation. ``In this case, a \ncompromise was struck between those who believed an adequate \ninvestigation could be completed within 2 or 3 months and those who \nbelieved no time limitation was necessary.''\n  It goes on to conclude that, ``We hope that in future cases such an \nartificial restraint on this pursuit of facts will not be necessary.''\n  That is what we have. We have an artificial restraint in the pursuit \nof facts, not occasioned by meanspiritedness, not occasioned by \nbenevolence, no one fixed this date. As a matter of fact, we chose this \ndate to attempt to avoid this debate.\n  Look. The Rules Committee did not have a quorum. Otherwise, we could \nhave brought this amendment to the floor without asking for unanimous \nconsent. I hope that next week at some point--I think Tuesday--the \nRules Committee is scheduled again to take this matter up so that we \ncan come to the floor without asking unanimous consent. At that point, \nmy colleagues will have every right to raise their objections to have \nextended debate; indeed to undertake that which we have commonly \nknown--and they are determined not to have a vote--as a filibuster. I \nthink that would be wrong. But that is their right. I still hold out \nthe hope that somehow, some way, men and women of good will can work \nout a way in which the committee can proceed to do its work without the \nneed for us tying up the floor for days creating a political event, one \nthat is highly charged, one that I suggest does not benefit either \nRepublican or Democrat, one which I would just as soon avoid. I say \nthat with all sincerity. I think I have some credibility with my \ncolleagues that if I give a commitment, I keep the commitment. I want \nto work out this dilemma.\n  I thank my colleagues for being patient so I could give a speech that \nis not all written down with dates and times and who held back what and \nwhy and when. We are here at this point. I say let us say that \neverybody had engaged in this with their best effort--the White House \nwitnesses, the people that have been called forth. We still do not have \nthe facts. Let us not ascribe it to ill will. We have a duty to gather \nthe facts. Let us see if we cannot do it in a way that makes sense, \nthat fulfills the obligations of the committee without the rancor, and \nwithout the partisanship.\n  Let me say this to you. This is not one-sided. I do not say here that \nmy colleagues on the Democratic side have been the only ones to make \nunwarranted attacks. There have been plenty of attacks on both sides. \nThere has been plenty of conjecture --plenty of it. I think it is about \ntime though, that at least we control our own actions; we cannot \ncontrol everybody out there in the universe. We cannot even control \nsome of those who support us on either the Democratic or the Republican \nside. But at least we can control how we conduct ourselves, and how we \nmove forward with what statements we make.\n  I could fight it out just as tough as anybody else. I do not think I \nam known as a shrinking violet. I have to tell you I think there is a \npoint when we should attempt to come together--we have between now and \nnext Tuesday--to see if we cannot work out some reasonable way to avoid \nsome of the pitfalls that have been outlined in ``Men of Zeal'' and \nthose pitfalls that we have already experienced. Again, if we set an \narbitrary time limit, it invites the kind of thing that our colleagues, \nSenator Cohen, and former Democratic leader, Senator Mitchell, \nexperienced. It will inevitably take place. We have seen some of that \nalready. Again, I do not say it will be through any malicious actions \nof one party or the other.\n  Again, if you are an attorney attempting to defend your client, you \nare going to avail yourself of everything possible. You are not going \nto be concerned about the committee and its duty.\n  I would suggest, by the way--and I just leave you with this last \nthought--if we do not set a time line it will provide occasion to those \nwho may be attempting to hold back to get past that date, to be more \nforthcoming because they are going to know that these matters, whatever \nthey are, whatever the testimony, whatever the documents are going to \ncome out. Better to let the chips fall where they may now as opposed to \nlater.\n  I suggest to you that we will probably have a good chance of winding \nthis up sooner rather than later. Can I give assurance, and I am \nwilling to give assurance as to some specific time that we will cut it \noff? If the facts lead us to move forward, or if we have the occasion \nto move forward, then I think we will have to do that. Maybe we can \nagree to a situation whereby after the trial--and I am putting this \nforth; I am thinking out loud; I suggest this to the Democratic \nleader--after the trial, and after a certain period of time, that the \nleaders will confer again and we may have to come back to the \ninvestigation. You may at that time say it is unreasonable or we are \ngoing to a filibuster or we are not going to do it.\n  But let us attempt to work our way out of this together as opposed to \nus insisting and my colleagues and friends on the other side of the \naisle taking their position of raising their rights and going to a \nfilibuster. Let us see if we cannot find a solution to this problem \nthat will permit the committee to do its work in the proper way, and to \nfind the facts.\n  I thank my colleagues and my friends for affording me this \nopportunity.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, my colleagues from the Banking Committee, \nespecially the ranking member and \n\n[[Page S1412]]\nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, are far more qualified to \naddress many of the points raised by the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee than am I. And let me say at the outset, I thank them for the \nremarkable job that they have done over the months in addressing this \nvery difficult matter as ably as they have, day after day, week after \nweek. I will leave it to them to raise many of our shared concerns and \nrespond to many of the specific points that have been raised by the \nchairman.\n  The chairman has spoken now for over 45 minutes. In spite of all of \nhis assurances and in spite of all of the explanation we have just \nheard, Mr. President, this issue boils down to one which is very \nsimple. This issue has now become a political one.\n  The motivation is very clear. It is politics pure and simple. That is \nwhat it is. We ought to recognize it as that. We need to deal with it. \nWe ought to confront it. We ought to try to find ways to contain it. \nBut that is really what this issue is about. It is politics. And the \nchairman so ably stated before the Senate Rules Committee a year ago \nthat the single biggest reason why it was so imperative that we finish \nby the 29th of February--the 29th of February--is that, and I quote, \n``We want to keep it out of the political arena, and that is why we \nhave decided to come up with a 1-year request.''\n  That is our chairman. He was right then. And unfortunately, I am \ndisappointed that he has changed his mind now. There has never in the \nhistory, to our knowledge, of the Senate been a request of this kind--\nnever. It is unprecedented. No one has ever said we want a fishing \nlicense to allow us to go for whatever length of time it takes. Such \nproposal has never been made before. And never have we found ourselves \nin a situation like this in a Presidential year.\n  Is it coincidental that given all the problems we see now in the \nRepublican Party that they conveniently need another 6 or 7 months to \ntake this into the Republican and Democratic Conventions? Is that what \nit is all about? This is unprecedented, and it is wrong. I daresay \nthere are a lot of Members on the other side of the aisle who know it \nis wrong.\n  Mr. President, it is not just the length of time and the amount of \nmoney that we have already expended that concerns me; it is the nature \nof this whole investigation. Were it not for the able leadership given \non so many occasions by the ranking member and so many of our \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, I do not know what this committee \nwould have done. But to make an initial request that over an 18-month \nperiod any communication of any kind relating to any subject by the \nPresident, the First Lady, any present or former White House employee \nor any employee of the RTC and dozen and dozens of other named \nindividuals be turned over, is that a fishing license or what? Is that \na witch hunt or what?\n  The committee authorized a subpoena asking for all telephone calls \nfrom the White House to area code 501, the entire State of Arkansas, \nfor a 7-month period. What is that? Is that a reasonable request? Above \nand beyond the committee's overbroad authorization, the majority staff \nunilaterally issued a subpoena for all White House telephone calls from \nany White House telephone or communications device for a 7-month period \nto anywhere in the country.\n  So I hear the chairman talk about how difficult it has been to get a \nresponse from the White House, how much they have been dragging their \nfeet. My heavens, how could anyone comply with requests of that nature. \nI am surprised that they have gotten anything if the nature of the \nrequests has been as broad as this. But the fact is that White House \ncooperation has been extensive. So that is point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2 is that this committee has already been operating longer \nthan any other we have experienced in the Senate in recent history. The \nWhitewater committee has now run for 20 months, almost 2 full years. \nHow does that compare to ABSCAM? Do you remember that one? That lasted \n9 months. What about the POW/MIA committee? I was on that one. The \neffort that we made on both sides of the aisle to come up with \ninformation about what happened in Vietnam, what happened to all of the \nPOW's and MIA's who are still missing, do you know how long we spent on \nthat? The Congress spent 17 months investigating that, and came up with \na 1,000-plus page report. Watergate only lasted 16 months. The Iran-\nContra hearing mentioned by the chairman, that only lasted 10 months.\n  So, Mr. President, I must say 20 months and counting with a request \nfor an indefinite time period from here on out to keep going regardless \nseems extreme. Our majority leader had it right. Our majority leader in \ntalking about this issue--and you talk about men of zeal; he could \nwrite a chapter himself--this is what the majority leader had to say. \nHe said, ``If we get bogged down in finger pointing, in tearing down \nthe President and the administration, we are not just going to be up to \nthe challenges ahead but all of us, all Americans will be the losers.'' \nThat was the majority leader, Bob Dole, as he was talking about the \nIran-Contra inquiry. They made a prudent decision to come to some \nclosure here. They took 10 months to do their work.\n  The third point I would say is equally as important. I do not know \nhow much longer we can continue to ask the taxpayers to fund this \nfishing expedition. We have already spent over $1.3 million. The \nindependent counsel has spent $26 million and counting. We do not know \nhow much the House has spent. But it is our estimation that we have \nalready spent over $30 million investigating this matter--$30 million.\n  I do not know whether anybody cares about what that would buy, but it \nbuys about 26 million school lunches. It would fund 400 cops on the \nstreet, and 15,000 computers in America's classrooms. I could go on and \non, if you want to get a better picture of what $30 million buys.\n  And when you talk about hearings, it is interesting; the American \npeople want us to start looking into ways we can improve public \neducation, ways we can improve the crime situation, ways that we can \ndeal with good jobs and good health care. Do you how many hearings we \nhave held on crime? We have had 12 days in this entire 104th Congress \non crime. Do you know how many days we have spent on jobs in this whole \n104th Congress? We have spent zero days. We have not found the time to \nfind 1 day to ask people to come in to see if we can deal with the \nchronic problems we have in the economy in dealing with underemployed \nand unemployed people.\n  What about health care? We have not found the time to hold any \nhearings for health care either. Zero. Zero days on health care, zero \ndays on jobs and the economy, 3 days on public education.\n  So I do not know, Mr. President, it seems to me we ought to be \nrelooking at what our priorities are in this Senate.\n  The fourth point I would make is this. The chairman has said time and \nagain that he has to wait for the end of the trials that are ongoing. \nThe independent counsel begins next week. But we also know that on \nOctober 2 the chairman advised Kenneth Starr that the special committee \ndid not intend to call the trial defendants and could not delay the \ncommittee's proceedings to accommodate the independent counsel.\n  There has not been any change in the factual circumstances, Mr. \nPresident, to explain this--I will not call it a flip-flop--but this \nchange of heart on the part of the chairman. In any event, regardless \nof why he has changed his mind in that short period between October 2 \nand now, February 29, the legal proceedings relating to those trials \ncould go on for years. We have seen it happen in Iran-Contra. We have \nseen it happen in a whole range of other cases. We have no guarantee it \nis going to be finished this year. I think there is a chance that none \nof us may be in the Senate when all that work gets done. Who knows how \nlong this is going to last. And whether convicted or acquitted, the \ndefendants retain their fifth amendment protections against self-\nincrimination. So no one should be misled, the end of the first phase \nof those court proceedings are by no means--no means--an indication \nthat they will then be prepared to come before the Banking Committee.\n  So, Mr. President, the American people know what this is all about. \nThey know it is a political fishing expedition. Poll after poll has \nshown what we already know in this Chamber. The \n\n[[Page S1413]]\nD'Amato hearings are politically driven. By a large margin, the poll \njust completed yesterday, 66 to 22, the D'Amato hearings are seen as \npolitically driven. The public opposes granting----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, personal privilege. I do not think the \nminority leader--may I make a point of order? When we address Members \nand begin to address Members by their names, when we begin to bring \nthis business of calling them ``D'Amato hearings,'' I think that the \nminority leader is out of line. I make that point.\n  Now, if the minority leader wants to attempt to get into \npersonalization, then take it off the floor. Then you might be \nabsolutely within your rights as a citizen, but not on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the hearings chaired by the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Senator D'Amato, are hearings that the public \nfully appreciates and fully understands. The hearings chaired by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, are political. By \n71-23 percent, the American people say it is time to let the \nindependent counsel complete its work.\n  We have laid out in as clear a way as we can our sincere desire to \ncome to some resolution to this issue. In the last several days we have \nmade a good-faith effort to say, let us resolve it. We do not want to \npoliticize it, we do not want it to drag on forever, as some on the \nother side would have us do. We have proposed that we finish the \nhearings by April 3 and complete our work by May 10. That is \nreasonable. It is way beyond what any other committee has done on any \nother set of circumstances involving investigations in the past.\n  We, too, hope we will not be compelled to prevent the committee from \ncompleting their work next week. Let us resolve this matter in a \nbipartisan way, in a way that accommodates the needs of the committee \nbut also accommodates the recognition that we need to do our job on a \nwhole range of other issues that must be addressed this year. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the distinguished minority leader, when this \nresolution was enacted under which the special committee has been \noperated with the February 29 deadline, was it not the recognized \nintention at the time that this was in an effort to keep it out of the \npolitical season?\n  In fact, the chairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, stated when \nwe were before the Rules Committee--and I quote him--``We wanted to \nkeep it out of that political arena. That is why we decided to come \nforth with just the 1-year request.''\n  And I, in appearing with him before the Rules Committee, stated, ``I \nthink it is important to try to finish this inquiry, to be very candid \nabout it, and not take it into an election year with the appearance and \nthe aspect that it is an election-year political effort.''\n  I say to the leader, was it not the understanding at the time that we \nwished to keep it out of the political season, a view expressed by both \nRepublicans and Democrats?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will allow me to respond, Mr. President, \nthe answer is absolutely yes. We decided last year that this had \nextraordinary political sensitivity. We understood last year that this \nwould be a Presidential election year, and that before we got mired in \nall the Presidential politics, before we ended up trying to resolve \nthis in the midst of Republican and Democratic conventions, that it was \ncritical that we came to closure. That was critical, that we allow the \nindependent counsel to do its work. That is why Senator D'Amato said it \nso well: ``We want to keep it out of the political arena. That is why \nwe feel the need for a 1-year request.''\n  So the Senator from Maryland is absolutely right. It was our \nintention back then, it is our intention now. Let us keep it out of the \npolitical arena.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This issue that we are facing now has been prompted, \nhas it not, by the request by the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, for an additional \n$600,000 to carry on the inquiry for an unlimited period of time?\n  The distinguished minority leader put forward a proposition to allow \nthe committee to continue until the 3rd of April with hearings and a \nlittle over a month thereafter to file the report with additional \nfunding of $185,000, which would enable the committee to go on to do \nthe last set of hearings but not involve us in an open-ended inquiry \nthat could carry right through the entire political year. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. Our intent--I think the intent \nof every Member when they voted on the authorization last year--was to \nmaximize the opportunity that we get our work done, to do all we could \nto resolve what outstanding questions there were, and then to complete \nour work with the opportunity to write a report by February 29.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Chairman D'Amato has quoted the Iran-Contra. I just \nwant to turn to that for a moment, if the distinguished leader would \nindulge me. At that time Senator Dole--and the distinguished leader \nquoted one of his quotes--but Senator Dole also said, ``I am heartened \nby what I understand to be the strong commitment of both the chairman \nand the vice chairman to avoid fishing expeditions and to keep the \ncommittee focused on the real issues.'' He was working for a limited \ntime period, originally just 3 months. In the end, a longer period was \nestablished. But it was pointed out at that time that it escaped no \none's attention that an investigation that spilled into 1988 could only \nhelp keep Republicans on the defensive during the election year.\n  Chairman Inouye, who chaired the Senate committee, and Chairman \nHamilton, who chaired the House committee, recommended rejecting the \nopportunity to prolong and thereby exploit President Reagan's \ndifficulties. In other words, they were not willing to turn it into a \npolitical gain, which is what is now happening here. They determined \nthat 10 months would provide enough time to uncover any wrongdoing.\n  Let me say to the leader, in order to meet that standard, the Iran-\nContra committee, in the period between July 7 and August 6, held 21 \ndays of hearings. It met Monday through Friday, over a 5-week period, \nwith only 3 open days during that period. There were 21 hearings--this \nis Iran-Contra--in order to complete its work, keep it out of the 1988 \nelection year, and not turn it into a political charade.\n  We urged the chairman of the committee earlier. In fact, the \ndistinguished leader, I believe, wrote to the majority leader in the \nmiddle of January urging that the committee intensify its work in order \nto complete it by the February 29 date; is that not correct?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Based upon \nconversations, discussions we had with members of the committee, it \nbecame apparent we were not maximizing the opportunities that were \nalready there. We went days, in some cases weeks, without any hearings \nin the committee, delaying, it seemed to us, in a very concerted and \nintentional way the opportunities to complete the work on time.\n  So without any doubt, there have been many, many opportunities for \nthe committee to continue to do the work that the chairman articulated \nin his remarks. We have run out of time not because we have run out of \ncalendar, but because we did not use the time appropriately.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the minority leader is absolutely correct.\n  Let me draw this contrast. I want Members to focus on this. This is \nthe hearing schedule in the Iran-Contra hearings, an instance in which \nthe Democratically controlled Congress set a date and undertook to meet \nit in order to keep that inquiry out of--out of--the Presidential \nelection year. In other words, we sought not to play politics with that \nissue, and in order to complete in a 1-month period, we held 21 days of \nhearings in order to complete that work.\n  Contrast that with the Whitewater hearings over the last 2 months of \nthe committee's existence--not the last 1 month; the last 2 months. In \nJanuary, no hearings this week; no hearings except 1 day; no hearings \nhere except 2 days; no hearings here except 2 days; 2 days. Eight days \nof hearings over the entire month of January, 8 days only during the \nentire month of January. \n\n[[Page S1414]]\n Actually 7 days. I misspoke; 7 days of hearings.\n  In February, did it get much better? No, it did not. In the month of \nFebruary, 8 days of hearings. Seven days in January, 8 in February, for \na total of 15 over a 2-month period, as we are coming toward the \ndeadline. Contrast that with the Iran-Contra committee, which held 21 \ndays of hearings in a 1-month period as it approached its deadline in \norder to complete its work.\n  In fact, this week there are no hearings at all. Last week, there was \nonly one hearing. So instead of an intensification, which the leader \nrequested and which we urged on the chairman of the committee, we had \njust the contrary--just the contrary.\n  It was our articulated position in mid-January, and one I continue to \nhold to in retrospect, that if we had followed an intense hearing \nschedule, as the Iran-Contra committee did, the work could have been \ncompleted. That did not happen. Then we get a request for $600,000, \nwhich would take this committee's allocation up to $2 million, and an \nindefinite time period for the inquiry.\n  The minority leader, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, \noffered an alternative, which I thought was eminently reasonable. The \nalternative of the minority leader provided that the hearing schedule \nwould be extended 5 weeks, until the 3rd of April, and the time for the \nfiling of the report until the 10th of May.\n  This matter was taken up in the committee and it was rejected, I \nregret to say, on a straight party-line vote of 9 to 7; an eminently \nreasonable proposal. The proposition now that advanced out of the \nBanking Committee and went to the Rules Committee, the resolution that \nChairman D'Amato is referring to, is a proposal for $600,000 and an \nindefinite time period, which, of course, guarantees that this matter \nwill be carried out right through the election year.\n  The public confidence in this inquiry, to the extent it has not yet \nbeen eroded, will, in my judgment, be severely eroded by pushing this \ninquiry further and further into the election year. That was recognized \nwhen we passed Resolution 120.\n  I think there is a growing perception in the country that these \nhearings are being seen as being politically driven. Of course, that \nundercuts the credibility of the hearings. The public contrasts the \nattention and hearings here compared with no hearings on Medicare cuts, \nhardly any hearings on jobs, and so forth. The independent counsel is \nthere to carry out inquiry, in any event, and many obviously feel that \nhe should be allowed to do his work.\n  No congressional committee has ever placed itself behind an \nindependent counsel. We did not do that in Iran-Contra, and we should \nnot do it here.\n  I say to the leader that an intense hearing schedule could complete \nthis matter. That is what ought to be done. I think the proposition put \nforward by the leader is right on target.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I can just respond to a point made by the \ndistinguished ranking member, I direct attention, again, to the chart \nthat the distinguished ranking member has displayed, because I think it \nreally--keep the one that is right here; that is the one that I think \nsays a lot.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have both January and February.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. But the one in February, I think, makes the point you \nhave been making very well. We have heard the assertions by the \nchairman of the committee that, indeed, they need the extension of time \nto hold more hearings. And yet, if you look at just February, no \nhearings were held on Mondays. No hearings in the entire month of \nFebruary were held on Fridays. No hearings in the entire last week \nprior to the expiration of the resolution were held at all. No \nhearings, except for one, were held in the second to the last week in \nFebruary.\n  So it seems to me, Mr. President, that, indeed, this chart speaks for \nitself and is the best response we can make to the consideration of \nadditional time.\n  If there was such a need, why did they not meet on Mondays? Why did \nthey not feel the need to meet on Fridays? Why did they not hold any \nhearings in the last week in February? Why just one in the second to \nthe last week?\n  Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for so clearly articulating \nwhat the circumstance has been during this critical last month of \neffort by the committee itself.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me just make the further point to the leader, in \nthese months of January and February, the Senate was not in session \nvoting on the floor. We urged the chairman of the committee to have an \nintense hearing schedule, which would be made easier by the fact that \nit would not be interrupted for votes, that we would be able to really \nbegin early in the morning and go late into the day.\n  Many of these hearings that were held began at 10:30 or 11 o'clock \nand ran until 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Not all of them; some \nextended through the day. But once again, the comparison between this \nhearing schedule and what occurred in the last month of Iran-Contra is \nabsolutely dramatic.\n  In spite of the fact that we did not have intensified hearings, the \nminority leader said, ``Well, we'll provide some additional time.'' \nThat was the alternative that was offered.\n  In other words, Chairman D'Amato said, ``Well, we want the $600,000, \nand we want an unlimited time period to carry on this inquiry,'' right \nstraight through 1996, I assume, until the eve of the election. My \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois commented in the committee one \nday. He said, ``There will be no more hearings after November 5.'' He \nsaid, ``I can guarantee you that,'' if he will recall making that \nstatement. That would obviously make it political--the very thing that \nSenator Dole spoke about in 1987 when we were considering the Iran-\nContra, and the very thing that was spoken about here last year when we \nwere considering this committee, on both sides of the aisle. Then at \nleast there was a recognition of the desirability of keeping it out of \nthe political year, not politicizing the inquiry, and not leading to a \npublic perception that what was going on was a straight political \nexercise.\n  Now, the minority leader, in order to try to accommodate, I thought, \nmade a very reasonable proposal. That is the one that we offered in the \ncommittee and, unfortunately, it was rejected on a straight partisan \nvote. A straight partisan vote rejected the proposition for a further \nextension until the 3d of April, and some time beyond that, to do the \nreport. And so the proposition now that moved out of our committee, and \nis pending in the Rules Committee, is for an indefinite extension and \n$600,000 worth of additional money.\n  I say to the distinguished leader that, in my perception, he has \noffered a very reasonable proposition. My own strong view, obviously, \nis that it should have been accepted. I do not think that we ought to \nundertake an indefinite extension. I think that is an unreasonable \nproposal on its face, and that is the issue that is now joined, that we \nare now contending with here on the floor of the Senate. But the \ncontrast between Iran-Contra and how that was handled by a Democratic \nCongress with a Republican administration could not be sharper.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the minority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will soon yield. I was just given a notice that would \nbe of interest, I think, to our colleagues. Congressman Henry Gonzalez \njust released the February 25, 1996, supplemental report to the \nResolution Trust Corporation, entitled ``A Report on the Representation \nof Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan by the Rose Law Firm.'' In \nreleasing the document, Congressman Gonzalez makes the following very \nbrief statement:\n\n       The report completely supports the Clintons and shows that \n     they have been wrongly accused. The report shows clearly that \n     the Clintons told the truth about Whitewater. As for Madison \n     Guaranty Savings and Loan, the Clintons knew nothing about \n     the shady activities of Madison's owners. With regard to the \n     charges that Mrs. Clinton knew about wrongdoing in the Casa \n     Grande development, the report shows that these claims are \n     false.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was going to raise that question. I was \nwondering whether or not the minority leader is familiar that the \nreport prepared by Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, at the cost, I point \nout, of nearly $4 million, using the services of former Republican U.S. \nattorney Jay Stephens. They reached the conclusion--to quote from the \nreport, that ``there existed no basis \n\n[[Page S1415]]\nwhatsoever. There is no evidence, however, that the Rose Law Firm had \nanything to do with the sales. In essence the evidence suggests that \nthese transactions were put together by Mr. McDougal and others at \nMadison.'' It further concludes, ``It provides no basis for any sort of \nclaim against the Rose Law Firm and, hence, Mrs. Clinton.''\n  I point that out and ask the leader whether or not he is aware of \nthis. But the earlier report, which this latest report supplements, \nconcludes on page 78 of the report, ``Therefore, pending the results of \nthe criminal case, it is recommended that no further resources be \nexpended on the Whitewater part of the investigation.'' Was the \nminority leader aware of that conclusion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the distinguished Senator of Connecticut \nthat I was not aware, until today, that the report had been completed \nand made available, and that it had such a resounding exoneration of \nthe Clintons. I am not sure all of our colleagues are aware who wrote \nthe report and under what circumstances this investigation was taking \nplace.\n  Mr. DODD. It was done by a private law firm hired by the FDIC--not \nCongress, or by Democrats or Republicans--that has expertise in this \narea. The law firm is Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro, located, I think, \non the west coast, using the services, I point out, of a former \nRepublican U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens. They spent $4 million, in \naddition to the almost $26 million being spent by the independent \ncounsel, the almost $2 million for the committee--and I do not know \nwhat the number is in the House--totaling more than $30 million spent \non this investigation. Here is their report now that was added because, \nafter the billing documents were discovered in December, they decided \nthey better wait and take a further look at this. These conclusions are \nbased on after examining those billing records that the people have \ntalked so much about. Their conclusion is to stop it, do not spend \nanother nickel on this, not another red cent. That is the conclusion of \nan independent body under the leadership of a former Republican U.S. \nattorney. Stop it. No more money on this.\n  Now, I inquire of the minority leader. That is not what we recommend. \nThe minority leader's recommendation was to allow another month of \nhearings, and another month after that for a report to be filed; is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. Just to make sure \neveryone fully appreciates what it is we are suggesting, you have an \nextraordinary investigation being conducted, as the Senator has \nindicated, by an independent body, largely directed by a Republican, \nwho is not known for his love or affection for the President or the \nFirst Lady, who have concluded, as was just indicated, that there is no \nmerit to continuing any further in this investigation. That is No. 1. \nThen you have an independent counsel whose activities and extraordinary \namount of effort already put forth will go on for who knows how long, \nrequiring millions and millions of dollars more and months and months \nand months more. So we have on top of that a Senate committee, which \nhas now been in existence for more than 20 months, which is not asking \nfor a week, 2 weeks, or 3 weeks to complete its work. But they want an \nunlimited amount of time. They cannot tell us whether it is going to be \nthis year, next year, the year after, or how much longer they are going \nto want.\n  So I say to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, the \nrecommendations made by the Pillsbury report, I think, are shared by \nthe vast majority of the American people. It is time to end this. We \nhave to take those limited tax dollars and put them to better use here, \nin areas like education, the environment, in hearings on how to find \nbetter jobs, in areas that this Senate ought to be directing its effort \ntoward, not in more politicized Whitewater investigations.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. I say further to the minority leader, I do not know if he \nwas aware of the amount of work. But here are almost 300 pages of a \nreport by the Pillsbury firm. It was the initial report in December, \nand then this is the supplemental report of February that comes in. \nThere is in excess of 300 pages after a 2-year study, by the way. This \nis 2 years of work, some $4 million, as I pointed out earlier. I was \nnot aware whether or not the minority leader knew exactly how extensive \nthis report was.\n  Further, may I inquire of the minority leader, he pointed out earlier \nhow much time had been spent on matters such as Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation, health, and the environment. I inquire of the minority \nleader whether or not he was aware that over the past 2 years, in \naddition to almost 50 hearings, by the way, on the Whitewater matter, \nand I gather another 15 hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge, some 60 \nhearings, more than 60 hearings were conducted, juxtapose that with the \nhearings that were not held, frankly, in this 104th Congress on the \nissues that people do care about.\n  The minority leader, was he aware of the number of hearings?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First, I respond by saying I was not aware that $2 \nmillion had been spent on the Pillsbury investigation----\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, $4 million.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Excuse me, $4 million on the Pillsbury investigation.\n  They have now completed their work. As the Senator from Connecticut \nhas indicated, they have recommended that there be nothing else done. \nThey have completed their work, they have come to a definitive \nunderstanding of what happened, and are recommending that no additional \naction be taken. In spite of that, we are recommending additional time.\n  The Senator makes a very important point. In a poll taken just \nrecently, the American people said of all the issues that they care the \nmost about, public education by more that 2 to 1 is the most important \npriority that they hope the Senate and the Congress will devote its \nattention to; following closely is the effort to control crime.\n  Mr. President, 64 percent, almost as many people, felt we ought to \nlook at the economy and good jobs. Here we have the American people \nsaying, if it is up to them, they want to talk about education, they \nwant us to deal with it. They want to talk about crime control and want \nus to deal with it more effectively. They certainly want us to try to \nfind ways to build an economy that creates better jobs.\n  Yet, on those issues, there have been no hearings on the economy and \njobs designated to examine ways with which to try to improve this \nsituation. Of all the days we have had, now more than 400 days since \nthe 104th Congress began, we can only find 3 days out of more than 400 \nto find time to hold a hearing on public education--3 days.\n  Mr. President, I think that speaks for itself. We can do better than \nthat. In part, that is really what this is all about. Where do we put \nour attention? Do we really feel the need not for another month, not \nfor another 2 months as we propose for the hearings and the report, but \nfor an unlimited period of time? Do we really feel the need to go on \nand on and on with these hearings, given the record just in the last \nmonth of February, of this committee and the work that it has done so \nfar?\n  Mr. DODD. Further, I inquire of the minority leader--he made the \npoint earlier about other investigations that have been done by \nCongress. I asked our staff to compile a list of the most prominent of \nthose hearings, Watergate being the one that most people probably \nrecall the best, with the Church committee, going back to 1975. Some \nMembers may recall that committee's work. Billy Carter and Libya--we \nhave probably forgotten about that, but that got a lot of attention--\nABSCAM; Iran-Contra; HUD; POW-MIA.\n  I just inquire, in every single one, I do not know if the minority \nleader was aware, but every single one of these hearings there was a \ntermination date. I do not know if the minority leader was aware of \nthat. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this list be printed \nin the Record for the purpose of people looking at it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Congressional Investigations\n\n       1. Watergate:\n       Authorizing resolution--February 7, 1973.\n       \n[[Page S1416]]\n\n       Initial reporting date--February 28, 1974.\\1\\\n     \\1\\ Often reporting dates are in the form of, as in the \n     Watergate resolution, ``at the earliest practicable date, but \n     no later than __________.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Final report--June 27, 1974.\n       2.

Mr. President, every single major investigation done by the \nU.S. Congress over the last 20 years that I can find in resolutions \nthat had to come before this body had termination dates in them, \nprimarily because of the very reason the minority leader has raised the \nissue today--they become open ended, they become political, it becomes \na fishing expedition. That is why the wisdom of our colleagues \nhistorically has said, ``Look, we will let you run, but you do not run \nindefinitely. You have to finish up your work. If you do not, we know \nwhat you do.'' They did not say ``Republicans,'' they did not say \n``Democrats.'' They said, ``All of you.'' We will put a termination \ndate on here so you come back to the full body and report and get it \nover with.\n  Otherwise, these things go on indefinitely. With all respect to my \ncolleague from New York, his proposal is just that--to go on \nindefinitely with another half million dollars.\n  I inquire of the minority leader whether or not he was aware that, in \nfact, there were termination requirements in every single major hearing \nby this Congress?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I respond to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nsaying the answer is, yes, I was aware of it. I think most people are \naware this is an unprecedented request. Never, at least in recent \nhistory here in the Senate, has a committee ever asked for an unlimited \namount of time to continue an investigation. Never. The list that has \njust been submitted for the Record demonstrates what has happened \nthrough all the investigations that we have had in recent times. We \nhave submitted a date. Now, in some cases those dates have been \nextended. In fact, I think that happened with the Iran-Contra at one \npoint. Those dates had to be extended.\n  However, in no case has any committee been given the authorization \nfor an unlimited period of time to continue to carry on whatever it is \nthey were doing. This is unprecedented. This is precedent setting and \njust one of the myriad of reasons why we feel so strongly about the \nimpropriety of this request.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One of the strongest----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, is that for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I just wanted to ascertain if it was for a question or \nfor the purpose of yielding the floor. It is proper to yield for a \nquestion. I have now watched this discussion and observed this for a \nperiod of time, but I do believe there is a manner by which Members can \nseek the floor. It should not be by way of any Member yielding to a \nMember unless it is a unanimous-consent request and reserving time. \nCertainly, the posing of a question is proper, and if it is yielding \nfor a question, I understand and will not object.\n  I ask my colleagues, in the interest of comity, because the Senator \nfrom New York would have engaged in the same situation and I understand \npeople want to make their points, but there are others who would like \nto make their points. I hope that if you yield it would be for a \nquestion and we can work out some way in which my colleagues can make \ntheir points without having to impinge on the rules.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We could probably ask the clerk how much time has been \nallotted to this debate so far and who holds the majority of time so \nfar consumed. I know that the chairman had a good deal of time to \nexpress himself, and we did not object to that. We certainly will not \nobject to further comments by the chairman or anybody else, but \ncertainly in keeping some balance, I certainly hope that he understands \nthe need for us to have an equal opportunity to address many of the \npoints he raised.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I inquire of the clerk if they have kept time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the minority leader aware that one of the strongest \nadvocates of placing a time limit in order to ensure that the hearings \nwould not drag into a political year was the then-minority leader, now \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, at the time of Iran-Contra?\n  At that time, he said there was a conflict between some Democrats, \nboth in the House and Senate, who wanted no time limitations placed on \nthe committee and Republican Members who wanted those hearings \ncompleted within 2 to 3 months, which was an absolutely truncated \nperiod.\n  I want to point out that we joined in a resolution last year in May \nthat carried these hearings to February 29, so we made no effort then \nto have such a truncated period that it would not be possible to do the \nwork.\n  Senator Dole then said he wanted to shorten the time period even \nmore. He says, ``I do believe that shortening the time period from \nOctober 30 to August 1 is a step in the right direction. If, in fact, \nwe do want to complete action on this resolution at the earliest \npossible time, then the August date will be extremely helpful.''\n  Then he went on to say, ``I am heartened by what I understand to be \nthe strong commitment of both the chairman and vice chairman to avoid \nfishing expeditions, to keep the committee focused on the real \nissues.'' Later in debate he said, ``There is still a national agenda \nthat needs to be pursued. There are a number of issues that must be \naddressed. The American people are concerned about the Iran-Contra \nmatter, but they are also concerned about the budget, about the trade \nbill, about health care, and a whole host of issues that will have to \nbe addressed in this Chamber. The problems of the past, as important as \nthey are, are not as important as the tasks of the future.''\n  Now, the Democratic-controlled Congress recognized--it escaped no \none's attention--that if the investigation spilled into 1988, it would \nkeep the Republicans on the defensive during an election year. And \nChairman Inouye of the Senate, Democratic chairman, and Chairman \nHamilton of the House, recommended rejecting the opportunity to prolong \nthe hearings. They determined that 10 months would be enough, and they \nagreed to a termination date.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield to me, in response to a question, \njust on the point the Senator from Maryland is making?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. This is a very good point. I ask the minority leader if he \nwould not agree this is a tremendously important point. I want to point \nout to my colleagues here and the minority leader that prior to that \ntime, Mr. Poindexter and Mr. North had deleted--this was public \ninformation--over 5,000 e-mails. Mr. North had a \n\n[[Page S1417]]\nshredding party at the White House, as reported by the United Press \nInternational. Fawn Hall had changed sensitive documents on North's \norders, as reported, by the way, all prior to the consideration of \nabbreviating the hearings. I ask the minority leader--so we have had \nnone of this, by the way, under this present investigation.\n  Here, with this information of shredding documents, destroying e-\nmails, trying to take documents by stuffing them in their cowboy boots \nand sneaking them out of the White House--knowing that, with full \ninformation, is it not correct, I ask the minority leader, that the \npoint that the Senator from Maryland is making is even more poignant, \nbecause even with that information, the Democratically controlled \nCongress said, give a finite period and wrap up these hearings. Is that \nnot true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Both Senators make a very important point. In the face \nof tremendous evidence of obstruction of justice, that Congress decided \nthat there were more important considerations.\n  There has been no finding of wrongdoing in this case. So the analogy \nthat others have used with regard to this particular investigation is \nwrong. It is baseless. So I think the Senator from Connecticut makes a \nvery, very important point.\n  Mr. DODD. When the two Senators from Maine made the case about \nextending the hearings, they were fully aware of this kind of \ninformation. Was that not the basis for the point in the book they talk \nabout?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That was exactly the basis and that was the whole point \nmade by the Senators in their book.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, if the leader will yield, is it not the \ncase that any charge relating to obstruction of justice will be handled \nby the independent counsel? This committee is not going to bring such a \ncharge, or instigate any punishment. We do not have the authority to do \nthat. That is something the independent counsel does. And is it not the \ncase that whenever our hearings end, the independent counsel will \ncontinue? He has an open-ended charter, and it is his responsibility to \nlook into this matter and to bring charges for any violation of the \ncriminal law.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And the record will show, I would say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, that that is what happened in the \nIran-Contra hearings. The investigation, I should say, by the \nindependent counsel, went on and on for years following the committee. \nSo I think the Senators have made a very, very important point.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maryland--who has the \nfloor, Mr. President?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I retain the floor, and I yield for a question to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would like to inquire, Mr. President, of the very \ndistinguished Democratic leader.\n  Yesterday I was sitting in a Finance Committee hearing. We were \nlistening to the Governors' reports on Medicare and Medicaid. And, by \nthe way, we were here almost at the first of March. For the information \nof Members of the Senate, this was only the fourth meeting this year, \nthe fourth meeting this year of the Senate Committee on Finance.\n  One of our colleagues on the committee, I say to my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, expressed disbelief that we have not yet dealt with the \nwelfare package, that we have not dealt with passing the welfare reform \nbill. And I happened to calculate, well, one reason we are not dealing \nwith legislation is pretty simple: The Senate is not functioning this \nyear.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1995, up until this point, I say to my \ncolleague from South Dakota, the distinguished leader of the Democrats, \nwe have had 97 votes; we have had 97 votes in this body. In 1996, by \nthe same date, we have had only 21 votes in the U.S. Senate, in 1996. \nThere is only one committee, for all practical purposes, that has been \nfunctioning, and that is the so-called Whitewater committee. In 1996, \nwith 15 hearings, 15 hearings thus far, 47 hearings total--time \nconsumed, resources of the Federal Government. In fact, we have had \nalmost as many hearings of the Whitewater committee as we have had \nvotes in the Senate in the year 1996.\n  I wonder if the distinguished minority leader was aware of those \nfacts?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was not aware of them, but it goes to the point that \nwe were making earlier, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, that there have been no hearings on health care, there have \nbeen no hearings on the economy and on jobs. There have been only 3 \ndays of hearings on public education--3 days in all of this time.\n  So the point made by the distinguished Senator is an accurate one. \nThe fact is, nothing is being done. There is no effort to address some \nof the major concerns that people have expressed over and over in poll \nafter poll. So I think the Senator makes a very valid point.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished leader would \nalso answer this question. I wonder if the distinguished leader was \naware that already the Whitewater committee has deposed 202 persons--\n202 persons?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was not aware.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I do not know how that would compare with Iran-Contra or \nsome of the other hearings we have had, but I tell you that is a lot of \npeople to depose.\n  Mr. President, 121 witnesses have now testified before the Whitewater \ncommittee. The Whitewater committee has subpoenaed all long-distance \ntelephone records, domestic telephone records, calls by the White \nHouse, and they have examined 45,000 pages of White House documents. I \nthink this is an unheard of amount of evidence that they are trying to \ngo over and over and over.\n  Mr. President, also I noted in the Washington Post, finally--\nfinally--the newspapers and press are about to become aware of an issue \nthat I think is also critical to this story, and that is the amount of \nlegal fees, the amount of legal fees that many of these witnesses are \nbeing forced to bear. Most of them could not afford these fees. There \nwere stories this morning in the Post about some of those individuals \nand some of the tremendous, burdensome, and very high, tremendous legal \nfees that these individuals are being now asked to assume personally--\nnot paid for by the Government, but personally. This will bankrupt them \ninto perpetuity. It will destroy their financial lives and their \nfinancial well being. And I hope, Mr. Leader, that we will see a higher \ndegree of sensitivity to those concerns.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from Arkansas makes a good point.\n  Mr. President, it is not my desire to prevent others from seeking \nrecognition. I know the Senator from Illinois has waited a long period \nof time to ask a couple of questions. I will defer to him and yield to \nhim for purposes of asking the question, and then I will yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the minority leader. I appreciate it.\n  On the point Senator Pryor just made, that we have had 121 witnesses, \nSenator Sarbanes has described this as a fishing expedition. And you \nhave, Mr. Leader, said absolutely nothing has come up in terms of \neither illegal or unethical activities on the part of either the \nPresident or the First Lady.\n  Would it be fair to characterize this fishing expedition, that has \ncost the taxpayers huge amounts of money, that is a fishing expedition \ngoing after a whale but so far has not even produced a minnow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is an innovative characterization. I think the \nmetaphor it represents is an accurate one. There is not much evidence \nof any real catch here. And that is really what the effort has been all \nabout, to see if they can get a political catch. The political catch \nhas turned up empty.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator from South Dakota, and my colleague from \nMaryland, for whom I have great respect, have gone further, frankly, \nthan I would go in saying we will continue this until April 3. Frankly, \nif I could vote to cut it off tomorrow, I am going to vote to cut it \noff tomorrow, because I think it is getting nowhere. I think the \nAmerican people understand that. I like my colleague from New York. He \nis fun to be with, and I read his book, ``Power, Pasta, and Politics.'' \nAnd it is pure Al D'Amato. It is fun to read. But I think we have to \nrecognize the political purposes.\n\n  Why are we doing this? It is hard for me to come to any conclusion \nother than we are doing it for pure politics. Is not it true that there \nis an excessive \n\n[[Page S1418]]\namount of cynicism out here in our society today? I think one of the \nreasons for that excessive amount of cynicism is that we play partisan \ngames around here. I am not saying the Republicans are the only ones \nguilty of that. We are guilty of it. Paul Simon has been guilty of it \noccasionally. I am sure none of the rest of you have been guilty of \nthat. But I think that is what makes the public cynical. They see us \nplaying political games instead of dealing with the real problems. I \nthink what you are trying to do is to say let us move on to the real \nproblems.\n  Then one final point that ties in with what Senator Pryor had to say: \nNot only are we hauling people in--121 witnesses who have to hire \nlawyers and their expenses--but we are terrifying people. This is not \nfair to people. We are calling in secretaries and people who have \nprobably never even talked to a Senator. And all of a sudden they are \non television--a nanny. We are calling people in who know nothing. The \none witness ended up his statement saying, ``I do not know why I am \nhere.'' I said to him--a lawyer by the name of Jennings--I said, ``Mr. \nJennings, that is two of us. I do not know why I am here either.''\n  I think we have to stop playing games. I think that is the thrust of \nwhat the minority leader is trying to say.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for the \neloquent points which he has made.\n  I read a comment just this morning that I think is so appropriate. It \ngoes to the points raised by the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. Somebody said in the paper this morning, ``Welcome to \nthe Federal Government. You need a telephone, a tablet, and a lawyer.'' \n``A telephone, a tablet, and a lawyer.'' And there are some lawyers \nthat have already garnered more than a half-million in fees to \nrepresent people of modest means before this committee and others. That \nis wrong. We should not subject people who want to dedicate themselves \nto public service to that degree of financial burden, to that degree of \nconcern and humiliation in some cases.\n  So I think the Senator from Illinois has made a very important point.\n  I know that there are others who seek the floor. At this time, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, might I ask my friend and colleague to \nyield to me for 30 seconds without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THOMPSON). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. A question was just raised. How deceptive things can be. \nYes. A witness did say--and he was a lawyer, a very distinguished \nlawyer--``I do not know why I am here.'' That was, I guess, Mr. \nJennings.\n  Let me tell you why the committee had him appear. This is an example. \nWe had Mr. Jennings appear because he came to Washington and had a \nmeeting with Mrs. Clinton, and David Kendall, her lawyer, just days \nafter the RTC-IG report criticizing the Rose Law Firm was released. And \nhe happened to represent Seth Ward who had significant transactions. We \ndid not just drag somebody in willy-nilly. The fact is he had total \nmemory loss as it relates to significant questions. We have not even \ngone into that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for an observation on that \npoint?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I was going to make an observation.\n  Let me finish, and then I will yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Just to respond to that particular point which the Senator \nhad.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Our colleague has the floor, and it has been over 1 hour \nsince the other side had their right.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield 30 seconds to respond because I want to come \nback to it myself.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  I think as to the point which has been raised here regarding Mr. \nJennings, a phone call to him, as far as deposition, would have \nanswered the question. He had come up. He was asked because he \npracticed law in Arkansas with Mrs. Clinton, and the issue was raised \nas to whether or not she was a competent lawyer. That is why they came \ntogether. He could have answered that question in about 15 minutes. \nInstead he was brought before the entire committee for a whole day. He \nsaid she was competent.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The Senator says that we could have gotten an answer \nby a phone call. We could not get it in a full day of testimony. He \ncould not remember how many times he had been to Washington. He could \nnot remember what he was here for. He had no earthly idea, and told me \nhe flew from Arkansas to Washington for 20 minutes to recall cases he \nhad tried with the First Lady. He did not even know who paid for the \ntrip. But talking about something that could have been handled by the \ntelephone, the meeting with the First Lady, that would have been it.\n  But, Mr. President, I have watched just how we have gone on here, \nand, No. 1, what we are trying to do here is put a price on this \ninvestigation. What the Democratic side of the aisle, the other side of \nthis aisle, is saying, is that we should put a price on the integrity \nof the White House, and it is costing too much to establish whether \nthere is integrity in the White House or not, and that we should cut \noff, and let it go. We simply cannot afford to establish the price of \nintegrity of the White House.\n  But as to the length of a hearing, it is the length of a bullfight. \nIt is whose ox is being gored. And right now, the way it is going I do \nnot see why anyone would not want the hearings to continue. In fact, to \nclear her name, I would have thought the First Lady would have been \ndown here saying, ``Please go on with the hearings. I want this cloud \nremoved from my law practice, and what I have done in my life prior to \nbeing in Washington.''\n  But what I would like to do very quickly is compliment the chairman. \nHe has done a great job, in fairness, as chairman of the special \nWhitewater committee. Just in a brief word, the former chairman, Don \nRiegle, did a great job too. So we have had good, honest leadership in \nthe Whitewater committee from day one.\n  But just so many things come up that I want to respond to. The \ndistinguished and honorable Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, said \nwe have not dealt with welfare. The House passed a great welfare bill. \nThe Senate passed a good one, and out of conference came a good welfare \nbill that would serve this country well. If I remember correctly, the \nPresident vetoed it. That was not dealing with welfare.\n  I think the first question here that needs answering is why are the \nDemocrats in the Senate and the White House so determined to end the \ninvestigation? If there is nothing there, then why not continue, what \nharm would come to the White House?\n  Do not tell me it is the cost of money. There has been a constant \nattempt to deceive and to weave a gossamer facade to cover this up. \nThat is exactly what it has been from day one, and I have been to most \nof the hearings. It has been a constant effort to deceive, we weave, we \ncover it up, and we get it out of here.\n  Why not continue? As I say, it would appear to me that to remove this \ncloud the President and First Lady they would be down here asking the \nhearings to be continued. I think their actions have answered the \nquestion.\n  There is very much something to Whitewater. Look at the people who \nhave been indicted, or are under investigation, and look at those who \nhave resigned. The honorable minority leader said we had not caught a \nminnow. But I doubt if some of the people that have been indicted, or \nwho are under indictment, like the Governor of Arkansas, and are going \nto be tried, would classify themselves as minnows. They certainly would \nnot like us to.\n  If there was nothing to this investigation, why else would billing \nrecords under subpoena for 2 years turn up in the White House in the \nreading room next to Mrs. Clinton's private office?\n  Now, the honorable Senator from Connecticut was referring to some \npast investigation in which they carried records out of the White House \nin their cowboy boots. Well, to answer that, I say to Senator Dodd, \nMaggie Williams did not need cowboy boots to get them from Vince \nFoster's office to the President's quarters. They got there. How \n\n[[Page S1419]]\nelse could they have gotten there. This is the most secure room in the \nworld. And I go back to saying, if it is not the most secure room in \nthe world, it ought to be. And anybody who knows how to make it more \nsecure ought to tell the Secret Service people, because where the \nPresident sleeps it should be.\n  Mr. President, how would the average citizen fare if he were raided \nby the FBI and a 10-pound bag of cocaine was sitting on his dining room \ntable or in his reading room in his house and he said, ``I don't know \nhow it got there. It couldn't have been me.'' It is here. How did it \nget here? What would they say? ``Oh, well, that's perfectly fine; you \nknow, things like that happen all the time.'' No.\n  Well, these records showed up. They are valuable, and have been under \nsubpoena for 2 years, and we need an answer to how they got there.\n  Take the notes from Mr. Gearan and Mr. Ickes, where have they been? \nWhy would they have been hidden for 2 years? Because the meetings show \npossible attempts to obstruct the Department of Justice investigation. \nVery simple. The notes on the meeting we went over and over with Mr. \nIckes, they wanted to make sure the Arkansas Securities Commissioner \nBeverly Schaffer and the White House were synchronized in telling the \nsame story to the Federal investigators.\n  Well, Mr. President, the truth does not have to be synchronized. If \nshe is telling the truth, it was the truth going in and it will be the \ntruth coming out.\n  Why would the White House go to such length and use parliamentary \nmaneuvers to block consideration of the resolution? We know they oppose \nit, but they do not want it even debated.\n  Mr. President, another question that needs answering here is whether \nor not Governor Clinton gave out leases from the Arkansas State \ngovernment in return for campaign contributions. Hearings that were \nscheduled to occur this week probably would have answered that \nquestion, if we could have had the hearings.\n  The committee planned to explore the possibility that an Arkansas \nState agency, the Arkansas Development Finance Agency, known as ADFA, \nwas ordered to lease a building owned by Jim McDougal in exchange for \nMr. McDougal hosting a fundraiser for then Governor Clinton in 1985.\n  Mr. President, the second question is whether Dan Lasater was given \npreferential treatment on State bond contracts.\n  Now, for those of you who do not remember, Dan Lasater was a \nconvicted drug dealer who, by sworn testimony, provided airplane \ntravel, some 35 trips, for the President, when he was running for \nGovernor of Arkansas. He held fundraisers at his offices around the \nState of Arkansas to raise funds for Governor-to-be Clinton. And then \nState bond business was directed to him to the amount of at least one \nwindfall profit of $750,000, and it has been reported that the Governor \nhimself lobbied the legislature to make sure that the contract was \nawarded to Mr. Lasater.\n  Dan Lasater gave a job to Roger Clinton, Bill Clinton's brother. He \npaid off Roger Clinton's drug debts. This is a true friend of the \nPresident. Dan Lasater was eventually convicted of trafficking in \ndrugs.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I was corrected by Patsy Thomasson at the Whitewater \nhearing; he was convicted of ``social distribution'' of cocaine.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I suppose there is some gossamer difference there, but \nI am not aware of it.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Carolina yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. No, I will not. I have been waiting for some hour and \na half, and I will yield when I am finished.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I was only going to ask what Lasater has to do with \nWhitewater, which is absolutely nothing, and the Senator from North \nCarolina should know that.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. Lasater has a lot to do with Whitewater, and the \nSenator from Arkansas should know that. Mr. Lasater was convicted of \n``social distribution'' of cocaine. He was sent to prison. He was \npardoned for his crime of drug trafficking by then-Governor Bill \nClinton. Dan Lasater's company received tens of millions of dollars of \nState bonding contracts from the Arkansas development and finance \nauthority. This was an agency controlled by Governor Clinton. Patsy \nThomasson was Dan Lasater's top assistant for nearly 10 years. She had \nhis power of attorney to handle his financial interests and run his \ncompanies while Dan Lasater was serving time in prison for trafficking \nin cocaine.\n  Now, in a twist of irony, the former head of the Arkansas Development \nFinance Agency is head of White House personnel, and guess who his \ndeputy is? Dan Lasater's former deputy, Patsy Thomasson.\n  The committee is specifically charged under Senate Resolution 120 \nwith probing the links between Dan Lasater and the Arkansas Development \nFinance Agency. The link takes us right to the top of the White House. \nIf that does not bring Dan Lasater into Whitewater, I do not know what \ndoes.\n  Is this why the White House wants to stop the investigation? All of a \nsudden, after being willing to throw millions and billions of dollars \nat any project anywhere in the world, now they say we cannot continue, \nwe cannot afford this investigation; it is breaking the Government. We \nsend foreign aid around the world. The President supports it. He \nsupports money for any giveaway program. But here the Democrats are \nsaying now we cannot do this.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. No, the Senator will not yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why don't you bring him in for a hearing?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Why don't we do what?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why don't you bring him in for a hearing?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The President?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, Lasater.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We are going to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why don't you do it. You had all these days when you \ncould have done it, and you did not do it. Why don't you bring him in?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We are going to bring him in.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let's have a hearing. Let's test the allegations.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We had his lieutenant here, and we are going to bring \nDan Lasater in. And we are looking forward to having him.\n  Mr. SARBANES. You had all the days when you could have done it, and \nyou did not do it.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We are going to do it in the future.\n  I comment to the Senator from Maryland, there are so many of them \ncoming out of Arkansas, there were so many dipping out of that kettle \nuntil we have not gotten to Lasater yet, but he is on the way.\n  But why do they want to stop the investigation now? I think only the \nWhite House can answer the question. But I think it is a sad procedural \ntool to be stopping the Senate investigation at this point with the \nsomewhat feeble excuse that it has gone on too long and it is costing \ntoo much, simply because we are rapidly getting to the heart of \nWhitewater. And as the Senator from Maryland just said, we are going to \nbring in Dan Lasater, but there have been so many we have not gotten to \nhim yet, but he is coming.\n  It is our constitutional duty to conduct this oversight hearing. The \nsavings and loan crisis cost taxpayers $150 billion. Madison, the one \nthat served as the pool of money in Little Rock, lost $68 million and \nmaybe more.\n  And 80 percent of the Arkansas State-chartered savings and loans--80 \npercent of them; one of the highest in the Nation--failed while Bill \nClinton was Governor. This cost the American taxpayers $3 billion in \nfailed Arkansas savings and loans while Bill Clinton was Governor.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my counterparts on the other side of \nthe aisle to stop the filibuster of this resolution, let the truth come \nout. I would think it would be exactly what the President and First \nLady would be recommending: Let the chips fall where they may, let us \nsee the truth, but let the American people who suffered the loss--let \nthe American people who suffered the loss--at least be rewarded with \nthe truth and get on with the investigation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Whitewater Chairman, Senator \nD'Amato. \n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I will make a very short statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I assume the chairman got the floor on \nhis own right, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not intend to be long, because I \nthink there will be extended and long debate. As I said, we are not \nable to get a vote of the Rules Committee or get the Rules Committee to \nconsider the resolution which would have authorized the expenditure of \nup to $600,000.\n  By the way, in order to get some kind of relevance, I think if we \nwere to combine both committees, the prior committee that met, the \nWhitewater committee that met under the chairmanship of Senator Riegle, \nand this committee, that we have spent something less than $1,500,000. \nIf we want to look at the Iran-Contra with respect to money spent, I \nthink they spent something in the order of $3,298,000, almost \n$3,300,000 in 1986, 1987 dollars. That would obviously be even more \ntoday.\n  When we talk about $30 million, and it is convenient to mix it in and \nsay, ``$30 million would buy a lot.'' That is the independent counsel. \nThat special counsel that has taken $20-plus million, was appointed at \nthe request of the President and the Attorney General. I think we ought \nto understand that they are different investigations, not mix the two.\n  When we speak to the issue of the Pillsbury report, there have been \nsome statements made that they said we should not go on any further. \nLet us understand that the Pillsbury report was very limited in nature \nand scope. The fact of the matter is that they were operating under a \ntime constraint. And, indeed, they have a total agreement that tolls as \nof March 1. They did not and still do not even in their secondary \nreport have all the facts and information. They have to make a \ndetermination with respect to whether a suit should go forward on the \nbasis of cost-effectiveness.\n  They were unable to come to a conclusion based upon all the facts. As \na matter of fact, on page 164 of the report they expressly concluded, \n``This conclusion does not necessarily mean that the evidence \nexonerates anyone.'' So let us understand that. The report was for the \nvery limited purpose as it relates to the FDIC bringing a civil suit \nagainst Madison. And it was up against a time line. And it did not have \nall the facts. We have a different role, a far different role.\n  Now, look, I have attempted to approach this today not in terms of \ncharging partisan politics, although it is obvious to me that there has \nbeen a conscious attempt by some to say that is the only reason this \ncommittee is asking for an extension. I think that is unfair. I think \nit is unfortunate. I think what does take place, whether consciously or \nnot--and I think rather consciously--is that those who make claims are \nattempting to poison the well as it relates to the credibility of the \ncommittee. That is unfortunate. They are attempting to paint the \ncommittee as partisan, as political.\n  I say there was a great Governor in our State, Al Smith. He said, \n``Let's look at the record.'' I heard lots of things, let's look at the \nrecord, the length of time the committee met, et cetera. We know the \ncommittee for months and months could not carry on its work. My \ncolleagues know also that there have been many occasions, including the \nlast several weeks, when we have not been able to go forward because of \nscheduling problems, and because we were looking toward a continuation \nand knew we could not finish our work, and because there are dozens of \nwitnesses that are unavailable, and it would not be timely to call \nthem.\n  There is a sequential order that we need. And these witnesses, in \nmany cases, first need to appear so we can take depositions. In some \ncases, after we take depositions, we do not bring them in to testify. I \nthink we have to look at that.\n  Again, I am just going to reflect on the question of hearing the \nfacts. The former U.S. attorney--who was objected to, whose law firm \nparticipated in or did the Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro report, did \nnot participate in the final conclusion--did not participate in the \nfinal report, but did have a limited involvement.\n  Today's Washington Post says, ``The retention''--I am trying to give \na balanced position on this--``The retention of the Pillsbury firm in \n1994 drew sharp complaints by the White House because Republican former \nU.S. Attorney Jay Stephens, a critic of the Clinton administration, was \na member of the Pillsbury team evaluating Madison.'' It goes on to \nsay--I think this is most instructive and important because we can all \npick out some little thing and attempt to pile on, try to make \nsomething out of it and blow it out of proportion--``His work on the \nmatter however amounted to only about 10 hours.'' So this was not a \nreport authored by Mr. Stephens.\n  Again, when we look at the report, its scope, its narrowness, it does \nnot give license to us to say that the work of the committee is done.\n  Last but not least, I have to suggest to my friends and colleagues on \nthe other side--and I am not disputing anybody's motivation; they say \nenough is enough, let us terminate this--if indeed we had access to all \nthe information; if it was forthcoming; if it was not withheld, whether \nby, again, design or because of human error; if we were not constrained \nby the independent prosecutor--and, again, I, indicate it was our \nintent to bring various witnesses in, we would not just surrender our \nrights; then we may have been in a position to wind up this \ninvestigation.\n  The question is posed, why did not we do that? Because we ascertained \nfrom the special counsel his concerns and more importantly we \nascertained the likelihood of us bringing in or attempting to bring in \nsome of the witnesses. One in particular, Judge Hale, would have \nbrought forth a plea or an indication that he would avail himself of \nhis constitutional rights, and that is, to take the fifth amendment or \nindicate that he would take the fifth amendment. That would have cut us \noff and put us in a position where it would have been rather doubtful \nthat we could get him at any time. We did not go forward. That is the \nreason.\n  Again, Al Smith said, ``Let's look at the record.'' With the \nexception of one situation, notwithstanding that there may not have \nbeen some bargaining with respect to the scope, I heard, ``Oh, the \nscope of some of the subpoenas that were requested were too broad.'' \nYes, indeed, when you are looking for information there is a tendency \nto cover the waterfront. All of those matters were narrowed down by way \nof counsel, majority and minority, with the exception of one occasion, \nand that had to do with Bill Kennedy and the famous Kennedy notes, \nwhere we had the references to the Rose Law Firm, et cetera--and even \nthen I do not believe that the administration should have pushed us to \nthat.\n  It was not the committee's desire to ask for enforcement of the \nsubpoena. It was only when they refused, refused to make those notes \navailable. And by the way, why did they withhold them? There was no \nquestion they could have done it before. Only on that one occasion did \nit finally come down to the fact that we had to insist on enforcement. \nThen the notes were turned over.\n  So, to attempt at this date today to say at this time that the work \nof the committee has been and is partisan, that our request to go \nforward is partisan and is political in nature, is just not the case. I \nunderstand the concern to limit the time. I am not suggesting to you--\nthat is why, by the way, as you say, Senator--in my presentation to the \nRules Committee, I said that my desire was to terminate, to set that at \nthe end of February, February 29, because we did not want to run it \ninto a political season.\n  That was my desire. It is my desire today that we terminate sooner \nrather than later, but only after we get the facts and conclude our \nwork. Ours is not an investigation that should be driven by time alone. \nI never envisioned that we would run into the problems that we did. I \ndo not think that my colleagues did.\n  In good faith, there has to be some attempt to reach some comity, or \nare we going to just simply charge ``politics, politics'' and drag in \nthe red herrings and talk about how many committees and the economy--\nsure, people are concerned about the economy and jobs. Do you want me \nto begin to assert what I think could or should have been \n\n[[Page S1421]]\ndone? We should have balanced the budget. We passed a balanced budget \nhere. It was vetoed--vetoed.\n  If we had a balanced budget that was passed, interest rates would be \ncoming down and the economy would be prospering. Do you want to talk \nabout that? That was not impugned or impinged, the fact the economy is \nin trouble, because of the Whitewater committee.\n  Do you want to talk about getting the economy going? Give the working \nmiddle class a tax cut. Come forward. If you want to drag in politics \nand rhetoric, we can do that.\n  If we want to concentrate in terms of attempting to do the work of \nthe committee in the way that keeps politics to a minimum, this \nchairman is willing to attempt to work out an accommodation. But I say \nin all good faith, the set time line proposed, which is April 5, will \nnot give us the opportunity to get the witnesses we need, and will \nbring us right back into the same situation that Senator Mitchell, \nformer Democratic chairman, and Senator Cohen advised us against. To \nset up an arbitrary time line--and I am now paraphrasing them--is to \nbring about a stratagem of delay. I am not suggesting, as I said \nbefore, that it would be delay just by the administration or the \nadministration alone. Defense attorneys for various witnesses who may \nhave something to be concerned about will look at that time line. I can \nguarantee you this will take place and there will be delays.\n  All the charts in the world are not going to overcome that. All the \nsloganeering in the world will not overcome that. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that we are going to have plenty of time for political \ncharges to be made next week. Maybe this ought to be the time that we \nnot engage in so much of that political rhetoric and begin to attempt \nto see in what manner we can continue the work of the committee with \nthe best hope and opportunity to wind up sooner rather than later.\n  If my colleagues want to take that up, I am willing to do that. I \nstand ready and willing to work to accomplish our goal without, again, \nsetting a time line which is guaranteed to bring about more delay.\n  Those sentiments are not original sentiments expressed by the Senator \nfrom New York; those are sentiments and concerns that have been \nexpressed by Senator Cohen and by former Senate majority leader, \nSenator Mitchell. They said they should not have done it. They did. \nThey set time lines with the best of intent.\n  I suggest the situation is analogous today. Theirs was an attempt not \nto go further into the political season, and they said they made a \nmistake--made a mistake.\n  I do not know how to work out of this dilemma. I understand the \nlegitimate concerns of my colleagues. I really do. I say if there is a \nway in which we can do it, if it is an authorization, I do not know \nwhere it will take us--we can start the work as soon as the trial is \ncompleted. We can continue work. There are certain witnesses that we \ncannot bring in now. There is certain work we can do that we do not \nhave to do by way of public hearings. By the way, Mr. President, let me \nsuggest to you, simply because a committee is not holding public \nhearings does not mean that there has not been tens of hundreds of \nthousands of hours of work in terms of the examination of witnesses, in \nterms of sifting through evidence, in terms of various interrogatories \nwhich have been sent out and reviewed. My colleagues know that. I think \nit is rather disingenuous to come up and simply say, ``Well, you didn't \nhave hearings on X, Y, Z days.'' We can get out the records and we can \ntalk about how many attorneys asked for delays, how many people had \nlegitimate excuses, how many people put forth that there were medical \nreasons they could not be here, how many could not be here on a \nparticular day because their counsel was too busy.\n  We have attempted to accommodate people on both sides. The fact we \nmay not have had a hearing on a particular day does not go to the \nessence of the work of the committee.\n  Let me say again, last, but not least, as it relates to the fact that \nthere may or may not have been hearings held by other committees with \nrespect to their relevant duties and obligations, whatever they may \nbe--Medicare, Medicaid, health care--and let me take this opportunity \nto say that I intend to support the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill which will \ndeal with health care which is scheduled to come to the floor. I think \nthat is a good bill and is going to go a long way toward helping. The \nwork of the Whitewater committee has not precluded these other \ncommittees or the Senate from undertaking its work. The fact that there \nmay have only been 20-some-odd votes this year as compared to 90-some \nlast year at the same time, again, is not something the Whitewater work \nhas impeded.\n  These are arguments that are put forth and which are fraught with, I \nthink, specious undertones, a kind of red herring to divert attention.\n  ``Thirty million dollars has been spent on this matter.'' Look, we \nspent less than $1.5 million, and that is both committees. I do not \nthink we have to spend $600,000. Why do we ask for it? Because, if at \nthe end we have, let us say, 3 weeks or 4 weeks of work to do and we \nrun out of money, we do not want to be in a situation where we have to \nagain come back to the floor of the Senate. I think we can complete it \nfor less, but the fact of the matter is, you learn by experience. But \ncertainly to say that this is one of the most costly investigations, \nthat is just not the case. As I said, the Iran-Contra ran almost \n$3,300,000. Their work was compressed in a shorter time. How is that? \nWe have examined more witnesses, taken more depositions. So I think in \nterms of management of the taxpayers' funds, we have been frugal. I am \nprepared at another point to go into the kinds of things we have \ndeveloped: The fact that there have been people who have pled guilty, \nthe fact that there are indictments pending, the fact that there is \nsubstance, not just smoke, to many of the things that people are \nconcerned about.\n  But, again, lest we be unfair, this chairman and this committee has \nan obligation to get the facts, and if those facts exonerate, clear \naway the webs of suspicion, why, then, that would be the pronouncement \nof the committee. I want the chips to fall where they may. If there are \npractices that should not have been undertaken but that were which may \nnot fall into a criminal area, or if there may be matters that may be \nof a criminal nature, then that will be the undertaking of the special \ncounsel to decide what, if anything, may be appropriate.\n  But we should not be afraid of going forward. Democracy is not always \nnice and tidy, and sometimes it does invite some things that are not \npleasant. They are not pleasant for either side. So sometimes we have \nto do the business of ascertaining what are the facts. It is not all \nfun, but it is necessary and sometimes it is even somewhat hurtful. I \nthink we have to attempt to not look to deliberately hurt people but to \ndo our job to get the facts. That is what I hope we will be able to do.\n  Mr. President, I said I am not going to continue and go into what the \ncommittee has found and some of the open questions, because I believe \nthat we will be here next week unless we can get a resolution of this. \nMy colleagues on the other side have indicated that they are going to \nask for extended debate, and I think there certainly should be extended \ndebate. But debate that reaches more than just that and denies us an \nopportunity to vote, I think that would be unfortunate.\n  Again, everyone has a right to play out their role in this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \nrecapitulate where we are.\n  On May 17 of last year, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 120 \nwhich provided for the establishment of the Special Committee to \nInvestigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters. \nThat resolution provided $950,000 to conduct the investigation. That \nfunding expires on February 29, 1996, which is today. From the \nbeginning, it was and remains my strong intention that this \ninvestigation be carried out in a fair, thorough, and impartial manner, \nand that it be completed before the country enters into the \nPresidential campaign. By authorizing funding only through February 29, \n1996, Senate Resolution 120 accomplished this objective. In fact, \n\n[[Page S1422]]\nthat resolution states that the purposes of the committee are ``to \nexpedite the thorough conduct of this investigation, study, and \nhearings,'' and ``to engender a high degree of confidence on the part \nof the public regarding the conduct of such investigation, study, and \nhearings.''\n\n  Indeed, Chairman D'Amato himself, when he went before the Rules \nCommittee in the first part of last year in seeking funding for the \ninvestigation, stated, ``We wanted to keep it out of that political \narena, and that is why we decided to come forward with a 1-year \nrequest.''\n  The funding deadline has now been reached. The investigation has not \nbeen completed. I will discuss, in a moment, the reasons I believe the \ncommittee failed to complete the investigation by the cutoff date. The \nSenate must decide now whether to continue the investigation and, if \nso, what additional funding and what additional time to provide.\n  I want this clearly understood. We passed a resolution last year by \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote to carry out an inquiry through \nFebruary 29 of 1996. In my judgment, as I will indicate shortly, that \nwas more than adequate to complete the inquiry. It has not been \ncompleted, and the chairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, is now \nproposing a resolution for an additional $600,000 in funding and an \nunlimited extension of time to continue the Senate's inquiry into the \nso-called Whitewater matter.\n  Unlike S. Res. 120, which we passed last year, this proposal now for \nan unlimited extension completely disregards concerns about extending \nthe investigation deep into a Presidential election year. In my view, \nit seriously undermines the credibility of this investigation and \ncreates the public perception that this investigation is being \nconducted for political purposes.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, \nindicated earlier, there is no precedent that I am aware of for the \nSenate to conduct an open-ended investigation of a sitting President \nduring a Presidential election year. In fact, as I understand it, there \nis no precedent to carry on an open-ended inquiry. All of the various \ninvestigations--and, as I understand it, the Senator put a list into \nthe Record--placed a defined timeframe. As I indicated earlier in my \nquotes, this is a matter on which Senator Dole, now the majority \nleader, has spoken repeatedly in the past in very strong terms, with \nrespect to the need to have a defined time period.\n  Now, this proposed additional funding for this committee, another \n$600,000, would bring Senate expenditures on the investigation of \nWhitewater to $2 million. It is $1,950,000, just under $2 million. It \nneeds to be understood that this is not the only money that is being \nspent on Whitewater. There is a tendency to say we are spending this $2 \nmillion. Then you can say, what about all the other expenditures that \nare being made? This is not the only inquiry taking place. There is the \nRTC commission of Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro, a distinguished San \nFrancisco law firm, to carry on a civil investigation with respect to \nthese matters involving Madison, and other related matters. They have \nnow issued their final report, in which they find no actionable \nconduct. They have concluded that no legal actions should be taken.\n\n  The cost of that inquiry is just under $4 million. So we add the \namounts of $2 million and $4 million on the Pillsbury Madison. The \nindependent counsel has spent, to date, we are informed, over $25 \nmillion and is spending at the rate of a million dollars a month. Of \ncourse, regarding the House committees, we do not know what the cost of \ntheir inquiry is. So over $30 million in direct costs have been spent \nby the Federal Government on the Whitewater investigation, and millions \nmore have been spent by Federal agencies assisting with or responding \nto these investigations.\n  This Whitewater committee made a very broad request to the White \nHouse for e-mails. It was so broad that it was eventually clear that \nthis really was not workable. It was an onerous request. When it was \nfinally narrowed down, we got a response from the White House. They \nhave now provided 7 of the 9 weeks of e-mails, and the other 2 weeks \nare about to come up.\n  Of course, the committee keeps sending further requests. I want that \nunderstood. This is a rolling game, and further requests are made. It \nhas cost the White House hundreds of thousands of dollars to retrieve \nthose e-mails because the Bush administration put in a system that made \nit very difficult to retrieve the e-mails. The Clinton administration \nchanged that system back. From the date when the system was changed \nback, they were able to give us the e-mails after that date \nimmediately. But the previous e-mails, under the Bush system, were \nextraordinarily difficult to retrieve. We are now in the process of \nreceiving those, and we hope to complete it soon. They have had to \nbring in a contractor from outside, lay on a lot of extra staff, and \nspend hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to do that.\n  Now, the proposal of Chairman D'Amato was first put forward for \n$600,000 and an unlimited time period. In the majority report on the \nprogress of the Whitewater investigation, which was submitted to the \nSenate on January 22 by the special committee, the minority argued very \nstrongly in its report that the committee, instead of seeking an \nextension of time and more money, should undertake an intensified \nhearing schedule in the final 6 weeks to complete its investigation by \nthe February 29 deadline. I want this very clearly understood. In mid-\nJanuary, we urged an intensified hearing schedule in order to complete \nthe responsibilities that were before us.\n  I want to point out that in the last 9 days remaining to this \ncommittee under S. Res. 120 to conduct hearings, only 1 day of hearings \nwas held--in the last 9 days of that time period. In the last 9 days of \nthe Iran-Contra committee, when it was coming up against its deadline, \nthey held hearings on 8 of the 9 days. This committee held 1 day of \nhearings over the last 9 days. No hearings this week. One day of \nhearings last week.\n  On the 23d of January, Senator Daschle wrote to Senator Dole, \nstating,\n\n       It is well within the special committee's ability to \n     complete its inquiry by February 29. The committee can and \n     should adopt a hearing schedule over the next 6 weeks that \n     will enable it to meet the Senate's designated timetable.\n\n  Senator Daschle was absolutely correct. Unfortunately, there was no \nserious effort to intensify the hearing schedule in order to meet the \nFebruary 29 deadline. In fact, sadly, to the contrary. As I indicated \nlast week, the committee held one hearing with one witness. This week, \none hearing was scheduled, but it was canceled. In other weeks, 2 or 3 \ndays of hearings were held. Never were there 4 or 5, as was done with \nIran-Contra. Indeed, as this committee did itself earlier in the year--\nthis committee itself, back in the summer, held hearings 4 and 5 days a \nweek. We have not done that once, during 1 week, in the January to \nFebruary period, even though there was no Senate business, there was no \nbusiness on the floor of the Senate, and therefore we were free from \nthose interruptions.\n\n  Some of the witnesses had nothing to add. I just want to give two \nexamples of this, which really in some ways is distressing. Susan \nStrayhorn, a former secretary, came in. A hearing started at about \n10:30, finished at 1:00 or 1:30, and many of the questions at the \nhearing were so long-winded, at one point in the hearing Mrs. Strayhorn \nstated, ``I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, could we have a short break? I am \nnodding off here.''\n  There are other examples I mentioned. We have taken over 200 \ndepositions. There is no selectivity and focus on the work of this \ncommittee. We took a deposition from a Mr. Charles Scalera. This should \nnever have happened. If the majority counsel cannot call him up and \nfind out whether there is anything there--the deposition began. He was \nbrought in. He had to be sworn. He had a lawyer. We had to get the \nreporter to record it and go through that expense. The deposition began \nat 2:15, finished at 2:30. Mr. President, 15 minutes, and these were \nthe last questions in the deposition:\n\n       Question: Do you have any other information other than what \n     you have gleaned from newspaper and media reports that you \n     can give to the special committee regarding Mr. Foster's \n     death?\n       Answer: No, none whatever. \n       \n[[Page S1423]]\n\n       Question: Any information other than what is reported in \n     the media or the newspaper regarding Whitewater Development \n     Corporation?\n       Answer: None whatever.\n       Question: Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association?\n       Answer: None whatever.\n       Question: Capital Management Services?\n       Answer: None whatever.\n       Question: Seth Ward?\n       Answer: No.\n       Question: David Hale?\n       Answer: No.\n\n  Finally, counsel says, ``Thank you very much for your time. I have \nnothing further.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator for a question. I do have a \nstatement I want to complete.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to what has been said here. \nAm I correct that, in all, the Senate investigation has spent 1.3 \nmillion of tax dollars, heard from over 150 witnesses, collected more \nthan 45,000 pages of documents, and have not proven any criminal or \nethical violations by anybody in the White House?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the current state of affairs. The Senator is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might ask a further question of my \nfriend, he is familiar with normal court procedures. I spent years as a \nprosecutor. I think, from my own judgment, if any assistant prosecutor \nin my office had gone on an expensive witch hunt like this, and a grand \njury for all this, the foreman of the grand jury would be calling me as \ndistrict attorney and saying, ``Hey, you better come down and answer \nwhat in Heaven's name you are answering to for our time and money.''\n  Would that be the experience of my friend from Maryland? At some \npoint, the grand jury or the judge would be saying, ``Why are you \nwasting our time and money?''\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the public is increasingly coming to ask those \nquestions. They are asking the question, ``Why do you now seek another \n$600,000, bringing the cost of this to just under $2 million, and why \nare you projecting it further into the President election year?''\n  As I indicated, I think the extending of--indefinitely--the proposal \nof Chairman D'Amato and his colleagues undermines the credibility of \nthis investigation and would obviously contribute to a growing public \nperception that is being conducted for political purposes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I may ask one last question of my friend from Maryland. \nI know he has a statement to make.\n  I ask if this is his experience. My experience from Vermont, a State \nwith maybe two-thirds of the people considering themselves Republican, \nmy experience has been in letters I receive constantly, in things that \npeople say to me when I am home on weekends, over and over again, \npeople of all walks of life in my State have said, ``Enough is enough. \nDon't you people have something important to do in Washington? Why are \nyou spending this time and money?''\n  I ask my friend from Maryland if that has not been his experience in \nthe State of Maryland?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think it is a perfectly legitimate \nquestion for the public to be asking. I do not think there is any \nquestion about it.\n  First of all, it must be understood that the independent counsel's \nwork will continue. Who knows how long that will go on. Under the \ncharter, it is unlimited and the amount of resources is unlimited. They \nhave already, we understand, spent $25 million, or at the rate of $1 \nmillion a month. He has broad authority. He has a professional staff of \napproximately 130 people, 30 attorneys, over 100 FBI and IRS agents, \nand the Reauthorization Act sets no limits on the duration or the cost \nof his investigation. So that is at work. It has been at work for a \nlong time. It will continue to be at work.\n  Now, he is about to start some trials. The other side treats those \ntrials as though they are going to be held on camera. They say, ``We \nneed the testimony of the people at those trials.'' Those people are \ngoing to make their testimony at the trial, and it will be on the \npublic record.\n  This committee has held almost 50 days of hearings. It has heard from \nover 120 witnesses. It has taken over 200 depositions. It has gotten \ntens of thousands of pages of documents from the White House and from \nthe President and First Lady's private attorney. It has nearly 30,000 \npages of deposition testimony.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield? I apologize, but I think it is \ntimely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator have some idea how much \nlegal expense by the individual witnesses--I saw a story in the paper \ntoday. We begin at $50,000 and $60,000 and $400,000, and individuals \nare being called before the Whitewater Committee that are absolutely \nscared to death, had no idea of what is going on, had nothing to do \nwith anything. Yet, they are advised to get an attorney, and they hire \nan attorney, and they cannot pay their mortgage. They have to borrow \nmoney to pay their attorneys' fees.\n  We keep on keeping on, keeping on, and we are absolutely ruining \nfamilies financially, calling all these people that have no relevance \nto the committee business at all. Has that ever been added up?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We do not have that figure. The figures we are giving \nare public expenditures of money to do the inquiries. The costs that \nare imposed on the people that come forward as witnesses we have no \naccounting for, although we do understand that for many of these people \nthose costs are very substantial and they are in no position to bear \nthe cost.\n  I want to distinguish between two groups of witnesses. There are some \nwho come before the committee, and I agree completely, they ought to be \nthere. There are questions that need to be asked if we are going to do \nour inquiry. One of the consequences of such inquiry is that people \nbear costs, and at some point I think we need to give consideration to \nthat as a Congress. There are other people that are being called before \nour committee and they get there, and they essentially sit there \nthrough the hearing. They really have not much to contribute. Maybe \nthey get asked a few questions, and then they, too, incur expense. Some \nof these are very young people, and others hold low-level positions--\nclerks, secretaries. It is very clear that this is a terrifying and \ntraumatizing experience for them, personally traumatizing.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, that is somewhat different from the Ethics \nCommittee or a grand jury investigation. When staff is called to go \nbefore the committee, to have representation, the Senate pays for that. \nThe Senate furnishes attorneys. If the Senator himself or herself is \nnot involved, then the Senate pays for the legal counsel.\n  So what you have here is that in certain instances we pay--we, being \nthe taxpayers--pay for the legal counsel. In this particular case it \ncomes out of the individual's pocket, hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  So I think that we are making a real mistake here, crushing families \nfinancially for the political whim of a few individuals.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would then make this point about the situation we \nfind ourselves in here now, because I know the matter is pending in the \nRules Committee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I answer that? There was a meeting of \nthe Rules Committee called yesterday afternoon at 3:30, and it was \npostponed. There has been no other meeting called of the Rules \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield?\n  Mr. FORD. I do not know that anything was before the Rules Committee \nyesterday.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may ask my colleague from Maryland to yield so I can \nask a question. I sit on the Rules Committee. There was a meeting of \nthe Rules Committee this morning, was there not?\n  Mr. FORD. An oversight meeting, from 9 o'clock until 1:30. Then there \nwas another one this afternoon at 2, and it went on until about 4 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me inquire. If a quorum had been produced in the Rules \nCommittee, could not the Rules Committee then have marked up and sent \nout the bill that we are being asked----\n  Mr. FORD. Only with unanimous consent of the Senate. We were beyond--\nthe 2 o'clock period was beyond the 2 hours. The committee hearing was \nonly for oversight. It would have had to have been expanded this \nafternoon. This morning, I am not sure. I had not given it any thought. \n\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I was referring to this morning.\n  Mr. FORD. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Was there a quorum at any point present?\n  Mr. FORD. There was no quorum. There were only three Senators there \nthis morning at any one time.\n  Mr. DODD. Was the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, who is a member \nof the Rules Committee, present?\n  Mr. FORD. No, sir.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday, as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I was informed that the Banking Committee had reported out a \nresolution under the procedures of the Senate. It came to the Rules \nCommittee, whereupon I immediately contacted the distinguished ranking \nmember, Mr. Ford, and actually went to his office where we visited for \na period of some 15 to 20 minutes.\n  In a very forthright manner, the two of us ascertained that we could \nnot achieve a quorum of nine members and, therefore, we could not act \non the legislative matter that had been received from the Banking \nCommittee.\n  Mr. Ford then counseled with the distinguished minority leader; I \ncounseled with the distinguished acting majority leader, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Lott. It was clear to me, and I was under the \nclear impression that it was clear to Senator Ford, that yesterday we \nwould not endeavor in any way to bring this matter up, even for \npurposes of discussion, even though I had earlier intended to schedule \na meeting for 3:30.\n  Today's agenda of the Rules Committee had been planned for some \nweeks. Notice was given to all members.\n  The agenda today was restricted to the subject of testimony from the \nSecretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms, and the acting \nArchitect, and other witnesses relative to their subjects. At no time \ndid Senator Ford and I discuss today the matter of the pending issue \nthat came from the Banking Committee.\n  So there was no question today of trying to raise a quorum for the \npurpose of considering the pending legislative matter that arrived \nyesterday from the Banking Committee. I regret that others somehow in \nthe colloquy today might have raised this question. I assure the Senate \nthat that was never on the agenda today. There was no effort to get a \nquorum for the purposes of consideration, and it was my clear \nunderstanding that the earliest date which the Rules Committee could \naddress this issue would be next Tuesday.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, some of my colleagues on the other side \nhave been treating this matter as though the choice is between \nterminating the inquiry right here and now or an indefinite extension, \nwhich is what Senator D'Amato has proposed. I want to underscore the \nfact that Senator Daschle put forward last week a proposal for \nproviding additional time and funding to complete the work of the \nspecial committee authorized by Senate Resolution 120.\n  Senator Daschle proposed providing until April 3, an additional 5 \nweeks, for the Senate committee to complete its hearings schedule and \nuntil May 10, a further 6 weeks thereafter, for the committee's final \nreport to be produced. Senator Daschle proposed then, in order to carry \nus through that period, additional funding of $185,000; not $600,000.\n\n  Let me point out, in Iran-Contra, in the 5 weeks leading up to the \nend of their hearings, they held 21 days of hearings. So, if this \ncommittee followed the schedule of the Iran-Contra committee in July \nand August of 1987, it could do 21 days of hearings within the time \nperiod provided by the proposal put forward by the majority leader. \nThat is almost half again as many hearings as have already been \nconducted by this committee over this entire period.\n  Five weeks of additional hearings should be more than adequate to \ncomplete the so-called Arkansas phase of this investigation. In fact, \nthat phase concerns events that occurred in Arkansas some 10 years ago, \nevents which have been widely reported on since the 1992 Presidential \ncampaign and about which much has already been said. Witnesses have \nbeen brought in, and they tell the same story that has been in the \nnewspaper 3 and 4 years ago. In fact, I must tell you--I do not have it \nhere with me, I will get it for further debate-- we had one witness \nwith whom we were going over the notes about the January 1994 period. \nSo the next day there was a story in the press about that. We compared \nthat story with the story that had been written in the press back at \nthe time. The first two paragraphs of those two stories are virtually \nidentical.\n  I mean, we are simply replowing old ground. I understand some people \nwant to do that, as well as whatever new ground there may be. But to \nnow appropriate another $600,000 in order to carry out this kind of \ninquiry? This investigation can be brought to a proper conclusion for \nfar less money than the $600,000, and the remainder of those funds can \nbe put to a far more constructive purpose. As I indicated before, the \ninquiry of the independent counsel will continue. He and his \npredecessor have already spent more than 2 years investigating \nWhitewater-related matters. We anticipate they will continue. So it is \nnot as though these matters are not going to be looked into. In fact, \nthis committee does not have the power of bringing actions. That rests \nwith the independent counsel.\n  In addition, as my distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd, pointed out, a comprehensive report by an independent law firm, \nPillsbury, Madison, and Sutro, retained by the RTC, has now been made \npublic. Its key findings are that they find no conduct on the basis of \nwhich action can be brought.\n  Let me now turn to two arguments that are put forward to support an \nopen-ended extension of time, which is what the proposal is that is \nbefore us. One is that there has been delay complying with White House \ndocument requests by the White House. And regarding complying with \ndocument requests, they point to documents that are provided late. I \njust want to make this point. Those documents were provided. I have \nbeen in other inquiries in which documents were never provided; in \nfact, in which they were destroyed. What happens here is they come \nforward with the documents. Instead of saying, ``Good, we have the \ndocuments, we can now examine them,'' people are berated because the \ndocuments were not provided earlier. It is reasonable, with respect to \neach person, to ask them why were they not provided earlier. I mean \nMark Gearan said that, by mistake, these documents were packed up, put \nin a box, and shipped over to the Peace Corps when he went there to be \nthe Director. He did not know that had taken place. Later he found out \nthat it had taken place, and he moved, then, to respond with the \ndocuments to the requests that had been made of him.\n  But it must be understood that the White House experienced \ndifficulties in complying with document requests because some of the \nmajority's requests were extremely broad and burdensome. For example, \nin early September the majority sent to the White House a request--now, \nlisten carefully to this--calling for the production of any \ncommunications, contacts, or meetings; any communications between \nanyone in the White House, current staff or former staff, and anyone on \na list of about 50 people, on any subject--any subject matter \nwhatsoever--over a 18-month period.\n  Just think of that. Take a moment to think about that. You get a \ndocument request that says we want any communication between any \npresent or former member of the White House staff, which is quite a \nlarge number. I do not know the exact number. But it is many, many \npeople, and anyone on a list of more than 50. Actually that list \nincluded any employee of the RTC which literally involves thousands of \npeople if you take it literally--any communication between those groups \non any subject matter; any subject matter whatsoever over an 18-month \nperiod. Think of the enormity of that request. Obviously, such a broad \nand onerous request slowed down the document production effort. We \nengage then in an effort to narrow this request and to focus, and in \neffect to pinpoint it on what was really relevant, and once that was \ndone, we were able to get a response in a reasonable period of time.\n  The majority request for electronic mail records encountered the \ndifficulty that the White House did not have an \n\n[[Page S1425]]\nexisting capability to retrieve all e-mail messages potentially \nencompassed by the committee's request. The White House attorneys \nexplained that the e-mail system implemented by the Bush administration \nand inherited by the Clinton administration did not save e-mail records \nin retrievable form. Under the Bush administration's system, only \nweekly backup tapes for the entire computer network were maintained up \nuntil the Clinton administration put a new system in place in July \n1994. The White House actually has produced responsive e-mail created \nafter July when they put their new system into place. So there was a \nproblem on how to proceed under the technical constraints imposed by \nthe Bush administration.\n  Finally, this matter was resolved through a more specific definition \nby the committee of the e-mail request. In other words, we were able to \nidentify particular weeks instead of a broad request over an extended \nperiod of time involving huge numbers of people. The White House \ncommitted a major outside computer contractual firm to assist it, and \nwe have now been receiving those e-mail. We still have 1 or 2 weeks to \ngo in terms of furnishing them to the committee, although additional \nrequests have been made in recent days I understand.\n  In any event, it is important to recognize that these documents were \nproduced, and, in fact, one produced contained little meaningful \ninformation.\n  Let me turn to the argument that is made that we need an indefinite \nextension in order to await the completion of the trial that is about \nto begin in Little Rock. When the Senate passed Resolution 120 creating \nthe special committee and defining its powers and responsibilities, the \nindependent counsel's investigation was already well under way. The \nSenate recognized that fact and provided for it in the resolution. It \nwas not the intent of the Senate, as reflected in the resolution, that \nthe special committee's work be delayed, or put on hold because of the \nactivities of the independent counsel. In fact, the independent counsel \nhas along the way raised concerns about the committee's investigation. \nThe committee declined to suspend its work to accommodate those \nconcerns, and on October 2 of last year Chairman D'Amato and I wrote to \nindependent counsel Kenneth Starr and advised him that the committee \nintended to proceed with its investigation contrary to wishes expressed \nby him in his letter of September 27. We said in that letter,\n\n       We believe that the concerns expressed in your letter do \n     not outweigh the Senate's strong interests in concluding its \n     investigation and public hearings into the matters specified \n     in Senate Resolution 120 consistent with section 9 of the \n     resolution.\n\n  In other words, on October 2, we said to the independent counsel we \nare going to go ahead despite your inquiries in order to complete by \nthe date provided in the resolution, February 29. We are not going to \nawait the outcome of your trial. Now we are being told just the \nopposite. Now we are being told we must await the outcome, and \ntherefore we must extend the inquiry beyond the completion of the \npending trial.\n  Indeed, four witnesses have informed the committee that they will \ninvoke their right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify. \nBut that is no reason for the committee to extend this investigation \ninto the political season, a result the Senate avoided when it provided \nthe funding for the investigation only through February 29, 1996. That \nproblem was recognized at the time. It was part of the thinking at the \ntime. And the thinking was that we would not defer if that became the \nissue before us to the independent counsel.\n  In fact, in that letter of October 2 to independent counsel Starr, \nChairman D'Amato and I said, with respect to the position of the \nspecial committee in seeking the testimony of defendants in criminal \ntrials initiated by the independent counsel, and I will quote:\n\n       The special committee does not intend to seek the testimony \n     of any defendant in a pending action brought by your office, \n     nor will it seek to expand upon any of the grants of immunity \n     provided to persons by your office or its predecessor.\n\n  That was the position that the committee took on October 2 as we \nprojected forward as to what our work schedule would be.\n  It must be understood that delaying beyond the trial will not affect \nthe ability of witnesses to assert their privilege against self-\nincrimination. In fact, I think it is fair to say that they can be \nexpected to continue to assert their fifth amendment privileges. Even \nthe availability of defendants, if one were to decide to seek them, \nwould be affected by the trial's outcome. If the defendants are \nconvicted, appeals will likely follow probably on numerous grounds and \ntake months, years. All my colleagues know the workings of the legal \nsystem. During that time, the defendants will retain their fifth \namendment privilege notwithstanding the prior trial and conviction. \nEven if acquitted, they retain the privilege for charges other than on \nthose on which they were tried. So it is very unlikely you will obtain \nthis testimony in any event.\n\n  Second, this trial is being treated as though it is going to be in \ncamera. In other words, that this trial is going to begin and that no \none is going to know what the testimony is at the trial.\n  Now, obviously, that is not the case. I am told, in fact, that the \npress and media are already moving from here in Washington to Little \nRock, and so I anticipate that the trial will be well covered and well \nreported.\n  No one knows, of course, how long the trial will last. Estimates are \n10, 12 weeks, maybe longer. I think this letter that we sent--and I \nwill discuss it at greater length subsequently because I take it my \ncolleagues wish to speak, but the October 2 letter which Chairman \nD'Amato and I sent to Independent Counsel Starr is instructive in this \nregard because it operated on the premise that we had to complete our \nwork, that we were not going to be placed in the posture by the \nindependent counsel of backing up our work behind his work. I think \nthat was a wise position then. I think it remains a wise position.\n  I am very frank to tell you, as I indicated at the outset, that the \nproposal for $600,000 funding and the unlimited extension of time is a \nproposal that disregards concerns expressed here a little less than a \nyear ago, concerns that Senator Dole has expressed on other occasions \nwith great vigor, completely disregards concerns about extending the \ninvestigation deep into a Presidential year, and therefore I think it \nundermines the credibility of the investigation and creates the public \nperception that it is being conducted for political purposes.\n  I do not think there is justification for the proposal for an \nindefinite extension of time. I am very much opposed to it.\n  Senator Daschle has come forward with an alternative proposal that I \nthink is reasonable. He has not said that we are going to simply stick \nwith Senate Resolution 120. He has offered a proposition to extend the \nhearing schedule to the beginning of April and some additional time to \ndo the report. I think the committee could complete its inquiry within \nthat time period, and I think that will give some assurance to all of \nus here and to the American people that this investigation is being \nconducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT.

McCaffrey, of Washington, to be Director of National Drug \nControl Policy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nGen. Barry R. McCaffrey, USA, to be Director of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. I congratulate the President on his fine choice.\n  As a strong supporter of the legislation to create the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy as part of the Executive Office of the \nPresident, I regret that the Office has not met my expectations. \nPerhaps no one should be surprised that the directors have been unable \nto exercise full authority over the numerous Federal agencies that have \njurisdiction and responsibilities over some aspect of the far-flung war \non drugs. These agencies range from the military, law enforcement \nagencies, public health agencies, education agencies, foreign affairs \nagencies, and border control agencies, among others.\n  The Director of this Office must be skilled in the ways of the \nnumerous bureaucracies that come within his domain. He must be able to \nmeld these disparate agencies into a single, effective weapon reaching \ntoward the same goal, even through widely different means. He must be \nable to handle competing political demands for resources and balance \nlong-term goals with short-term needs. The most important weapon in the \nDirector's arsenal is the President's committed support to the ending \nthe plague of drug use in our Nation.\n  In 1992, our Nation had achieved a remarkable record in reducing drug \nuse over the previous 10 years. While still confronting excessive crime \nrates due to illegal drugs, we had made real headway. Not surprisingly, \ncrime rates soon followed in a downward trend. I regret that this \nrecord of success has been turned around since 1993.\n  While cocaine use has been relatively stable since then, the use of \nother drugs has increased significantly. Heroin use is up, as is the \npurity of that pernicious drug. Meanwhile, the price is down, \ndemonstrating that heroin supplies have been increasing. This is not an \nunexpected problem. Under Senator Biden's leadership, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the subject of heroin trafficking in 1992. \nThe problem has still not been satisfactorily addressed.\n  Even more troubling is the sharp increase in juvenile drug use. \nRecent studies show increases in the use of all sorts of drugs among \nstudents in junior high and high schools. The sharp increase in \nmarijuana use among these children, double between 1992 and 1994, is \nmost troubling because of marijuana's frequent use as an entry-level \ndrug. Students who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use more \nserious drugs than those who do not. LSD, methamphetamine, and inhalant \nuse among students is also increasing.\n  I believe leadership from the top has been lacking for the past few \nyears. I hope that the nomination of General McCaffrey signals a \nrenewed commitment to fighting the war on drugs.\n  Wars must be fought on many fronts. Even armies with overwhelming \nstrength and superiority can lose a war to a foe that can take \nadvantage of strategic weaknesses. While the United States has been \nwaging its war on drugs, we have not been doing it intelligently. Too \nmany resources have been wasted on international eradication and \ninterdiction efforts. Not enough resources have been dedicated to the \nreal, long-term answers to the drug problem: education, prevention, and \nrehabilitation.\n  While I was a little concerned with General McCaffrey when he was \nnominated, because of his background in interdiction, those concerns \nwere put to rest by the commitment he expressed both at his \nconfirmation hearing and in his responses to questions submitted for \nthe record to prevention and treatment programs as the key to solving \nAmerica's drug problem. General McCaffrey is right. America cannot win \nthe drug war by focusing on law enforcement. Prevention, education, \nrehabilitation are the real keys to winning this war. With General \nMcCaffrey leading our efforts, I am convinced that we will do better \nand once again begin to make strides in our collective effort to reduce \nthe drug problem.\n  I also want to note my appreciation to General McCaffrey for his \nwillingness to come to Philadelphia to view first-hand the scope of the \ndrug problem in an American city and some of the innovative steps taken \nto combat that problem. I look forward to his visit soon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the U.S. Senate considers the \nnomination of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, President Clinton's nominee to \nbe Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the so-\ncalled drug czar. I strongly support General McCaffrey's nomination and \napplaud President Clinton's choice of this decorated hero of the \nVietnam and Desert Storm conflicts.\n  General McCaffrey currently runs the United States military's joint \ncommand in Latin American--Southern Command, also know as SOUTHCOM. \nSOUTHCOM is responsible for overseeing the military's Latin American \ninterdiction efforts.\n  I have been a vocal critic of President Clinton's drug policy, or \nshould I say, lack of drug policy. While President Clinton has \nabdicated his responsibility to combat the plague of illegal narcotics \nto fight the war on drugs by refusing to use the bully pulpit of the \nPresidency to speak out against drugs, I believe that he should be \ncommended for the nomination of General McCaffrey to join forces with \nothers such as Judge Freeh [FBI], Tom Constantine [DEA] and Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno who have been instrumental in fighting the drug war. \nGeneral McCaffrey has the opportunity to use his position to condemn \ndrug use and take active steps in formulating a policy that will help \nthis Nation triumph over drug abuse.\n  A question I have is whether the selection of General McCaffrey \nsignals a new-found commitment by the President to lead in the drug \nwar, or whether it is, more simply, an election year make over. But I \nam willing to give the President the benefit of the doubt. I am willing \nto see if he will provide General McCaffrey with the support necessary \nto reverse the disturbing trends we have seen the past 2 years, trends \nthat suggest substantial increases in youthful drug use.\n  In order to be successful, General McCaffrey will need to engage the \nfull support and involvement of the President. The general promised me \nthat he enjoys the President's full support. I want General McCaffrey \nto know that he will have strong allies in Congress for a serious \neffort against drugs.\n  Senator Biden and I, for example, have made a major commitment of \ntime and energy to the drug issue, including shoring up the drug czar \neven after President Clinton slashed it substantially in his first year \nin office. While the President cut the Office of National Drug Control \nstaff from 147 to 25, I am pleased that General McCaffrey said he plans \non increasing staff to its original level of 150.\n  Last summer Senator Biden and I saved the office from elimination. As \nlate as last week we interceded to lift an earmark against ONDCP's \noperating budget. These recent efforts to eliminate or cut back the \ndrug czar's office reflect congressional frustration with the Clinton \nadministration's abdication of responsibility. I hope we will see the \nPresident take a more active role in supporting General McCaffrey and \nin condemning illegal drug use.\n  General McCaffrey has raised three children free from the scourge of \nillegal drugs. I hope he will now view all this Nation's children as \nhis own, and take their futures to heart as he devises and implements a \ndrug strategy. I hope the Senate will commit to assisting him any \nreasonable way that it can.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a distinct pleasure for me to speak \nbriefly on the confirmation of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey as the Director \nof the Office of National Drug Control Policy today. It comes as no \nsurprise that a man of General McCaffrey's stature and accomplishments \nhas been confirmed so swiftly by the Judiciary Committee and the full \nSenate. As Senator Hatch mentioned in his remarks at the Judiciary \nhearing yesterday, President Clinton has made a bold and enlightened \nchoice to be our next drug czar and I know he will bring fresh energy, \n\n[[Page S1427]]\nideas, and experience to this difficult challenge.\n  I cannot let this occasion go by without briefly mentioning some of \nthe many awards and accomplishments that General McCaffrey has received \nduring his illustrious military career: two awards of the Distinguished \nService Cross, two awards of the Silver Star, three awards of the \nPurple Heart for wounds suffered in Vietnam, leader of the 24th \nMechanized Infantry Division whose left hook attack against the Iraqi \narmy was the decisive ground battle in our gulf war efforts. In order \nto accept the President's call to duty in the drug war, General \nMcCaffrey will retire form the Army: there is no greater indication of \nhis love of country than this sacrifice to take on a new challenge.\n  The extent of the drug war is well known and seems to have worsened \nduring the last few years, especially among our young people. General \nMcCaffrey's recent responsibilities as commander of the Southern \nCommand has plunged him into the counternarcotics battle, experience \nwhich will serve him well in his new post. Along with his unquestioned \nmoral authority and leadership skills, this experience makes Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey uniquely qualified for this position.\n  I urge the Congress to assist our new drug czar in this fight in \npolicy determination, financial commitment, and moral leadership. Only \nby enlisting all of us as soldiers in this war will the generals in the \nfight, such as General McCaffrey, be able to win the war on drugs. I \nwish my friend the best in his new position and it has been a singular \nhonor for me to participate with my friend, Senator Nunn, in \nintroducing General McCaffrey to the Judiciary Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1426-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, Mr. President, I want to make note of what is being \ndone here. The distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee has \nasked for a very fair unanimous consent that the Senate bring up the \nresolution extending the Special Committee To Investigate Whitewater \nDevelopment Corp., and that it would be presented in a most fair \nmanner, 2 hours of debate, equally divided, with an amendment in order \nby the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, or his \ndesignee, and an hour of debate on that, and we would then proceed to \nvote.\n  That unanimous-consent request has been objected to. It seemed like a \nfair way to proceed to me. It is normal business. You bring up a \nresolution, you have a very fair procedure where the other side can \noffer an alternative and we can have a vote on that and then proceed to \nvote on the resolution as it is presented. That has been objected to \nnow about four times. We are just trying to find a way to move this to \na conclusion.\n  This Whitewater committee has a job to do. The American people \nunderstand that. They want the job to be done. But that job is not \ncomplete. It would have been nice if it could have been wrapped up a \nmonth ago, or today. But the work is not completed. It is not completed \npartially because there has been this slow process. They talk about a \nperception of politics; how about a perception of coverup?\n  I can understand how there are documents can be misplaced at one time \nand then turn up, like the billing records did in the private residence \nat the White House. That is one example. And then there are these \ndocuments that Mr. Gearan found. Then there are the documents which Mr. \nIckes found. I think that came out just in the last week or so.\n  Every time it looks like all the documents that can be found have \nbeen found--and I am not on the committee; I am just observing it as a \nnormal Member of the Senate would--and when the Senate seems like it is \ngetting to the point where we could begin to move to some conclusions, \nanother raft of papers just appears out of thin air.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the Banking Committee. He has been \ndiligent. He has been very calm in the way he has handled this \ncommittee. He has been very fair. Yet he is, on the one hand, \ncriticized because they have not had hearings every day and on the \nother criticized because of all that has been done and all the \ndocumentation that has been accumulated. I just think he is entitled to \nsome credit for the very calm and methodical job that has been done.\n  Those who want to say, well, it is politics, those who are opposed to \nextending this hearing in the way that it should be extended, certainly \nyou would think that they would have had the Washington Post or New \nYork Times and other media in their corner. But that is not so.\n  The New York Times, in fact, on the 28th of February, said that \nSenator D'Amato has in a non-partisan way made a very strong point \nabout the need to continue the Whitewater committee. I want to read an \nexcerpt from the New York Times. The editorial supports an indefinite \nextension of the committee and the duty of the Senate to pursue this \nmatter in a fair way.\n  The New York Times editorial reads thusly:\n\n       The Senate's duty cannot be canceled or truncated because \n     of the campaign calendar. Any certain date for terminating \n     the hearings would encourage even more delay in producing \n     subpoenaed documents than the committee has endured since it \n     started last July. The committee has been forced to await \n     such events as the criminal trial next week of James \n     McDougal, a Clinton business partner in the failed Whitewater \n     land venture.\n       No arguments about politics on either side can outweigh the \n     fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full facts \n     about the land venture, the Clintons' relationship to Mr. \n     McDougal's banking activities, Hillary Rodham Clinton's work \n     as a lawyer on Whitewater matters and the mysterious \n     movements of documents between the Rose Law Firm, various \n     basements and closets and the Executive Mansion. The \n     committee, politics notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite \n     extension. A Democratic filibuster against it would be silly \n     stonewalling.\n\n  The New York Times is not exactly a Republican National Committee \npublication. The New York Times is not the only newspaper which has \nexpressed similar views. There have been similar articles in the \nWashington Post.\n  So, I am a little surprised at what I have heard here today: that \nwe're dragging the investigation out; that Whitewater is only about \nempty allegations and politics. There are also these complaints that \nthere is nothing really to Whitewater. There is no ``there, there,'' so \nto speak.\n  I do not know all the details. But I do know this, that in connection \nwith this matter, there have been numerous guilty pleas and \nindictments. David Hale pleaded guilty on March 22 to two felony \nviolations. Charles Matthews pleaded guilty on June 23, 1994, to two \nmisdemeanor violations. Eugene Fitzhugh pleaded guilty on June 24, \n1994. Robert Palmer pleaded guilty on December 5, 1994. Webster Hubbell \npleaded guilty on December 6, 1994. Christopher Wade pleaded guilty on \nMarch 21, 1995. Neal Ainley pleaded guilty on May 2. Stephen Smith \npleaded guilty on June 8. Larry Kuca pleaded guilty on July 13, 1995.\n  We have indictments on numerous felony counts of Mr. McDougal. Eleven \nfelony indictments were handed down against Governor Tucker. You know, \nI do not think we can lightly dismiss all of these things.\n  I acknowledge that these are separate proceedings that are being \ncarried forth by the independent counsel's office. But as a matter of \nfact, the Senate has an even higher responsibility. \n\n[[Page S1428]]\n We are not just looking at legal matters; we are looking at broader \nquestions of misconduct, how Federal agencies or departments may have \nbeen used, how certain Federal funds may or may not have wound up in \ncampaigns.\n  So even aside from all this, if you can just dismiss all this, you \nhave to ask yourself, should not the committee be looking at that and a \nlot of other matters that are surrounding this Whitewater affair? So, \nclearly, the committee should have an extension of its time well beyond \nFebruary 29.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield, but I want to take note that I listened a \nlong time to the Senator's statements without any interruption. If the \nSenator would like to ask a question or make a point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would prefer that I wait, I will be \nhappy to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Beg pardon?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would prefer that I wait, I will be \nhappy to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator? Then I would be glad to respond to \nquestions. And I would like to address some to the distinguished \nchairman of the committee because most Senators do not know the answers \nto some of these questions that are being asked out here today. I would \nlike to ask those of you who have been involved to respond to those.\n  Certainly, the Whitewater committee should be extended beyond \nFebruary 29. Even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nacknowledge this. But you want to put this arbitrary cutoff on it. \nRegardless of what happens in the trial that is beginning next week, \nyou want to say by a date certain we are going to stop it no matter \nwhat happens in that trial.\n  I know some of the defendants maybe will be found innocent, or maybe \nthey will be found guilty. Maybe there will be appeals. But we will \nfind out. There are witnesses, I presume, associated with that trial \nthat this committee has not been able to have testify.\n  How can we say to the committee, ``Complete your work,'' when they \nmay not have questioned some of the most critical witnesses? Again, I \ndo not know what the end result will be. I do not know how long it will \ntake. But I am uncomfortable, in view of the dribbling out of \ninformation, with saying you have to just stop it at some date certain, \nlike May 3. The minute you say this is the cutoff date, the way things \nhave transpired, what your guarantee is that there will be more \nwithholding of information until that date arrives.\n  I have some sympathy for the White House, in a way, because I am \namazed at how they handled this thing. They certainly have not helped \nthis committee finish its work, even though the Whitewater affair is a \nblight on the administration. Surely, it would be better if we could \nget it all out in the open and reach a conclusion. I am sure that the \nadministration, in many respects, is horrified at how some of this is \nbeing handled.\n  Let me say this, too. I served in the House for 16 years. I have been \nin the Senate 7 years. I was on the Judiciary Committee during the \nWatergate hearings. Oh, yes, is it not amazing how the worm sort of \nturns over the years, depending on which side of the aisle you are on. \nI remember Watergate, and I watched the Iran-Contra hearings. I watched \nthe October surprise. I never figured out what the surprise was. I got \nthe answer. There was not any. And now some of those who were saying we \nmust get to the bottom of this, that we cannot have a coverup, that we \nhave to go forward with this no matter what the cost, now they are \nsaying, ``Geez, we need to cut this thing off; it costs too much, it \nlooks political because of an election year.'' If we had gotten all the \nevidence, if the special independent counsel had completed its work, \nmaybe we could have completed it.\n  I want to talk about the dollars, too. Not only has the chairman done \na very calm, reasonable, fair job, he has also been frugal. This \ncommittee has only spent $950,000 in the 104th Congress, as I \nunderstand it, through February 29. I understand there might have been \nan amount that was actually done in the previous Congress, bringing the \ntotal to like $1.3 million, I believe, and that is what the Democratic \nleader had said earlier.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield on that point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This committee spent what was available to them. That \nwas the $950,000.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is going to relate to what I am fixing to say. You \ntalk about the cost. That is a very small amount of money in doing its \njob, especially when you compare it to what these other committees \nspent. For instance, the select committees on Iran-Contra spent well \nover $3 million, and in 1996 dollars, it would probably be $4.5 million \non that investigation, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n  The October surprise investigation cost up to $2.5 million, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office. Chairman Hyde in the House, who \nserved on the investigating committee, said the total cost, including \nsalaries and expenses, amounted to probably as much as $4.56 million. \nIt may have been for a shorter period of time, but the actual costs \nwere greater.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the total cost of \nWhitewater, including the independent counsel, at this point has been \n$12,525,000.\n  Compare this $12.5 million to the $40 million in direct costs spent \non Iran-Contra. Some estimates place the total cost of Iran-Contra as \nhigh as $100 million. Even the Watergate investigation, in which I \nparticipated, is estimated to have cost $26 million.\n  I understand you have the cost of the independent counsels and the \nentire cost of some of these other investigations, and in this case you \nhave the independent counsel going forward, but the committee itself \nhas been very reasonable in what it has spent.\n  What they have asked in additional funds is only $600,000. You are \ntalking about, based on that money, 3 months, 4 months maybe, and if \nthe work is completed before then, it certainly would have to be \ncompleted within 4 months, but it could be done before then.\n  I want to know, when did this committee establish 96 to 3, by a vote \nof the Senate last year, to become a political circus? What we are \ntrying to do here is find out the facts, not facts as determined by \nRepublicans or Democrats, but what happened in this matter. There are a \nlot of questions that remain unanswered, as far as I can see.\n  More and more this Whitewater affair looks to me like a scheme to \nfund dubious ventures illegally, perhaps with some of the tab \nultimately being picked up by the taxpayer. These are important issues, \nnot flights of fancy. To treat this investigation as anything less, as \npartisanship or vindictiveness, is wrong.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just say the Whitewater investigation is \nnot and should not be about politics. The committee has found a \ntremendous amount of information and facts that raise a lot of \nquestions. Some of those questions have not been answered yet, and the \ncommittee has done its job inexpensively and prudently. The truth needs \nto get out. The Congress has a job to do, no matter what happens with \nthe independent counsel. We need to get through the public hearings.\n  If there is wrongdoing, then the judiciary will get involved. The \nSenate's role is limited. The job of Congress constitutionally is not \nto prosecute but to reveal. It is a place not only where the people \nrule, but where the people hear. Through hearings and other means, the \nSenate has and can continue to reveal what really happened in \nWhitewater. For the good of the Presidency and for the good of the \ncountry, we must find out.\n  Surely we can find a way to come to an agreement on the necessary \nfunds to get this hearing done and completed in a reasonable way, but \nwithout artificial cutoffs. We will regret that if we do it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address a couple of questions to the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee to clear up some of these \nthings that some of the Members are wondering about and that I wonder \nabout.\n  Obviously, documents have been coming in fits and stops and not all \nthe documents that the committee subpoenaed, but I just wonder and ask \nthe chairman of the committee, what kind of cooperation have you \nreceived from the White House? The White House keeps talking about the \nnumber of \n\n[[Page S1429]]\npages of documents. The Senator from Maryland talked about this \ntremendous, voluminous amount of material that has been furnished to \nthe committee, but have we received full cooperation from the White \nHouse? Have you received everything you have asked for?\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator raised a very good point, because we have \nheard ``50,000 pages of documents being produced in response to \nrequests,'' but the fact of the matter is, as Senator Mack pointed out \nyesterday that it is not the sheer quantity of documents that matter, \nit is the quality and relevance; for example, documents that were under \nthe jurisdiction of key people with the so-called Whitewater defense \nteam, the group that was attempting to deal with press inquiries and \nother inquiries, headed by Mr. Ickes. We just received about 200 pages, \nliterally, last week. Incredible.\n  Now, we have requested that--\n  Mr. LOTT. You received 200 pages just last week?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Where did those documents come from?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It was indicated they were in a box, a file. He thought \nhe maybe turned them over to his lawyer.\n  Mr. LOTT. Who is he?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. He is Mr. Ickes, deputy chief at the White House, and in \ncharge of this task force dealing with this Whitewater and Whitewater-\nrelated matters.\n  Let me say that the production of those documents alone have raised \nvery interesting questions, and I have to think that there are many \nmore documents--because the produced records contain information \nrelating to Mr. Ickes tasking assignments out to different people. You \nknow something, we have not gotten any of those documents or any of the \ntask reports from the other members of that so-called White House \ndefense team. But that is only one individual.\n  With Mark Gearan several weeks ago, former White House communications \ndirector, the same kind of event. He claims that the documents were not \nfound because he put them in a box while he was packing. He was going \nto head the Peace Corps, and he thought mistakenly that they had been \nturned over. An inadvertence. Interesting. Because he is another member \nof the defense team.\n  Guess what? Again, just several weeks ago, the same thing. This time \nMr. Waldman, another member of the defense team, finds documents. \nAgain, it relates to specifically Whitewater-related matters. No \nquestion. I have to tell you, it does lead one to believe--even if one \nwere to accept that these were just accidental--these are delays that \nare no fault of the committee.\n  What about the manner in which the White House conducted an \ninvestigation to get the documents? Let me give you an example of what \nthe Treasury Department did. They sent a team of IRS agents in to comb \nthe files for relevant material. It is not what the White House did. \nThey had a haphazard handling of this, almost with the back-of-the-hand \nattitude, designed--or certainly if not designed, they should have \nrecognized that it certainly did not comply with the spirit and intent \nof what the President meant by promising full cooperation.\n  Last but not least is the miraculous production of the billing \nrecords--billing records that are very essential to analyze what Mrs. \nClinton did or did not do for Madison. Where are they found? In the \npersonal residence of the White House. I do not know how it got there. \nBut I have to tell you, as our friend from North Carolina, Senator \nLauch Faircloth, points out, that is one of the most secure places in \nthe world. He asked, tongue in cheek, ``Did the butler bring it \nthere?'' Who do you think had control of the billing records of the \nRose Law Firm? Who? It was not this Senator. I do not know. Where do \nyou think they found them? They were found in the personal library of \nthe First Family. Who brought them there? How did they get there?\n  Our colleagues complain that we are bringing in witnesses \nunnecessarily. An attorney, Austin Jennings, was brought in. Let me \ntell you why we asked for that poor attorney to come in. It was because \nhe came up to Washington to meet with the Clintons' personal defense \nlawyer. Are we supposed to talk to him by telephone? Why did the \nClinton's attorney not do that? He was writing a book--this is a great \nstory--and he wanted to ascertain, was Mrs. Clinton a competent lawyer.\n  Could you believe he flew from Little Rock up here to the White House \nitself to meet with the Clintons' personal lawyer and Mrs. Clinton to \nspend 20 minutes simply to say that, yes, if asked any questions, he \nwould say she was a competent lawyer? He did not even know who paid for \nhis trip. You want to talk about disingenuous. I think it is \ndisingenuous to ask why we asked this poor gentlemen to come here. \nIncredible. Sympathy and sop? Come on. Let us level somewhat.\n  I have to tell you something. The fact of the matter is that Mr. \nJennings was Seth Ward's attorney. Who is Seth Ward? If my friends want \nto debate this, we will bring out what the committee has been doing on \nthis floor. If you want to do it for 10 hours, we will do it for 10 \nhours. If you want to do it for 20 hours, we will do it for 20 hours, \nand we will spell it out.\n  Seth Ward is Webb Hubbell's father-in-law, and he participated in \nCastle Grande, the biggest of Madison Guaranty's sham deals--a $3.8 \nmillion loss. By the way, Mrs. Clinton, when asked by various \ninvestigative agencies of the Government, gave indications that she did \nnot know about Castle Grande. She heard it referred to by a different \nname. She had 15 conversations with Seth Ward. Jennings was Seth Ward's \nattorney. That is why we brought him in. When an attorney says tongue \nin cheek, like Mr. Jennings did--a smart fellow--says, ``I do not know \nwhat I am doing here,'' come on, it is disingenuous to come to the \nAmerican people and to the Senate and to say some witnesses did not \neven know why. Here is a smart lawyer, and he does not even know who \npaid for him to come up here. I have to tell you, it raises many more \nquestions than it answers.\n  It is this kind of delay and holding back that puts us here in this \nposition. You can pull out the letter and all of the conversations you \nwant. I thought we would have this matter finished by February 29. If \nwe had the cooperation of witnesses, the White House, and others, we \ncould have wound this up. But we did not have the kind of cooperation \nthat the American people are entitled to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1427-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VISIT TO THE SENATE BY HIS HIGHNESS SHEIKH JABER AL-AHMAD AL-JABER AL-\nSABAH, AMIR OF THE STATE OF KUWAIT, AND MEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL KUWAITI \n                               DELEGATION\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I know others wish to speak and ask \nquestions. I will ask one more question at this time. I think it is \nreally the key question that we had asked in answer to the objections \nwe are hearing from the other side of the aisle.\n  There have been complaints that the chairman's request does not set \nup an end date for the investigation. I assume he has some very good \nreasons for that. Why can we not say that the investigation will end on \nsuch and such a date? Why is May 3 or May 31 not an acceptable date?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is a very valid point and question. Also, again, \nwhen one looks at the contention that we have looked for an indefinite, \nad infinitum extension, that fails to take into account that we have \nasked for a finite amount of money, up to $600,000. But if we get into \nthe situation where we cannot get certain witnesses, because their \nlawyers seek--as has been spelled out in a book called ``Men of Zeal,'' \nwhere they talk about what happens if you fix a date for the end of an \ninvestigation or the work of the committee. Exactly what we are \nconfronting today is what \n\n[[Page S1430]]\nour colleague, Senator Mitchell, the former Democratic leader, and \nSenator Cohen warned us about: there will be lawyers who use the \ndeadline as a target time, and delay their clients from coming forward; \nand there will be bureaucratic stalling. It is stated quite explicitly \nin here. This is the result of hard deadlines.\n  He says: ``The committee's deadline provided a convenient stratagem \nfor those who were determined not to cooperate. Bureaucrats in some \nagencies appeared to be attempting to thwart the investigative process \nby delivering documents at an extraordinarily slow pace.''\n  My gosh, if that is not exactly what is taking place. We have \nexperienced that. If we want to guarantee that stratagem will continue, \njust put on a date certain and we will see that take place.\n  Last, it says, ``perhaps more important, the deadline provided \ncritical leverage for attorneys of witnesses in dealing with the \ncommittee on whether their clients would appear without immunity and \nwhen in the process they might be called.''\n  We have key witnesses that we want to appear. And I joined with \nSenator Sarbanes in trying to bring a key witness, Judge David Hale, \nbefore the committee. Indeed, the Senator quotes a letter of October \n2--but he does not read all of it--in which we said to the special \nprosecutor, who objected to us calling Mr. Hale in, ``having determined \nthat the Senate must now move forward the special committee,'' we were \ngoing to bring various witnesses in. ``We will, of course, continue to \nmake every effort to coordinate where practicable activities with those \nof your investigation.'' We say ``we stand ready to take into account \nconsistent with the objectives set forth your views with regard to the \ntiming of such private depositions and public testimony of particular \nwitnesses.''\n  You have to read the whole letter to understand it and you have to \nunderstand that there were briefings subsequent to this letter in which \ncounsel for the minority and the majority were advised as to the \nproblems related to bringing Mr. Hale in. If somebody wants to impugn \nthe motives of the committee for not bringing him in, I say why would I \nnot want to? I did not want, first, to have a situation where we \njeopardized the trial that would be taking place, which is starting \nthis coming week; and second, to have lost the opportunity, probably \nfor all times, to get the cooperation of Mr. Hale. I know that there \nare some in this body who may not really want Mr. Hale to come in and \ntestify, because, indeed, if he testifies, as there have been \nindications, that he was asked--or even more, told--to make a $300,000 \nloan to Susan McDougal by the then Governor, it would seem to me that \nthere are some who would not be very anxious for that to be uttered \npublicly, in view of the American people.\n  I suggest that if that is anything, it is an indication of the \nSenator's good will in not attempting--and lack of political \nmotivation--in not attempting to pull them in here and say the devil \nmay care, we do not care about that trial, I want somebody to come in \nhere and make accusations against the President and the First Lady. I \ndid not go in that direction. I think I chose to act in a responsible \nmanner in accordance with the request of the special counsel. Yes, I \nwanted Mr. Hale to come in, but indeed the special counsel was able to \nmake a convincing argument, and I think we did the right thing.\n  What would they have said, what would this body have said if I asked \nto immunize David Hale? They would have risen up, by the Democratic \nleadership, calling me and accusing me of all kinds of things, and \nwould have said, ``What are you doing? You want to immunize a crook and \na thief to have him make accusations?'' Think about it. Come on. Let me \nask the question. What are you hiding? What are you afraid of? Why do \nyou not want the facts to come out?\n  The New York Times says that, and this is what most responsible \nnewspaper editorials are saying. When you suggest that we are asking \nfor an unlimited period of time, that is not what we say. We couch it \nin terms of no more than or up to $600,000. But if we spell out, I say \nto my friend, a specific time certain, by gosh, everything that has \ntaken place in terms of the procrastination, in terms of the documents \nthat find their way--oh, I just found it in this book. Can you imagine, \ntrained lawyers who are in charge of defending the White House giving \nus this drivel--drivel--that they were not aware that the documents \nwere not turned over, documents setting out, tasking other members of \nthe White House at the highest levels, what to do as it related to \nWhitewater.\n  This was the very man charged with the responsibility of mastering \nand bringing the very forces together--Mr. Ickes, Deputy Chief of Staff \nof the White House. I could just imagine if my friends and colleagues \nwere in the majority and that was the Bush administration, and that was \nthe manner in which their Chief of Staff was responding--Deputy Chief \nof Staff--on a particular matter. We are not talking about one instance \nor two instances. This is repeat; a pattern.\n  Want to talk about delay? We, unfortunately, were delayed for weeks \nand weeks because we had to battle over documents being produced and we \nhad to vote subpoenas and come to the floor of the Senate. Who \noccasioned that political debacle? Who is it that created that \npolitical firestorm? We are always tested. Weeks and weeks and months \nand months of negotiations behind the scene. My friend brings out and \nsays these subpoenas are so far reaching. He knows that those were, \nindeed, the preliminary negotiations as it related to scope and \nbreadth. In only one case did we not agree upon the breadth and scope \nof the subpoenas. We agreed on every other one of them.\n  It is disingenuous to come out and say officially they requested a \nfar-reaching subpoena. That happens and is part of the process in \nnegotiating. We did negotiate. The one exception was the case where we \nhad to come to this body and vote the enforcement of a subpoena and \nthen, miraculously, we get the documents on a Friday afternoon. It's \nalways on a Friday, by the way, most of these documents appear Friday \nafternoons; they get the least press.\n  Want to talk about politics? Talk about politics in the White House \nanswers. When we ask for documents, let me tell you what the White \nHouse, Mr. Fabiani of the White House says, ``Tell Senator D'Amato and \none of his fat cats to pay for the production of them.'' Is that the \nkind of response that the Senate and the committee is entitled to when \nwe ask for electronic e-mail? ``Tell the Senator and his fat cats to \npay for it.''\n  Want to talk about crude political assassination? How about the team \nthat they had over there, Mr. Waldman, who was assigned a task to get \ninformation, to get dirt, on Senator D'Amato, on White House time, and \nthen send it over to the Democratic Committee. Is that what we are \ninvolved in? Want to talk about a low down kind of thing--that is fact. \nThat is fact.\n  Now, look, I never intended nor did I wish for this hearing, these \ninvestigations, to go into the political season. Had we had cooperation \nand had we been able to get some of the witnesses in, we would not have \nto be asking for that. Had we not been precluded from some of the \nwitnesses we could have even made our request such that we will examine \nonly these witnesses that we have not had access to. I did not delay \nthe production of these documents. The committee was not responsible \nfor the miraculous production of the billing records that showed up in \nthe White House.\n  The fact of the matter is that we have encountered a far different \nsituation than has been promised to us. The President promises \ncooperation. Those who carry out the President's wishes have stalled, \nhave delayed, have been engaged in dilatory tactics. I will at a \ncertain point in time elucidate on those and touch on those with \ndefiniteness. If, indeed, they think that by the political attacks upon \nthe committee or upon the chairman that they are going to dissuade us \nfrom doing our job, and that is to get the facts, they are wrong.\n  I suggest that we call a truce, call a truce to the politicization of \nthis, and say we will agree to get the facts and work together. We have \ndemonstrated we can do that. I have no doubt that some of my colleagues \nare placed in a \n\n[[Page S1431]]\nvery awkward position. I do not think they like what they are doing and \nsaying--some of the things that they say. I think they are almost \nforced to do it. I think they are compelled to do it by an \nadministration that seems to be totally bent on keeping the facts from \ncoming to the people, an administration that says, ``We don't care.'' \nWhy do you not care what the public thinks? Why are they not entitled \nto the truth? What is it that lurks behind that stone wall that has \nbeen constructed? We have not had cooperation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask, then, that we go ahead and vote to \npass this resolution, stop the filibuster, find a way to get an \nagreement to go forward with these hearings, find the information that \nwe need to draw the conclusion to the hearings. I think that can be \ndone. I hope we will seek to find that process. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for some questions?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from New Mexico \nbut I indicated earlier I would be glad to yield for some questions, so \nI would like to be able to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First, the Senator indicated, as I understood it, the \ncosts of the independent counsel were $12 million, is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. According to the information I have from the Congressional \nResearch Service, the total cost of Whitewater to that point is \n$12,525,582. That is the congressional investigation plus the \ninvestigation of Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr to this point. I have \nheard various estimates from several sources, all the way up to $25 or \n$30 million, but that is the information I got from the Congressional \nResearch Service. If it is more than that, I would be glad to get that \ninformation, but that is not what I have.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I just want to put on the record, because I think it is \nimportant to keep it accurate if we can, that the GAO did a financial \naudit. It does periodic financial audit reports. The audit report for \nthe period January 1994, which is when Fiske began, to March 1995, by \nthe GAO, was $14,600,000.\n  In addition, an estimate has been made from the period subsequent to \nMarch 1995. In other words, April 1995 to January 1996. Based on the \nlevel that they were following at the end of the previous period--and, \nof course, the independent counsel has, in fact, intensified his \nefforts, but that is not taken into account--that figure would be $11 \nmillion, which would give you a total of $25,600,000.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, to respond to that, we could probably argue back \nand forth about what the accurate number is. The source that I have \nhere, Congressional Research Service, versus GAO. But I still say that \nis probably just barely more than half what was spent on Iran-Contra. \nAnd that is still less than what I understand was spent on Watergate. \nSo what is your point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course Iran-Contra involved sending investigators \noverseas, if you recall, both to the Middle East and to South America.\n  Mr. LOTT. It might have been easier to get what you are looking for \nthan what we experienced in the Whitewater. I do not know.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the next point I want to address. The fact of \nthe matter is the committee has now received from the White House \nvirtually everything that has been requested. There are a couple of \nweeks----\n  Mr. LOTT. Voila. Maybe that is true. I do not know. I do not know if \nthe committee even knows that. All I do know is there has continued to \nbe this drizzle of information. The Senator surely feels discomforted \nby the way documents have appeared in various places, at the White \nHouse, in boxes at the Peace Corps, and Vice Chief of Staff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me give one example. Gearan came before us and he \nsaid this is how this happened. I thought it was a plausible statement, \nfrankly. I mean, Gearan said when he packed up to go over to the Peace \nCorps his file was put in that box unbeknown to him and he did not find \nit over there. When he found it he tried to get it back into the loop. \nI think that is a plausible statement.\n  You have to judge it on your own. But the fact is, the documents have \nbeen provided in the end. The fact that there was a deadline----\n  Mr. LOTT. Do we know that is all of them? There was another group of \npapers that came to the committee just last week, 200 pages, not from \nGearan but from Ickes. If it were one example, or maybe two--but three? \nI am not on the committee. The committee tells us, tells the Senators. \nIs this all the documentation or not? I do not know. I am under the \nimpression there is reason to believe maybe there is more information \nthat we should try to obtain. Maybe there is information, even from the \nindependent counsel, that that might be available at some point. But we \nare not even going to be able to look at any of that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No; the independent counsel is not able to make his \ninformation available to us, under grand jury requirements. Certainly \nthe Senator----\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the point. I assume at some point----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Are you suggesting we should transgress those?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am suggesting at some point his work will be completed \nand some of what he has may, in fact, be available to the committee. I \ndo not know to what extent. But I am just expressing a concern about \nhow we just go ahead and wrap it up in 30 days and say we are done with \nit when there appears to be--in fact, when I look at this, from what I \nam hearing and what I have heard, it looks to me like the committee \nreally is just getting started with this work. You have not started \nfinding out some of the answers that are still pending out there.\n  I do not want to ask a whole series of questions. Maybe some more \nwill be asked by the Senator from New Mexico. But there are other \nquestions pending. You have not started to write the report. We do not \nknow what is going to be the result of this trial down there.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We got the Gearan notes. We held a day of hearings with \nGearan. We had nothing substantially new and the same thing happened \nwith Ickes. We got the notes. We held the hearing on both of them. In \nboth instances we received the notes and the hearings have been held.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is that a question or a statement?\n  Mr. SARBANES. No; it is a response to the point you just made.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New Mexico would \nlike to get into this with some questions and a statement. I yield the \nfloor at this time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder, Senator D'Amato, would you answer the last \nquestion? I am asking it of you now.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, the Gearan notes indicate quite a few things that \nwe did not know. They indicated----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. They indicated an attitude of the Deputy Chief of Staff \nand others, but certainly the Deputy Chief of Staff, that they were \nconcerned, very concerned. And they characterized in very descriptive \nlanguage what professionals, civil servants at the Justice Department, \nwere doing. And they did not like it. They did not say they are doing a \nprofessional job. They said, in essence, they are working us over. He \nis a bad guy. That is what we find in the Gearan notes.\n  We find a whole series of meetings that we were not aware of. No one \ncame in and told us that we met on this day and the next day and we met \nin the morning and we met in the afternoon. Oh, no. We learned \nthereafter that various tasks are given out. And I have reason to \nbelieve, as it relates to the question that was asked, I say to the \nSenator, by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, \nthat, indeed, there very well may be--and I would suspect there are--\nsubstantial documents that have not been turned over to this committee \nor that may have been discarded deliberately, particularly by that \nteam, that so-called Whitewater team. I cannot believe that we have \nonly received documents from a handful of them.\n  Where is it? Where are they? What happened to those tasks? What did \nthey do? What were their responses to \n\n[[Page S1432]]\nthe tasks, very carefully enumerated? We will go through that.\n  Last, but not least, I think it is rather interesting that the First \nLady turns up at, I believe, the first meeting--I may be wrong--the \nfirst meeting. And according to Mr. Gearan's notes: Oh, this looks like \na meeting I would like to attend or that I would be interested in.\n  No, let us not let it be said that these were just casual, \nindifferent, that these were notes that had no meaning. They reflected \na pattern of concern, of fear, of absolutely disdain, in some cases, \nfor the work that professionals at the Justice Department were \nundertaking.\n  So, to your question, Senator Domenici, they were very revealing and \nrevealed facts that we were not aware of, facts that we are still \npursuing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise for just a few minutes today to \ntalk about this Whitewater issue. I will take very little time.\n  I think I should say to my friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat I believe they are making a very big mistake. I can tell you that, \nif they intend to preclude us from bringing this resolution to the \nfloor and they intend to use that tool called filibuster, the American \npeople are going to get their ears and eyes filled with Whitewater. \nHowever, it will not be in the records of the Whitewater Committee. It \nwill be here on the Senate floor, and, frankly, what they are going to \nhear they are not going to like.\n  What they are going to hear is going to convince them, I say to my \nfriend from Maryland, that the reason this committee needs more time is \nnot because of Chairman Al D'Amato of New York taking too much time, \nbeing too slow, not doing enough work, and not working the committee \nand his staff hard enough. That is pure bunk. There are reasons why we \nare still here and there are plain and simple reasons why we need more \ntime: This is about the toughest committee investigation you will ever \nfind.\n  Why? The first reason is because witnesses are telling half-truths \nall over the place. Witnesses are losing their recollection in a way \nwhich would make you think that a wave of amnesia has begun to affect \nyoung people. Witnesses cannot remember anything. In fact, I cite the \ntestimony of just two of them. We had one witness, Josh Steiner. He was \nthe chief of staff for the Secretary of the Treasury at one point. This \nyoung fellow claimed that he could not believe his own diary. Imagine \nthat.\n  So people had to spend time getting to other witnesses and bringing \nthem in to verify because he could not believe his own diary.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When was that hearing on Steiner?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That was the very first part of the hearings.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Summer of 1994. I was there for that. So I know that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Summer of 1994.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what I was just told by counsel. That the \nhearing took place 2 years ago has nothing to do with whether he should \nbelieve what was in his diary. When we asked him, he had the diary put \nin front of him.\n  There is also another one. There is April Breslaw. This is a good \none. This witness refused to even verify that her own voice on a tape \nrecording was actually hers. That is the kind of thing this chairman, \nthis committee, and the competent staff had to go through day after day \nwith White House witnesses.\n  Why do I say that to the American people? I guarantee you that is \nwhat makes hearings go on forever. Hearings go on forever when you have \nto bring in extra witnesses to verify facts, when you have to bring in \nanother witness to verify the verifier, and then some witnesses only \nknow part of the truth, and others do not remember anything. That takes \ntime. It takes energy. That takes competent legal counsel. That is one \nreason--because the huge entourage of witnesses were about as difficult \nas you will find in terms of volunteering information and getting it on \nthe Record, getting it straight, and getting it right the first time.\n  And the second reason we need an extension--it will come out in huge \npanorama for the American people, if the other side chooses to \nfilibuster this--is that the White House and the White House staff are \nmore responsible than anyone else for this committee being unable to \nget its work done. Let me tell you why.\n  It came as a shock when, after subpoenas had been outstanding for a \ncouple of years, all of a sudden just before a witness is supposed to \ntestify, they find documents in the White House. Let me tell you, that \nmakes for prolonged hearings. When that evidence should have been \navailable for months, Mr. Ickes finds 200 pages of evidence just before \nhe has to appear. These files and notes in some miraculous way all of a \nsudden became relevant and responsive to the subpoena. That costs time \nand exacerbates the delay. If that had been produced when it was \nsupposed to have been produced, it would have been analyzed and these \nhearings could have been over with.\n  I am merely telling those listening just who is to blame for the \ndelay. And that is just a little part of this debate. But anyone who \nblames the committee, the committee's chief counsel--counsel \nextraordinaire, in my opinion--for this dilemma will find more things \nin this Record to justify our committee and its counsel's competency \nand ability than anybody has ever thought could be put before the \nSenate.\n  If they want to bring Whitewater here and keep it on the Senate floor \nfor a week, then people are going to hear what happened in the course \nof this investigation. It has been locked up in a committee. It will be \nunlocked here before the American people, and they are going to pass \njudgment, I tell you, Mr. President. And if the other side of the aisle \ndoes not agree that this investigation ought to go forward, they are \nharming our President. That is who they are harming, because it is not \ngoing to go away. I do not know of a single Member on this side of the \naisle who thinks this is going to go away. And I would think, in \nfairness, there are many on that side who know they ought to extend \nthis committee's work.\n  They can get up on the other side, whether it is my friend from \nMaryland or whomever, and say, Senator D'Amato is asking for too much. \nAs I understand it, he is asking for $600,000, which is probably \nbetween 3 and 4 months of effort at most, and then the committee would \nrun out of money. Why did he choose not to agree to a date certain? \nBecause he has now been informed by those who have undertaken \ninvestigations before him that to agree to a date certain invites more \ndelays. So essentially this is not open ended because the committee \nwill be out of money soon--in 2 or 3 months.\n  I can recite lots of facts about the Whitewater investigation. I can \ncome down next time and give my friend, Senator D'Amato, a couple of \nhours here. I will read some transcripts, and I will put them in the \nRecord, and we will see why it was so tough to get things accomplished \nand why the investigation is not concluded. And we will see whose fault \nit is.\n  But, frankly, I believe the Democratic leader ought to sit down with \nthe Republican leader, Senator Al D'Amato, and the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland. They ought to decide and reach an agreement on \nhow we should continue these hearings.\n  But we should not take a week in this Chamber exposing what is going \non in these hearings, but I guarantee for those who want to do it, the \nPresident is not going to win. The President is not going to win that \ndebate. If they think the American people are going to end up saying, \n``Hurrah, hurrah, we should stop these hearings,'' let me tell you, \nthey are mistaken. They are going to end up saying, ``What's the matter \nwith that White House? What's the matter with all those people? And all \nthat time and effort spent at the White House on Whitewater. Something \nis fishy.'' They are going to say, ``Something is being covered up.''\n  I came down to suggest that and to support the chairman. I happen to \nbe on this committee. I am not a long-time member. I have been here a \nlong time but not on the committee. But I think the committee has done \na very good job. I do not think that in the debate over this extension \nthat anyone ought to come down here and add onto this record \nindications that the committee is in any way to blame for the delays \nthat have been caused.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas. \n  \n[[Page S1433]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield to me for just a \nmoment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wish to point out to the Senator from New Mexico that \nthis committee held 1 day of hearings in the last 9 days leading up to \nthe end of our time. The Iran-Contra Committee held hearings in 8 of \nthe last 9 days leading up to the end of its time.\n  Your leader, Senator Dole, with respect to the Iran-Contra Committee, \ninsisted that it have a timeframe because, he said, it would not be \nfair to run that inquiry into the 1988 political year. The Democrats in \nthe Congress, led by Chairman Hamilton and Chairman Inouye from the \nSenate, agreed with that. They provided a time limit, and then they met \nalmost around the clock over the last month. They held 21 days of \nhearings in the last month in order to complete their work. Now, it was \nyour leader who pressed that case very hard. And the Democrats \nresponded to it, in all fairness. Now, this situation is in complete \ncontrast.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume the Senator is asking for an observation or \ncomment on my part.\n  Let me say to my friend from Maryland, I just want to repeat, I do \nnot think that this committee has been intentionally dilatory. I do not \nthink for a minute that Senator Al D'Amato wants to use this to carry \nit into the Presidential election. Frankly, I look back at the last 3 \nmonths and I kind of wonder how he was able to hold as many hearings as \nhe did. I look at what has happened in the Senate during most of that \ntime. We had more votes during a 2- or 3-week period than we have ever \nhad.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is not accurate, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not mean in the committee. I mean in December in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand. In January and February, when we urged \nthe committee to do an intensified schedule, when the Senate was not \nholding floor sessions and not voting, over that 2-month period we held \nonly 15 hearings. The Iran-Contra Committee in a month's time held 21 \nhearings. So during that period, January and February--in other words, \nthe last 2 months of this committee's existence--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We had a blizzard. Nobody could get around for a week.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The schedule ground down. It did not intensify. And \nover the last 10 days we have only had 1 day of hearings.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I almost welcome this, and I am not in a position to do \nthis right now, but if we continue this I will ask counsel for this \ncommittee to prepare a work product evaluation for the last 90 days of \nwhat the staff of this committee has gone through to try to get this \nmoving, and we will produce it here. And anybody who thinks there has \nbeen intentional delay is truly not paying close attention to this \nsituation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me also respond to my friend from New \nMexico.\n  Earlier in the afternoon, we did a very quick summary of what the \nSenate has done in the year 1996 as compared to 1995. In fact, I do not \nhave that sheet before me, but I think we have had--if I am not \nmistaken, I think the Senate this year, in 1996, has had 21 votes, \ntotal. In 1995, we had had 97 votes up until this time. So basically, \nthe Senate, except for the Whitewater operation, has been pretty well, \nlet us say, called to a halt.\n  We have been waiting for all the primaries to get over, and we have \nbeen accommodating. We have been cooperative, et cetera.\n  Also, I think earlier in the afternoon--I do not know if our friend \nfrom New Mexico was here--talking about the lack of cooperation from \nthe White House--I hope, Mr. President, my friend will listen to this--\nthis committee has requested all documents covering an 18-month \nperiod--listen to this, please--any communication of any kind relating \nto any subject between the President, First Lady, any present or former \nWhite House employee, and any employee of the RTC and several dozen \nnamed individuals. The next group, the committee authorized a subpoena \nasking for all telephone calls--I heard the Senator from New Mexico, my \nfriend, a while ago talking about his own area code. What is that area \ncode?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. 505.\n  Mr. PRYOR. 505. Arkansas is 501. The committee authorized a subpoena \nasking for every telephone call from the White House in Washington, DC, \nto any area code 501 number, the entire State of Arkansas, for a 7-\nmonth period.\n  Third, they asked, above and beyond the committee's already overbroad \nauthorization, the majority staff unilaterally, unilaterally issued a \nsubpoena for all White House telephone calls from any White House \ntelephone or communications device for a 7-month period in 1993 to \nanywhere in the country. This is the type of documentation the \ncommittee is trying to force the White House to come up with.\n  Now, it is my understanding that the committee is trying to get all \nof the e-mail messages from the White House. Well, I would say to my \nfriend from New Mexico, I think that this White House has been \nextremely cooperative, and you know it was not just but a very few \nyears ago when, in September 1992, after a subpoena, after a subpoena \nhad been issued in the Iran-Contra affair, you might remember because \nthe Senator was certainly here at that time, as this Senator was \npresent, in September 1992, an administrative staff assistant, Patty \nPrescott, found George Bush's diary, President Bush's diary which was \nunder subpoena. Where did they find it? They found it on the third \nfloor of the White House living quarters.\n  Even when the document was not delivered to the investigators, as the \nsubpoena called for--not delivered--Ms. Prescott told President Bush of \nher discovery and said she believed it was relevant to the latest then-\ncounsel request. The President said he directed Ms. Prescott to have \nthe Presidential counsel at that time, C. Boyden Gray--we all \nremember--``sort it out.'' That was December 1992, after the election, \nafter the election when Mr. Clinton had won and Mr. Bush had lost. I do \nnot think that the diary was ever turned over to the investigators. If \nit was, I do not have any knowledge of it.\n  I do not recall my friend from New Mexico or my friend from New York \never coming to the floor of this Senate and saying, ``Oh, my goodness, \nthis has been a terrible transgression; this has been a terrible \nobstruction of justice.'' George Bush did not present his diary to the \nsubpoena's call and request for that diary.\n  So I just think we ought to put things in perspective. I think we \nought to talk about how this White House has cooperated--45,000 pages \nof statements and testimony and records have been turned over from the \nWhite House to this committee. They deposed 202 persons; 121 witnesses \nhave testified to this date before the Committee on Whitewater, and the \nexamination, as I have said, of thousands and thousands and thousands \nof pages.\n  We on our side of the aisle think that we have proposed a reasonable \nsolution to this so-called impasse, a reasonable solution. April 3, \ncontinue with our hearings until April 3, and then allow the Whitewater \nCommittee to, at that time, write a report and submit that report to \nthe Congress and to the public on its findings and any recommendations \nthat it might have.\n  Then after that, any and all information, I assume, would be turned \nover to the special counsel, Mr. Kenneth Starr, who is in Little Rock, \nAR. I am sure he would love to receive all of these truckloads of \ninformation that will be driven from Washington, DC, down to Little \nRock and deposited in Mr. Starr's office, including all of the \ntelephone logs, all of the telephone records, and even the subpoena for \nChelsea Clinton's nanny. I am sure he would enjoy seeing that subpoena, \ntoo.\n  It is my understanding that there is a whole new list now out that \nthe chairman wants to bring before the Whitewater committee, people who \nhave no way to pay their legal bills, people who have no way to pay the \ncosts of coming, mostly from Arkansas, to Washington, DC, and back.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to talk some sense into this matter. I \nthink we have made a reasonable offer. I am very hopeful that our \ncolleagues on the other side will consider that offer. \n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n  I have one other thing I wanted to place in the Record. But should my \nfriend desire to ask a question, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me just say that we are going to miss him \nwhen he leaves the Senate.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the manner and demeanor he uses in \nsituations like this. It is pretty obvious he has been a loyal friend \nof the President for a long time. I respect him for that. Nothing I \nsaid here on the floor had anything whatsoever to do with a lack of \ncooperation. You can have cooperation, but what is the quality of the \ninformation provided by those who are told to cooperate?\n  Frankly, I say to the Senator, I believe that when Mr. Ickes just \nrecently, 2 weeks ago, all of a sudden discovered 200 documents that \nhad been under subpoena for a long time, and going through the \ntranscripts and finding the large number of ``I don't remembers'' and \nthe number of people forgetting things that hardly anybody could \nforget, not believing they are on tape recorders even if they are, and \nsaying, ``That is not me''--when you have all that, it is pretty \nobvious that the committee is having difficulty getting facts and \ngetting to a conclusion.\n  It is in that context that I speak here today. Frankly, you all have \nmade an offer from the other side. You think it is reasonable. The \nchairman and his legal counsel, who know more about it than I do, think \nit is unreasonable. Somewhere between what you have presented and some \nother proposition may be where we ought to end up.\n  But all I wanted the Senator to know is that there are a lot of \nSenators on this side, who I think are fair-minded people and worried \nabout many of those staff and their legal bills. I read in the paper \nabout it. I am not one running around here saying they should not find \nresources to help them. I know about that kind of stuff. I am for \ntrying to let them find resources to help with their bills. But that \ndoes not mean this committee is to blame for the kind of slipshod \nefforts that have gone on with reference to the type of cooperation \nthat the President obviously told them to give to this committee.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may respond now that I have the floor. \nI want to thank my friend from New Mexico. I have loved serving in this \nbody. I have enjoyed so much my service with the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico and the Senator from New York and my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. It has been a hope and a dream that I have hoped \nfor all of my life. I have been one of the fortunate 1,800 and some odd \npeople who have had this great privilege. So I thank my colleague very \nmuch.\n  But the Senator and several of our colleagues have made reference \nduring the discussion this afternoon of how many times witnesses \nforget, how many times they say, ``I don't know'' or, ``I don't \nrecall.''\n  Let me ask my friend from New Mexico, what was the Senator doing 12 \nyears ago? I am asking my friend, what was the Senator doing 12 years \nago today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us see, 12 years ago.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, 12 years ago today. Does the Senator recall who he \ntalked to on the telephone?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was probably campaigning for reelection.\n  Mr. PRYOR. The Senator was probably campaigning, but he does not \nrecall specifically?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If I had a chance to look at all my records and prepare \nfor a deposition, I probably could recall something.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. What if the Senator had a diary?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe if I had a diary. Everybody knows I do not have a \ndiary.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I was trying to bring brevity. Some of these events \nhappened 10, 12, 15 years ago, a decade ago, 6 and 7 and 8 years ago. A \nlot of these people did not have an associate or maybe someone we might \ncall a staff person to keep a diary, to keep a phone log, to keep \nrecords for them. And they are trying, to the very best of their \nability, to come up here and tell the truth as they know the truth. \nYet, many times they appear to be badgered before the committee day \nafter day. Sometimes they are attempting to answer the question, and \nthe counsel will not even give them that opportunity. I would just----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. One of the things that is happening--and I think this \nneeds to be understood--is that we get notes and testimony, and then it \nis treated as though it is some new discovery. ``Oh, we found out \nsomething that no one knew anything about.'' For example, when Mr. \nIckes came in, a lot of focus was on the fact that there was this \ndamage control squad to deal with the Whitewater matter set up in early \n1994 and that he was the head of it.\n  So this is treated in the hearings--and it has been done here on the \nfloor as well today--as a major revelation, a new sort of breakthrough \nin discovery of facts that has been made.\n  This is from the Washington Post, January 7, 1994:\n\n       With the start of the new year, the White House launched a \n     major internal effort to fight back against mounting \n     criticism of the way it has handled inquiries into President \n     Clinton's Arkansas land investments. A high-powered damage \n     control squad was appointed under the direction of new Deputy \n     Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, and daily strategy sessions \n     began.\n\n  This article was in January 1994, reporting on this matter. Then we \nhold a hearing, we get these notes, and this is treated as though some \nmajor revelation has been discovered.\n  Actually the report on February 16, 1996, reads:\n\n       Four days into the new year of 1994, top White House aides \n     gathered in the office of then Chief of Staff Thomas F. \n     ``Mack'' McLarty for the first meeting of the Whitewater \n     response team.\n\n  You could take the story from January 1994 and the story written \nafter our hearing, and they are virtually the same. Yet this is \nportrayed as though something new has been revealed or discovered. This \nsort of process is going on all the time. Members need to understand \nthat. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am going to yield in just a moment. I \nhave only a few more points I wish to make. I would like to read, if I \nmight, Mr. President, a few sentences from a February 15 editorial from \nthe Atlanta Constitution. This editorial begins by saying, ``The \nSenate's Watergate hearings of 1973-1974''--Watergate hearings--``were \nmomentous, delving into White House abuses into power, leading to the \nresignation of a disgraced President, and the imprisonment of many of \nhis aides. That lasted 279 days. Next week Senator Alfonse D'Amato''--I \nwant my friend to know that I am mentioning his name, and I do not want \nhim to think I am abusing his name; I am simply reading from the \neditorial--``next week Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican, New York, \nand his fellow Whitewater investigators, will surpass that mark. \nToday,'' which was February 15, ``is the 275th day.''\n  The Watergate hearings went 279 days. And we have already surpassed \nprobably almost 280 days. ``And they have nothing anywhere near \nconclusive to show for their labors. To put matters in context, all \nthey have to do is ponder a fairly obscure 1980's real estate and \nbanking scandal in Arkansas.''\n  Let me interject here, Mr. President. President and Mrs. Clinton made \nan investment, and it went sour. They lost everything in that \ninvestment that they made. I do not know what it was, $50,000 or \n$60,000, $30,000. I am not sure how much they lost.\n  What would have happened had they made that much money in this \ninvestment or had they made $500,000? We would have really seen a \nmomentous explosion. But they lost money, and they show that they lost \nthat money.\n  Reading further:\n\n       With the February 29 expiration date for the special panel \n     staring him in the face, D'Amato has the effrontery to ask \n     the Senate for more time and more money to continue drilling \n     dry investigative holes. Specifically, he wants open-ended \n     authority and another $600,000. That's on top of the $950,000 \n     his committee has spent so far, plus $400,000 that was \n     devoted to a Senate Banking Committee inquiry into Whitewater \n     in 1994.\n\n  Mr. President, I conclude with the last paragraph of this editorial:\n\n       The First Couple is still under investigation by \n     independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, a former Reagan Justice \n     Department official \n\n[[Page S1435]]\n     who can be expected to scrutinize the Clinton's legal and business \n     affairs rigorously. Any additional sleuthing by Mr. D'Amato \n     would be a waste of taxpayer money.\n\n  That comes from the Atlanta Constitution.\n  An editorial that appeared yesterday in, I believe, the Washington \nPost states, and I read:\n\n       Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut reluctantly agreed \n     to renewal of the Senate Whitewater committee's expiring \n     mandates, suggesting limiting the extension to 5 weeks ending \n     April the 3rd. Along with the minority leader Tom Daschle and \n     other leading Senate Democrats, Mr. Dodd told reporters \n     yesterday that they were prepared to filibuster against any \n     extension beyond April.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no desire for anyone to filibuster this \nlegislation. We have offered a reasonable compromise, and that \nreasonable compromise is to go to April 3 and then to allow a 30-day \nperiod for a committee report to be sent out to the public and to the \nSenate and to the Congress of the United States. We think that is fair. \nWe think that is reasonable. We think and we hope that proposal will be \ngiven very careful consideration by our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, and I will yield to my friend, Senator \nThomas, for some questions that he might want to pose, but before I \nyield to him for the purpose of questions, let me say, we can all quote \neditorials. My friend and colleague gave a viewpoint of a distinguished \nnewspaper, but let me say, if one were to look at the major newspapers \nof this country, very clearly--and I am not talking about now the \nopinions expressed by various pundit s, but rather the editorial \npages--you will find overwhelmingly, 5 to 1 or more, a clear pattern. \nThose in the media who have been following this, like the American \npeople who have been following it have been supportive of our efforts.\n  And I'd like to add the manner under which we are compelled to \noperate does not make our work quick or easy. That is, bringing in \nwitnesses, deposing them.\n  You cannot schedule 1 day after the other. You have to bring in \nwitnesses and examine them. Thousands of hours go into these hearings, \nnot just the hearings that are heard publicly, but in preparation for \nthem. Otherwise, we would have had many, many witnesses who came in \nand, rightfully, the minority and, more important, the American people \nwould have said, ``Why are you bringing these people here? They have no \nrelevance.''\n  We have examined well over 100 witnesses--well over--and we will go \ninto that. This month alone, we have examined dozens of witnesses not \nin a public forum. Many of them we will not call, because we have found \nthat they do not add to the investigation.\n  So it is not accurate to suggest that the committee has not been \ndiligent, notwithstanding that there may have been a period of time \nwhen we have not had many public hearings.\n  Again, as it relates to the various editorials, I will speak to some \nof them, but I will tell you that when you find most of the Gannett \nchain, when you find the Los Angeles Times, when you find the New York \nTimes, when you find the Washington Post and others, for the most part, \nsupporting very clearly that the work of the committee continue, I \nthink it underscores the need for us to find the facts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am not going to. I want to take questions, but I want \nto yield for some questions which I think Senator Thomas wants to----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator read the Washington Post as supporting \nhis position?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I read the Washington Post as taking a middle ground, \nnot one which I am totally unsympathetic with. And I also read the \nWashington Post as saying extend but with limits. I disagree to the \nlimits for reasons I stated before.\n  I think it is noteworthy where they say:\n\n       The Senate Democrats would do themselves and the president \n     little good--\n\n  Let me read you the concluding paragraph where they say there should \nbe some extension, it is interesting, and I know my colleague, Senator \nThomas, wants to pose some questions:\n\n       What the Senate does not need is a Democratic-led \n     filibuster. Having already gone bail for the Clinton White \n     House, often to an embarrassing degree--\n\n  I think it is very interesting, because I think, indeed, that is what \nmany of my colleagues have been forced to do, to kind of walk the \nplank.\n       Senate Democrats would do themselves and the president \n     little good by tying up the Senate with a talkathon. Better \n     that they let the probe proceed.\n\n  Then it goes on to say something rather interesting, that it is a \nresponsibility that all of us have, including this Senator and the \nmajority. It said:\n\n       Give the public some credit for knowing a witch hunt and a \n     waste of their money if and when they see one. And that, of \n     course, is the risk Senator D'Amato and his committee are \n     taking. The burden is also on them.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. What about----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me suggest that by simply saying this is politics, \nthis is politics, this is politics, this is politics, it reminds me of \nthe adage that if you repeat it over and over and over and over, you \nwill draw people from what it is we are doing. I think this is a well-\norchestrated attempt by the Democrats, by the minority, to have just \nthat, to have us forget the paper trail, to have us forget the \nwitnesses who deliberately --Senator, I will yield to you when I am \nready to yield to you. Senator, I have not interrupted you once.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, but you are----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I watched you now for quite a period of time. I have not \ninterrupted you. When I yield the floor, then you can ask whatever \nquestions you wish. If I am here, I will attempt to answer them.\n  The fact of the matter is that there has been a persistent pattern of \ndelay, obfuscation and deliberate memory loss. When this matter gets to \nthe floor next week, we will go through it.\n  We will go through, for example, incidents where Mrs. Clinton, the \nFirst Lady, right after the death, or soon after the death of Vincent \nFoster, makes a phone call to Susan Thomases. Susan Thomases comes in \nand testifies to us she does not recall the phone call.\n  By the way, this is on, I believe, July 22. I will have the record in \nfront of me. This is after the death, and they are now going to conduct \nthe investigation as it relates to what papers may or may not be in Mr. \nFoster's office, looking for possibly a suicide note. She would have \nthe committee and the American people believe--I think it is absolutely \nincredible--that at 7:57, a phone call from Little Rock, AR, made by \nthe First Lady to her hotel, that she did not get it. The First Lady \nwas on the phone for 3 minutes. ``Maybe the operator got it.'' At 8:01, \n1 minute after that, she admits to paging Mr. Nussbaum.\n  Let me tell you why she admitted it, because she would have feigned \nrecollection there, too, in my opinion. You see, because Mr. Nussbaum \nhad an assistant, and that assistant indicated Mr. Nussbaum said Susan \nThomases called him, so she could not very well deny that call. But, \nbelieve me, if there was any way for her to do it, she would have done \nit. This is one of the most capable lawyers in America, described as a \nlady who has the ``juice.'' ``She has the juice,'' they said. She walks \ninto the White House whenever she wants. She is a close confidant, a \nfriend, a counselor. Guess what Mr. Nussbaum's assistant, Mr. Neuwirth, \nsays in depositions and testimony? He says--I am paraphrasing, but we \nwill get it on the record with absolute precision because I know my \ncolleague wants that. We will get that absolute precision.\n\n  The First Lady was not happy. The First Lady was not happy with the \nmanner of investigation, that there would be unfettered access into Mr. \nFoster's office. We asked about that call and, of course, remember, we \nhave absolute proof, phone logs--if we did not have the phone logs, \nthey would deny anything and everything. I will give you examples of \nthis. As Senator Domenici has indicated, I am not going to just sit \nhere and have those who would take our work and our good efforts and \nsimply attempt to politicize them for their own purposes. That is my \nobservation. I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing \nthat. We have worked together too long and hard in a spirit of \nbipartisanship. But if they want to throw that out and just do the \nbidding of the \n\n[[Page S1436]]\nWhite House and carry their water, that is their decision. As the \nWashington Post said--and I just quoted that editorial--``to almost an \nembarrassing degree.''\n  Let me tell you, when we asked Mrs. Thomases about this call--she \nsaid she was reaching out. It was a touchy-feely call. When we asked \nabout the other calls she made--and there were 13 or 14 within a hour \nand a half--to Nussbaum, calls to the Chief of Staff office, almost \nfrantic. She was reaching out to touch someone. There is an ad about \nthat. By the way, we have not been able to examine her yet. Only \nbecause we received logs and notes that indicate she had a \ncommunication from Mrs. Clinton's scheduler saying, ``Come down to \nWashington to see us,'' and she did come; the only reason we know she \nwent over to see her is because the White House logs maintained by the \nSecret Service indicate that. Lawyers were meeting--a lawyer--Mr. \nBarnett was meeting with Mrs. Clinton to review various documents, and \ndocuments were indeed turned over to Mr. Barnett on that date. We said, \n``Did you recall meeting Mrs. Clinton?'' She was upstairs for an hour \nand a half. I believe that date was July 27, but I have not looked at \nthe records for a while. ``No.'' ``Did you meet with Mrs. Clinton?'' \n``I do not recall.'' ``Did your scheduler tell you?'' ``I do not \nrecall.''\n  Look, that is absurd. We are not talking about incidental events. We \nare talking about critical times and junctures. We are talking about a \npattern. That is what we see taking place. So we have not been dealt \nwith fairly. We have not had candid testimony from numerous witnesses. \nThe pattern continues. And there are those who say, ``Why are you doing \nthis?'' I say, why are you afraid of getting the facts? The only reason \nI am forced to editorialize, or at least sum up what I see at this \npoint in time, is because of the opposition of the other side to permit \nus to do our work. So that, then, puts me in a very peculiar and \ndifficult position, one that I have resisted in terms of making these \nobservations public and making them with more precision and \npreciseness. But we will do that. We will have no choice but to do \nthat. We will have no choice but to decide, when we do not have all of \nthe facts--and that is why we are making a mistake by pushing this at \nthis point in time, instead of saying, OK, we will permit x numbers of \ndollars, and let us see if we cannot wind this up within a reasonable \nperiod of time after you get access to the necessary witnesses, \nparticularly those who may or may not be called to testify but that the \nspecial prosecutor objects to.\n  I see my friend wants to raise a question. Certainly, if he wants to \nraise that question, I will take it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me say, first of all, that I enter \ninto this debate and discussion from a little different point of view. \nI have not been a member of this committee, and I have not indeed \nfollowed it real closely. But I am very interested in it. I understand \nthere is a purpose for this committee action. The purpose is to \ndiscover what the facts are. So I am a little surprised when they argue \nthat we ought to stop, put a limit on it, when we have not completed \nwhat the purpose of it was, which was to find facts.\n  I must tell you that I did have a little brush with it in the House \nlast year. I was on the Banking Committee. Somebody talked about Mr. \nGonzalez's report. He would not let us do anything last year. We were \nstonewalled. So I was excited when the Senate went forward with an \nopportunity to do something. I know a little about that because I was \nthere. So I say I am surprised, and I am not sure I should be \nsurprised. I know that the minority sort of acted like defense counsel \nhere instead of asking questions.\n  I do have a couple of points. Mr. President, if I might ask, I am \ncurious about the work of the independent counsel and its effect on the \ncommittee's work specifically and if the criminal investigations into \nWhitewater have impeded the congressional efforts to get all the facts \nabout Whitewater.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. As my distinguished colleague may be aware, the Senate \nresolution that empowered us to go forward indicated that we should \ncoordinate our activities with the investigation of the counsel. We \nhave attempted to do that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. What about the October 2, 1995, letter Senator Sarbanes \nmade reference to yesterday? Is it the special committee's intention to \nmove forward without regard to the independent counsel's investigation?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am glad my colleague has raised that point. I think \none has to read the letter in its entirety, not just part of it. It was \nour very real intent to bring forward and to move in an expeditious \nmanner with these hearings, but never without regard to the independent \ncounsel's investigation. Even in that letter of October 2--which does \nnot contain the totality of our discussions either with the independent \ncounsel or with the minority--indicates that we were going to be very \nmindful of the independent counsel's efforts. That letter, if you read \nit in its totality, indicates we are going to be very mindful of not \nimpacting on the special counsel's work adversely.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is my understanding that there are criminal trials \npending. Could the Senator share with us the timetable with respect to \nthese trials?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Again, I appreciate my colleague's inquiry because we \nare now talking--by the way, in our letter, we expressed some concern \nthat this trial would be adjourned much longer than the beginning of \nthe year. They indicated they thought January and possibly early \nFebruary. That is going to be going off next week. We are there at that \npoint.\n  There have been other delays. It just seemed to us that as time went \nalong, as we attempted to bring in Judge Hale, in particular meeting \nwith the difficulties of Judge Hale's lawyer--the distinguished counsel \nhad a number of arguments before the Supreme Court. He told our counsel \nthat he could not even consider bringing his client in because he had \nto prepare him, and he would not be able to prepare and be thoroughly \nbriefed until after he made these arguments. One of those arguments was \npostponed due to the snowstorm we had.\n  I have to tell you that we are making every effort. It was unusual, \nalmost unheard of--the Supreme Court's adjournment of a matter that had \nbeen docketed and set for schedule. But the Court found that the \ncircumstances were so difficult that they granted an adjournment. \nPeople could not make it in, participants in that case. That was put \noff until the end of January or very early February.\n  That is a practical matter that made it impossible for him to prepare \nthe witness, to bring him in. We were just not ever able to get that \nconcurrence. Notwithstanding that, we might have had strong objection \nbecause the independent counsel did indicate he was opposed. We were \nstill willing to attempt to bring him in.\n  Let me say this to you. Once we began to hit February, the end of \nJanuary, February, you then run into a question of responsibility of \nthis body in conjunction with and cooperation with the independent \ncounsel. You really do. We could have insisted that the attorney \nformally raise the fact that his client would assert the privilege \nagainst self-incrimination.\n  There is something more important. Rather than run the risk of \njeopardizing--because we were so close to that trial, so close to the \nproposed trial of March--putting that off or creating an impediment to \nthe special counsel going forward. I think in a responsible way we did \nwhat was absolutely necessary and did not attempt to create a clash or \na crisis with the prerogatives that we had, which we could have \nexercised, but I think would have been injudicious.\n  Mr. THOMAS. As I understand it, the proposal that has been brought \nforth is to conclude the special committee's work in the middle of \nApril and the possibility of examining either Governor Tucker or the \nMcDougals, then, would not be possible, is that correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is absolutely correct. It would be impossible, and \nwe may or may not be able to get them in any event. That would \ncertainly preclude the examination of McDougal and would preclude us \nfrom even considering whether we might want to immunize him, to get his \ntestimony, whether or not the special counsel might agree after that \ntrial to us providing them with immunity, and also other witnesses, \nJudge Hale and about a dozen others who may or may not be testifying. \n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\n  Let me say, it has been indicated that there is going to be public \ntestimony at this trial. The scope of the trial--given that it is a \ncriminal trial, and given the rules of evidence--will not permit the \nkind of latitude that would give a full, detailed story as to what did \nor did not take place. Indeed, there may be testimony that we seek or \nrequire that will never be asked of these witnesses at a public trial.\n  Indeed, all the questions may be answered. We may have no need to \nbring some of them in. We may not have to. But to prejudge it now and \nto say that we are going to cut it off now is wrong. It is wrong. We \nshould not set an arbitrary time limit for it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the chairman, and I certainly want to \ncongratulate you and your committee for continuing to seek to find the \nanswers. That is what this is all about. I certainly hope we continue \nto do that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Could I ask my friend from New York a question?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from New York has led, as \nchairman of the Banking Committee, the extraordinary responsibility of \nthis body relative to the Whitewater investigation. I ask my friend \nfrom New York, as a consequence of what I understand is accurate to \ndate, the investigations have led to nine convictions and seven \nindictments, which is reason to believe that more may still be coming. \nTwo indictments occurred just last week.\n  Now, in conscience, how could the chairman suggest to this body, as a \nconsequence of this factual information, to terminate these hearings or \neven indicate a definitive date at which time these hearings might be \nconcluded? I think that my colleague would agree that the work of the \nWhitewater Committee is clearly not done, the investigation is not \ncomplete. The primary reason for its incompleteness is the inability of \nthe White House to present factual material in a timely manner. It has \nbeen suggested that some of the material provided by the White House \ncomes in like a haystack, but the needles--the information that the \ncommittee really needs--is missing.\n  I ask my friend from New York, how can those that object to the \ncontinuance of this very important process conceivably reflect on the \ncollective responsibility we have as a body? My question to the Senator \nfrom New York is, how do you see your responsibility as chairman of \nthis committee? How do you see the responsibilities have been given to \nyou? And, without all the facts before the committee, how can you reach \na definitive deadline such as April?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BENNETT). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague. The Senator from Alaska \nhas served on the committee and knows and has felt the manner in which \nthe committee in many cases has been almost stifled.\n  I think the point is inexorable. I do not think the Senate could \npossibly discharge its duties by truncating or terminating its work by \nsetting an arbitrary deadline, one that particularly would ensure that \nwe would not have access to a number of witnesses whose testimony may \nbe very key, and as a result of relevant information and facts it leads \nyou to possibly other facts that one must discover, other areas that \none must look at.\n  That is why I think any thoughtful analysis of the committee's work, \nwhere we are today, would lead one to believe, as Senator Mitchell once \nindicated very clearly in his book, ``Men of Zeal,'' do not put an \narbitrary end date for any hearing, even if the intent--and I am \nparaphrasing--is to avoid partisan politics. That was the intent in \nIran-Contra, not running it into the political season. That was my \nintent. That was the intent of the distinguished ranking member.\n  There is no doubt, I hope he would not have questioned, or did not \nquestion, the sincerity of the Senator from moving forward in that \nmanner. That was my intent. That continues to be my intent.\n  I also suggest that it seems to me that I do not know how my \ncolleagues can know for certain what may be revealed or may not be \nrevealed. I do not think they can. I do not think they know the \ndocuments that may or may not have been produced. I do not think that \nthey are aware of what the testimony of various witnesses we would like \nto bring in will be, but certainly it would appear that the White House \nis very intent, and my colleagues are intent, in order to protect \nthem--and I am paraphrasing the New York Times editorial--to protect \nthem from embarrassment.\n  It is better to get the facts out now and let the chips fall where \nthey may than to continue this exercise in this matter. It will not \ndissuade the chairman and the committee from doing its job by simply \ncharging partisan politics. That has not been the case. It will not be \nthe case. I will move as expeditiously as the events and facts permit \nto end the work of this committee, particularly the public hearings, \nbut that will be based on facts, not an arbitrary date.\n  I answer my colleague in saying we should not set an arbitrary date. \nIt is exactly the situation we find ourselves in today. By the way, if \nwe reflect on the words, and I read them half a dozen times today, that \nour friend said--the parallel between what took place then, bureaucrats \nholding back information, looking at a date in which the inquiry would \nterminate, attorneys keeping their clients from coming forward, et \ncetera, and delaying and obfuscating--it is the same pattern that we \nsee repeating itself. It is, I think. I am sorry that I agreed to a \ndate. I did not contemplate that this would take place.\n  Now, you never get credit from the other side in attempting to be \nfair. You just do not. But I will attempt to be fair and to say to \nthem, not all of this has been occasioned by some kind of a diabolical \npolitical plot by my colleagues or the Democrats or the White \nHouse. That would be unfair. Some has been occasioned by attorneys who \nare looking to protect their clients. And, so, they have engaged in a \npattern, it seems to me, of withholding, having them testify in that \nmanner. At least the clients have insisted upon it, or maybe witnesses, \nwho said I cannot recall anything.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me commend the Senator for accepting the \nresponsibility of responding to such a wealth of questions. I know that \nit is your desire and sense of real obligation to get to the bottom of \nthis investigation so we are all satisfied that the investigation was \ndone fairly, appropriately, and in depth. But I wonder if my friend \nfrom New York recalls a comment of one of our colleagues during the \nIran-Contra debate? Our good friend, Senator Byrd, said:\n\n       The Congress has a Constitutional responsibility of \n     oversight, a Constitutional responsibility of informing the \n     people. . . [T]o reassure the faith of the American people in \n     the Constitutional and political system, is to find out about \n     all of these things that we have been hearing, and the way to \n     do it is to go at it, put our hand to the plow, and develop \n     the facts.\n\n  Now, I think that sets a pretty good direction for the committee. I \nthink we all know that the constitutional process is going to take \ntime. It is going to take expense. Also, I think that it is important \nfor my friend to consider the recommendation of certain editorials--so \nI ask if my friend from New York would comment on two editorials. I \nwill quote a portion from the Washington Post, February 15, 1996:\n\n       Hardly a day goes by without someone in the administration \n     suddenly discovering some long-sought subpoenaed documents. . \n     . The committee clearly needs time to sift those late-\n     arriving papers.\n\n  And, in the New York Times, February 28, 1996:\n\n       The Senate's duty cannot be canceled or truncated because \n     of the campaign calendar. Any certain date for terminating \n     the hearings would encourage even more delay in producing \n     subpoenaed documents than the committee has endured since it \n     started last July. . . .\n       No arguments about the politics on either side can outweigh \n     the fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full \n     facts about the land venture. . . . Clinton's work as a \n     lawyer on Whitewater matters and the mysterious movements of \n     documents between the Rose Law Firm, various basements and \n     closets and the Executive Mansion. The committee, politics \n     notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite [an indefinite] \n     extension. A Democratic filibuster against it would be silly \n     stonewalling.\n\n  I ask my friend from New York, recognizing the statement of the \nformer majority leader and our good friend, Senator Byrd, regarding his \nstatement of the Iran-Contra dispute, is not the \n\n[[Page S1438]]\nsame constitutional application and principle appropriate in this case? \nShould not that same constitutional application be used as we search \nfor the facts and attempt to reach a final conclusion so that the \nAmerican people as well as the Congress can be satisfied in this \nmatter?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator from Alaska is absolutely correct. He is \nabsolutely correct. I think our colleague, Senator Faircloth, has \nindicated there should be no price placed upon the integrity of the \nWhite House.\n  The fact is, the cost for the hearings, and given the work, the \nwitnesses, the volume of work, sifting through the haystack to attempt \nto get the needles--it has been difficult. The lack of cooperation of \nvarious witnesses; the lack of cooperation with various agencies; the \nlack of cooperation and candor with many, many officials; total failure \nto recollect events, even though the diaries put them at various places \ndoing various things; even the transmittal of documents when occasioned \nby distress calls.\n  I have to tell my colleague that the committee's work must continue \nand that we have limited it, both initially and now, to very modest \nsums. Although $600,000 is a lot of money, if we look at the Iran-\nContra investigations and hearings--and again those were almost 10 \nyears ago--that cost was $3,300,000. I think it was $3,298,000 at that \npoint in time. If we were to get this appropriation, and I believe we \nwill, we would still have spent less than $2 million.\n  I am not suggesting that is not a considerable sum. But I am \nsuggesting that the work that we have done, the charge and the \nresponsibility, is important. And in the words of Senator Byrd, it \nshould be continued. It is our ``constitutional responsibility.'' \nCertainly it was true then and it is true now. Certainly Congress met \nits responsibility in fully funding the Iran-Contra hearings.\n  Again, if we look at the words of two of the Members who served on \nthat committee, they said they made a mistake by setting an arbitrary \ndate for concluding the hearing. I think it is disingenuous for people \nto say--by the way, I understand it comes out of the White House spin \ndoctors--that $30 million has been spent. And we have heard it here \ntoday. ``Do you know how much food that could buy? Do you know how many \npeople that could help?''\n  This committee has not spent $30 million. The work of the independent \ncounsel was decided upon by none other than the President of the United \nStates and the Attorney General. They requested that the independent \ncounsel undertake his work and there have been 11 or 12 convictions or \npleas of guilty. And he does continue his work. He has one capacity. \nThat is to ascertain criminal wrongdoing and to prosecute it where it \nis found. We have another. To simply lump it in and then say to the \nAmerican people, ``This is politics, and they are spending all this \nmoney in search of we know not what it is,'' I simply have to say that \nis not correct. And it is not factual. And it is not dealing with our \ncolleagues in a fair and even-handed manner, in the same manner in \nwhich they would like to be dealt with.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask my friend from New York a question, since \npartisanship has been brought up here more than once or twice in the \ndiscussion? Would my friend from New York care to enlighten the Senator \nfrom Alaska on what is the objective of our friends on the other side \nof the aisle? Why do you believe that the other side of the aisle is \ndelaying the majority from bringing this matter before the Senate for a \nvote? Wouldn't you agree that we are all here collectively to meet our \nobligation of finding the facts and presenting them to the American \npublic? What could be more political than for one party to ban together \nin an attempt to delay a vote? I am sure that is of some frustration to \nmy friend from New York. Would he convey, in the graciousness of the \ncordiality that we are all bound by, why this body is being prevented \nfrom bringing this resolution to the floor?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I have to say to my colleague and friend from Alaska, \npolitely, I can not understand what my Democratic colleagues hope to \naccomplish by extended, protracted debate--which is a filibuster. That \nis a nice way of talking about filibustering this. It will only conjure \nin the minds of people the question: What are you hiding and why are \nyou doing this?\n  I think the Washington Post, although it did not say, today, that we \nshould go on endlessly--nor do I believe we should--they said, today, \nthat ``The Senate Democrats have already gone bail.'' That is pretty \ntough language. Listen to this.\n  ``What the Senate does not need is a Democratic led filibuster, \nhaving already gone bail for the Clinton White House, often to an \nembarrassing degree.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on this editorial?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Because the Senator continues citing it, yet the \neditorial very clearly states the Senate should require the committee \nto complete its work and produce a final report by a fixed date. That \nis the essential difference between the two sides.\n  You want an indefinite hearing, and we have suggested that there be a \nfixed date, just like I say to the Senator from Alaska there was in \nIran-Contra, which is exactly the position that Senator Dole took at \nthat time and which was acceded to by the Democratic Congress. This \neditorial is consistently being cited by my colleague from New York, \nand yet the editorial says, in very clear terms, the Senate should \nrequire the committee to complete its work and produce a final report \nby a fixed date, a matter with which the Senator, as I understand it, \ndisagrees.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I indicated heretofore that I would not--and I again \ncited none other than an authority on this than Senator Mitchell as to \nwhy a fixed date I believe would be counterproductive. Having said \nthat, certainly April 3 is absolutely unacceptable, or April 5--is \nguaranteed to deny us essential information and evidence that we would \nneed. There is no way that trial will be concluded.\n  Let me say something else. I would be willing to say that at some \nreasonable period of time after the conclusion of the trial, whether it \nresults in whatever--an acquittal, a conviction, or a hung jury--that \nwe then, because there are practicalities, an attempt to end this, \nwhether it is 8 weeks thereafter, that we would, and then a time for \nthe writing of a report. But even that is dangerous because then we run \ninto the problem of having certain attorneys looking to take advantage \nof every opportunity to run the clock.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask my friend from New York, is it not a fact that \non February 17 the committee received notes of important substance from \nMr. Gearan? And, isn't it true that on February 13, the committee \nreceived Michael Waldman's notes, which totaled over 200 of \ninformation? In addition, isn't it true that the committee received \nHarold Ickes' documents, which totaled over one hundred pages? That was \njust 8 days ago.\n  How could the committee possibly evaluate that information? How could \nthe committee possibly be expected to set a definitive date of when \nthis investigation will be completed when we received subpoenaed \ninformation only 8 days ago? Do you not believe that this task is \nvirtually impossible knowing that we have every reason to believe there \nis other material going to come in?\n  I ask my friend from New York if he would feel that he is acting \nresponsibly if he sets a definitive date of when the investigation \nwould end, knowing that 8 days ago the committee just got several \nhundred more pages of information? How long does it take the \nprofessional staff to go through that information, and how long does it \ntake the staff of the minority side of committee to examine that \ninformation?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It would be impossible to give a date exactly, because \nthe Senator is right: We have to go through the information and bring \nin people. It may develop--and does in many cases--additional leads and \nadditional people.\n  I have to tell you. I do not believe that we have received nearly all \nof the pertinent information that we have requested, or subpoenaed, or \nthat has been subpoenaed by the special counsel. I just do not believe \nthat to be the case. I think it is impossible to believe that other \nmembers of that White House defense team, that strategy team that met \nduring the early week of \n\n[[Page S1439]]\nJanuary--they met under extraordinary circumstances, they met \nrepeatedly, they met every day for a 1-week period of time, and \nthereafter--that there is not more information that was available that \nhas not been turned over to this committee.\n  If we set a time, I have to tell you something, I do not think we \nwill ever get it. If we do not wait to see what takes place in terms of \nthat trial and what witnesses we may or may not have, we are never \ngoing to get all the facts. I never knew that a committee ran just \nsimply on the basis of a time line. I thought that our obligation was \nto get the facts. I thought that was what determined. And if we were \ndoing a credible job, if we were getting the facts, that we would \ncontinue until the picture was completed, until the job was completed, \nif it took additional resources. That is why we are here. We are here \nfor those resources.\n  Let me say that we did not say ``give us such funds as may be \nnecessary.'' So you see when we say there is not a definitive date, \nthat is true. But we have asked to limit it to an amount of money. That \namount of money will only enable us to go approximately 3, maybe 4 \nmonths if there is no real activity, and if we have to suspend during a \nperiod of time, maybe somewhat longer. Indeed, if there is no \njustification--and I suggest it has been the action of the White House \nand their people in terms of holding back documents, that has brought \nus to this point where we suspect, and I think we have reason to \nsuspect, that they are still withholding key documents and information \nfrom the Senate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Along those lines, I would ask my colleague from New \nYork if he can explain to me why throughout the testimony of Susan \nThomases and Maggie Williams there seemed to be significant memory \nlosses. I am particularly thinking of Maggie Williams, the chief of \nstaff of the First Lady--she responded some 140 times, ``I do not \nremember.'' These are people that were in positions of responsibility, \nand, obviously, very intelligent people. These were significant events \nin their lives. And to suggest that Maggie Williams had no recollection \n140 times is troubling to this Senator. Also troubling is the fact that \nSusan Thomases, the First Lady's friend and adviser, told the committee \n``I do not remember'' over 70 times.\n  My friend from New York is a lawyer who has practiced and who knows \nsomething about the procedures in the court. What kind of an \nexplanation can you provide for Maggie Williams responding 140 times \n``I do not remember'' to questions from the committee? And what kind of \nexplanation can you provide for Susan Thomases telling the committee \nthat she ``didn't remember'' over 70 times? I find that very \ndiscomforting because, obviously, it suggests that there are questions \nthat witnesses are refusing to answer. I know the chairman sat through \nevery single witness and was troubled by this as well.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is absolutely correct. Of course, you see \nthat you could ask. If you were to say, ``Where were you, Senator, on \nlast week on Tuesday,'' I could not tell you now. I would have to look. \nBut when you have key events, monumental, the death of a trusted \nfriend, someone you have known for a long time, someone who you have \nworked with, and you get some of the testimony surrounding that event, \nsurrounding the search for something that was important, the possible \nsuicide note, to have the kind of statements ``I do not recall.'' ``I \ndo not know.''\n  ``Who did you speak to?\"\n  ``I do not know.''\n  ``Did you speak to anybody?\"\n  ``I do not know. I do not remember. It would have been any\" --it is \njust inconceivable. It smells of a well-orchestrated plot to deny the \ncommittee the facts and the information. And it is not just once; it is \nrepeated.\n  Then when we find--and, again, very troubling--documents that relate \nto the work of the First Lady, documents that relate to her \nrepresentation, or at least the fact that there were numerous phone \ncalls to Seth Ward, Seth Ward, a man who purchased the property known \nas Casa Grande, Seth Ward, Webb Hubbell's father-in-law, Associate \nAttorney General, his son-in-law is in that law firm. It is interesting \nthe son-in-law did not represent or make the phone calls with respect \nto his father-in-law who he was close to, a transaction that can be \ndescribed as nothing less than a sham, that attempted to provide Seth \nWard, in the final analysis, with over $335,000, and finally had to \nagree to give back to the RTC. One has to say, was it that \nrepresentation, or those phone calls which we were never aware of until \nwe found the billing records? And where were the billing records of \nphone calls between Mrs. Clinton and Seth Ward? In the personal \nresidence of the President and the First Lady, in their personal \nresidence. How about that? Are we to believe some construction worker \npicked them up someplace? Where did they pick them up, and where did \nthey get to where they got, the President's personal residence, in \nAugust, just when the RTC was again releasing a report dealing with \nthese events?\n  So it is very troubling. It is very troubling and it raises \nquestions. Maggie Williams, you see, was seen, at least by the \ntestimony of Officer O'Neill, a career Secret Service officer, who \nwould have no reason to concoct a story, says that on the night of \nVincent Foster's death he saw Maggie Williams coming out of Vincent \nFoster's office--and she admits she was there--and that she was \ncarrying papers, files. And he remembers with great detail, that when \nshe, Maggie Williams, who is Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, attempted \nto gain access to her office, she could not do it; she had to balance \nthe files with one hand and then with the other hand open her door.\n  You see, this is an experience I think probably many of us have had \nwhen you are carrying something and then you have to shift it. And he \nsaid she propped it up against the wall or a cabinet so that she could \nthen use her other hand to open the door. That was a specificity that \nmade it hard for this Senator to not totally believe Officer O'Neill.\n  Let me tell you, the saga continues, the saga of the memory lapses, \nbecause Maggie Williams denies that this occurred.\n  But then there is another White House staffer, a young man who works \nthere as an assistant by the name of Tom Castleton. He still works \nthere. This is not someone who is in discord with the administration. \nThis is not a partisan--if anything, he may be a partisan supporter of \nthe White House. And there is nothing wrong with that. But he has no \nreason to lie.\n  What does he testify? He testifies that when Maggie Williams is \ncarrying a box of documents up to the personal residence of the White \nHouse, she says, ``Mrs. Clinton wants to review these papers.'' When we \nasked Maggie Williams, she didn't say that; she has no memory of that. \nWhy would she say that? She would never tell this young man that for no \nreason. After all, of course, he told us the truth. He had no reason to \nmake this up.\n  Let me ask something else. It has always mystified me why it is \npeople have to invent incredible stories. Would it not be ordinary, if \npapers that belonged to you, that were with a trusted friend and a \nlegal advisor, that you would look them over as opposed to simply \nhaving them turned over to another attorney without looking?\n  I find that very difficult, very difficult to understand. It would \nseem to me that if the Senator had important papers entrusted to his \nlegal advisor and counselor and something has suddenly gone wrong and \nthose papers were packaged and sent to your residence so you could then \nsend them over to your personal lawyer, would you not look through \nthem? Would it not be natural? Would it not be correct? Would it not be \nright? But you see what happens when people invent stories; they are \nstuck to them. They are stuck to them. Once the White House issued the \nstatement, a definitive statement, that the First Lady had, never \nlooked at those papers, they could never explain how the papers that \nwere sent up there found their way back down, and then, if all of those \npapers were sent over to Mr. Kendall, the lawyer for the Clintons, if \nall of them were sent over, then how could it be that the billing \nrecords were found in the personal residence, if you had already said \nfor the public record, public consumption, that you never looked at the \nrecords?\n  So now we have the mystery of the appearing documents. Where are they \nfound? In the personal residence, where all the papers had been brought \ninitially, all of them, and, I would suggest \n\n[[Page S1440]]\nto you, probably including the billing records. And that, indeed, when \nwe have heard this troubling story--because I tell you it would be \nabsolutely totally reasonable for anybody, President or anyone--to look \nthrough their personal files and their personal records. I think that \nit would be unusual, unusual, absolutely unusual--after all, they had \nnothing to fear. There was no wrongdoing. Why would you not look \nthrough the papers to ascertain if these were papers, indeed, that \nshould be then sent over to a new lawyer. Would you not want to look at \nthem?\n  So the answers that are forthcoming do not in many cases lead to a \nconclusion. They raise other questions. But let me say our mandate is \nto get the facts. It is not to rush to judgment. It is only because--\nand I have only shared this for the first time--of some of the \nquestions that I consider important, some of the troubling aspects, \nthat I raise this. I have not raised this heretofore. I have not shared \nthis with the media. I have not rushed to judgment, nor do I. But I \nraise this question--and there are others--in light of testimony given \nby witnesses who have nothing to gain, who, if anything, are supporters \nof the administration. Neuwirth, assistant counsel to the chief counsel \nof the United States, he says they are concerned about unfettered \naccess, that Mrs. Clinton was concerned. This young man, Tom Castleton, \nwho says Maggie Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, says that Mrs. \nClinton wants to review these documents. Then the White House states \nthat they did not look at these documents. Then the billing records \nappearing. How did they get there?\n  So there is more work to be done. I do this--and I was not happy \nabout having to raise these questions at this point in time--only \nbecause, again, the assertions have been made that our investigation \nhas not revealed anything, that this is a waste of time and a waste of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Let me conclude by saying I believe that the committee has been \npatient, in some cases overly so; that the committee has gone out of \nits way to give the benefit of the doubt, as we should and will \ncontinue to do, to witnesses and in certain instances when evidence has \nnot come forth when it should. We will say, let us conclude our job, \nget the facts, and that is when we will end the investigation, sooner \nrather than later.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, unlike my colleague, I will be brief. I will be to the \npoint as nearly as I can. I have been standing now for 1 hour and 20 \nminutes on the floor of the Senate to try to get a word in edgewise, \nand I recognize that when someone has the floor, they can literally \nkeep it forever. I was prompted to come here by some remarks that I \nheard by my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, a \ncouple of hours ago when I happened to hear him say that the only way \nto resolve the problem before us is for the majority leader and the \nminority leader to sit down in one office or the other and come up with \nsome kind of an agreeable compromise.\n  I thought, as usual, that was a very constructive suggestion from my \nfriend and colleague from New Mexico, with whom I have worked on the \nBudget Committee each and every year, this being the 18th, since I have \nbeen here.\n  It makes an awful lot more sense than the long, drag-out \nconfrontation that we seem to be headed for and are involved in now \nwith regard to what is right and what is wrong with the request made by \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee for the continuation of the \nhearings as long as he wants to pursue them in whatever manner the \nchairman of the committee wishes to pursue them.\n  I notice with great interest there were several references during the \nlast hour and 20 minutes, when I was listening very carefully, that the \nname of Robert Byrd was used. We all respect Robert Byrd as one of the \ngreat Members of the U.S. Senate of today and certainly, in my opinion, \nof all time. It has been said on the floor that Senator Byrd felt that \nthe Iran-Contra hearings should proceed because we have ``a \nconstitutional responsibility.'' I do not think there is any quarrel \nwith that. I suspect that Senator Byrd voted for the Whitewater \ninvestigation, as did this Senator, because I think it is our \nconstitutional responsibility to investigate wrongdoing.\n  In that regard, I might say that one of the side elements of this \ninvestigation and other investigations that we see more and more and \nmore going on forever and forever and forever in the Senate of the \nUnited States, has caused a great deal of harm and a great deal of \nexpense to many people whom most would agree are totally innocent. That \nhas happened. The committee is chaired by my colleague from New York. \nIt happened in previous committees.\n  If you read the newspapers and talk to some of the people that have \nappeared before the Banking Committee, you will find that when they \ncome there, they have to bring a lawyer to protect themselves. The \namount of lawyers' fees that these people have, mostly without means, \nto defend themselves when they are called by a committee of the U.S. \nSenate, they have spent anywhere from $50,000 in the last few months, \nsometimes up to $500,000 in the last few months, out of their own \npockets to defend themselves, when in most instances most would agree \nmost of them, if not all --and I say most of them, and maybe all, with \nthe understanding that there was always a reason to investigate \nWhitewater. The dialog that we have heard, the dog and pony show for \nthe last hour and 20 minutes, was merely to fulfill the wishes of those \nwho wish to continue.\n  Senator Byrd said it is our constitutional responsibility. And it is. \nAnd we have investigated. Senator Domenici suggests that the two \nleaders should get together and work out some kind of a compromise, if \nyou will. That is the only way we get things done down here, after we \nraise all kinds of havoc. I endorse the suggestion made by Senator \nDomenici.\n  My colleague from Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Banking \nCommittee, knows where this Senator has been coming from on this issue \nfor a long, long time. I think that we have granted the Banking \nCommittee--I voted to give the Banking Committee the time and the money \nto make an investigation. I am willing to give them some additional \ntime, if that is what they need.\n  But if anyone thinks that this Senator is going to give an open-ended \nlicense to the present chairman of the Banking Committee, or anyone \nelse, to go on and on and on and on, on something that, in my view, \nshould have been concluded weeks ago, they are badly mistaken.\n  We do this to ourselves here, Democrats and Republicans, over and \nover again. We wonder why the polls show that the people despise--I \nthink the word ``despise'' is not overstated--they despise, as a group, \nthe Members of the House of Representatives and the Members of the U.S. \nSenate. Even used car salesmen, I believe, rate ahead of us in the \npolls. Why is that? Because we bring it on ourselves, Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is not just one side of the aisle or the other. It is \nthe conspiratorial nature of the business, unfortunately.\n  Mr. President, I had been the Governor of my State for 8-years, \nlonger than any other person in the history of that State, and this is \nmy 18th year in the U.S. Senate. I have never been sued, either before \nI was in public service or since I have been in public service. I never \nhave been accused of any wrongdoing. I have never had to pay out a \ndollar, let alone $50,000 or $500,000 or more, to defend myself. I have \nhad the wonderful experience of serving 18 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have been in hundreds of thousands of hours of committee hearings \non the national security interests of the United States, the Armed \nServices Committee, in the Budget Committee, that is very much up front \nnow. I happen to be the ranking member of the Budget Committee at the \npresent time. I also serve, and have since I came here, also, in \naddition to those two committees, as a member of the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee.\n  I am proud to say that never, as long as I have served or called \nwitnesses or been a part of questioning witnesses, have I ever cost \neven one of those witnesses any money out of their own pocket to come \nbefore me as the sacred \n\n[[Page S1441]]\none on the elevated platform directing questions down at them.\n  It so happens that I have not, nor have I ever, sought to serve on \nthe Ethics Committee of the U.S. Senate. I do not like judging other \npeople. I have never sought to serve on that committee or any other \ninvestigative committee that is going after people, to get people. Some \nof that is necessary. I believe that Bob Byrd is right in saying we \nhave a constitutional responsibility to do that. But in so doing--and \nit has been going on and on every day, almost of every week of every \nmonth, and certainly of every year since I have served in this body--\nsome people, a group of people, have set up themselves as judge and \njury. They use the taxpayers' money of the United States of America to \nmake accusations, to carry on investigations, some of them legitimate. \nBut we wonder why the people of the United States distrust us.\n  I saw a bumper sticker on a car in Nebraska the other day that said, \n``I love my country, but I don't trust my Government.'' Well, is it any \nwonder what we do to ourselves? We have become the conspirators, \nwhether we recognize or realize it or not. And the feeling of the \npeople of the United States with regard to their elected public \nofficials, most of whom I can certify are honest, God-fearing people \ntrying to do the right thing, whether they have Democrat or Republican \nbehind their names, we wonder why we are not more respected. Because of \nwhat you see on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight.\n  I am not conspiratorial by nature, and I do not like what is going \non. In addition to the committee of jurisdiction that seems to be on \nthe tube every time I turn on C--SPAN, and I see mean-looking lawyers \npeering down, as if they were judges, at these people behind them, kind \nof like the Christians in the lion's den in Rome--I see that, and I do \nnot like that either because I think you can make inquiry of people as \na U.S. Senator in a fashion that does not say, ``It is us against \nthem.'' That is what is going on here.\n  The costs of this, as I understand it, are over $1 million for the \ncommittee and up to $15 million or more for the special prosecutor.\n  The special prosecutor has a job to do, and I voted the money to have \nthe special prosecutor check into Whitewater. I guess what I am saying, \nMr. President, is that somewhere sometime enough is enough.\n  Some--not this Senator--some have said that the chairman of the \nBanking Committee is doing this primarily because he is the chairman of \nthe Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is designed to \ncollect money and make a lot of hoopla to try and elect Republicans. \nWell, that is the job of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, \nand we have a Member on this side who does the same thing.\n  But some have said--not this Senator--some have said one of the main \nreasons that the chairman of the Banking Committee, who is \nsimultaneously chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, is doing this and wants more taxpayer money to continue the \ninvestigation forever and forever and forever, as near as I can tell, \nis he wants to continue it at least until after the November elections, \nbecause some have said--not this Senator--that the chairman of the \nBanking Committee wants to do this for political reasons. He thinks it \nwill help elect Republicans.\n  Now remember, I did not say that, but I guess other people have. \nWhether that is true or not, I voted for the money for the special \nprosecutor to investigate Whitewater. I voted in support of and \nprovided a vote to provide the money to the Banking Committee to do \ntheir investigation. I had assumed that it would not take longer than \nit took to investigate other matters, such as Iran-Contra, but it has \nfor whatever reason. Now the chairman of the Banking Committee wishes \nto go on and on and on.\n  I simply say that I do not believe this committee going on and on and \non, spending more of the taxpayers' money is going to amount to any \nmore than it has already. The special prosecutor is continuing, the \nspecial prosecutor is the place to bring charges if anyone before the \nBanking Committee has committed perjury, as was indicated by the dog-\nand-pony show tonight. If they committed perjury, they should be \nprosecuted, and if they are found guilty, they should stand whatever \nthe sentence in court should be.\n  I simply say that I think it is far past time for this committee to \nhave made its report, but in the good nature that I think has always \nembodied me, I suggested to the ranking Democrat, the Senator from \nMaryland, who is on the floor, what, 2 months ago, 3 months ago--I do \nnot know what it was--when the chairman of the Banking Committee was \nbeginning to talk about the necessity to extend this date beyond the \nexpiration date of yesterday and wanted $200,000 or $300,000 more of \ntaxpayers' money to get the job done, I said, ``I'm not for that at \nall. I think they should be called upon to wind up their inquiry and \nmake their report to the U.S. Senate.''\n  But I said in the spirit of compromise, since the chairman of the \nBanking Committee says he wants more time and he needs more time, I \nwould, against my better judgment say, ``All right, let's give them \nanother 30 days, until the 28th of March, and $90,000,'' or whatever it \ntakes to wind this up and then set a date for the report no later than \n30 days after that, so that we can get on with this matter. I remember \nvery well the ranking Democrat at that time thanking me for that \nsuggestion.\n  We have now come to the place, while I can assure the Senate that the \nvast majority of the Democrats in this body--and there are 47 of us--\nthe vast majority of them are against any extension period beyond the \nexpiration date of the committee of yesterday.\n  But it has been talked over and it was agreed, in an effort to come \nto some kind of a compromise, that we do not want to filibuster, we do \nnot think a filibuster is necessary.\n  Following up on what Senator Domenici suggested on the floor of the \nSenate, why do we not have the majority leader, Senator Dole, and the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, get together tomorrow and make a \ndecision, a reasonable decision, along the lines that Senator Dole \nsuggested back under the Iran-Contra affair?\n  At that time, the Democrats were the conspirators. They were the ones \nwho wanted to continue this discussion. Senator Dole suggested that we \nshould not go on with Iran-Contra forever. It was causing problems for \nthe President of the United States who, at that time, was a Republican. \nBelieve it or not, Mr. President, the Democratic majority at that time \nsaid, ``Senator Dole, you're right. You're making sense. You're trying \nto be reasonable, Senator Dole.''\n  What we are asking for at the present time, and taking up on the \npublic expression and request by my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, it is time for the two leaders to get together. It is time to \nend the dog-and-pony show. It is time to come to a definite timeframe--\n30 days, x amount of money, whatever is necessary--to wind up this \ninvestigation, and then anything further that is done beyond that, as \nit should be, would be accomplished by the special prosecutor.\n  If we end the investigation by the Banking Committee tonight, the \nspecial prosecutor is still there with full subpoena powers and the \nauthority of a prosecutor to bring charges for anything that he thinks \nneeds to be raised in the courts.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that I hope we will take the wise \ncounsel offered by the Senator from New Mexico, my friend, Senator \nDomenici, and resolve this matter tomorrow and get on with the business \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1429-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1441-S1442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXTENDING WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday we returned for the last \nsession of the 104th Congress to complete the Nation's business. We \nreturned so that we could attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement on \nwelfare reform. We returned to continue debating the future of \nMedicare. We returned so we could end the budget impasse. We returned \nso that we could face the legislative challenges before us and not let \nthe American people down.\n  I'm sad to say, we are not doing these important things. We are not \nserving the American people by working on the things that affect their \nday to day lives. Instead, we are debating whether \n\n[[Page S1442]]\nto extend the Senate Committee's investigation into Whitewater \nindefinitely and if an additional $600,000 for the investigation should \nbe provided.\n  I oppose this attempt to extend the hearings indefinitely. The Senate \nhas already spent $950,000 on 277 days of Whitewater investigation, \nheard from more than 100 witnesses, and collected more than 45,000 \npages of documents. Enough is enough.\n  Let me tell you what I support. I support Senator Daschle's proposal \nto complete the task at hand by extending the hearing until April 3, \n1996, with a final report due on May 10, 1996. I also support letting \nthe Independent Counsel do his work. Three federal judges have given \nhim the job of investigating Whitewater and all related matters. He has \nmore than 130 staff members helping him. There is no time limit or \nspending cap on his investigation, so he will be able to gather facts \nin a systematic and unencumbered way and to investigate Whitewater \nthoroughly. The results of his investigation will be made public. If \nthe Independent Counsel finds wrongdoing, he has the authority to bring \nany lawbreakers to justice. By permitting him to do what none of us can \ndo and what none of us should be doing, we will get a complete \nrendering of the facts. That's the right thing to do. That's what I \nsupport.\n  What I don't support is using Senate committees to play Presidential \npolitics. The goal of this proposed extension is very clear. It's about \nPresidential politics. And, it's about vilifying Mrs. Clinton in the \nname of Presidential politics. This attack on her is unprecedented. She \nhas voluntarily answered questions on four occasions from the Grand \njury and on three occasions in interviews for the Grand jury, numerous \nwritten questions, and she has been cooperative with the committee. I \nknow her personally. Like many others across the Nation, I have deep \nadmiration and respect for her.\n  Like so many other American women she has struggled to meet the \ndemands of both a career and a family. She is dedicated to her family \nand she is a dedicated advocate for children. For more than 25 years \nshe worked on behalf of children and families which she discusses in \nher book ``It Takes a Village''. In ``Village'', Mrs. Clinton shares \nwith the public her passion, conviction, and insight, gleaned from her \nexperience as a mother, daughter, advocate, attorney, and First Lady.\n  Mrs. Clinton has truly inspired a generation of men, women and \nchildren. She has worked to raise her own family and she has worked to \nprotect a generation of children. So I don't support extending the \nSenate committee's investigation into Whitewater.\n  We should not ask taxpayers to continue subsidizing this round of \nPresidential politics and this attack on Mrs. Clinton. Instead, I say, \nlet's get on with the business of this country and its citizens. The \nSenate committee should finish its investigation immediately, write its \nreport, and let the American people hear what the committee has to say. \nI believe the Senate should get back to the job we were elected to do. \nGet back to meeting the day to day needs of the American people. The \nAmerican public deserves our full attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1441-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1442-S1446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WHITEWATER\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I listened with great interest while my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from New York, and his colleagues \nwent on for some length, and I do not intend to match that length at \nthis hour. I do not think that is really necessary, but there are some \nmatters that I think ought to be reviewed with respect to this \nWhitewater matter.\n  First, a great deal is being made about these documents that appear, \nas though it is a nefarious plot. I understand that people like to \nattach sinister intentions, but the explanation for it may be far more \ninnocent than that. And I really want to include in the Record an \narticle that appeared a few weeks ago in the New York Times by Sidney \nHerman, a former partner of Kenneth Starr. Let me quote from it:\n\n       Documents that are relevant to an investigation are found \n     in an unexpected place 6 months after they were first sought. \n     A shocking development? Absolutely not. In most major pieces \n     of litigation, files turn up late. One side or the other \n     always thinks of making something of the late appearance. But \n     these lawyers know the truth. It could just as easily happen \n     to them. Despite diligent searches, important papers in large \n     organizations are always turning up after the initial and \n     follow-up searches.\n\n  Later on he goes on to say:\n\n       My former partner, Kenneth Starr, knows all this. As \n     independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, he will \n     take it into account. But the American people have no reason \n     to know that this is a normal occurrence. It is not part of \n     their every-day experience. Reporters really do not have any \n     reason to know this either, or they may know and simply \n     choose to ignore it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. I place it in the Record simply to make the point, as \nthe article does, that the appearance of documents a considerable \nperiod of time after they have been requested is, in fact, not a \nshocking development. This goes on all the time, as anyone involved in \nlitigation or document requests well knows.\n  In each instance, of course, one has to judge the explanation for the \nlate-appearing documents with respect to their plausibility, but as I \nindicated when we were discussing Mr. Gearan earlier, his explanation, \nI thought, was very straightforward. He said by mistake these had been \npacked into a box he took with him to the Peace Corps. He thought they \nhad remained at the White House where the White House counsel could go \nthrough them and provide responsive matters to the committee. It was \nonly by chance that these documents, then, were later discovered in \nthat box that had been sent over to the Peace Corps and then were put \nback into the loop so that they eventually came to the committee.\n  A great to-do is made of the fact that if you have a fixed date for \nending, you will not get the documents, and that to-do is made over \ndocuments that we have gotten. I find it incredible--in other words, \nthese documents are furnished to us and then an argument is made if you \nhave a fixed date--as we did, the date of February 29--you will not get \nthe documents. I do not know how you square the two. We get the \ndocuments. They are provided to us. Then the assertion is made if you \nhave a fixed date you will not get the documents. We have a fixed date. \nWe got the documents. The people provided them to us in response to the \nrequest. I do not understand that argument. Obviously, logically, it \ndoes not hold together.\n  Now, the issue here is essentially the difference between the request \nof my colleague from New York, Chairman D'Amato, for an open-ended \nextension of this inquiry, and the proposal put forth by Senator \nDaschle for an extension until April 3 for hearings and until May 10 to \nfile the report.\n  When this resolution was first passed, it was passed on the premise \nthat there would be an ending date, February 29, and the rationale \nadvanced in part for that ending date was to keep this matter out of \nthe Presidential election year and therefore avoid the politicizing of \nthese hearings and the erosion of any public confidence in the hearings \nbecause of a perception that they were being conducted for political \nreasons.\n  I listened with some amazement earlier as the Washington Post \neditorial was cited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in \nsupport of their position for an unlimited extension. Now, that is the \nposition, and I recognize it, of the New York Times. I recognize that \nthe New York Times' posture is for an indefinite extension; but the \nWashington Post, which was also cited in support, said today, very \nclearly, ``The Senate should require the committee to complete its \nwork, produce a final report by a fixed date.''\n  Now, they question the dates that we put forward as perhaps being too \nshort a period. They said a limited extension makes sense but an \nunreasonably short deadline does not. They said 5 weeks may not be \nenough time. They suggested maybe there should be a little extra time, \nrunning in the range of through April or early May. In other words, a \nfew more weeks beyond what the leader has proposed in the alternative, \nwhich my distinguished friend from Nebraska has suggested was a \npossible way of approaching this matter. \n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\n  In any event, so that readers of the Record can judge for themselves, \nI ask unanimous consent that this Washington Post editorial entitled \n``Extend But With Limits,'' and which contains as I said the sentence, \n``The Senate should require the committee to complete its work and \nproduce a final report by a fixed date,'' which editorial has been used \nby some in support of an indefinite extension--for the life of me I \ncannot understand how one can do that, can make that argument. I ask \nunanimous consent that editorial be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to point out with respect to both \nthe Gearan and Ickes notes, because the point was raised that we have \nthese notes and we got them late in the day. The fact is the committee \nheld a full day of hearing with Mr. Gearan and a full day of hearing \nwith Mr. Ickes with respect to their notes. There was an opportunity to \nexamine their notes, see the contents of their notes, bring them in \nbefore the committee, and have a hearing with respect to them.\n  The White House has, in effect, now responded to every request of the \ncommittee. We have some e-mails to be obtained, but that is almost \ncompleted. I outlined earlier the difficult problems that were \nassociated with the e-mails. First of all, the extraordinary and \nonerous breadth of the committee's request and the fact that the Bush \nadministration had put in a procedure, a process at the White House \nthat made the recovery of those e-mails extremely difficult. The White \nHouse finally had to bring in a consultant, and they are expending \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in order to provide those e-mails. The \nones that have been provided thus far, the weeks covered, have not \nproduced anything. That is in a very real sense a fishing expedition. \nIt has not produced anything thus far.\n  Now, Mr. President, a lot has been made of citing the book by Senator \nMitchell and Senator Cohen with respect to having a firm deadline and \ntheir feeling that the Iran-Contra inquiry would have worked better \nwithout a firm deadline. Of course, as my colleague from Connecticut \npointed out earlier, there has been no inquiry conducted in the Senate \nwithout a firm deadline. This is an entirely new and different \nprecedent that was going to be established.\n  Let me just quote from their book:\n\n       At the time, the setting of a deadline for the completion \n     of the committee's work seemed a reasonable and responsible \n     compromise between Democratic members in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate who wanted no time limitation \n     placed upon the committee, and Republican Members who wanted \n     the hearings completed within 2 or 3 months.\n\n  As an aside, I may note that probably the strongest advocate of a \ntime limitation for the committee's work was the then-minority leader, \nSenator Dole. Time and time again he took the floor to argue that very \nstrenuously, did the same thing in the meetings that were being held \nbetween the leadership to work out how that inquiry would be done, and \ndid, in fact, press for a timeframe at one point of only 2 or 3 months, \nas this book indicates.\n  Now, the book then goes on to say, and I am now quoting it again:\n  ``It escaped no one's attention that an investigation that spilled \ninto 1988 could only help keep Republicans on the defensive during an \nelection year. Both Inouye and Hamilton recommended rejecting'' and I \nunderscore that. ``rejecting the opportunity to prolong, and thereby \nexploit President Reagan's difficulties, determining that 10 months \nwould provide enough time to uncover any wrongdoing.''\n  I want to underscore to this body that the Democratic leadership of \nthe Congress, as that book states, Chairman Hamilton from the House and \nChairman Inouye from the Senate, agreed to a defined timeframe as the \nminority leader, Senator Dole, had pressed for very, very hard. And, of \ncourse, the reason was to keep it out of the 1988 Presidential election \nyear and, therefore, not turn the inquiry into a political football.\n  That was the thinking here last year when we passed Senate Resolution \n120 with an ending date of February 29, 1996, which is where we find \nourselves now. That was the thinking. And many of us have taken the \nview, and I hold to it very strongly, that extending the inquiry deep \ninto a Presidential election year will seriously undermine the \ncredibility of this investigation and create a public perception that \nthis investigation is being conducted for political purposes. I think \nthat is clearly happening, and I think the effort to have the inquiry \ncontinue on through the Presidential election year will contribute to \nthat.\n  I was very much interested in an editorial that appeared in U.S. News \n& World Report on January 29, by its editor in chief, Mortimer \nZuckerman.\n  I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the course of it he says, and let me just quote it:\n\n       It would be foolish to expect a congressional investigation \n     to be above politics. But at what point, in a decent \n     democracy, does politics have to yield to objectivity? At \n     what point does rumor have to retreat before truth? In \n     Whitewater that point would seem to have been reached when we \n     have had an independent, exhaustive study of the case under \n     the supervision of a former Republican U.S. attorney, Jay \n     Stephens.\n\n  Of course, he is referring there to the study that was commissioned \nby the RTC, from the Pillsbury, Madison, Sutro law firm.\n  He goes on a little later in that editorial to say:\n\n       That official report is in, but hardly anyone who has been \n     surfing the Whitewater headlines will know of it. It has been \n     ignored by both the Republicans and a media hungry for \n     scandal. The Stephens report provides a blow-by-blow account \n     of virtually every charge involved in the Whitewater saga. \n     Let us put the conclusions firmly on the record. The quotes \n     below are directly from the Stephens report.\n\n  And he then goes through questions that were raised about various \nactivities and the conclusions of the report. And then goes on to say:\n\n       The report concludes: On this record there is no basis to \n     charge the Clintons with any kind of primary liability for \n     fraud or intentional misconduct. This investigation has \n     revealed no evidence to support any such claims. Nor would \n     the record support any claim of secondary or derivative \n     liability for the possible misdeeds of others.\n       Stephens's firm--Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro--spent two \n     years and almost $4 million to reach its conclusions and \n     recommended that no further resources be expended on the \n     Whitewater part of this investigation.\n\n  Pillsbury, Madison actually asked for a tolling agreement from the \nRose Law Firm at the end of December, because of some new material that \nhad come out. And then subsequent to that we received the billing \nrecords of Mrs. Clinton from the Rose firm. Other matters came of \npublic record, and they examined all of those before they submitted \ntheir final report, which has just come in today. In that report they \nconclude, as they had concluded earlier, that there was no basis on any \nof the matters they investigated--and they went carefully through quite \na long litany of them--\n\n       . . . no basis on which to charge the Clintons with any \n     kind of primary liability for fraud or intentional conduct, \n     nor would the record support any claim of secondary or \n     derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others.\n\n  This report needs, obviously, to be carefully examined by my \ncolleagues. It is a very important report; $4 million of public money \nwas expended on it. And it reached the conclusions which I have just \noutlined.\n  Mr. President, I think the proposal that Senator Daschle has put \nforward is an eminently reasonable proposal. It is argued, on the one \nhand, we need even an indefinite time because we need to get more \nmaterial. The material has now all come--an extraordinary request for \nmaterial, some of it delayed, in my judgment, because of how far-\nreaching and onerous the document requests were. Other items were \ndelayed because people misplaced them, did not find them. They have now \nbeen provided to the committee.\n  The other argument that is made, which is an interesting argument \ngiven the record of this committee, is that we now need to await the \ntrial in Arkansas. It was recognized in Senate Resolution 120 that the \nindependent counsel was already at work, and it was never anticipated \nthat the committee would defer its work to the independent counsel in \nsuch a way as to go beyond the February 29 deadline. \n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\n  In fact, when the independent counsel in September of last year \nindicated to the committee to forbear until some unspecified time any \ninvestigation and public hearings into many of the matters specified in \nSenate Resolution 120, we rejected that in a joint letter which Senator \nD'Amato and I sent to Mr. Starr. We stated:\n\n       We have now determined that the special committee should \n     not delay its investigation of the remaining matters \n     specified in Senate Resolution 120.\n\n  We went on to say:\n\n       We believe that the concerns expressed in your letter do \n     not outweigh the Senate's strong interest in concluding its \n     investigation and public hearings into the matters specified \n     in Senate Resolution 120 consistent with section 9 of the \n     resolution.\n\n  Section 9 is the provision of the resolution which called for the \nFebruary 29 concluding date for the work of this committee.\n  And we went on to say:\n\n       Accordingly, we have determined that the special committee \n     will begin its next round of public hearings in late October \n     of 1995. This round of hearings will focus primarily on the \n     matters specified in section (1)(b)(2) of Senate Resolution \n     120, and through the remainder of this year the special \n     committee will investigate the remaining matters specified in \n     Senate Resolution 120 with the intention of holding public \n     hearings thereon beginning in January 1996.\n\n  That was our position then. I thought it was a correct position. It \nwas not anticipated that the committee would defer its work until after \nthe independent counsel has pursued his trials. It is now said this \ntrial. But he has other trials in the offing as well, all of which, of \ncourse, would serve to carry this inquiry on into infinity.\n  Just to underscore it with respect to Mr. Hale because we, the \nminority, have pressed repeatedly throughout for bringing Mr. Hale in, \nseeking through subpoena to obtain his documents--and that has \nconsistently been delayed--this issue was considered at a hearing on \nthe 28th of November, and Chairman D'Amato said the following. I now \nquote:\n\n       I would like to bring him, Hale, in sooner rather than \n     later so that he can testify and so that he can be examined. \n     If we drag this, if this matter is dragged out into February \n     or later, I believe legitimate questions can be raised as to \n     why bringing him in so late and getting into next year and \n     the political season--and I think that is a very legitimate \n     concern of this committee--both Democrats and Republicans and \n     I would like to avoid that.\n\n  It certainly was a legitimate concern and the effort to press to move \non the Hale matter never was realized. The minority staff continually \nsent memoranda to the majority about Hale and nothing was done about \nit. We now find ourselves finding this being used as an argument to \ndefer the hearings to the other side of the trial. As I said, the trial \nis not going to be in secret. So the matters developed at the trial \nwill be, I can assure you, on the public record and available to the \npublic.\n  Many of the witnesses sought have indicated they will take the fifth \namendment. And there is every reason to assume that they will continue \nto do so. So then they are not going to become available to the \ncommittee in any event. And the committee has to do its work and make \nits report.\n  We have taken an extraordinary number of depositions. Much of what we \nare now looking at, which involves matters that occurred in Arkansas 10 \nand 15 years ago, had been covered voluminously in the press. I am \nreally almost staggered by the fact that we hold a hearing and then it \nis asserted, well, new revelations came out at this hearing. We held a \nhearing with Ickes. And everyone said, ``My goodness, we have \ndiscovered that a special team was set up in the White House to deal \nwith the Whitewater matter in January of 1994.'' A newspaper account in \nearly January of 1994 states that a special team under the direction of \nMr. Ickes was set up. So he comes in. We have these notes. He comes in \nand testifies. We have the situation in the committee where the \nestablishment of this team and him as the head of it is considered as a \nnew discovery when there is a newspaper story from 2 years earlier \nstating that such a team was being set up and that he would head it up.\n  Interestingly enough, the article that was written on the day after \nthe hearing paralleled the article that was written 2 years earlier. \nThe January 7th, 1994--not 1996, 1994--article in the Washington Post \nstated, and I quote:\n\n       With the start of the new year, the White House launched a \n     major internal effort to fight back against mounting \n     criticism of the way it has handled inquiries into President \n     Clinton's Arkansas land investments. A high-powered damage \n     control squad was appointed under the direction of new Deputy \n     Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, and daily strategy sessions \n     began.\n\n  That is in 1994. Then we get notes from Ickes about a meeting of the \nspecial strategy session that he is heading up, and that is treated as \nthough we discovered something new. In fact, the article reporting on \nthe hearing paralleled the article written 2 years earlier.\n  That is what we have been going through; I mean a replowing of \nmaterial that has already been available generally in the press and out \nto the public. In fact, the Atlanta Constitution in the editorial that \nmy colleague, Senator Pryor, cited of February 15 states:\n\n       The Senate's Watergate hearings of 1973 and 1974 were \n     momentous delving into White House abuses of power and \n     leading to the resignation of the disgraced President and the \n     imprisonment of many of his aides. They lasted 279 days. Next \n     week, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York and his \n     fellow Whitewater investigators, will surpass that mark. \n     Today is the 275th day, and they have nothing anywhere near \n     conclusive to show for their labors. To put matters in \n     context, all they have to ponder is a fairly obscure 1980's \n     real estate and banking scandal in Arkansas. With the \n     February 29th expiration date for the special panel staring \n     him in the face, Senator D'Amato has the effrontery to ask \n     the Senate for more time and money to continue drilling dry \n     investigative holes. Specifically, he wants open-ended \n     authority and another $600,000. That is on top of $950,000 \n     his committee has spent so far plus $400,000 that was devoted \n     to a Senate Banking Committee inquiry into Whitewater in \n     1994. The partisan motives behind Senator D'Amato's request \n     could not be more obvious.\n\n  They then go on along this vein.\n  They also make the point in concluding that the independent counsel \nwill continue his investigation and, therefore, the legal and business \naffairs of the President and Mrs. Clinton will be scrutinized by the \nindependent counsel.\n  This editorial actually called for ending on February 29 as the \nresolution provided. The distinguished minority leader has in effect \ncome forward and said we will not press this immediate cutoff. We are \nprepared for the hearings to go on for a limited further period of \ntime, and for a period of time after that in order to do the report. I \nthink that is a very forthcoming proposal, and I very strongly commend \nit to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 27, 1996]\n\n                               Docudrama\n\n                         (By Sidney N. Herman)\n\n       Documents that are relevant to an investigation are found \n     in an unexpected place six months after they were first \n     sought. A shocking development?\n       Absolutely not. In most major pieces of litigation, files \n     turn up late. One side or the other always thinks of making \n     something of the late appearance, but these lawyers know the \n     truth: it could just as easily happen to them.\n       Despite diligent searches, important papers in large \n     organizations are always turning up after the initial and \n     follow-up searches. How many times have you looked for \n     something on your desk and couldn't find it, only to have it \n     appear right under your nose later? Happens all the time.\n       Indeed, as every litigator knows, there is nothing worse \n     than having an important document show up late. You've only \n     highlighted its absence for your opponent. If you know where \n     it is, it is far better to include it in the initial delivery \n     of relevant papers, where it gets mixed in with the rest of \n     the morass. Why red-flag it by holding it back?\n       My former partner, Kenneth Starr, knows all this. As \n     independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, he will \n     take it into account.\n       But the American people have no reason to know that this is \n     a normal occurrence; it is not part of their everyday \n     experience. Reporters really don't have any reason to know \n     this either. Or they may know, and simply choose to ignore \n     it.\n       Last summer, notes that were critical to the celebrated \n     libel suit brought by Jeffrey Masson against the writer Janet \n     Malcolm appeared in her private study, years after they were \n     first sought. I recall that discovery being treated as an \n     interesting happenstance, nothing more.\n       When documents show up belatedly, even in private quarters, \n     there is simply nothing unusual about it.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 29, 1996]\n\n                        Extend, But With Limits\n\n       We noted the other day that the White House--through its \n     tardiness in producing \n\n[[Page S1445]]\n     long-sought subpoenaed documents--has helped Senate Banking Committee \n     Chairman Alfonse D'Amato make his case for extending the \n     Whitewater investigation beyond today's expiration date. If \n     one didn't know any better, one might conclude that the \n     administration's Whitewater strategy was being devised not by \n     a White House response team but by the high command of the \n     Republican National Committee.\n       However, despite the administration's many pratfalls since \n     Whitewater burst onstage, Sen. D'Amato and his Republican \n     colleagues have not provided compelling evidence to support \n     the entirely open ended mandate they are seeking from the \n     Senate. There are loose ends to be tied up and other \n     witnesses to be heard, as Republican Sen. Christopher Bond \n     said the other day. But dragging the proceedings out well \n     into the presidential campaign advances the GOP's political \n     agenda; it doesn't necessarily serve the ends of justice or \n     the need to learn what made the Madison Guaranty Savings & \n     Loan of Arkansas go off the tracks at such enormous cost to \n     American taxpayers. The Senate should allow the committee to \n     complete the investigative phase of its inquiry, including a \n     complete examination of the Clinton's involvement with the \n     defunct Whitewater Development Corp. and their business \n     relationships with other Arkansas figures involved in \n     financial wrongdoing. But the Senate should require the \n     committee to complete its work and produce a final report by \n     a fixed date.\n       Democrats want to keep the committee on a short leash by \n     extending hearings to April 3, with a final report to follow \n     by May 10. A limited extension makes sense, but an \n     unreasonably short deadline does not. Five weeks may not be \n     enough time for the committee to do a credible job. Instead, \n     the Senate should give the committee more running room but \n     aim for ending the entire proceedings before summer, when the \n     campaign season really heats up. That would argue for \n     permitting the probe to continue through April or early May.\n       What the Senate does not need is a Democrat-led filibuster. \n     Having already gone bail for the Clinton White House, often \n     to an embarrassing degree, Senate Democrats would do \n     themselves and the president little good by tying up the \n     Senate with a talkathon. Better that they let the probe \n     proceed. Give the public some credit for knowing a witch hunt \n     and a waste of their money if and when they see one. And \n     that, of course, is the risk Sen. D'Amato and his committee \n     are taking. The burden is also on them.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Jan. 29, 1996]\n\n                       The Real Whitewater Report\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n       Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you \n     left no sense of decency? Forty years ago, Joseph Welch, a \n     venerable Boston lawyer, thus rebuked Joe McCarthy in the \n     Army-McCarthy hearings and stopped his reckless persecution \n     of a naive but innocent young man. How one longs for a Joseph \n     Welch to emerge in the middle of the extraordinary affair now \n     known as Whitewater! The parallels between Sen. Alfonse \n     D'Amato's investigation of a land deal in Arkansas and \n     McCarthy's investigation of communism in the Army are hardly \n     exact, but there is an uncanny echo of 1954 in the fever of \n     political innuendo we are now experiencing and in the failure \n     of an excitable press to set it all in proper perspective. \n     Then, as now, the public found itself lost in a welter of \n     allegation, reduced to mumbling the old line about ``no smoke \n     without fire.''\n       It would be foolish to expect a congressional investigation \n     to be above politics. But at what point, in a decent \n     democracy, does politics have to yield to objectivity? At \n     what point does rumor have to retreat before truth? In \n     Whitewater that point would seem to have been reached when we \n     have had an independent, exhaustive study of the case under \n     the supervision of a former Republican U.S. attorney, Jay \n     Stephens, a man whose credibility is enhanced by the fact \n     that he was such a political adversary of the Clintons that \n     his appointment provoked Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos \n     to call for his removal. Yes? No. That official report is in, \n     but hardly anyone who has been surfing the Whitewater \n     headlines will know of it. It has been ignored by both the \n     Republicans and a media hungry for scandal. The Stephens \n     report provides a blow-by-blow account of virtually every \n     charge involved in the Whitewater saga. Let us put the \n     conclusions firmly on the record. The quotes below are \n     directly from the Stephens report.\n       Question 1: Were the Clintons involved in the illegal \n     diversion of any money from the failed Madison Guaranty \n     Savings & Loan, either to their own pockets or to Clinton's \n     1984 gubernatorial campaign? ``On this record, there is no \n     basis to assert that the Clintons knew anything of substance \n     about the McDougals' advances to Whitewater, the source of \n     the funds used to make those advances, or the source of \n     the funds used to make payments on bank debt. . . . For \n     the relevant period (ending in 1986), the evidence \n     suggests that the McDougals and not the Clintons managed \n     Whitewater.''\n       Question 2: What of money diverted to the campaign? No \n     evidence has been unearthed that any campaign worker for \n     Clinton knew of any wrongdoing pertaining to any funds that \n     might have come out of Madison into Clinton's campaign.\n       Question 3: Did taxpayers suffer from Whitewater through \n     Madison's losses on the investment? No. Whitewater did not \n     hurt Madison, the possible exceptions being a couple of \n     payments involving James and Susan McDougal. The report says \n     the Clintons knew nothing about the payments.\n       Question 4: Did the Clintons make any money? The report \n     says they did not; instead, they borrowed $40,000 to put into \n     Whitewater and lost it.\n       Question 5: What of the charge from David Hale, former \n     municipal judge and Little Rock businessman, that Bill \n     Clinton pressured him to make an improper Small Business \n     Administration loan of $300,000 to Susan McDougal? As to the \n     $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal, ``there is nothing except an \n     unsubstantiated press report that David Hale claims then-\n     Governor Clinton pressured him into making the loan to Susan \n     McDougal.'' The charge lacked credibility in any event. It \n     was made when Hale sought personal clemency in a criminal \n     charge of defrauding the SBA.\n       What's left? Nothing. The report concludes: ``On this \n     record there is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind \n     of primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. \n     This investigation has revealed no evidence to support any \n     such claims. Nor would the record support any claim of \n     secondary or derivative liability for the possible misdeeds \n     of others.''\n       Stephen's firm--Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro--spent two years \n     and almost $4 million to reach its conclusions and \n     recommended ``that no further resources be expended on the \n     Whitewater part of this investigation.'' Amen.\n       So when you cut through all the smoke from D'Amato's \n     committee and almost hysterical press reports such as those \n     emanating from the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, \n     what you have is smoke and no fire. No Whitewater wrongdoing \n     to cover up, no incriminating documents to be stolen, no \n     connection between the Clintons and any illegal activities \n     from the real-estate business failure and the web of \n     political and legal ties known as Whitewater.\n       But wait. What about the time sheets showing the amount of \n     legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S? \n     Surely we have some flames there? Again, no. Her role, says \n     the Stephens report, was minimal. Mrs. Clinton did perform \n     real-estate work in 1985 and 1986 pertaining to an option for \n     about 2 percent of the land, but as the report says, that was \n     at most related only tangentially to the acquisition itself. \n     Mrs. Clinton did not play a legal part in the original \n     acquisition of the land, known as castle Grande, although the \n     Rose Law Firm did. Both sides pointed out that the \n     principals, as opposed to the lawyers, put together the deal. \n     The lawyers did only the scrivener work, and if this \n     transaction was a sham, there is ``no substantial evidence \n     that the Rose Law Firm knowingly and substantially assisted \n     in its commission.''\n       As for the option, the report says there is no evidence \n     that Mrs. Clinton knew of any illegalities in this \n     transaction: ``The option did not assist in the closing of \n     the acquisition. It . . . was created many months after the \n     transaction closed. The option . . . does not prove any \n     awareness on the part of its author of Ward's [Madison's \n     partner] arrangements with Madison Financial. . . . While \n     Mrs. Clinton seems to have had some role in drafting the May \n     1, 1986, option, nothing proves that she did so knowing it to \n     be wrong, and the theories that tie this option to wrongdoing \n     or to the straw-man arrangements are strained at best.''\n       Rep. James Leach's spokesman asserts that Hillary Clinton's \n     minimal work on the option put her ``at the center of a \n     fraudulent deal,'' and D'Amato says that her billing records \n     show tremendous inconsistencies with her previous statements \n     on the time she spent on Whitewater. Fraud? The only fraud \n     lies in these congressional statements; they are a political \n     fraud on a credulous public. On the role of real-estate \n     lawyers, I must endorse the Stephens judgments here from my \n     personal business experience of thousands of real-estate \n     transactions. Never, not once, have my lawyers drawing up \n     legal documents determined the business terms or the \n     appropriateness of the price.\n       It is appalling that the smoke and smear game has been \n     played so long by the Republicans and the media that everyone \n     is tagged with some kind of presumption of guilt rather than \n     a presumption of innocence. The double standard of judgment \n     is well illustrated by the performance of those standard-\n     setting newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington \n     Post. The Times originally broke the Whitewater story on its \n     front page with a jump to a full inside page. What did it do \n     with Stephens's report? Ran it on Page 12, in a 12-inch \n     story. The Post's priorities were so distorted that it \n     mentioned the findings in only the 11th paragraph of a front-\n     page story devoted to a much less important Whitewater \n     subpoena battle. Most other major papers ran very short \n     stores on inside pages, and the networks virtually ignored \n     the report.\n       The press has slipped its moorings here. It seems to be \n     caught in a time warp from the Nixon-Watergate era. The two \n     questions then--what did the president know and when did he \n     know it?--were at the very heart of the matter. The two \n     questions now--what did the president's wife know and when \n     did she know it?--seem a childish irrelevance by comparison. \n     The time, money, and political energy spent barking up the \n     wrong tree are \n\n[[Page S1446]]\n     quite amazing. The press gives the impression that it has invested so \n     much capital in the search for a scandal that it cannot drop \n     it when the scandal evaporates. The Republicans give the \n     impression that if one slander does not work, they will try \n     another. No wonder the nation holds Congress, the White House \n     and the media in such contempt; the people know that the \n     press seems to be acting like a baby--a huge appetite at one \n     end and no sense of responsibility at the other.\n       We have a topsy-turvy situation here. The Republicans win \n     the case on merit over balancing the budget but are losing it \n     politically on the basis of public perception. The Clintons \n     have the better case on Whitewater but are losing it \n     politically because of smear and slander, a situation \n     compounded by their defensive behavior. The media seem \n     unwilling to focus on the substance of either issue. So much \n     for a responsible press!\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I read with great interest an article in \nthe Washington Times a few days ago. I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 26, 1996]\n\n                 European Armies Lose Size, Efficiency\n\n\n         conscription not working; all-volunteer too expensive\n\n                            (By John Keegan)\n\n       London.--The state may not be withering away, as Karl Marx \n     predicted it would, but Europe's armies are.\n       Only seven years ago, Europe was awash with combat units. \n     Now they are so thin on the ground that governments can \n     scarcely meet their military commitments. And the situation \n     is getting worse.\n       The problem is conscription. Young Europeans do not want to \n     perform military service, even for as little as a year, now \n     the norm.\n       Paradoxically, the generals are not keen on conscription \n     either. As a result, the big armies, such as those of France \n     and Germany, are planning either to increase the proportion \n     of volunteers or to scrap conscription altogether.\n       France announced Thursday the most sweeping changes in its \n     military since it developed nuclear weapons nearly 40 years \n     ago, saying it will shrink its armed forces by one-third in \n     six years and eliminate the draft. The French want a force of \n     350,000 by 2002, all of it volunteer.\n       Smaller armies in Europe have taken similar steps. The \n     Netherlands will call up no new conscripts and release all \n     those in service by Aug. 30. Belgium stopped conscription in \n     1993. Austria, not part of NATO, is talking of substituting \n     an armed police for its army.\n       In the former Soviet bloc, the situation is confused at \n     best, chaotic at worst.\n       Russia's problem is that young men of military age do not \n     report for the call-up. In some military regions, the \n     proportion of those who do is as low as 10 percent, and they \n     tend to be unqualified--often dropouts who cannot find a \n     place in the new free-enterprise economy. That does much to \n     explain the poor performance of Russian units in Chechnya.\n       The Russian army has been humiliated by the collapse of the \n     Soviet empire, of which it was the guardian. Russian officers \n     resent the dimunition of national power as much as they are \n     frustrated by the drop in their units' ability to perform. \n     Inefficiency is so glaring that self-appointed volunteer \n     formations, often calling themselves ``Cossacks,'' are \n     springing up.\n       Military disgruntlement in circumstances of political \n     weakness always bodes ill. The need to put the former Soviet \n     armed forces on a proper footing is now urgent.\n       Poland, where the army is a revered national institution, \n     still operates a successful conscription system. Neighboring \n     states, such as Belarus and Ukraine, are laboring to decide \n     what sort of army they want. They look to the West for \n     advice.\n       The British Defense Ministry held a conference in London \n     last year to explain the options to them. The British model \n     of all-``regular''--that is, career or volunteer--forces is \n     much admired, but is too expensive for many. Conscription \n     staggers on but does not produce combat units worth the money \n     they cost.\n       The crisis in France and Germany is of a different order.\n       Conscription in France, since the French Revolution, has \n     always been given an ideological value. Military service, the \n     French believe, teaches the ``republican virtues'' of \n     equality and fraternity, besides patriotism and civic duty.\n       There have been ups and downs in the system: exemptions for \n     the well-educated, substitution for the rich. Since 1905, \n     however, all fit young Frenchmen have had to serve a year or \n     two in the ranks.\n       The logic is different from that held by Britons, who pine \n     for the days before 1961, when conscription was abolished. \n     They see it as a recipe for an end to inner-city hooliganism. \n     In France it has a higher motive. Military service makes \n     Frenchmen into citizens.\n       In Germany, conscription also acquired an ideological \n     justification in the post-Hitler years.\n       Under the kaiser, it was intended to produce the biggest \n     army in Europe, but also to make German youth respectful of \n     their betters and obedient to all authority. The imperial \n     officer corps took trouble to see that their authority was \n     obeyed. Regular officers remained a caste apart from \n     civilians, even under Hitler.\n       When postwar West Germany rearmed, its democratic \n     government harbored understandable fears of creating such an \n     office corps again. It saw in conscription a check against \n     military authoritarianism. Conscripts were guaranteed their \n     civil rights, military law was abolished, and conscientious \n     objection was made easy.\n       Too easy, it has proved.\n       More than half of the 300,000 annual conscripts now opt for \n     alternative, non-military service. There are simply not \n     enough men to keep units up to strength.\n       What makes things worse is that Chancellor Helmut Kohl, \n     with his passion for European integration, is pushing for \n     more inter-allied units, with Germans serving beside French, \n     Spanish and Belgian soldiers.\n       Spain retains conscription, though the short term of \n     service makes its army of little use. If French and Belgian \n     troops are to be regulars in the future, the difference in \n     quality between them and their German and Spanish comrades-\n     in-arms will become an embarrassment.\n       The solution may be to make all soldiers regulars, to go \n     for what Europeans increasingly call ``the British system.'' \n     The problem is cost.\n       Regulars are at least twice as expensive as conscripts, \n     requiring either a bigger defense budget or smaller armed \n     forces. No one wants to spend more on defense, particularly \n     when social budgets are crippling national economies. It \n     seems inevitable, therefore, that armies must grow smaller \n     but become all-regular if they are to meet international \n     standards of efficiency.\n       The French appear to have accepted that logic.\n       President Jacques Chirac is about to be advised that France \n     should withdraw the 1st Armed Division, its main contribution \n     to the Franco-German Eurocorps, from Germany and disband \n     several of its regiments, together with many others in \n     metropolitan France. The army would be halved.\n       That may make good military sense, but it is likely to \n     cause a political storm. Democratic France, like Germany, \n     harbors suspicions of regular forces. They are thought to be \n     anti-popular and all too readily turned against elected \n     governments.\n       French history, like Germany's makes such fears realistic.\n       Napoleon III came to power through a military coup mounted \n     with long-service troops. Charles de Gaulle faced another \n     coup mounted by the Foreign Legion in Algeria. The Foreign \n     Legion has never been allowed to serve in mainland France \n     during peacetime because of fears about its loyalty.\n       In Germany, which already has some all-regular units, the \n     public is probably no more ready to face a transition to the \n     British system than is Mr. Kohl. The paradoxical outcome may \n     be to leave Germany with the least efficient of armies among \n     major European states.\n       German generals, who increasingly count on existing all-\n     regular units to fulfill their NATO commitments, will not be \n     pleased. They are likely to press for an end to conscription \n     but unlikely to get it.\n       The difficulties involved in a change from conscript to \n     regular forces are not easily understood in Britain, nor is \n     the political debate it causes. The British take their \n     system, together with the political stability of their armed \n     forces, for granted.\n       What is not perceived is that such stability is the product \n     of 300 years of unbroken constitutional government, during \n     which the officer corps has completely integrated with civil \n     society. There is, indeed, no ``officer corps'' in Britain, \n     where soldiering is seen as a profession akin to others.\n       In Germany and France, with their different traditions, it \n     may not take 300 years to change the relationship between \n     army and society, but it will still take some time. In the \n     former Soviet bloc, time may not be on the military \n     reformers' side.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this article was written by John Keegan of \nthe London Daily Telegraph in which he stated the historical \nperspective of how the principal European nations and Great Britain \nhave, through the years, raised their Armed Forces, and how the future \nportends that they are going to depart from these time-honored methods, \nand, as a consequence, the likelihood of their level of manpower could \nsignificantly drop in the coming years.\n  I promptly sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense, the Honorable \nWilliam J. Perry, addressing my concerns.\n  The letter said:\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I want to bring to your attention the \n     enclosed article, ``European Armies Lose Size, Efficiency,'' \n     which appeared in the ``Washington Times'' on February 26.\n       According to this article, European nations--many of which \n     are Members of \n\n[[Page S1447]]\n     NATO--are in the process of dramatically reducing the size of their \n     ground forces. Such developments could have adverse \n     consequences for the future of NATO, and require ever-\n     increasing U.S. military contributions to the Alliance to \n     compensate for European shortfalls. In such developments \n     continue, NATO's ability to fulfill its commitments under \n     Article 5 of the ``NATO Charter'' could be called into \n     question.\n       As Chairman of the AirLand Forces Subcommittee of the Armed \n     Services Committee--the Subcommittee with primary \n     jurisdiction over NATO and the European Command--I will need \n     information from the Department of Defense in order to assess \n     the impact on the United States of the issues raised in the \n     enclosed article. In particular, I am concerned about the \n     long-term plans for meeting our NATO commitments in light of \n     the reductions planned by our European allies; the need for \n     increased U.S. military contributions to the Alliance to \n     offset the European reductions; and the adequacy of current \n     U.S. force structure planning to meet our NATO commitments in \n     light of these changes.\n       During a time when NATO expansion is being actively \n     considered, by some, these issues must be thoroughly \n     examined. I ask that you provide your assessment as soon as \n     possible in order for my Subcommittee to incorporate this \n     information into its upcoming budget review and schedule of \n     hearings. I am hopeful your reply will be detailed, as I view \n     the representations in this article with deep concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1446-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATOR THURMOND APPOINTS ROMIE L. BROWNLEE AS NEW SENATE ARMED \n                      SERVICES COMMITTEE DIRECTOR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond, for his selection of Col. Les \nBrownlee as the new staff director of the Armed Services Committee. \nColonel Brownlee has served me with extraordinary professionalism for \n12 years. He brings to this position a record of significant \nachievement as a highly decorated career military officer for his valor \nin combat, service with the Army Secretariat, special assistant to the \nundersecretary of the Army, and many other qualifications.\n  I wish to compliment the chairman for the selection of Colonel \nBrownlee, who, although he has been in my employ, so to speak, for a \ndozen years, now will owe his total allegiance to the chairman and all \nother members of the committee. I was so pleased when Chairman Thurmond \nconsulted me on this nomination that he had in mind some days ago. Of \ncourse, I strongly recommended Colonel Brownlee, and I am pleased that \nthe chairman did select him from the strong field of candidates to \nbecome the staff director.\n  Colonel Brownlee is well known throughout the Senate and the staffs. \nHe has worked here by my side and by the side of many others, including \nSenators Tower, Goldwater, Nunn, and many members of the committee, in \nthe preparation of our legislative responsibilities, which have been \ndischarged here on the floor through these many years. I would like to \nthink that the men and women in the Armed Forces on active duty today, \nand, indeed, the retired military, will receive with pride the news \nthat one of their own, one who has distinguished himself so well in \nuniform, as well as in service to the committee, has been selected to \nthis very, very important post.\n  I add, Mr. President, the fact that while Colonel Brownlee had not in \nany way actively looked at outside opportunities because he is a strict \nadherent to the rules of conflict of interest here, it was clear to me \nin our conversations that, in all probability, having spent 12 years on \nthe committee and having many years before him of useful and productive \nlife, thoughts were given to the more lucrative opportunities that are \nfrequently offered by the private sector. But he clearly decided, once \nagain, on the offer to serve his Nation, serve this Senate, and indeed \nserve the Armed Forces of the United States. The call came, and he \nresponded unhesitatingly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the press release accompanying the \nannouncement by Chairman Thurmond be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Thurmond Appoints New SASC Director\n\n       Washington, Feb. 27. 1996.--Chairman of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee Strom Thurmond (R-SC) today appointed \n     longtime committee staff member Romie L. Brownlee as the new \n     Staff Director for the Committee.\n       Brownlee, a retired Army Colonel, has worked on defense \n     issues in the Senate since 1984, when he began his career in \n     the Legislative Branch as a National Security Assistant to \n     Senator John Warner (R-VA), and then joined the Committee in \n     1987 as the Deputy Staff Director for the Minority. Before \n     being named Staff Director, Brownlee was responsible for \n     handling issues related to the Army and Marine Corps land \n     forces, Special Operations Forces, and drug interdiction.\n       ``Les Brownlee is extremely well qualified to serve as \n     Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as he \n     is a man with a keen intellect and proven abilities,'' said \n     Thurmond. ``He is widely respected by senior members of the \n     armed forces, by Senators serving on the Armed Services \n     Committee, and by his fellow staffers. We are fortunate to \n     have him as our new Director.''\n       A native Texan, Brownlee was commissioned a Second \n     Lieutenant of Infantry following his 1962 graduation from the \n     University of Wyoming. Brownlee served two tours in Vietnam, \n     including one as a Company Commander with the 173rd Airborne \n     Brigade. During his career, Brownlee earned a number of \n     decorations including two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, \n     and a Purple Heart. In subsequent years, Brownlee would hold \n     postings that included serving as Commander of the 3rd \n     Battalion, 36th Infantry, and at the Pentagon as the \n     executive officer for the Under Secretary of the Army. He \n     earned a Master's of Business Administration from the \n     University of Alabama, graduated from the Army War College, \n     is a distinguished graduate from the Army's highly demanding \n     Ranger Course, and is an Honor Graduate of both the Infantry \n     Officer Advanced Course, and the Command and General Staff \n     College.\n       Brownlee is replacing retired Brigadier General Richard \n     Reynard, who is resigning from his position as Staff Director \n     to return to the private sector.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, once again, 1 of our 50 is missing. If \nthat seems like an enigmatic statement, bear with me a little longer. I \nhave a story to relate to you that proves true once again the adage \nthat truth is often stranger than fiction.\n  On Tuesday of this week one of my constituents, a man named Wade \nMiller, of Santa Fe, NM, called the Olympic ticket office in Atlanta, \nGA, in the United States--Atlanta, GA, USA. He was calling them to \nrequest tickets for the Olympics, I say to my friend from New York. \nInstead, imagine his surprise when he was told that since he was \ncalling from New Mexico with his request, he would need to consult with \nthe Mexican or Puerto Rican Olympic Committees in order to get \ntickets--not the Olympic office in Atlanta, which, I repeat, is in \nGeorgia, USA.\n  Keep in mind that the area code for New Mexico is 505. The area code \nfor Atlanta is 404. I checked it myself, and this does not register as \nan international call. If it was, my poor constituent, who argued with \nthem for a half hour to 45 minutes trying to convince them that New \nMexico was, indeed, in the United States, would have a real telephone \nbill. There was even some debate about old Mexico versus New Mexico. \nBut when all was said and done they still told him that, no, you cannot \nbuy any tickets from us. You have to get them from either the Mexican \nor Puerto Rican--they were not sure, I guess--Olympic office.\n  Finally, Mr. Miller produced a mailing address in Arizona and asked \nif his tickets could be mailed to that address. They established on the \nphone that yes, Arizona was in the United States and that tickets could \nbe sent there. Alas, the identity crisis for New Mexico, USA, seems to \ncontinue. And while I'm pleased we could all agree that Arizona, our \ndistinguished neighbor to our west, is a State, I must point out that \nNew Mexico was actually a State even before Arizona, although not by \nmuch.\n  So, as the Senator from New Mexico--although I guess the Olympic \nCommittee would simply call me a delegate, not a Senator--I must once \nmore rise to refresh everyone's memory. New Mexico--that large span of \nland between the oil wells of Texas and the saguaros of Arizona--is in \nthe United States. I flew home during the last recess and they did not \nbook me on an \n\n[[Page S1448]]\ninternational flight, nor did I need to pass through customs on my way. \nAnd while my passport is in order, I can assure you I did not need it \nto land at Albuquerque International Sunport.\n  I might also remind the Senate, and also the Olympic organizers in \nAtlanta, that New Mexico was admitted to the Union as the 47th State in \nJanuary 1912. It lies directly south of Colorado, east of Arizona, west \nof Texas, and north of the Mexican border. Let me repeat, north of the \nMexican border. You may know it as one of the larger pieces in jigsaw \npuzzles of the United States.\n  In fact, New Mexico has one of the longest histories of any State in \nthe Union, starting with our ancient Indian cultures, almost four \ncenturies of Hispanic ancestry, and nearly 200 years of American \nsettlement. It is a dramatic land of scenic vistas and 1.5 million \nproud citizens.\n  And let me remind the Olympic office that we had good reason to be \nproud during the last Olympics, for we had a great champion from New \nMexico--Trent Dimas, who earned a gold medal in gymnastics. When Trent \nDimas won this medal, it wasn't ``O Fair New Mexico,'' New Mexico's \nState song, that was played during the ceremony. They played the \nNational Anthem of the United States--surely an indicator that even in \nthe context of the Olympics, New Mexicans are proud U.S. citizens. And \nthose New Mexican athletes who visit the State of Georgia this summer \nto attend the Summer Olympics will do so as citizens of the United \nStates, cheering our other terrific American athletes.\n  Let me wrap up by assuring the Atlanta ticket office that we in New \nMexico are well practiced in the use of U.S. currency. We, too, use the \ndollar and not the peso. We're also well accustomed to potable drinking \nwater and to driving our cars on the right side of the road. And I \ncan't even imagine that those unique Southern accents will give New \nMexicans any trouble.\n  So today, I put a little note in Senator Nunn's and Senator \nCoverdell's mailboxes, asking them if they would do us a favor in New \nMexico and vouch for us to the Olympic Committee in Georgia--and I'm \nassuming that would be Georgia, USA, not Georgia, Russia. Perhaps they \ncould each send a note to the good people of Georgia to remind them \nthat New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment, is a State. No need to refer \nNew Mexicans to any embassy, customs office, passport center, or \ncurrency exchange office. We're one of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1447-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRAVIS LETTER\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this month marked the sesquicentennial \nof the end of the Republic of Texas.\n  But I rise this morning to celebrate the beginning of our Republic, \nnot its end. One hundred sixty years ago Saturday, March 2, a band of \nTexans gathered in Washington-on-the-Brazos and declared our \nIndependence from Mexico. Around them raged a fierce war for that \nIndependence. I would like the Senate to remember the many brave Texans \nwho gave their lives in that war as I read the last letter sent from \nthe Alamo on February 24, 1836. In reading this letter, I continue a \ntradition begun by my late friend, Senator John Tower. Here then is the \nletter of Col. William Barrett Travis, from his fort at San Antonio.\n\n       To the people of Texas and all Americans in the world:\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots--I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on \n     you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear \n     to the American character to come to our aid with all \n     dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and \n     will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or \n     five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to \n     sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who \n     never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his \n     country. Victory or death.\n       P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in \n     sight we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found \n     in deserted house 80 to 90 bushels and got in the walls 20 or \n     30 head of Beeves.\n       William B.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending February 23, the United States imported \n6,094,000 barrels of oil each day, a 6.5-percent increase over the \n5,698,000 barrels imported during the same period 1 year ago.\n  Americans continue to rely on foreign oil for more than 50 percent of \ntheir needs, and there are no signs that this upward trend will abate.\n  According to the January 30, New York Times article ``Odds of Another \nOil Crisis: Saudi Stability Plays a Large Role,'' Saudi Arabia, which \nsits on 25 percent of the world's proven oil reserves--that's \napproximately 260 billion barrels--is politically vulnerable. There is \nincreasing tension between the Sunni majority and the Shiite minority; \ntensions within the royal family have been widely reported.\n  Mr. President, a power struggle could easily lead to violence with a \ndisastrous effect on the price of oil. Of course, we all pray that \nSaudi Arabia remains stable, politically, economically, and otherwise. \nThis is a concern that has bothered me for years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks and, \nneedless to say, I hope Senators and their staffs will heed the very \nexplicit warning in it.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Odds of Another Oil Crisis: Saudi Stability Plays a Large Role\n\n                           (By Agis Salpukas)\n\n       Oil Shock III. Could it happen again?\n       With supplies of oil plentiful and the price of gasoline, \n     adjusted for inflation, as low as it was in the bountiful \n     1950's, the notion that the world will go through another \n     spike in oil prices like those in 1973-74 and 1979 seems \n     farfetched. And with Iraq apparently on the verge of re-\n     entering the market, nothing is likely to change soon. \n     Indeed, prices may fall for a while.\n       But some oil industry experts--worried that Saudi Arabia, \n     the linchpin of the world oil market, may be more vulnerable \n     politically than is generally believed--are raising the \n     specter of an oil price surge for the first time in years.\n       The talk has intensified because of the possibility, remote \n     as it may be, of a battle to succeed the ailing King Fahd \n     between Crown Prince Abdullah, the King's half brother, and \n     Prince Sultan, a full brother. Both men control large armies.\n       On Jan. 1, the 74-year-old King handed over authority to \n     Crown Prince Abdullah, 72, for an unspecified time while he \n     recovered from exhaustion. The Crown Prince, long designated \n     to succeed the King, is known as an Arab nationalist who may \n     be less open than King Fahd to American policies.\n       Civil war between rivals for power or between the Sunni \n     majority and the Shiite minority cannot be ruled out, says \n     David P. Hodel, Secretary of Energy under President Ronald \n     Reagan. And any instability in Saudi Arabia, which sits on 25 \n     percent of the world's proven oil reserves, or 260 billion \n     barrels, would have wide repercussions. The tendency in the \n     United States, he warns, has been to ``go merrily on our way \n     as if there is no potential problem to world oil supply until \n     it is too late.''\n       ``Sadly,'' he added, ``the consequences can be \n     devastating.''\n       Most political leaders and industry executives say there is \n     nothing to worry about. Another oil crisis is always \n     possible, they concede, but it is highly remote. The United \n     Nations World Economic and Social Survey 1995 confidently \n     predicts that the real price for oil will remain roughly \n     constant for the next 20 years.\n       ``Nobody can say it won't happen,'' said Alfred C. DeCrane \n     Jr., the chairman and chief \n\n[[Page S1449]]\n     executive of Texaco Inc. ``But an earthquake on the San Andreas Fault \n     is more apt to happen than a disruption in oil.''\n       Is that confidence overdone?\n       Saudi Arabia is still vital to feed the world's growing \n     appetite for oil, which now totals about 62 million barrels a \n     day. It accounts for a little more than 8 million of the 17 \n     million barrels of oil that flow from the Middle East. And \n     even though output outside the Middle East has been growing, \n     there is not enough reserve capacity to fill the void if \n     Saudi supplies are disrupted.\n       ``The world needs Saudi Arabia,'' said John H. Lichtblau, \n     the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a \n     private research group. In the event of upheaval, the \n     question, Mr. Lichtblau said, is, ``Will you be killed or \n     just be hurt?''\n       Experts like Mr. Lichtblau offer the consoling thought that \n     history demonstrates that even the most disruptive political \n     events are unlikely to keep the crude oil from pumping for \n     long.\n       Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of a private consulting firm \n     in Washington, the Petroleum Finance Company, generally \n     agrees. He recently warned in an article in Foreign Affairs \n     magazine that Saudi Arabia's leaders were frozen in time and \n     had shown little inclination to respond to the decade-old \n     drop in oil prices by reining in spending by the royal family \n     and its entourage of princes, households and hangers-on.\n       ``If in the next three to four years the Saudi Government \n     resists reforms,'' he said in an interview, ``you will see \n     more often the types of riots and civil unrest partly caused \n     by economic concerns and the rise of more Islamic movements. \n     The oil markets in the world will not watch this kind of \n     thing with detachment.''\n       Yet even under the worst view--in which a fundamentalist \n     Islamic group seizes power in Saudi Arabia--the new \n     government will only hurt itself if it cuts off the supply of \n     oil for a sustained period. ``Sooner or later,'' he said, \n     ``the new leaders would have to export oil.''\n       The best protection against a temporary cutoff in supplies \n     lies in the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which \n     holds about 600 million barrels, enough to meet America's \n     needs for 90 to 120 days. But growing complacency about the \n     risk of another oil shock is leading some lawmakers to look \n     at the reserve as a source of revenue today rather than an \n     insurance policy for tomorrow. Senate Republicans have \n     proposed selling 39 million barrels from the reserve to help \n     reduce the budget deficit. And most companies have cut their \n     own inventories of oil, leaving the nation with a smaller \n     margin of protection.\n       There is also little will on the part of the public, \n     political leaders or the oil industry to lessen the \n     vulnerability by increasing conservation or supporting \n     alternative energy sources.\n       ``At the moment we're just letting things drift,'' said \n     James R. Schlesinger, Energy Secretary under President Jimmy \n     Carter, ``when we should be alert to finding possible \n     contingencies.''\n       In the event of a crisis, the most likely outcome, many \n     experts say, will not be a complete shutoff but the risk that \n     any new leadership will decide to sacrifice maximum income \n     for a while, cutting production over time in a bid to push up \n     prices.\n       But not everybody is so confident that the worst can be \n     avoided. Milton Copulos, president of the National Defense \n     Council Foundation, a conservative group in Washington, \n     raised the possibility of an oil crisis at Congressional \n     hearings last year. ``The optimists assume that the Arabs are \n     exclusively motivated by economics,'' Mr. Copulos said. ``The \n     Ayotollah Khomeini was not motivated by economics. Other \n     militants are not motivated by economics.''\n       Ultimately, of course, there is always the option of \n     military force.\n       Walter E. Boomer, the president of the Babcock & Wilcox \n     Generation Group and a former Marine Corps lieutenant general \n     who was involved in the Persian Gulf war, said the United \n     States had already demonstrated its commitment during the war \n     to defend Western interests in the Middle East.\n       ``If the country is threatened,'' he said, ``we would make \n     that commitment again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1448-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1449-S1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTERNATIONAL DRUG CERTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to draw a line--a line that divides \nour nation from those countries who have fallen prey to the obscene \ninfluence of international drug cartels.\n  This week, the President will offer his decision--drawing his line--\nabout which countries have cooperated sufficiently with United States \ncounter-narcotics efforts to justify all the benefits of a full \npartnership with our Nation. This year, some of our neighbors have \ncrossed the line and should not be ``certified'' as fully cooperating \nwith the U.S. drug enforcement effort. Others of our neighbors are \ncoming perilously close to crossing this line.\n  Before offering my specific views on which countries I believe have \ncrossed this line, I want to offer my general views of this drug \ncertification process. Foremost, the certification process does not \nseek to shift the full blame for the drug scourge solely to the drug-\nproducing and transit countries. In fact, the comprehensive drug \nstrategies I have offered call on the U.S. government and the U.S. \npeople to remain vigilant and committed to attacking the drug problem \nat home.\n  But, as I have always recognized, slowing the flow of drugs into the \nU.S. must be an integral part of a comprehensive drug strategy. And \nthis effort to cut the literally hundreds of tons of drugs flowing \ntoward American shores must be assisted by all countries if they are to \ncontinue as our full partners in the family of nations.\n  Mr. President, let me make it real simple--any nation that wishes to \nenjoy the benefits of American friendship must do everything they can \nto help America fight the scourge of drugs. This is not an impossible \ntask. We are not being unreasonable. We do not ask that the nations \nthat have literally been held hostage by the drug cartels end the \nsupply of drugs coming from their shores. That would be unreasonable--\nmany of these nations just cannot eliminate all drug cartels, just as \nwe cannot eliminate all of the mafia here in the U.S.\n  Still, America has the right to ask what is reasonable--no more but \nalso no less. That has been my longstanding test, not only in the area \nof drug policy but also in other important questions of foreign policy, \nsuch as arms control.\n  To be more specific, I have long believed that a United States policy \nof support and cooperation with our friends in Latin America is the \nbest way to counter the drug threat. While it might make us feel \nbetter, isolation and incrimination of other countries rarely helps us \nmeet our ultimate objectives. Particularly in the drug interdiction \ntask, cooperation and shared intelligence are absolutely essential to \nan effective strategy because drugs can be hidden in any of the \nbillions of legal containers that cross our border every year. And with \nno intelligence, we can never hope to stop these drugs.\n  Nevertheless, despite the fact that cooperation is usually the best \npolicy, there are grave circumstances where both morality and \npracticality require America to draw the line.\n  I regret to conclude that for Colombia that line has been crossed. \nThe United States should not certify that Colombia has done everything \npossible to curb the operations and influence of the illicit drug \ntrade, primarily because of the corruption at the highest levels of the \nColombian government.\n  I also conclude that for Mexico, that line is close to being crossed. \nThis requires the U.S. to send a clear warning--just as we did last \nyear to Colombia. Let me also point out that totally cutting off \ncooperation could make a bad situation very much worse, and it is \nsimply not in our national interest to do so. Therefore, I recommend \nthat a vital national interest waiver or similarly strong, unambiguous \nwarning be sent to the Mexican government.\n  Even as I call for our nation to decertify Colombia, I recognize the \nimmense challenges that the drug trade poses in that country. I admire \nthe courage of the men and women in Colombian law enforcement--leaders \nsuch as the National Police Chief, General Serrano--who endure violent \nthreats and even actual assaults on their Government institutions. \nHundreds of honest, hard-working Colombians sacrificed their lives last \nyear in the struggle against drug traffickers.\n\n  But, how can we assured of the Government's commitment against drug \ntrafficking when the President himself almost surely benefited from the \ndrug trade? The extent and level of official drug corruption in \nColombia is the single most glaring failure --and the overriding reason \nI must recommend decertification.\n  President Ernesto Samper has been charged with accepting $6 million \nin campaign funds from the Cali cartel-- and may soon be impeached \nbecause of it. In addition, at least 20 members of congress are also \nunder investigation for accepting drug funds.\n  I have long stated that such official corruption cannot be tolerated. \nEven if a nation is overwhelmed by the horrible powers of international \ndrug cartels, as long as their leaders remain committed to fighting \nthese cartels they deserve our support. But, once a nation's leaders \nhave fallen under the corrupt influence of the drug cartels, morality \nand practicality require that they cannot be given our support. \n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n  This has been my test for certification for years. In 1989, I voted \nto overrule President Bush's decision to certify the Bahamas. I \nbelieved then that the Bahamas should have been decertified because \ndrug corruption had permeated the highest levels of their Government.\n  Let me also point out that the current leadership of Colombia has \nalready been given the benefit of the doubt--given chances--given \ntests--but, ultimately, their leaders have failed. The Senate was first \nfaced with reports of the Samper campaign's alleged connection to the \nCali cartel during the summer of 1994. I and every Senator voted to \ncondition U.S. aid on progress in fighting drug operations and \ncorruption. But, with no clear evidence of corruption against Mr. \nSamper available at the time, this provision was dropped when the final \nforeign operations bill was negotiated with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  At the time of President Samper's inauguration in August 1994, I and \nthe majority of Senators voted against a measure to place further \ncounter \nnarcotics conditions on United States aid to Colombia. We voted, in \neffect, to give the new President time to demonstrate his commitment to \nfighting the drug cartels. President Samper personally assured me that \nhe would remain faithful to the struggle against drugs. The evidence is \nclearer every day that he has not lived up to his word.\n  Last year's certification of Colombia on vital national interest \ngrounds was the clearest possible--and first ever--official United \nStates warning that the leaders of Colombia must remain absolutely free \nfrom the corrupt influence of the drug cartels. In response to this \nwarning, we did see an unprecedented series of raids--Colombian \nauthorities, cooperating with the of DEA, captured six leaders of the \nCali cartel.\n  But just last month, one of those key traffickers walked out of \nprison and reliable reports indicate that the cartel kingpins who \nstayed in prison continue to run their drug operations from their plush \nprison cells.\n  Finally, and unpardonably, charges of corruption have coincided with \na marked diminution of efforts to slow the drug trade--as last year \nColombian seizures of cocaine decreased by 24 percent last year. And, \nsupplies of Colombian heroin are also on the rise--becoming more pure, \nless expensive, and taking over the streets of America.\n  Even as I recommend decertification, I recognize that this issue \ncan--under the law--be revisited during the coming year. The Samper \ngovernment may soon be replaced. It may even prove that the charges of \ncorruption are groundless.\n  So, let me be crystal clear. If a new Colombian Government \ndemonstrates a commitment to fighting the drug cartels and an absolute \nfreedom from corrupt influence of the drug cartels, then the United \nStates should revisit the decertification decision. The Foreign \nAssistance Act allows the President to reconsider a decertification \ndecision if there has been a fundamental change of government or a \nfundamental change in the reasons for decertification. A new \ngovernment--free of the corrupt influence of the drug cartels--would be \nsuch a fundamental change.\n  But, until then, I cannot recommend to the President that he do \nanything other than decertify Colombia.\n  The story for Mexico is different than Colombia's--at least so far. \nThe key difference is the antinarcotics leadership of the current \nMexican administration. Still, the growing threat to the United States \nof drugs grown, produced, or traveling through Mexico is too serious \nfor Mexico to be granted full certification. Therefore, the correct \ncourse to take this year with Mexico is the step we took last year with \nColombia. In other words, we must send a warning--such as granting a \nnational interest waiver.\n  Let me point out, Mexico's problems are in some ways the result of \nsuccesses in interdiction in the transit zone--the Caribbean. Our \nsuccess at pushing the drug traffickers out of the transit zone means \nthat the drug cartels needed a new route--the natural choice is the \noverland route that passes directly through Mexico. This has been the \nkey opportunity for Mexican traffickers to gain control more phases of \ncocaine operations. Reports from the field indicate that Mexican drug \nkingpins actually accept payments in the form of cocaine--1 free kilo \nfrom the Colombian kingpins for every kilo the Mexican traffickers \nsmuggle to the United States.\n  This 2-for-1 sale has had such a severe impact that now more than \ntwo-thirds of all the cocaine in this country now comes through Mexico. \nAnd, it means that Mexican drug cartels are poised to become much \nricher, more powerful and more deadly than ever before. What is worse, \nall this is on top of longstanding Mexican trafficking in heroin, \nmarijuana, methamphetamine, and one of the newest drugs of abuse--\nrohypnol.\n  Let me also point out that Mexico's large geographic size and their \nlimited resources mean that fighting the drug traffic is simply an \noverwhelming task.\n  Last year, for example, we heard that traffickers landed fast-flying \njumbo jets with multi-ton shipments of cocaine in rural Mexico. \nSometimes using dry riverbeds or dirt roads as landing strips, \nobviously ruining these planes--literally abandoning planes worth \nupwards of $10 million . Of course, it's worth it to the drug cartels--\nthese tons of cocaine are worth literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Such tactics seriously test the capacity of Mexico's anti-drug \npersonnel and resources.\n  But with all these problems, I believe Mexico has a President who is \non our side. President Zedillo has taken sincere and important steps on \nthe drug front, including judicial reforms and the appointment of an \nattorney general who is from the opposition party dedicated to weeding \nout corruption. The recent arrest of Juan Abrego--leader of the Mexican \ngulf cartel--was an example of United States-Mexican cooperation.\n  Mexico's demonstrated leadership amidst the growing drug threat is \nthe fundamental reason I do not propose decertification for Mexico. \nFrankly, if we destroy Mexico's moral, political or practical resolve \nagainst the drug traffickers we will only have succeeded in making a \nbad situation very much worse.\n  Still, in rejecting no-strings-attached full certification for \nMexico, we must send a clear and strong warning that the Mexican drug \ntrade must be a priority in our bilateral relations and that we expect \nresults. Nevertheless, continued cooperation between the United States \nand Mexico on drugs is critical with such a close and important \nneighbor. Last year, we sent a warning to the Colombian government--\nthey did not heed this warning--and this year I call for them to pay \nthe price. This year, we must send a warning to the Mexican \ngovernment--and if they do not heed it, they will pay the price.\n  We cannot expect a quick fix to the drug problem in Mexico. But we \nmust be clear about areas where we think a strong, honest government \ncan make a difference--starting with reforms in the institutions and \nlaws that are both governable by their national leadership and \nvulnerable to the narcotics industry.\n  For example, more can and must be done to curb the problem of money \nlaundering in Mexico's financial sector. More can and must be done to \ncontrol precursor chemicals of methamphetamine, as Mexican traffickers \nbecome key players in the manufacturing and distribution of this drug. \nAnd, more can and must be done to work together to control the new \nchallenge posed by the flow of rohypnol across the border.\n  In 1993, I supported the North American Free Trade Agreement--and \nvowed to monitor carefully how the agreement with Mexico was \nfunctioning. And last year, I did not protest when President Clinton \ndecided to lend Mexico money to help alleviate the peso crisis. My call \nto end the full no-strings-attached certification for Mexico means that \nmy continued support for NAFTA will depend in great measure on an \naggressive Mexican response to the growing drug threat. In doing so, I \nam following the same prudent course I followed for Colombia--a clear \nwarning, a chance to comply, with failure to comply resulting in \naction.\n  Mr. President, I understand that both Mexico and Colombia are making \nefforts in counter-narcotics--but the standard for certification is \nfull cooperation. Given the massive scourge of drugs confronting us, it \nis in the interest of the United States to raise the \n\n[[Page S1451]]\nlevel of expectations and attention given to the drug trade by our \nsouthern neighbors. This is what the certification process allows, and \nthis is what our Nation must do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1449-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FUTURE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, shortly after Christmas, the New York Times \nprinted a very one-sided portrayal of the National Guard. In that \narticle, a senior Defense Department official is quoted as saying, \n``There's a lot of the Army National Guard that's just irrelevant to \nour strategy. It's kind of like a welfare program for weekend warriors. \n* * *''\n  Aside from being grossly inappropriate, the statement is simply not \ntrue. Change is inevitable--not just for the Guard but for this \nNation's military structure as a whole. And, while the Guard is \nprepared to face those new challenges, as we go forward, I'll continue \nto be guided by my unequivocal support for the Guard and by the \nknowledge that the Guard is in no way the problem, but rather the key \nto the solution.\n  I can also assure my colleagues that some nameless, faceless \nbureaucrat who equates the Guard--with its stellar performances in the \nPersian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, the Sinai, and Bosnia--to a handout, will \nnot be determining the Guard's fate. Instead, the Guard, sitting down \nas equals with the Army, will determine that future.\n  That's the message I delivered a few weeks ago to the Adjutants \nGeneral Conference, that's the message I delivered when the Governors \nmet here for their annual meeting, and that's the message I bring to \nyou today. Because when representatives of the National Guard sit down \nat the negotiating table with the Army, I intend for both the Governors \nand Congress to be solidly behind them.\n  Our common goal has been to maximize the Guard's role both during \ntimes of war and peace, and to assure the Guard is ready and \naccessible. That goal has not changed. But, we must assure that this \ngoal can adapt to the changing global, economic, technological, and \npolitical environment. I think that the Guard's accomplishments put us \nin an excellent position as we head into this debate, and ask the \nquestion, ``What are the military needs of this country, and how can we \nbest meet them?''\n  We've already proven we can conform to the changing global demands \nbeing placed on our military. In his State of the Union Address, \nPresident Clinton said, ``We can't be everywhere. We can't do \neverything. But where our interests and our values are at stake--and \nwhere we can make a difference--America must lead. We must not be \nisolationists or the world's policeman. But we can be its best \npeacemaker.''\n  The Guard has proven itself 100 percent as a necessary and vital part \nof America's peacekeeping force. Any discussions about the Guard's \nfuture must recognize the interdependability of the regular Army and \nthe Guard, rather than continuing to see them as having separate \nmissions.\n  The Air Force and Air Guard are a perfect example of how we can make \nthis integration work. Serving anywhere around the globe, there is no \ndistinction between these two Air Forces. They fly as one, they work as \none, and they succeed as one.\n  Another issue often mentioned is the changing technology and its \nimpact on our military makeup. Again, the Guard is keeping pace with \nthe changing demands. I'll use this opportunity to brag on Kentucky a \nbit. Our western Kentucky training facility, in conjunction with the \nhigh-technology training available at Fort Knox, puts Kentucky and the \nNational Guard at the forefront of this country's military training.\n  Last year, 16,000 soldiers trained there. But, those numbers \nrepresent just the beginning in a long line of soldiers who will \nreceive the best, state-of-the-art training this country has to offer.\n  The Kentucky Guard is certainly not alone in its ability to adapt to \nnew high-technology opportunities and demands. And, who better than our \ncitizen-soldiers with their added professional skills, to meet the \nhigh-technology challenges of the future? We've seen how these \nadditional skills constantly come into play--a chief of police \nproviding the know-how to set up policing operations in Haiti is just \none example--and we'll see it when the Guard uses its outside expertise \nfor the high-technology military of the future.\n  In the end, Mr. President, our greatest pleasure comes from budget \nrealities and growing fiscal restraints. Last year, we essentially had \nto go in and write the Guard's resource and training needs into the \nbudget. But, our hard work paid off and our priority items--Air \nNational Guard force structure, military technician manning and the \nArmy Guard operating funding--survived.\n  This year, things will get even more difficult. And as General Baca \nconceded a few weeks ago, we'll not only have to confront the issue of \nforce structure, we'll have to accept change. But, the Guard can be the \narchitects of that change.\n  In drawing up the plans for that change, I think we should be guided \nby the Adjutants General Association president, General Lawson's words. \nAs he said last September, ``We may need less military, but we don't \nneed the military less.''\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense Deborah Lee is right on target when \nshe points out that our units cost 25 to 75 percent of active-duty \ncounterparts. ``Making greater use of the reservists makes good sense \nin an area of shrinking budgets. This means that instead of reducing \nthe Reserve components in the same direct proportion as the active \ncomponents, more use should be made of reservists to control peacetime \ncosts and to minimize the risks associated with active drawdown.''\n  And that last point is very important. As the executive officer of a \nCobra helicopter squadron put it, ``If you dissolve units like this, it \nwould take years to rebuild that ability if you ever needed it again.''\n  Major General Philbin put it another way: ``Since few conflicts \nevolve as anticipated, where would those reserve component forces be \nfound if the Guard combat divisions are deactivated? The Army Reserve? \nNot structured for combat. Another draft? No time, since the Pentagon \npundits are forecasting, however unrealistically, conflicts that arise \nlike lightning bolts and are successfully concluded in a flash.''\n  When we go to the table to hammer out a new covenant with the Army, \nwe must bring to the table our willingness to see changes to force \nstructure. But we shouldn't leave behind our commitment to a relevant, \nviable and ready Guard that maintains a balanced force of combat, \ncombat support, and combat service support, along with an equal level \nof command support to maintain balance across the Nation. These items \nwill not be negotiable.\n  We're at a crucial juncture that will have long-felt repercussions \nfor the National Guard and the Nation as a whole. But I hope we've \nreached that juncture, with Congress behind the Guard, with the \nGovernors behind the Guard, and most important, with the American \npeople behind the Guard.\n  That's because the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard find their \nroots in the history of this country, but equally important, in the \ncommunities of this country.\n  If you look behind the words in the Guard's theme--``Capable, \nAccessible, Affordable''--what you'll find are average folks who've \nstruggled through some of the worst disasters imaginable.\n  They understand that taken together, these three words define with \nsimplicity and clarity, the important dual Federal-State function of \nour National Guard, the decisive role they've played in our Nation's \nhistory, and will play in our Nation's future.\n  And taken together, they decree what the Guard has been, what they \ncan be, and what they will be.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to assure \nthat the Guard continues to play a major role in this Nation's military \nstructure and mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1451-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1451-S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHARACTER COUNTS RESOLUTION, SENATE RESOLUTION 226\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Domenici, in submitting Senate Resolution 226. This \nresolution which, I strongly support, would designate the week of \nOctober 13-19, 1996, as the third annual National Character Counts \nWeek.\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\n  For the past 2 years, I have joined with Senator Domenici and several \nof our other colleagues in introducing the previous character counts \nbills, and I have been very pleased with its reception by our \ncolleagues and our constituents.\n  We have come together again this year to draw attention to the fact \nthat our Nation is experiencing a crisis of values. This crisis is \nreflected in the rising tide of violence that kills children in the \ncross-fire on school yards and in front of their houses, and in the \nincreasing number of children who kill each other.\n  This crisis goes beyond crime. It is reflected, also, in the recent \nsurvey of youngsters conducted by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nThese ordinary youngsters may never be involved in crime, drug abuse, \nor teenage pregnancy, but they still acknowledge disturbing ethical \nlapses;\n  Two out of five high school age boys and one in four girls have \nstolen something from a store.\n  Nearly two-thirds of all high school students and one-third of all \ncollege students had cheated on an exam.\n  More than one-third of males and one-fifth of females aged 19-24 said \nthey would lie to get a job and nearly one-fifth of college students \nhad already done so in the last year. Twenty-one percent said they \nwould falsify a report to keep a job.\n  As a character in John Steinbeck's novel ``Of Mice and Men'' \ncomplained, ``Nothing is wrong anymore.'' Unfortunately, a lot is wrong \nand our society seems reluctant to admit the problem, and to teach \nagain and live by the values of right and wrong.\n  This is the core message of character counts--that there are core \nvalues that our society agrees on and that should guide our \ndecisionmaking. These values, as set out in the resolution, are \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship. These values are and have been supported by an extremely \nbroad and diverse coalition of people, including former Secretary of \nEducation Bill Bennett, the late Barbara Jordan, actor-producer Tom \nSelleck, and Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman. \nAmong our colleagues, Senators with such diverse political viewpoints \nas Senator Helms and Senator Boxer have supported similar efforts in \nthe past. I come before the Senate today on behalf of this group to \nurge continued attention to this important problem.\n  In recent months, I have joined with my colleague Senator Lieberman \nand Secretary Bennett in an effort to raise awareness of the connection \nbetween what people see in the media and the way they live their lives. \nOne of the points we have tried to stress to media producers and the \nadvertisers who support these shows is that they have a responsibility \nto consider the societal context in which their programs play. It is \ndifficult for our children to see trash and violence on television \nevery day and avoid falling into those habits in their own lives. By \nthe same token, we as citizens have a responsibility to provide an \nexample of good character for our children to follow. If they see us \nupholding the pillars of good character in our everyday lives, it \nbecomes easier for them to live that way.\n  This is a resolution considered by members of the Senate and House in \nWashington, DC. But it is the parents, teachers, coaches, ministers, \nbig brothers and sisters in local communities who will lead the fight \nfor values in our Nation. As a result of the efforts by the Character \nCounts Coalition, people in all areas of the country are more aware of \nthe problems we face, and have begun to incorporate these values into \ntheir everyday lives and those of their children. Senator Domenici has \noutlined some of these efforts. We resubmit this resolution to remind \nthe Senate that the work on this issue is far from over, and again to \nenlist our colleagues' support in reenforcing that these values are \nfundamental to our society. I am proud to join my colleagues, \nespecially Senator Domenici, in this effort once again, and I urge the \nSenate to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1451-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE BERQUISTS FOR CELEBRATING THEIR 60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

The effects of \ndivorce on families and particularly the children of broken families \nare devastating. In such an era, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``til death \nus do part'' seriously and have successfully demonstrated the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity, to build a strong family. \nThese qualities make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor the Reverend and \nMrs. Ernie Berquist of Springfield, MO, who on February 28 celebrated \ntheir 60th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Berquists commitment \nto the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted \nand recognized. I wish them and their family all the best as they \ncelebrate this substantial marker on their journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1452-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1452-S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNITED NATIONS SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over \nongoing discussions in New York between Iraqi representatives and the \nUnited Nations Secretariat over possible implementation of U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 986. Should Resolution 986 be accepted by \nIraq, $2 billion of Iraqi oil would be permitted to be sold on the \ninternational market over a 6-month period. A loosening of the economic \nembargo under Resolution 986 would occur without any linkage to the \ncessation of Iraq's drive to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The \nprospect of even a partial lifting of the Iraqi embargo at this time \nraises a number of concerns and may serve to remind Members of the \ncontinuing duplicity and intransigence of the Iraqi regime, and the \ncosts the United States has borne as a result. Moreover, the fact that \nthe recent discussions over implementing Resolution 986 have occurred \nin a virtual information black-out, without the input or oversight of \nthe American U.N. Representative, adds additional concern.\n  If accepted by Iraq, Resolution 986 would permit Iraq to sell oil in \norder to finance humanitarian goods and address ``the serious \nnutritional and health situation of the Iraqi people.'' Resolution 986 \nwould not, however, require Iraq to cease its efforts to acquire \nweapons of mass destruction--the foremost reason sanctions were imposed \nagainst Iraq in the first place. While reducing the suffering of the \nIraqi people is certainly a laudable goal, the cause of this suffering \nrests squarely and completely on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein. His \ncontinued refusal to accept relevant U.N. Security Council Resolutions \nregarding cessation of the production of weapons of mass destruction \nand his continued harsh internal repression against the people of Iraq \nare the causes of the economic embargo and the deprivations suffered by \nthe Iraqi people, as well as others in the region.\n  Despite apparent cooperation with U.N. monitors in some areas, \nevidence of Iraqi's ongoing effort to build weapons of mass destruction \nwas obtained as recently as 2 months ago. On December 8, 1995, Jordan \nsaid it intercepted a shipment of missile guidance components bound for \nIraq. A few weeks later, on December 26, Jordan intercepted dangerous \nchemicals on their way to Iraq. On December 15, 1995, the United \nNations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) reported that Iraq \ncontinues to conceal and provide false information on its efforts to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. Mr. President, these incidents \nalone, even ignoring past acts of terrorism and weapons procurement, \nshould be sufficient cause to continue fully the economic embargo \nagainst Iraq. Even a temporary allowance for ``humanitarian'' oil sales \nwill decrease the pressure on Iraq to comply with U.N. requirements to \ndismantle its facilities for the production of weapons of mass \ndestruction and could free-up other Iraqi resources for its weapons \nprograms.\n  Beyond ceasing production of chemical, biological and nuclear \nweapons, Saddam Hussein is also required to end \n\n[[Page S1453]]\nthe repression of Iraqi citizens under the terms of U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 688 enacted on April 1, 1991. The most recently \navailable Human Rights Report issued by our State Department calls the \nhuman rights situation in Iraq ``abysmal''. Just a short excerpt from \nthat report makes the case that conditions of Resolution 688 have not \nbeen met:\n\n       Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive \n     one-party apparatus dominated by Saddam Hussein. . . . \n     Systematic violations continued in all categories, including \n     mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of \n     torture, extreme repression of ethnic groups, disappearances, \n     denial of due process, and arbitrary detention.\n\n  Mr. President, I certainly do not wish more hardships on the Iraqi \npeople beyond those they have already suffered at the hands of Saddam \nHussein. But softening the pressure against his regime, while so many \nexamples of outrageous and dangerous activities continue to confront \nus, makes no sense. Certainly reducing the pressure on Iraq now will \nnot hasten the day when the Iraqi people can live free of the \ndepredations imposed on them by Saddam Hussein.\n  Even more alarming than a temporary easing of sanctions, however, are \nsuggestions that UNSCOM may recommend lifting the Iraqi embargo \nentirely sometime this year. How such a recommendation could be \ncontemplated so shortly after UNSCOM itself reported that Iraq \ncontinues to lie and hide information about its weapons program is \nbaffling. Further increasing America's dependence on imported oil from \na country with Iraq's openly hostile objectives is not in our national \ninterest.\n  On that point, I should also mention that on March 27 of last year, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on the subject of \nAmerican dependence on foreign oil. Despite repeated findings over many \nyears that the United States' national security is harmed by a \ndependence on foreign oil, this dependence continues to increase. I \ncommend Chairman Helms for having held this hearing and recommend that \ncolleagues concerned about our national dependence on foreign oil \nreview the hearing record.\n  In any case Mr. President, either a temporary easing of sanctions \nunder Resolution 986, or a permanent lifting of sanctions pursuant to \nearlier Security Council Resolutions, should be accompanied by a full \nreporting to Congress of the effect on U.S. national security of any \nIraqi oil sales, the steps being taken to ensure adequate protection of \nhuman rights in Iraq, and the international safeguards in place to \nprotect against future weapons development by Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1452-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CUBAN SHOOT DOWN OF MIAMI-BASED CUBAN EXILE PLANES AND THE CUBAN \n   LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY--LIBERTAD--ACT CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to H.R. 927, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic \nSolidarity Act--Libertad. As an original cosponsor of this legislation \nin the Senate, I have long believed that the United States should \nstrengthen international sanctions against the dictatorial regime of \nFidel Castro. I regret that it has taken the most recent outrageous \nbehavior of the Cuban Government to convince the President of this.\n  Fidel Castro was, is, and always will be a despot and a murderer who \nhas no regard for human life and no respect for international law. The \ndowning of 2 private planes and the killing of 4 civilians by Cuban \nmilitary fighter aircraft reiterates this fact. It is imperative that \nMr. Castro realize that the United States will not tolerate his \ntyranny. The passage of the Libertad Act will send this vitally \nimportant message.\n  This legislation strengthens international sanctions against Cuba, \nprovides support for a free and independent Cuba, protects the \ninterests of American citizens whose property was confiscated by the \nCastro regime, and denies visas to individuals who traffic in \nconfiscated property.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this vital \nlegislation. President Clinton has agreed to sign this act into law. It \nis time that we send a strong bipartisan message to Fidel Castro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1453-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO BRIG. GEN. RICHARD L. REYNARD, STAFF DIRECTOR, SENATE ARMED \n                           SERVICES COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions of Brig. Gen. Richard L. Reynard, the staff director of \nthe Committee on Armed Services. Dick Reynard, who is well known to \nmany in the Senate and in the Department of Defense, is leaving the \ncommittee to return to the private sector.\n  General Reynard joined the committee as the minority staff director \nin April 1993. He quickly earned the reputation as a capable leader to \nwhom the Members and staff could turn for clear advice and counsel. His \nmore than 34 years of leadership and management experience in \ngovernment and the private sector served him and the committee very \nwell.\n  General Reynard was commissioned in the Army as an artillery officer \nfollowing graduation from the U.S. Military Academy in June 1958. He \nserved in a wide variety of staff and command assignments at every \nlevel of the Army, including a combat tour in Vietnam. General Reynard \ntaught at the U.S. Military Academy where he helped shape a new \ngeneration of leaders for our Nation. Many Members of the Senate \nremember Dick Reynard from his assignment as the Army's liaison officer \nto the Senate where he ensured that we understood the Army's priorities \nand traveled with us as we performed our duties around the world.\n  Following retirement from the Army, General Reynard worked in the \nprivate sector as an officer in a small corporation and as a government \nrelations specialist. When I asked General Reynard to be my staff \ndirector, he agreed to return to Government service even though it \nmeant personal and financial sacrifice. During his first year in the \ncommittee, we addressed such important issues as the ``Don't Ask, Don't \nTell'' policy concerning the service of gays in the military, force \nreduction policies and benefits, assignment of women in the military, \nand Secretary Aspin's reorganization of the Department of Defense. His \nanalysis, advice, and ability to protect the minority points of view \nresulted in important legislation which enjoyed bipartisan support. \nFollowing the elections in November 1994, General Reynard administered \nthe transition of the Armed Services Committee from a Republican \nminority to the majority. Under his direction, the Armed Services \nCommittee staff was in place and ready to support the committee members \nwhen the Congress convened in January 1995.\n  During his 3 years with the committee, General Reynard earned the \nreputation as a reliable, steady, and fair person to whom Members and \nstaff could turn when they sought advice or insight on National \nSecurity issues. He was a tireless, dedicated, and trusted aide to me. \nI know many in this Chamber join me in expressing our appreciation to \nGeneral Reynard and in wishing him and his wife Bibs well in his new \nendeavors.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1453-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1453-S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNITED STATES-GERMAN OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am delighted to inform the Senate that \ntoday the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed an \nopen skies agreement which will liberalize air service between our two \ncountries. I am also pleased to advise my colleagues that the United \nStates and Germany initialed a Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement \n[BASA] which will greatly enhance safety coordination between the \nFederal Aviation Administration [FAA] and its German counterpart \nagency.\n  The United States-German open skies agreement is a great economic \nvictory for both countries and a very welcome development for \nconsumers. In fact, I regard this agreement to be a trade accord of \ntruly historic proportions for both countries. As always is the case \nwhere market forces are unleashed, consumers flying between the \n\n[[Page S1454]]\nUnited States and Germany, as well as passengers connecting in either \ncountry for travel to a third country, will benefit enormously. These \nconsumer benefits will include increased choice and competitive air \nfares.\n  Mr. President, the United States-German open skies agreement is the \nproduct of bold and visionary leadership by two men. I refer to our \nSecretary of Transportation Federico Pena and German Transport Minister \nMatthias Wissmann. Secretary Pena had the vision to identify this \nopportunity and to recognize that competition will be our best ally in \nopening restrictive European air service markets such as those in the \nUnited Kingdom and France. Minister Wissmann had the vision to \nrecognize the economic benefits of an open skies agreement with the \nUnited States are a two-way street.\n  In addition, I want to praise the great work of four men who labored \nfor months to negotiate the fine points of this agreement. For the \nUnited States, I commend the outstanding work of Mark Gerchick, DOT's \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and \nJohn Bylerly, special negotiator for Transportation Affairs at the \nState Department. For the Germans, I commend the outstanding work of \nDr. Jurgen Pfohler, Deputy chief of staff to Minister Wissmann, and \nDieter Bartkowski, Director of the Air Transport Section at the German \nMinistry of Transport. The United States-German open skies agreement is \na fitting tribute to their efforts and exemplary public service.\n  What does the United States-German open skies agreement do in terms \nof putting aviation relations between our two countries on the firm \nfoundation of market principles? It will allow airlines of both \ncountries to operate to any points in either country, as well as third \ncountries, without limitation. It also liberalizes pricing, charter \nservices and further liberalizes the open skies cargo regime already in \nplace. In short, it allows market demand, not the heavy hands of \ngovernments, to decide air service between the United States and \nGermany.\n  How will this open skies agreement benefit all U.S. carriers? It will \ncreate tremendous new air service opportunities between the United \nStates and Germany in which all U.S. carriers can partake. Also, German \nairports will provide well-situated gateway opportunities for our \ncarriers to serve points throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, \nand the booming Asia-Pacific market. These gateway opportunities offer \nthe double benefit of serving as a means of breaking the bottleneck at \nLondon's Heathrow Airport and offering a backdoor to the booming Asia-\nPacific market.\n  All U.S. carriers also will receive indirect benefits from the United \nStates-German open skies agreement. I predict the United States-German \nopen skies agreement will be an important catalyst for further \nliberalization of air service opportunities throughout Europe. In fact, \nI believe this agreement will serve as a template for such \nliberalization. Hopefully, the United States-German open skies \nagreement, in combination with open skies agreements we already have \nwith 11 other European nations, will force the United Kingdom and \nFrance to come to the alter of air service competition.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that today is a very \nimportant day in U.S. international aviation policy and U.S. trade \npolicy. It also is an important day in United States-German economic \nand political relations. Perhaps most important, it is a great day for \nconsumers in both countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1453-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES-GERMAN BILATERAL AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this morning the Department of \nTransportation announced an open skies agreement with Germany. Access \nto Germany, as Secretary Pena has recognized, is critical. I want to \nrecognize the effort by the administration and the Secretary is \naggressively pursuing an open skies agreement with Germany.\n  The agreement today does three things. First, it will enable our \ncarriers to satisfy consumer demand this summer. Second, the Secretary \nand the German Government also will sign an important safety agreement. \nFinally, the two countries have initialed an open skies agreement.\n  The open skies agreement is the 10th with a European country and is a \nbig step forward in our efforts to liberalize aviation agreements in \nEurope. Germany is the second largest European market. I caution my \ncolleagues not to get over-confident--countries like the United Kingdom \nare not likely to jump on the bandwagon quickly. Each country and \nmarket differs. We also must focus on Japan, which I will discuss at a \nlater date.\n  This open skies agreement is a major step forward. With all of the \npraise forthcoming today for the administration and Secretary Pena, I \nwant to raise one issue. The effective date of the open skies agreement \nis triggered by favorable treatment of an application for antitrust \nimmunity by Lufthansa and United. I have been assured that the request \nwill be treated separately, and that the two matters are not linked. I \nknow the Departments of Justice and Transportation will review the \nrequest thoroughly. I would have preferred that consumer benefits of an \nopen skies agreement not be held hostage to a subsequent and \nindependent review of the antitrust issue. This open skies agreement, \nas the Secretary recognizes, is an important one. I hope that this \nagreement, and others in the future, are able to be implemented without \nextraneous issues encumbering the process. I am certain Secretary Pena \nshares my views and I congratulate him on this breakthrough today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1454-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:06 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1561) to \nconsolidate the foreign affairs agencies of the United States; to \nauthorize appropriations for the Department of State and related \nagencies for fiscal years 1996 and 1997; to responsibly reduce the \nauthorizations of appropriations for United States foreign assistance \nprograms for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and for other purposes, and \nagrees to the conference asked by the Senate on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses thereon; and appoints Mr. Gilman, Mr. Goodling, Mr. \nHyde, Mr. Roth, Mr. Bereuter, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr. Burton of \nIndiana, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Gejdenson, Mr. Lantos, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Berman, and Mr. Ackerman as the managers of the \nconference on the part of the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1454-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on February 28, 1996, by the President pro tempore \n[Mr. Thurmond]:\n\n       H.R. 2196.

A bill to provide funding for community-oriented policing, \nto reduce funding for the Department of Defense, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     The Safer Streets Act of 1996\n\nMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Safer \nStreets Act of 1996 that will address the anxiety of many citizens who \nbelieve that violence and crime are eating away at the social fabric of \ntheir communities. The Safer Streets Act would help to restore family \nsecurity by funding an additional 100,000 police officers, above and \nbeyond the 100,000 initially funded by the crime bill, to take their \nplace on the streets of communities across our Nation.\n\n  Mr. President, to date, Massachusetts has received $53 million in \nfunding from the 1994 crime bill for 1,020 new police officers, \nincluding the redeployment of 407 officers to the street from desk \nduty. Our communities must be able to respond to the threat of violent \ncrime with an effort we know is already working in towns and cities \nacross Massachusetts. I have listened to police officers and law \nenforcement officials, and citizens across my State, and they tell me \nthat there is a real need for an even greater police presence on the \nstreets of Massachusetts. Our first effort--putting 100,000 cops on the \nstreets of our Nation--is already working to fight crime. There is no \nbetter deterrent to crime in our communities than a cop on the beat, so \nit is vital that we help communities obtain the police they need to \nkeep neighborhoods safe. The Safer Streets Act will fund approximately \n100,000 additional community police positions across the Nation--\neffectively doubling the number it was possible to provide from the \nfirst year's funding. It does this by cutting $6.5 billion from the \n1996 fiscal year Defense Department appropriation and transferring it \nto the Justice Department to fund community policing efforts with \ngrants that will be awarded to communities using the same formula as \nthe first 100,000 cops on the street initiative. This is money the \nDefense Department did not ask for, and it is money we desperately need \nfor more cops on the street.\n  Americans are understandably anxious about their economic and \npersonal security. How we as a Congress respond to that anxiety--the \nkinds of partnerships we form between government and communities to \naddress the concerns of families struggling to keep up and do well--\nwill determine this Nation's future. That's why a strong, affordable \neffort to expand community policing, that has been proven to be \nextraordinarily successful, is not only our responsibility but is our \nobligation to the people we represent.\n  Mr. President, If we know that community policing works; and we know \n\n[[Page S1456]]\n  that our constituents are anxious about their personal security, then \nit would be irresponsible not to act. This legislation addresses the \npersonal frustrations of families who see a level of crime and violence \non their streets and in their neighborhoods that is unacceptable. \nPeople want their government to respond with what we know can make a \ndifference. Community policing with 200,000 more police on the streets \nwill make a difference.\n  Mr. President, passing the Safer Streets Act is our duty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record,\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFER OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-61), \n     the Secretary of Defense shall transfer $6,500,000,000 of \n     unobligated funds appropriated under such Act for fiscal year \n     1996 to the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund established \n     under section 310001 of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14211).\n       (b) Allocation.--The Secretary of Defense shall allocate \n     the amount transferred under subsection (a) from among any \n     programs in the Department of Defense for which funding was \n     not requested in the 1996 budget request of the President.\n\n     SEC. 2. FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY-ORIENTED POLICING PROGRAMS.\n\n       The amount transferred under section 1 shall only be used \n     for community-oriented policing programs under section \n     1701(b) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n     1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd(b)).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1581. A bill to reinstate the license for, and extend the deadline \nunder the Federal Power Act applicable to the construction of, a \nhydroelectric project in Ohio, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   hydroelectric project legislation\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, S. 1581 would reinstate the license \nfor a 49.5 megawatt hydroelectric project in Ohio, which was originally \nissued on September 27, 1989, and extend the deadline for construction \nuntil September 24, 1999. The licensee for this project is the City of \nOrrville. The original license was stayed and held in abeyance until \n1992, due to administrative and judicial challenges to FERC's decision \nto issue licenses for 16 projects in the upper Ohio River basin. In \n1992, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld FERC's licensing \ndecision. Due to the delay caused by the litigation and difficulty \nsecuring adequate funding for the project, the city surrendered its \nlicense in June, 1993 and sought other sources of power to meet its \nimmediate energy needs. This bill would reinstate the license and \nextend the construction deadline for this project. In a letter dated \nFebruary 9, 1996, FERC chair, Elizabeth Moler, stated that she did not \nhave any specific objections to legislation reinstating the license and \nextending the construction deadline for Pike Island Project No. \n3218.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1582. A bill to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and \nthe Missing Children's Assistance Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      Reauthorization Legislation\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator \nSimon to introduce a bill reauthorizing a number of worthwhile programs \nthat serve young people and their families in Vermont and across the \ncountry. In particular, I am referring to the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act, the Missing Children's Assistance Act, and related programs, \nwhose authorizations are expiring later this year.\n  A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting with Frances Dodd, \ncoordinator of the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth \nprograms. The Vermont Coalition is a community-based network comprised \nof eight member programs that provide crisis response, emergency \nshelter, counseling, and other services to troubled youth throughout \nnine Vermont counties. This meeting also included a number of young \nVermonters who knew first-hand the value of providing shelters and \nsupport for young people facing difficult times. I came away from that \nmeeting more convinced than ever that the Federal assistance provided \nby the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act continues to make an important \ndifference in the lives of our young people and to play a critical role \nin reuniting families.\n  Those who provide services pursuant to these programs and those who \nare the beneficiaries of those services are far too important to be \nleft hanging. In a Congress in which the budget and appropriations \nprocesses have given way to short-lived spending authority, they all \ndeserve the reassurance of reauthorization and a commitment to funding. \nOnly then will our State youth service bureaus and other shelter and \nservice providers be able to plan, design and implement the local \nprograms necessary to make the goals of the act a reality.\n  In 1974, Congress passed the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as title \nIII of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The \ninclusion of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in this legislation \nrecognized that young people who were effectively homeless were in need \nof shelter, guidance and supervision, rather than punishment, and \nshould be united with their families wherever possible.\n  Since 1974, the programs that make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct have evolved to meet the complex problems faced by our young \npeople, their families and our communities. Over the last decade, as a \nnation, we have witnessed an increase in teen pregnancy rates, drug and \nalcohol abuse beginning as early as grade school, child physical and \nsexual abuse, and a soaring youth suicide rate.\n  Today, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act encompasses basic center \ngrants, the transitional living program and drug abuse prevention \nprogram. These programs are vital to meeting the needs of troubled \nyouth in rural Vermont and across the Nation. While the actual numbers \nof young people who run away or become homeless in rural areas might be \nsmall in comparison to that of large cities, emergency shelter and \nother services must still be accessible. It is an unfortunate reality \nthat urban and rural youth can experience family conflict, and physical \nor sexual abuse.\n  The majority of these programs in my home State are coordinated \nthrough the Vermont Coalition. Young people find these services through \nfriends and family as well as through referrals by police and our court \ndiversion program.\n  Our Vermont programs and services have been very successful. Last \nyear, for example 87 percent of runaways returned home or to a positive \nliving situation after receiving services. Only 7 percent of those \nserved in 1995 had new State social service cases open and less than 1 \npercent ended up in police custody. Since 1993, there has been a 42-\npercent increase in the total number of youths served by Vermont's \nprograms. In 1995, these programs reached over 700 young people and \nover 1000 family members.\n  Two years ago, the Vermont Coalition was awarded a Federal rural \ndemonstration grant to assist counties that lack adequate services for \nrunaway youth in developing responsive programs. Through this grant, \nthe Vermont Coalition was able to identify underserved counties, draw \nupon the expertise of its many programs and help develop programs for \nthree additional Vermont counties in which services are now emerging.\n  Since 1989, the transitional living program, which was developed by \nmy colleague, Senator Simon, has filled a gap in the needs of older \nyouth to help them make the transition to independent living \nsituations. I know how hard Senator Simon worked on creating this \nimportant program and I look forward to working with him now to \ncontinue it.\n  The programs we seek to reauthorize include those directed at young \npeople who have had some kind of alcohol or other drug problem. The \nisolation in rural areas can lead to serious substance abuse problems. \nIt is difficult to reach young people in rural areas and it is \ndifficult for them to find the services they need. In Vermont, these \ndrug abuse prevention programs provide essential outreach services. \n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\n  Providing these types of community-based services to runaway and \nhomeless youth seems to me to make good economic sense. We need only \ncompare the cost of these programs to other services often needed by \nyoung people experiencing serious family conflict and associated social \ndifficulties. Neglecting the needs of runaway and homeless youth and \ntheir families would have staggering economic implications. In Vermont, \nthe average cost of services to youth by the Vermont Coalition of \nRunaway Youth Programs is $1,895. Compare this with $18,392, the \naverage annual cost of maintaining someone in State custody through the \nsocial services department; the $50,000 it would cost to place someone \nin a substance abuse treatment facility; or the $60,000 a year it costs \nto incarcerate someone.\n  I receive letters from parents whose families have been kept together \nwith the assistance of runaway and homeless programs as well as from \nyoung people who have been helped by these services. In one, a mother \nwrote of a program in the Northeast Kingdom:\n\n       My teenage daughter ran away this spring. I feel fortunate \n     to have been able to call upon the [Northeast Kingdom Youth \n     Services] programs. I credit the quick, compassionate \n     response by [the] on-call worker, with keeping my daughter \n     out of state custody. Careful, immediate intervention was the \n     key in helping my daughter feel comfortable about remaining \n     at home. [Your] ongoing efforts to mediate issues which \n     continue to arise have kept our family together.\n\n  These service providers are being challenged as never before with an \nincreasingly complex set of problems affecting young people and their \nfamilies. Now is not the time to abandon them. There is consensus among \nservices providers that young people seeking services and their \nfamilies are increasingly more troubled--as evidenced by reports of \nfamily violence, substance abuse and the effects of an array of \neconomic pressures. These services may well be the key to breaking \nthrough the isolation of street youth, their mistrust of adults, and \ntheir reluctance to get involved with public or private providers.\n  Among the other critical programs reauthorized by our bill is the \nMissing Children's Assistance Act. Since its initial passage in 1984, \nwe have made real progress on the tragedy of missing and exploited \nchildren. A national coordinated effort has proved essential in facing \nthese problems. I understand that in Vermont alone there have been more \nthan 30 cases of missing children resolved. Those children and their \nfamilies know the value of this program.\n  This month, Senator Thompson has begun a series of hearings before \nthe subcommittee on Youth Violence. I look forward to working with him \nand with Senator Biden, the ranking member on the subcommittee and on \nthe Judiciary Committee, and our other colleagues in connection with \nthese matters. In addition to the critical role that Senator Biden is \nplaying, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kohl have long been supporters of \nthe juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs. Senator \nSpecter has been actively involved in these matters for more than a \ndecade, formerly chaired the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee and \ncurrently chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nmany of these programs.\n  In light of the ongoing hearings and in deference to our colleagues \nwho lead the subcommittee, we have chosen not to include the title II \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act programs in this \nreauthorization bill at this time. I understand that our colleagues, \nthe administration, State program officers, the Ad Hoc Coalition on \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, and other groups are all \ncurrently developing proposals for the reauthorization of the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act. We look forward to \nconsideration of those proposals and to working together to continue \nthe bipartisan traditional that has always attended this program. While \nwe all need to work together to address the rise in serious, violent \njuvenile crime and the need to enhance public safety, I believe that we \ncan do so while still preserving the essential elements of the act.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act has helped foster \nstrides nationwide through a series of funded mandates. Throughout the \nUnited States, the number of violations of the deinstitutionalization \nmandate for status offenders and non-offenders has been reduced from \n171,581 to 3,146 among the participating States. In 1994, 55 States and \nterritories participated in the program and only three received reduced \nfunding because of compliance issues.\n  Over a decade ago, the Vermont General Assembly established the \nChildren and Family Council for Prevention programs, which is the \ndesignated State advisory group that monitors and distributes our funds \nunder the title II block grant. The Vermont co-chairs of the council, \nKen Schatz and Pamela Smith, and its other members encourage community \ninvolvement in the development of effective prevention programs that \npromote the health and increase the self-reliance of Vermont children \nand families. I look forward to working closely with the council on the \nreauthorization of the title II programs.\n  In June 1993, the council used Federal assistance under the act to \nsponsor a youthful offender study project. The ensuing report \nrecommended the development of a youthful offender program, which won \nthe endorsement of the Vermont Department of Corrections and the \nDepartment of Social Rehabilitative Services. The council is now \nfunding projects with Federal assistance to implement this \nrecommendation.\n  In 1994, the council developed Vermont's 3-year plan for the formula \ngrant monies by identifying State priority areas. The largest portion \nof juvenile justice and delinquency prevention funding is a State block \ngrant program, not a one-size-fits-all solution. In Vermont, the \npriorities are violent family functioning, the lack of treatment \nresources for violent youthful offenders and the need to improve the \njuvenile justice system. Over the last decade, Vermont has seen a \nsubstantial increase in reported violence against women and children. \nThe council's plan allowed it to target this problem. The decrease in \nsubstantial cases of child abuse last year signals that the State's \nprevention efforts are making a difference.\n  Using its Federal assistance, Vermont has made great progress in \nimproving the juvenile justice system in recent years. These funds \nenable Vermont to replicate initiatives that are working across the \nState. Typically, the Federal funding is leveraged with State and \nprivate funds to support these efforts. Vermont's formula grant has \ngone to support such projects as community-based treatment, court \ndiversion, diversity training, pilot programs on juvenile restitution, \nits Families First program, its Caring Communities program and teen \ncenters where young people can gather in a safe, supervised environment \nfor socializing, group activities and educational events. One Vermont \nyouthful offender noted:\n\n       The Diversion program works. The board's faith in me gave \n     me something to live up to and gave me confidence. They \n     trusted me at a time when almost all the trust I ever had was \n     gone, and they gave me one extra chance and that one extra \n     bit of trust that I needed.\n\n  Through the programs which make up the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act, the Federal response to the problems of our \nyouth has become comprehensive and collaborative. The Federal technical \nand financial resources have enabled States to undertake a number of \nsystem-wide improvements. The bill that we are introducing today \nrecognizes the importance of a nonpunitive system for vulnerable youth.\n  In my view, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the other Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act programs are working in Vermont \nand ought to be continued. Given the short time left in this Congress, \nI believe that changes proposed to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act will have to be those around which a consensus can be \nobtained very quickly if we are to meet our goal of reauthorizing it \nbefore the end of the year.\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is the year that the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act needs to be reauthorized. This \nimportant act has vastly improved our handling of juveniles in our \ncriminal justice system, and has provided funding for services to some \nof the most vulnerable young people in our society. \n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\n  Today, Senator Leahy and I are introducing a bill to reauthorize the \nrunaway and homeless youth sections of the act. Although I feel \nstrongly that the entire Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct should be reauthorized, I understand that Senators Thompson and \nBiden, chairman and ranking member of the Juvenile Violence \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, are holding hearings on \nthe rest of the act. I applaud their work to examine these issues and \nconstruct a reauthorization plan, however I want to introduce this bill \nbecause the runaway and homeless youth parts of the act are \nparticularly important to me.\n  In 1988, I held a hearing in Chicago on the problem of homeless \nyouth. As a result of that hearing, I sponsored the Transitional Living \nProgram. The Transitional Living Program was designed to fill a gap in \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. The basic centers part of the act \nprovides grants to community centers which provide temporary shelter \nand services to runaways while they try to reunite with their families \nor are placed in a foster home. Unfortunately, as I discovered during \nmy 1988 hearing, many young people never return to their family homes, \nlargely because of neglect and abuse, but are too old to be placed with \na foster family. These young people were not being adequately served by \nthe temporary shelters which help so many others.\n  The Transitional Living Program awards new-start grants to community \nprojects which provide longer-term residential services to older \nhomeless youth ages 16 through 21. Nonprofit, community-based grantees \nteach these young people independent living skills to prepare them to \nlive on their own. Young people live in host family homes, group \nhouses, or in supervised apartments, and receive guidance from \ncounselors to help them make the transition to independent living. The \ngoal of this program is to help these young people live productive, \nself-sufficient lives, and prevent future dependency on social \nservices. The total annual appropriations for this program has been \napproximately $12 million. That investment has assisted countless young \npeople who otherwise would have found themselves on the street with no \none to provide the support and resources they need to live \nindependently.\n  In 1988, a third component of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act was \nalso added. This Drug Abuse Prevention Program [DAPP] for runaway and \nhomeless youth was initiated because of the recognition that drugs play \na large role in these young people's lives. Their difficult living \nsituations make them particularly vulnerable to the dangers of drug \nuse, and such drug use severely hinders efforts to improve their \ncircumstances. As anyone working in this field will testify, drug \nprevention and treatment are an essential element of any efforts to \nhelp runaway and homeless youth. Unfortunately, this DAPP component of \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, along with a companion DAPP program \nfor youth gangs, was not reauthorized last year and did not receive any \nfunding this year. This bill recognizes the destructive role of illicit \ndrug use in these young people's lives, and reauthorizes both of these \nessential programs.\n  Finally, this bill reauthorizes the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children. This center, created in 1984, provides important \nservices to the thousands of families who face the devastating, \nmysterious loss of a child. The center operates a toll-free number to \ngather tips about missing children, coordinates Federal, State and \nlocal efforts to locate missing children, serves as a clearinghouse of \ninformation on successful service and research efforts, provides grants \nto local agencies for research and service efforts and conducts a \nregular survey on the number of missing children. This center has \nhelped us as a nation understand the scope of this problem and has \nhelped families locate missing children. Unfortunately, the problem of \nmissing children continues, as President Clinton recognized on January \n19, 1996, when he signed an order instructing Federal agencies to post \nmissing-children posters in Federal buildings. The National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children performs an essential function and \nshould be reauthorized.\n  Mr. President, this bill should not be considered a substitute for a \ncomplete reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act. I support the efforts of Senators Thompson, and Biden, \nand look forward to working with them to reauthorize the act. However, \nSenator Leahy and I agree that the runaway and homeless youth part of \nthe act provide essential support for a most vulnerable group of young \npeople. Our bill is meant to highlight our support for these programs \nand our belief that they should be reauthorized.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 1583. A bill to establish the Lower Eastern Shore American \nHeritage Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n       the lower eastern shore american heritage area act of 1996\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to designate the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland as a \nNational Heritage Area. The purpose of this legislation is to help \nconserve and promote the resources of the region's communities and \ntheir unique contribution to the fabric of the Nation, while \nrevitalizing its local economies and improving its overall quality of \nlife.\n  The Lower Eastern Shore is a very special place. It contains an \nunrivaled combination of resources and history which represent a unique \nand integral piece of the diverse tapestry of our national character. \nSituated on the Delmarva Peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the \nChesapeake Bay--the largest and most productive estuary in North \nAmerica, its nationally significant natural resources also include the \nCoastal Bays--Chincoteague, Sinepuxent, Isle of Wright, and Assawoman; \nthe Wild and Scenic Pocomoke River; and one of the few relatively \nundisturbed strands of barriers islands on the east coast--to name only \na few. Its unique land and water resources contain an extraordinary \nvariety of habitat types--from old growth forests to cypress swamps--\nand a tremendous diversity of flora and fauna.\n  The Lower Eastern Shore has played an important role in the history \nand culture of our Nation from the earliest native American, African-\nAmerican, and European-American settlements. Evidence of the Lower \nShore's past is featured prominently in its daily life--including its \nwatermen who for centuries have sailed the Bay's waters in the \nlegendary Skipjacks--the last commercial sailing fleet left in North \nAmerica--Bugeyes, and other vessels harvesting oysters, crabs, and \nfish. The area is recognized as the country's original historic and \ncultural center for the shell fishing industry. It holds the birth \nrights to the uniquely American art form of decoy carving through the \ninternationally-recognized work of Lemuel and Steve Ward. The \nagriculture and water-related industries which flourished throughout \nthe 1700's and 1800's, still contribute heavily to the regional \neconomy. Many of the towns and communities on the Lower Shore including \nCrisfield, Deal Island, Smith Island, Snow Hill, and Princess Anne look \nmuch the same today as they did almost two centuries ago--and their \nnumerous buildings and sites on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces still serve as important reminders of the history of the area.\n  The Lower Eastern Shore also boasts a wide array of national \nrecreational amenities including: Ocean City, one of the Nation's \npremier ocean resorts; the Assateague Island National Seashore, one of \nthe few pristine and unspoiled seashores remaining on the east coast; \nthe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, home to the largest population \nof bald eagles east of the Mississippi River; and the Beach to Bay \nIndian National Recreational Trail. Over 10 million tourists visit the \narea each year to enjoy not only the scenic waterways and recreational \ndraws, but also the historic sites and cultural attractions.\n  Five years ago, State and local government officials, area residents, \nthe National Park Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nUniversity of Maryland-Eastern Shore, businesses, and other private \norganizations joined together to harness and at the same time protect \nthis area's distinctive potential. This was one of the early efforts in \na growing national movement of concerned individuals, organizations, \nand governments working \n\n[[Page S1459]]\ntogether to develop a vision for the future of an area distinguished by \nits resources, communities, and ways of life. Through that effort, a \nregional public-private partnership was formed and the Lower Eastern \nShore Heritage Committee has prepared and begun to implement a plan \nwhich is already showing results in the conservation, preservation, and \nthe revitalization of the Lower Shore counties.\n  The bill which I have introduced will provide further impetus for the \nsuccessful implementation of a heritage conservation and development \nplan, while providing the Lower Eastern Shore with the important \nnational recognition it deserves. This legislation is not designed to \ncreate a new national park or in any way change existing authorities of \nFederal, State and local governments to regulate the use of land as \nprovided for by current law or regulations. Rather, it provides Federal \ntechnical assistance and grants and seed moneys at the grassroots level \nto foster Federal, State, and local partnerships, and promote and \nprotect the unique characteristics of the area.\n  The Lower Eastern Shore Heritage initiative has been endorsed by a \nnumber of communities and organizations including the town of Berlin, \nthe city of Crisfield, Pocomoke City, the town of Princess Anne, the \ntown of Snow Hill, the Beach to Bay Indian Trail Committee, the \nPocomoke River Alliance, the Greater Crisfield Marketing Authority, the \nJenkins Creek Environmental Research Center, Wicomico, Worcester, and \nSomerest County tourism offices, and local chambers of commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and a section-\nby-section analysis be included in the Record. It is my hope that this \nbill can be included as part of the broader National Heritage Area \nlegislation which is working its way through the Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the preservation and \nrestoration of historic buildings at historically black colleges and \nuniversities; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  the historically black colleges and universities historic building \n                    restoration and preservation act\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Frist, and Senator Mosely-Braun authorization \nlegislation for historic preservation activity for buildings at \nhistorically black colleges and universities. This bill directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to administer a program of grants-in-aid, \nfrom amounts authorized to be appropriated to carry out the National \nHistoric Preservation Act for fiscal year 1996 through 1999, to \neligible historically black colleges and universities for the \npreservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures on \ntheir campuses.\n  This being African-American History Month, I believe it is important \nfor us to step back and reflect on the contributions that African-\nAmericans have made to the founding and building of this Nation. And \nmore importantly, to reflect on the institutions and organizations that \nwere built by African-Americans to meet the challenges, goals, and \nneeds of their people. Historically black colleges and universities \nstand as a testament to the hopes, dreams, achievements, and struggle \nof a people previously denied opportunity and justice to overcome \nextreme adversity and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost \ninsurmountable legal and social obstacles.\n  This bill authorizes the Secretary to: First, obligate funds for a \ngrant with respect to a building or structure listed on the National \nRegister of Historic Places only if the grantee agrees to match the \namount of such grant, with funds derived from non-Federal sources; and \nsecond, waive this matching requirement if an extreme emergency exists \nor is such a waiver is in the public interest to assure the \npreservation of historically significant resources.\n  It authorizes funds for to complete preservation operations at Fisk \nUniversity and 13 historically black colleges and universities in \nDelaware, the District of Columbia and throughout the South, based on \nthe 1991 National HBCU Historic Preservation Initiative. In September \n1987, the Office of Historically Black College and University Programs \nwithin the Department of the Interior developed a proposal for a \nproject designed to restore and preserve historic structures on the \ncampuses of HBCU's. In 1988, a special survey to identify candidates \nfor inclusion in the program generated responses from 46 HBCUs \nnominating 144 structures for consideration. The initiative selected 11 \nof the most historically significant and critically threatened \nstructures which will require an estimated $20 million to restore \nand preserve the structure. Projects to be funded under the program \ninclude: Gains Hall, Morris Brown College, Atlanta, GA; Leonard Hall, \nShaw University, Raleigh, NC; Hill Hall, Savannah State College, \nSavannah, GA; St. Agnes, St. Augustine's College, Raleigh, NC; The \nMansion, Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, MS; White Hall, Bethune-Cookman \nCollege, Daytona Beach, FL; Graves Hall, Morehouse College, Atlanta, \nGA; Howard Hall, Howard University, Washington, DC; Virginia Hall, \nHampton University, Hampton, VA; Parkard Hall, Spelman College, \nAtlanta, GA; Administration Building, Fisk University, Nashville, TN; \nLookerman Hall, Delaware State College, Dover, DE; Cooper Hall, \nSterling College, Sterling, KS; and Science Hall, Simpson College, \nIndianola, IA.\n\n  This bill is exactly the same as the bill that passed both the House \nand Senate in 1994 but died in conference due to the end of the \nsession. The only changes made were to the effective dates. I am happy \nto be a part of preserving this important part of American history and \nurge my colleagues to join me in the effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

                S. Res. 228\n\n       Whereas on February 25, 1996, two vicious terror attacks in \n     Jerusalem and Ashkelon killed two American citizens and 23 \n     Israelis, and wounded dozens more;\n       Whereas the Gaza-headquartered terrorist organization \n     ``Hamas'' claimed credit for the attack;\n       Whereas in 1995, 47 innocent Israeli and American citizens \n     were killed in Palestinian terror attacks;\n       Whereas since the signing of the Declaration of Principles \n     between Israel and the PLO on September 13, 1993, 168 people \n     have been killed in terrorist acts, 163 Israelis and five \n     American citizens;\n       Whereas the Gaza-based ``Hamas'' terror group and Damascus-\n     based Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine terror groups have claimed \n     responsibility for the majority of those terror attacks;\n       Whereas the PLO, the Palestinian Authority and Yasser \n     Arafat have undertaken on repeated occasions to crack down on \n     terror and bring to justice those in areas under their \n     jurisdiction who commit acts of terror;\n       Whereas notwithstanding such undertakings and some \n     improvements in Palestinian efforts against terrorism, the \n     vast majority of terror suspects have not been apprehended, \n     or if apprehended, not tried or punished, and no terror \n     suspects requested for transfer have been transferred to \n     Israeli authorities by Palestinian authorities in direct \n     contravention of agreements signed between the PLO and \n     Israel;\n       Whereas the governments of Iran, Syria and Lebanon continue \n     to provide safe haven, financial support and arms to terror \n     groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, or Hezbollah among \n     others, and have in no way acted to restrain such groups from \n     committing acts of terrorism;\n       Whereas failure to act against terrorists by the \n     Palestinian Authority, Syria and others can only undermine \n     the credibility of the peace process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns and reviles in the strongest terms the attacks \n     in Jerusalem and in Ashkelon;\n       (2) extends condolences to the families of all those \n     killed, and to the Government and all the people of the State \n     of Israel;\n       (3) calls upon the Palestinian Authority, the elected \n     Palestinian Council and Chairman Arafat to act swiftly and \n     decisively to apprehend the perpetrators of terror attacks, \n\n[[Page S1463]]\n     to do more to prevent such acts of terror in the future and to eschew \n     all statements and gestures which signal tolerance for such \n     acts and their perpetrators;\n       (4) calls upon the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian \n     representatives in the elected Council to take all possible \n     action to eliminate terrorist activities by Hamas, \n     Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine, and all other such terror groups;\n       (5) urges all parties to the peace process, in order to \n     retain the credibility of their commitment to peace, to bring \n     to justice the perpetrators of acts of terrorism, and to \n     cease harboring, financing and arming terror groups in all \n     territories under their control; and\n       (6) urges the Clinton administration to act decisively and \n     swiftly against those who continue to harbor, arm or finance \n     terror groups seeking to undermine the peace process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1462-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 229--COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND \n        CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNITED STATES SENATORS\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, \nand Mr. D'Amato) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

WILLIAM OWENS AND JROC\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Adm. William A. \nOwens and his extraordinary efforts in developing the military's Joint \nRequirements Oversight Council, better known as JROC. Admiral Owens \nretires today after 33 years of service to our Nation, and as our \nmilitary's third Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--the second \nhighest ranking officer in our Armed Forces.\n  As Vice Chairman, Admiral Owens defined the role of the JROC in the \ndefense requirements planning process--a process that has seen little \nchange from the cold war planning process instituted by former Defense \nSecretary McNamara in the 1960's. The JROC as a forum, and a process, \nis little known and even less understood. But I believe it is essential \nto leveraging the tremendous capabilities that can be gained through \njoint planning and operations. I believe it also signals the need for a \nfundamental change in the way America plans for its future defense. \nThis need for change is not a challenge limited to the Defense \nDepartment, but rather will provoke many of us to reflect what means to \nbe pro-defense today--in a daunting era of emerging new technologies, \nuncertainly over future threats, an expanding continuum of military \noperations, and scarce and competing resources.\n  The JROC evolved in response to these challenges. But the JROC was \nalso largely motivated by the Goldwater-Nichols' Defense Reorganization \nAct of 1986. Goldwater-Nichols required the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff to conduct net assessments to determine our military \ncapabilities. The act also required that the Chairman provide the \nSecretary of Defense with alternative program recommendations and \nbudget proposals--recommendations alternative to decisions derived from \nbusiness as usual.\n  To assist the Chairman in this role, Goldwater-Nichols created the \nposition of the Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. As Vice Chairman \nfor the past 2 years, Admiral Owens has chaired the JROC and its \nmembers--the Air Force and Army Vice Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chief of \nNaval Operations, and the Assistant Commander of the Marine Corps. \nThese senior military leaders now devote 10 to 15 hours each week to \nreview issues generated by various joint warfighting capability \nassessments, or JWCA's. The JWCA's, which Admiral Owens initiated, \ncomprehensively evaluate 10 distinct warfighting capabilities across \nmilitary service lines. The purpose of these assessments is to enhance \ninteroperability among programs and services, and to identify those \nnew technologies, organizational changes, as well as deficiencies and \nredundancies, that will improve our military's warfighting \ncapabilities.\n\n  Through his leadership and vision, Admiral Owens transformed the JROC \ninto what it is today--a forum where our military's senior leadership \nundertakes the critical process of reviewing, debating and planning our \nmilitary's future warfighting capability. The JROC has given our \nmilitary service members a greater awareness of other services' \nprograms, requirements and operations, as well as the capabilities \nrequired by each of the warfighting commanders. Because it \ncomprehensively assesses the overarching military capability as a \nwhole--compared to the well-rooted program by program review of the \npast--the JROC can better assess how much warfighting capability is \nenough and how much redundancy is acceptable.\n  The JROC is in a state of evolution and its recommendations will not \nalways be popular. But what's remarkable about the JROC is its ability \nto address military requirements across service lines--across the lines \nof parochialism that have, in the past, inhibited the military's move \ntoward greater jointness, to greater effectiveness and to greater \nefficiencies. Admiral Owens and the JROC have been a catalyst for \nmoving defense planning away from business as usual--shifting the focus \nof the defense debate away from defense spending levels, and move \ntoward a process that collectively addresses a kaleidoscope of defense \nchallenges, and will ensure that defense investment decisions and force \nstructure changes are wise, attainable and affordable.\n  At one of our last meetings, Admiral Owens left with me a booklet \nentitled ``New York Habits for a Radically Changing World.'' There is \none particular quote in this book which perhaps best captures Admiral \nOwens' concern and vision for the future of our armed forces. I quote:\n\n       Organizations can't stop the world from changing. The best \n     they can do is adapt. The smart ones change before they have \n     to. The lucky ones manage to scramble and adjust when push \n     comes to shove. The rest are losers, and they become history.\n\n  Our Nation owes a debt of gratitude to Admiral Ownes for effecting \nchange before it was compelled, and for his stewardship in ensuring our \nArmed Forces are well-equipped, well-trained, and well-prepared in this \ncentury and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1464-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TAYLOR MIDDLE SCHOOL NAMED BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding achievements of Taylor Middle School in Albuquerque, NM. On \nFebruary 8, 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named \nTaylor Middle School a blue ribbon school, the highest honor for a \nschool in our Nation. One of 266 recipients nationwide and the only \nrecipient in New Mexico, Taylor Middle School deserves to be commended.\n  Taylor Middle School, a charter school, uses an interdisciplinary \nteam approach in which both the teachers and the parents are catalysts \nfor the educational development of their children. The school is using \na revolutionary middle school philosophy in which the students are \nlearning and the teachers are being taught. Taylor is using both \nspecial education and regular education teachers to work with the \nentire student body enabling a more supportive learning environment.\n  Secretary Riley recognized that Taylor Middle School offers a \nchallenging and rigorous academic approach to learning in a safe, \ndisciplined and drug-free environment. This school is an outstanding \nexample of an academic institution that is using its own resources to \nwork toward the National Education Goals. Taylor Middle School is an \noutstanding model for New Mexico's schools and schools across our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend Taylor Middle School, its \nstudents, its staff, and the parents who have formed a partnership to \ncreate a healthy and effective learning environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1464-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1464-S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING PAULINE D.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \npay tribute to Pauline Gatt for receiving the Macomb Chapter of \nProfessional Secretaries [PSI] Secretary of the Year Award. Ms. Gatt \nstarted her secretarial career after graduating from high school. She \nthen went on to obtain her stockbroker and insurance licenses and earn \nher certified professional secretary designation. Currently, she is \nexecutive secretary to Joseph R. Grewe, president of Masco Tech \nSintered Components in Auburn Hills.\n  Pauline joined PSI in 1994 and has been a very active member of the \nMacomb Chapter. She has served on several committees, both as leader \nand \n\n[[Page S1465]]\na member. Pauline is currently team leader of the certified \nprofessional secretary [CPS] membership committee and spearheading the \nseminar and publicity committee for the Michigan division annual \nmeeting. She also serves as proctor for the biannual CPS exams at \nMacomb Community College in Fraser.\n  Throughout such a busy career, Pauline has found time to marry Mr. \nWilliam Gatt and raise their 4-year-old son, James Gatt. Her example \nshould serve as an inspiration to all of us concerning what we can \naccomplish. On behalf of all Michigan residents, I would like to wish \nPauline all the best and congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1464-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Black History Month, 1996, draws \nto a close, we have had an extraordinary opportunity to remember \nAfrican-Americans who have changed America. We find our Nation more \nculturally enriched in the arts, in film and theater, in literature and \nmusic, in the humanities, the sciences, in our military and political \nhistory, in education, communications, and civil rights because of the \ncontributions of African-Americans. But the most compelling stories are \nof the earliest African-American leaders who are among America's \ngreatest heroes. They struggled and succeeded in the face of slavery \nand against the odds, and rose above the extraordinary prejudice and \nhatred of the 19th century to have a lasting impact on the cultural, \nsocial, and spiritual fabric of America. To name just a few: poets like \nPhillis Wheatley, a Massachusetts native and the first African-American \nwoman to have her poetry published; Crispus Attucks, said to be the \nfirst person killed in a Boston battle that presaged the Revolutionary \nWar; and the soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first \nAfrican-American unit in the Civil War who were memorialized in the \nfilm, ``Glory,'' and in a statue on Boston Common are not heroes to \njust African-Americans, but heroes to every American.\n  Their stories are part of this Nation's lexicon and should be as \ncommonly known as the story of another Massachusetts native, Paul \nRevere, but they are not. That is one of the reasons that, 20 years \nago, Black History Month formalized a 70-year-old celebration begun in \n1926 by Dr. Carter Woodson, the father of black history. Dr. Woodson \nset aside a special time in February to celebrate the achievements and \ncontributions of African-Americans and the rich traditions and proud \nheritage of those who contributed so much to the building of this \nNation.\n  But, as we celebrate we must also recognize that the contributions of \nAfrican-Americans serve as a bridge over the troubled waters of \neconomic insecurity. Their struggle and achievements in the face of \nincredible odds give us hope when we see that struggle for freedom, and \nequal justice has become an economic as well as a social struggle that \nfinds hard working, self-reliant, responsible African-Americans looking \nfor a good job at a liveable wage. The economic disparity between \nAfrican-Americans and the rest of America is disproportionate. I know \nthat African-Americans in Massachusetts--from Roxbury to Lowell, from \nNew Bedford to Springfield--are working harder and harder, like all \nAmericans, without receiving a raise, struggling to get the skills they \nneed, and trying to educate themselves and their families, and some are \nfalling further and further behind.\n  So, this month, in recognizing the importance of African-American \nheroes and their contribution to the history of America, we must not \nonly reaffirm our commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity but \nto building an opportunity economy that provides for a better paying \njob, decent benefits, and a chance for their children to make more and \ndo better in a world that judges them as Martin Luther King said, ``on \nthe content of their character.'' Black History Month is one more \nimportant step in tearing down the economic, social, and cultural walls \nthat divide us and bridging the racial gaps between us. As we approach \nthe 21st century, this will be one of our greatest challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1465-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am here today to celebrate \nthe achievements of the 27 schools from my State that were awarded the \nDepartment of Education's prestigious Blue Ribbon Award. The Blue \nRibbon Award signifies excellence in education and calls attention to \nremarkably successful public and private schools.\n  Blue ribbon schools display the superior qualities that are necessary \nto prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. The \nrecognized schools serve as models for other schools and communities \nseeking to provide high quality education for their students. This year \n266 secondary, junior high, and middle schools will be presented with \nthe Blue Ribbon Award.\n  After a vigorous screening process by each State Department of \nEducation, a panel consisting of 100 outstanding educators and other \nprofessionals reviews the nominations, and selects the most promising \nschools for a site visit. After the schools have been visited, the \npanel considers the reports and forward its final recommendations to \nSecretary Riley, who then reveals the names of the schools selected for \nrecognition.\n  It is my honor and privilege to identify the following 27 Texas \nschools selected to receive a Blue Ribbon Award: Klein Oak High School, \nPlano Senior High School, Renner Middle School, Forest Meadow Junior \nHigh School, Strickland Middle School, Forest Park Middle School, Mayde \nCreek High School, Groesbeck Middle School, Lawrence D. Bell High \nSchool, Grapevine Middle School, Spring Forest Middle School, Spring \nOaks Middle School, Northbrook Middle School, James E. Taylor High \nSchool, Westwood High School, Noel Grisham Middle School, Travis Middle \nSchool, Socorro High School, Lubbock High School, Lackland Junior-\nSenior High School, Georgetown High School, Coppell Middle School West, \nEdward S. Marcus High School, Booker T. Washington High School for \nPerforming and Visual Arts, Crookett Middle School, Carroll High \nSchool, and Carroll Middle School. They are clearly among the most \ndistinguished schools in the Nation with a persistent commitment to \nexcellence in education.\n  I am elated that of all the schools selected from the entire United \nStates, 10 percent are in Texas. Their achievements stand as positive \ntestimony to the dedication, pride, and devotion to responsibility of \nthe students, teachers, administrators, and parents at each of these \nblue ribbon schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1465-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1465-S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in my home State of Connecticut \nand across the Nation, something very positive is happening. Every day \nwe hear about crime and violence committed by youth, teenage pregnancy, \nfalling test scores and a host of other indications that the fabric of \nour society is fraying. These are problems that certainly need to be \naddressed. But today I would like to talk about Character Counts, a \nprogram that has committed itself to the children of this Nation in an \naffirmative way that conveys the faith and optimism we have in our \nyouth and the high expectations we have for them. I am very proud to be \na part of this growing endeavor.\n  On yesterday, I joined with my colleagues in the introduction of a \nresolution to designate October 13-19, 1996 as this year's National \nCharacter Counts Week. Character Counts Week will focus attention on \nthe importance of character education and mobilize participation in the \nprogram. Last year in Connecticut, almost 3,000 students and teachers \nfrom 75 towns attended a rally in Hartford kicking off Character Counts \nWeek, and I know many other States have had an equally enthusiastic \nresponse to the promise of character education. I invite all Americans \nto join us in taking part in the character education of our young \npeople as it is everyone's duty.\n  Character Counts emphasizes six values--trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These are values \nthat we all hold in common; these values transcend religions, cultures, \nsocio-economics, and generations. But these values need to be \nexplicitly taught to our children and reinforced and reflected in the \nway we live and in the way we shape our society. Character Counts does \nexactly \n\n[[Page S1466]]\nthis--the program encourages participating schools to infuse their \nregular curriculum with the six core values. There is no set \ncurriculum--schools create individualized programs to fit their needs. \nCharacter education can be quite simple--as one Connecticut educator \ncommented, ``Any good teacher or good coach is probably doing it \nanyway.'' Character Counts spotlights and inspires these efforts.\n  A 1992 survey of 9,000 high school and college students conducted by \nthe Josephson Institute of Ethics revealed that 65 percent felt that \nvalues should be taught in school because some parents fail to do so in \nthe home, and 45 percent felt that character education should begin as \nearly as kindergarten. This tells me that kids not only need guidance, \nbecause it is often not received at home, but that they want guidance. \nA responsible society will work together to fulfill this obligation.\n  Schools participating in the program have experienced a dramatic \nimprovement in their behavioral problems. The Devereux Glenholme School \nin northwest Connecticut, the first school in the State to adopt \nCharacter Counts, saw a 50-percent drop in behavioral problems. And I \nknow of at least three children in Connecticut who found sums of money, \nand instead of keeping it, turned it into the authorities. These \nchildren attributed Character Counts with helping them make the \ndecision to turn in the money.\n  I believe that our youth reflect the broader society as it is \nrevealed to them by adults and that they will rise to our expectations. \nIf expectations of ourselves and of our children are low, then kids \nwill fulfill those low expectations. If we communicate to our youth \nthat they are bad kids, then they will be bad kids. If we recognize \ntheir potential for being good kids and then show them and teach them \nwhat it means to have character, then they will grow up to be adults of \ncharacter, and it is our obligation to see that this happens. Character \nCounts helps us meet that charge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1465-3", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

J.M. (MIKE) McCONNELL\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is always an honor and a \nprivilege to recognize the men and women of our Armed Forces who have \ndiligently and faithfully maintained the security of this great Nation. \nWe do this on Armed Forces Day and on Veteran's Day, but I believe \neveryone would agree that we do not recognize these individuals as \nfrequently as their deeds would warrant. Today, I stand to recognize \nand pay tribute to one of the Nation's outstanding military leaders and \nunsung heroes, Vice Adm. Mike McConnell, Director of the National \nSecurity Agency [NSA], who will retire on March 1, 1996 after having \nunselfishly served his country for over 29 years.\n  Vice Admiral McConnell's life is truly an American success story. \nBeing the product of humble roots, he attended Furman University in \nGreenville, SC, also the place of his birth, and was commissioned as a \nline officer in the Navy in 1967. He served tours in Vietnam, Japan, \nthe Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean as an intelligence officer before \nbeing nominated for flag rank and being selected as the Director for \nJoint Staff Intelligence, J-2. In this critical assignment, he served \nas the senior military intelligence advisor to the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [CJCS]. Vice Admiral \nMcConnell's leadership skills and expertise were immediately put to use \nto keep the Nation's senior policymakers informed of developments \nduring the turmoil and revolutionary changes that swept the former \nSoviet Union during 1990. More important, however, were his \ncontributions to the Nation during the 1991-92 Persian Gulf crisis. \nVice Admiral McConnell's service to the Nation during the gulf war, \nwhich included keeping Gen. Colin Powell [CJCS] informed of all enemy \nactivity, was instrumental in saving U.S. and coalition lives and \ndirectly contributed to bringing about a quick and decisive victory for \nallied forces. Realizing that Vice Admiral McConnell had much more to \noffer the Nation, the President recommended him for a two-star \nelevation to vice admiral and nominated him to serve as Director of the \nNational Security Agency in 1992.\n  Vice Admiral McConnell's greatest contributions to the Nation were \nyet to come. Becoming NSA's 13th Director in May 1992, he committed \nhimself to ensuring that the United States had the world's best \ncryptologic organization. Vice Admiral McConnell streamlined NSA's \noperations while ensuring that the Agency had the requisite skills and \nresources to meet the quickly evolving technological challenges that \nfaced the Nation. His candor and openness with the Congress and its \noversight committees helped ensure that the Nation's legislators were \nwell informed of the Agency's operations and how taxpayer dollars were \nbeing spent. Realizing that NSA's support saves lives, he also ensured \nthat the Agency provided matchless support to every major military \noperation undertaken by the United States during his tenure. Most \nimportantly, he crafted a strategy that will enable NSA to ensure that \nits people will remain its most critical resource.\n  Mr. President, I close by stating that everyone who calls this great \nNation home owed a debt of gratitude to Vice Admiral McConnell. He has \nquietly, yet dutifully, served the Nation during four different decades \nand under seven different Commanders in Chief. Those of us who have \nbeen fortunate enough to know him personally can attest to his \ndedication, peerless integrity, and unwavering loyalty to this Nation. \nIt is with a sense of great pride and honor that I salute Vice Adm. \nMike McConnell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1466-2", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1466-S1467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GIRL SCOUTS AND BOY SCOUTS OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with pride that I present to \nyou the outstanding individuals who have achieved the highest honors as \na Girl Scout or Boy Scout. These young people possess qualities of \nleadership and hard work that distinguishes them from the rest.\n  Since the beginning of the century, the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts \nhave provided a positive outlet for young men and women to develop \nleadership skills, make new friends, explore new ideas, as well as gain \na sense of self determination, self-reliance and team work.\n  The highest honors that can be received by a Girl Scout are the Gold \nand Silver Awards. These awards are presented to those Girl Scouts who \nhave demonstrated their commitment to excellence, hard work and the \ndesire to help their community. The Eagle Scout Award is the highest \nhonor given to a Boy Scout.

Mr. President, a popular TV show in the 1960's, \nThe Outer Limits, began each episode with these words: Do not attempt \nto adjust your television set. We control the horizontal. We control \nthe vertical. . .\n  Those words symbolized the kind of control the TV industry has had \nover what viewers could watch in living rooms all across the country. \nFor a long time, we didn't mind, as TV offered plenty of quality shows, \nwith a few inoffensive bombs sprinkled in here and there.\n  But in recent years, the domination of the broadcast industry over \nwhat we see on TV has grated on the sensibilities of the American \npeople, especially as TV has gone beyond the outer limits of good taste \nand decency, and into a twilight zone of immorality and degradation.\n  The Outer Limits TV show ended each week with the announcer telling \nviewers, ``We now return control of your television set,'' and that is \nwhat has begun to happen today.\n  This is an historic day for millions of American families. The major \ntelevision networks and the people responsible for most of what we see \non TV have agreed to create a rating system for their programs. This \nrating system will be compatible with the V-chip that television sets \nwill carry in the near future. I would like to commend the \nentertainment industry leaders who have taken this step forward and \nagreed to implement a rating system and embrace the V-chip. I have no \ndoubt that this will be seen as both a socially responsible and a good \nbusiness decision in the long term. I have no illusions however, about \nhow difficult it was for the entertainment leaders who met with the \nPresident to take this step.\n  Today's news means parents will have a new tool to use as they \nstruggle to raise their children in a healthy, moral environment. \nParents will be able to block out programs that they deem inappropriate \nfor their children.\n  As co-sponsor of the V-chip legislation with Senator Kent Conrad and \nRepresentative Ed Markey, I am very pleased that the V-chip will soon \nbecome reality. President Bill Clinton deserves a lot of credit for \nmaking this major step forward possible. Beginning with his support for \nthe V-chip last July, and continuing through his strong endorsement in \nthe State of the Union Address, President Clinton, along with Vice \nPresident Gore, has helped move this issue front and center, and \nencouraged the television industry to abandon their opposition to \nratings and the V-chip.\n  We all will be watching what the television industry does to \nimplement this new rating system. I have some concerns about how the \nratings will be structured, because the credibility of that system is \nessential if parents are going to be able to use and trust the V-chip. \nThe ratings must be tough enough to allow parents to prevent their kids \nfrom seeing too much violence, sexual activity, vulgarity, and even \nsexual innuendo, which has inundated many prime time television shows \nin recent years. A Seinfeld or Friends episode about masturbation or \norgasms might qualify for a PG rating in a movie theater but should get \nthe equivalent of an R when it comes on at 8 o clock at night.\n  We must also guard against a rating system becoming a cover for even \nmore inappropriate content in television programming. The parents of \nAmerica will not stand still if the networks use the existence of \nratings as an excuse to produce even more explicit and offensive shows.\n  But, if properly designed and widely used by parents, a rating system \noperating through a V-chip can change the economics of the television \nindustry, \n\n[[Page S1468]]\nmake quality programming more profitable than ever, and halt the \ncurrent downward spiral in which the networks are too often competing \nwith each other in a sleaze contest to capture their lucrative slice of \na particular demographic pie.\n  Today, the V in V-chip stands for victory, and the struggle to \nreclaim our public airwaves from the sleaze which too often dominates \nwhat is broadcast will continue. Ratings alone do not solve the \nproblem. You can rate garbage, but you haven't changed the fact that it \nis still garbage. As my friend Bill Bennett said yesterday in a news \nconference we held with Senator Nunn and leaders from the Christian, \nJewish, and Moslem organizations, a sign in front of a polluted lake \ndoes let you know that it's polluted, but it doesn't mean you can fish \nor swim in it. We need to clean up the polluted lake that is American \ntelevision today, and take out the garbage.\n  There are some television programs that no rating will make \nacceptable. Last week, Sally Jessy Raphael put a 12-year-old girl on \nher stage--a girl who had been sexually victimized repeatedly by older \nmen--and verbally abused her in front of a nationwide audience. That is \na form of child abuse in itself, and it's totally unacceptable, rating \nor no rating.\n  That's the big, next task for the television industry--to use its \nincredible creative genius to bring us more programs that will elevate, \nnot denigrate, our culture and our children.\n  There is probably no other force around that dominates the lives of \nyoung people in America today as thoroughly as television. Millions of \nchildren spend more time in front of a TV than they do talking with \ntheir parents, praying in church, or listening to their teachers.\n  The TV industry must do more to clean up their programs. Get rid of \nthe violence that is still too pervasive, and damaging to \nimpressionable young minds. Get rid of the gratuitous sex scenes, the \ncommon use of vulgarity, and the heavy sexual innuendo that dominates \nso many programs. You don't need to get down in the gutter to attract a \nbig audience and make a profit. You do need to begin to draw a line, \nand say to yourselves and your producers, writers and actors--we won't \ngo beyond that line, even if we can make more money, because it is \nwrong and it is bad for our country and our children.\n  One way the television networks can demonstrate they mean business \nwhen it comes to helping America and its parents is to adopt a code of \nconduct to govern their programming. They used to have active standards \nand practices divisions, but those divisions have been sub-standard and \nout-of-practice in recent years, and need to be bolstered and empowered \nby a strongly worded code of conduct that sets decent standards.\n  Another way the networks can show better corporate citizenship is to \ngive us back the family hour. Give America's parents at least one hour \nat night when they can sit on the couch and watch TV with their \nchildren without fear of having their values insulted. Many parents, \nincluding my wife and I, have simply given up on network TV at night, \nchoosing a family-oriented cable channel instead, or just reading or \nrelaxing together. But tens of millions of families have no access to \ncable, and have little choice about what they can watch.\n  There is no law, no business imperative, no reason not to give the \nAmerican people decent, quality programs from 8 pm to 9 pm every night. \nTo paraphrase the line in Field of Dreams, air them, and we will come. \nWe will watch good TV.\n  Mr. President, I am not a child of the information age. I am a child \nof the television age. I was raised watching TV, and I have watched TV \nwith three generations of my children. I love TV, but I am not happy \nwith what TV has become.\n  It is not too late to reverse course. The degradation of America's \nculture can be stopped. We can't go back to the 1950's, but we can go \nback to a time of decency and quality television.\n  We celebrate today the news that the television industry will develop \na rating system for its programs and support the V-chip that will give \nparents more power to control over what their children see on TV. And \nwe encourage the television executives to see today as a beginning, not \nan end. A beginning to a new partnership with America's families.\n  ``A rising tide raises all ships,'' President Kennedy said, in \nspeaking of economic growth. The same can be said of the tide of \ncultural decency. American television can uplift our people, or it can \ndegrade them. It can inspire, or it can dispirit. Today, we hope the \ntide has begun to shift. Will the rising tide be sustained? All we can \nsay now, is, ``stay tuned.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1467-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ORDER OF DeMOLAY\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 228, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Helms, Pell, Dole, and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 228) condemning terror attacks in \n     Israel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is with profound regret that I feel \nobliged to offer another resolution condemning an act of terrorism in \nIsrael.\n  Early this past Sunday, suicide bombers from the Palestinian \nterrorist group Hamas slaughtered 25 innocent human beings in two \nseparate terrorist attacks. In Jerusalem, two young Americans, a young \nman and his financee, were among those who died.\n  Shock waves from the bomb blast reverberated around Jerusalem. I am \nconfident that decent people the world over were dismayed.\n  Mr. President, we hear much oratory about the sacrifices that must be \nmade for peace, but surely, however, there are mothers, fathers, and \nbrothers and sisters throughout both Israel and America who are asking \nthemselves how much more they must sacrifice; indeed when will they \nknow peace?\n  When Yasser Arafat tours his new domain, when he pays condolence \ncalls on the families of suicide bombers, does he ask himself what kind \nof man boards a crowded bus with pounds of explosive, specially packed \nwith shards of metal to cause the maximum carnage?\n  Is Arafat willing himself to continue to be identified as the leader \nof such brutal men? If not, he must do more. Hamas and other such \ngroups must be outlawed, and their members prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law.\n  For peace hangs in the balance. If Yasser Arafat expects Gaza and \nother areas under his control to be known as anything more than a \nbreeding ground for terrorists, he must move swiftly, and decisively \nagainst the terrorists in his midst.\n  Only then can mourning Americans and Israelis believe that peace has \nreal meaning.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations--Senator Helms--\nand others in submitting a resolution to condemn the recent terrorist \nattacks in Israel.\n  I have not doubt that all of my colleagues were as stunned and \ndismayed as I to learn about the horrifying bombings. All too often in \nthe past several years, we have been forced to watch the gut-wrenching \npictures on CNN of the Chaos, carnage, and misery of yet another \nterrorist bombing in Israel.\n  The frequency of these occurrences, however, does nothing to lessen \ntheir devastating impact. Each time a bombing occurs, the Israeli \nGovernment must reexamine its approach to security and its commitments \nto the Palestinians. The Israeli people again must come to grips with \nthe fact that the peace has a heavy toll. The Palestinians must \nreaffirm that they are worthy of taking charge of their own destiny, \nand that they are living up to their commitments to end terrorism. And \nthe United States must step back and ask yet again if we are doing the \nright thing.\n  As painful as these realities are, we must not let them obscure our \ninterests in the Middle East peace process. Having just led a \ncongressional delegation on a trip to the region--where Senators, Robb, \nInhofe, and I met with Prime Minister Peres and PLO Chairman Arafat \namong other--I have a renewed sense of the importance of the peace \nagreements between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  We must also remember that the perpetrators of these heinous bombings \nare in fact the enemies of peace, and more to the point, the enemies of \nthose Palestinians who have committed themselves to peace with Israel. \nMy own hope is that the world--and specifically the parties to the \npeace process--will not let them succeed in destroying the peace. While \nwe must indeed hold Arafat's feet to the fire, and insist that he do \nmore to stop terrorist acts, we must acknowledge the progress that the \nPalestinians have made to stop violence and terror. Clearly they have \nnot yet succeeded, but we should not minimize the improvements they \nhave made since signing their peace agreements with Israel.\n  Above all, this is a moment to commiserate with the families of the \nvictims, to express our profound sorrow and regret to our ally, Israel, \nand to reaffirm our basic and fundamental commitment to the true \nsuccess of the peace process. Our resolution intends to do just that, \nand I hope that the Senate will move to adopt the resolution as quickly \nas possible.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with the \nleadership of the Foreign Relations Committee and of the Senate in \ncosponsoring Senate Resolution 228, a resolution condemning the recent \nterror attacks in Israel.\n  The heinous attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon on February 25 killed \n25 people and wounded dozens more. A radical, crazy minority opposed to \nthe peace process which is supported by most Israelis and Arabs has \nagain taken innocent lives. The perpetrators and their supporters must \nbe brought to justice.\n  Such cowardly attacks are always reprehensible. But these attacks \ntruly brought home to us the horror of terrorism because the victims \nincluded two Americans, one of them from Connecticut. This is the \nsecond time in less than half a year that the hand of terrorism has \nstruck someone from Connecticut.\n  In this case, Matt Eisenfeld--a wonderful young man, committed to the \npeace process, a student of the bible, exemplary of the best \ntraditions--was struck down by cowards planting a bomb on a bus. \n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\n  I am in awe of the strength of the Eisenfeld family of West Hartford \nat such a difficult time. They have been true to their principles and \ntrue to their son's principles and continue to support the movement \ntoward peace in spite of the awful loss they have suffered. Let us hope \nthat people of similar strength and good will among the Palestinians \nand the Israeli population will not be distracted and deterred by these \nviolent acts.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to condemn in the strongest possible \nterms this past Sunday's heinous bombings in Israel. I also wish to \nconvey my heart-felt condolences to the families of the 23 Israelis and \nthe 2 young Americans who lost their lives in these despicable acts.\n  Mr. President, many of us are asking the same questions that Israelis \nare asking in the wake of these attacks: why and for what end would \nsomeone commit such senseless acts of mass murder? We probably never \nwill be able to penetrate the demented mind of a suicide-bomber to \nunderstand what causes that person to kill. But I think we all know the \nimmediate aim of the bombers who struck on Sunday--it is to spread fear \nand terror in order to derail the peace process.\n  As hard as it is to comprehend, peace in the Middle East is actually \nperceived as a threat in some quarters. Coexistence, friendship, \ncooperation--all of these concepts are anathema to a small, extremist \nminority on both sides.\n  And Mr. President, I would submit that the vast majority of \nPalestinians--which does believe in these concepts--needs to stand up \nnow to prevent its future from being stolen by the extremists. These \nextremists offer a version of the future that includes a return to the \ndarkest days of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Indeed, they see renewed \nconflict as a necessary means to achieve their ultimate goal of \ndestroying Israel.\n  Mr. President, if the Palestinians want a brighter future for their \nchildren--as I know they do--then they will need to stop these \nextremists in their tracks.\n  We stand ready, and I know that Israel stands ready, to provide \nwhatever help the Palestinians need to win this fight. But they must be \nthe ones to initiate a new all-out battle with the violent \nrejectionists.\n  Israelis have rejected the message and methods of extremists in their \nmidst. Their democratically chosen institutions have been acting to \nthwart the designs of Israeli extremists.\n  Recently, the Palestinians have acquired their own democratically \nchosen institutions. It is time for those new institutions to be put to \nthe test by employing their full might in a battle whose outcome will \nbe historic for the Palestinian people and the middle east as a whole.\n  Mr. President, we cannot let Sunday's attackers achieve their goals. \nThe peace process must continue. The two young American victims, \nMatthew Eisenfeld and Sarah Duker, whose future life together was so \ncruelly taken from them on Sunday, were committed to peace. We can best \nhonor their memory by staying on the path that they had chosen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 228) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 228\n\n       Whereas on February 25, 1996, two vicious terror attacks in \n     Jerusalem and Ashkelon killed two American citizens and 23 \n     Israelis, and wounded dozens more;\n       Whereas the Gaza-headquartered terrorist organization \n     ``Hamas'' claimed credit for the attack;\n       Whereas in 1995, 47 innocent Israeli and American citizens \n     were killed in Palestinian terror attacks;\n       Whereas since the signing of the Declaration of Principles \n     between Israel and the PLO on September 13, 1993, 168 people \n     have been killed in terrorist acts, 163 Israelis and five \n     American citizens;\n       Whereas the Gaza-based ``Hamas'' terror group and Damascus-\n     based Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine terror groups have claimed \n     responsibility for the majority of those terror attacks;\n       Whereas the PLO, the Palestinian Authority and Yasser \n     Arafat have undertaken on repeated occasions to crack down on \n     terror and bring to justice those in areas under their \n     jurisdiction who commit acts of terror;\n       Whereas notwithstanding such undertaking and some \n     improvements in Palestinian efforts against terrorism, the \n     vast majority of terror suspects have not been apprehended, \n     or if apprehended, not tried or punished, and no terror \n     suspects requested for transfer have been transferred to \n     Israeli authorities by Palestinian authorities in direct \n     contravention of agreements signed between the PLO and \n     Israel;\n       Whereas the governments of Iran, Syria and Lebanon continue \n     to provide safe haven, financial support and arms to terror \n     groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, or Hezbollah among \n     others, and have in no way acted to restrain such groups from \n     committing acts of terrorism;\n       Whereas failure to act against terrorists by the \n     Palestinian Authority, Syria and others can only undermine \n     the credibility of the peace process: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns and reviles in the strongest terms the attacks \n     in Jerusalem and in Ashkelon;\n       (2) extends condolences to the families of all those \n     killed, and to the Government and all the people of the State \n     of Israel;\n       (3) calls upon the Palestinian Authority, the elected \n     Palestinian Council and Chairman Arafat to act swiftly and \n     decisively to apprehend the perpetrators of terror attacks, \n     to do more to prevent such acts of terror in the future and \n     to eschew all statements and gestures which signal \n     tolerance for such acts and their perpetrators;\n       (4) calls upon the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian \n     representatives in the elected Council to take all possible \n     action to eliminate terrorist activities by Hamas, \n     Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the \n     Liberation of Palestine, and all other such terror groups;\n       (5) urges all parties to the peace process, in order to \n     retain the credibility of their commitment to peace, to bring \n     to justice the perpetrators of acts of terrorism, and to \n     cease harboring, financing and arming terror groups in all \n     territories under their control; and\n       (6) urges the Clinton administration to act decisively and \n     swiftly against those who continue to harbor, arm or finance \n     terror groups seeking to undermine the peace process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/02/29/senate-section/article/S1470-1", "month": "02", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1471-S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN \n                         UNITED STATES SENATORS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 229, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Dole and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 229) commemorating Black History \n     Month and contributions of African-American U.S. Senators.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is indeed the most profound \nhonor and privilege to stand before the United States Senate today to \ncommemorate the 126th anniversary of the election of the very first \nAfrican-American ever to serve in these great Senate Chambers.\n  U.S. Senator Hiram Revels.\n  We are all of us indebted to this man, Mr. President--and to Senator \nBruce and Senator Brooks who followed him. These leaders carried forth \nthe dignity of black Americans, as they worked vigilantly inside these \nChambers to open the opportunity of America to all Americans.\n\n  The past is always prolog. The history of the contributions of \nAfrican-Americans is as much a part of the mosaic of America as any \nother. Indeed, the dream of black Americans resonates so powerfully, \nbecause it is an optimistic dream. Because it is about inclusion. \nBecause it is about expanding opportunity. Because it breaks down the \nbarriers that divide us.\n  The Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, the twin \ncornerstones of our Nation, eloquently set forth the kind of nation we \nall want. Think about the preamble of our Constitution. It states:\n\n       We the people of the United States, in order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic \n     tranquility, provide \n\n[[Page S1472]]\n     for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the \n     blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, do \n     ordain and establish the Constitution for the United States \n     of America.\n\n  With that elegant pronouncement, 39 white men laid down the tenants \nthat would organize the Government for this, the greatest nation in the \nworld. In so doing, they created a democracy which guides us still.\n  However, as Dr. Martin Luther King so wisely said, ``The Declaration \nof Independence is really a declaration of intent.'' In reality, the \nConstitution was more a statement of principles than a set of rules \ncarved in stone. It took almost two centuries of struggle and testing \nto fulfill the promise of so lofty a pronouncement.\n  For one thing, the new Americans learned right away that ``We the \npeople'' was a pretty exclusive group. It certainly did not include \nwomen. Women were not enfranchised into the body politic until the 19th \namendment to the Constitution was adopted in 1920. Poor people were \nshut out, too. Most States required ownership of property for \nparticipation in elections. Nor were young people recognized until the \n26th amendment was ratified in 1971, allowing 18-year-olds to vote. And \ncertainly not the large population of slaves, who counted as three-\nfifths of a person, for purposes of the census, taxes, and \nrepresentation.\n\n  As Congresswoman Barbara Jordan was wont to note: ``When the \nConstitution was completed in September 1787, I was not included in \nthat `We, the people.' ''\n  All of this despite the noble proclamation:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, governments are instituted by men, deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  After the first Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was \nasked: ``What have you wrought?'' He answered: ``A Republic, if you can \nkeep it.''\n  If we can keep it. Indeed it is a grand vision that has inspired \ngenerations of African-Americans to steward the Constitution so that \nthis statement of intent shall be realized and turned into a reality \nthat benefits all Americans. By contrast, a history which deliberately \nerases the sagas of blacks and women is no history at all--it is \nfiction--as flat and incomplete as a history that would leave out \nGeorge Washington, Abraham Lincoln or any of these 39 men who founded \nour great country.\n  Worse, it has the ultimate mischief of misdirecting future activity \nthat grows forth from that fraud. For the past is indeed prolog. A \ndistorted past without texture and honesty misleads us all.\n  And so Congresswoman Barbara Jordan said, too, when she was seated in \nthe House Chambers--\n\n       Today I am an inquisitor. I believe hyperbole would not \n     overstate the solemnness that I feel right now. My faith in \n     the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total. I am \n     not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the \n     diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  I say to you today, Mr. President, Congresswoman Jordan was honoring \na tradition of paramount importance to our African-American ancestors. \nA tradition started by the man we honor today. Senator Hiram Revels, \nthe very first African-American to serve in the Senate, representing \nthe great State of Mississippi during Reconstruction.\n\n  Senator Revels was a courageous man for his time. How he grew from \nhis ordinary roots to dedicate his life to public service, and \ncontribute in such an extraordinary way to public policy in the \nReconstruction era should show us all that every one of us really can \nmake a difference.\n  Consider who he was. Born the son of free parents, Senator Revels \nstarted out in the ministry, preaching in the Midwestern and border \nStates, and assisting fugitives from slavery. When the Civil War broke \nout, Revels was a school principal and a church pastor in Baltimore. He \nhelped raise two regiments of African-American troops in Maryland, then \nmoved on to St. Louis, MO, where he established a school for freed men.\n  The following year, in 1864, Revels joined the Union Army and served \nas chaplain assigned to an Army regiment of African-Americans stationed \nin Mississippi. You heard me right. He served in a black regiment \ndefending the Union in Mississippi.\n  Such courage as this is the foundation of our African-American \nancestry.\n  By 1870, Revels had been elected to the Mississippi State Senate. But \ndestiny tapped his shoulder when the Republican-dominated legislature \nelected Revels to the U.S. Senate, in anticipation of the State's \nreadmission to representation in Congress.\n  It was in 1870, you will recall, and the 15th amendment granting \ncitizens the right to vote regardless of race or previous condition of \nservitude, was finally passed. 1870. That is almost 100 years after the \nConstitution declared this country to exist for the protections of all \npeople.\n  His victory was not without a fight. Sent to Washington, Senator \nRevels' credentials were immediately challenged. On the basis of the \nDred Scott decision by the Supreme Court in 1857, which judged that \npersons of African-American descent were not U.S. citizens, he was \naccused of failing to satisfy the citizenship requirement to hold \nelected office in the Senate.\n\n  The debate over Senator Revels seat became increasingly bitter. For 2 \ndays, his opponents offered up a caustic mix of racial epithets, \ninflammatory charges, and specious arguments in a futile effort to \nprevent the seating of the Nation's first black Senator.\n  As a result, this minister and school principal, this educator and \nspiritual leader, embarked on his career as a U.S. Senator defending \nthe rights of other blacks to hold public office. His first debate was \nagainst an amendment to the Georgia readmission bill that prevented \nblacks from holding State office in Georgia, and from representing \nGeorgia in either House of Congress. Prefacing his remarks, and I \nquote: ``With feelings which perhaps never before entered into the \nexperience of any member of this body,'' Senator Revels declared that \nblack citizens, ``ask but the rights which are theirs by God's \nuniversal law.'' And Senator Revels reminded his audience of the \ncontributions that African-American troops had made to the war effort. \nDespite Senator Revels efforts, the Georgia readmission bill was \nenacted.\n  During 14 months of service in the Senate, Senator Revels spoke out \nagainst legislation to segregate public schools in the District of \nColumbia, and was instrumental in helping to integrate the work force \nat the Washington Navy Yard.\n  Although Senator Revels decided not to run for re-election, his short \nstay in the Senate paved the way for other African-American Senators to \nfollow.\n\n  In fact, he opened the door of opportunity for the election of \nSenator Blanche Kelso Bruce in 1875, who became the first African-\nAmerican to serve a full term in the U.S. Senate.\n  Though born a slave, Senator Bruce still believed in the guiding \ntruth of the Constitution, and he dedicated his life to working for the \ninclusion of all under the arm of its protections. In an effort to \nsupport African-Americans seeking higher office, Senator Bruce \nchampioned the cause of Pinckney Pinchback, a Louisiana Republican who \nmight have been this Nation's third black Senator but for a challenge \nto his seat. In his first speech in this Chamber, Senator Bruce \nvigorously defended Pinchback, and the Republican-dominated legislature \nwhich had elected him to the Senate. But it was to no avail.\n  During his 6-year term in the Senate, Senator Bruce served as \nchairman of a select committee charged with investigating the \nFreedman's Savings and Trust Co.--a federally chartered institution \nwhose collapse threatened to impoverish thousands of black depositors. \nThrough his efforts, investors were able to recover more than half of \ntheir deposits.\n  Senator Bruce made great contributions in the fight for inclusion \nduring his one term in the Senate. However, despite the tremendous \nstrides achieved during the Reconstruction era, in the late 1870's, \nominous tactics of intimidation unbecoming of a great democracy were \nused to exclude African-Americans from full participation in the voting \nprocess. Lives were threatened, and lives were lost, when Afican-\nAmericans dared to exercise their right to vote.\n  Both of these gentlemen clung to the promise of a republic, guided by \na love \n\n[[Page S1473]]\nof liberty. And they did this, Mr. President, despite their direct \nexposure to a society that condoned slavery--and espoused the \ndegradation of humanity--which characterized the popular will of their \ntimes. They did this because they hoped. Because they were determined \nthat their hopes would not be in vain.\n  Even so, it was not for another 86 years--that's almost a century, \nMr. President, a full century--until America elected another African-\nAmerican to the U.S. Senate.\n  Not until the great surge of the civil rights era was the third \nAfrican-American Senator elected; 1967 was the year, and the American \npolitics had matured. For one thing, a change in the Constitution \nallowed for direct elections by the people, rather than elections or \nappointments by State legislatures.\n\n  Thus, it was a significant victory, Mr. President, when the people of \nMassachusetts, on their own volition, on the basis of their own vision \nand wisdom and depth of comprehension of America's political values \nelected Senator Edward Brooks to the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Brooks was only the first African-American ever to win a \nSenate seat by direct election. With his victory, the American \nelectorate showed that it had grown in its maturity. The people had a \ndeeper connection to the meaning of ``We the People.'' They appreciated \nthe value of inclusion for all peoples. They understood the great \npossibilities of allowing diversity to thrive in our Nation, and so \nthey opened up the ranks of participation in leadership.\n  Senator Brooks served two terms until 1979. During his 12 years of \nservice, Senator Brooks supported a number of measures aimed at healing \nthe Nation's racial and economic divisions, including tax reform, fair \nhousing legislation, the extension of the Voting Rights Act and Federal \naid to education.\n  Each of these three gentlemen set a fine example of leadership that \nall Americans can be proud of. Each championed the cause of justice, \ndemocracy, and liberty for all. And perhaps most notably, each one of \nthem avowed that one day, one day the promise of America would be a \nreality for all Americans.\n   Mr. President, I stand on the floor of this most powerful \nlegislative body, and I am only the fourth American of African descent \nto serve in the U.S. Senate. The fourth ever. And the only one serving \ntoday.\n  But I want to tell you that I share the hopes of my ancestors, too. \nWhen the Senate convened for the first time, we met in the old Senate \nChamber, and I searched out the desk of my predecessor from Illinois \nwho would actually have been seated in that Chamber.\n  It was the seat of Stephen Douglas. You may recall that Abraham \nLincoln debated Stephen Douglas in the late 1850's, and the famous \nLincoln-Douglas debate sharpened the focus of the clouds of war on the \nhorizon. Lincoln, not at that point an abolitionist, argued the \nquestion of the Douglas legislation, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which \nwould make the extension of slavery into the territories a matter to be \ndecided by referendum. Lincoln thought slavery was best confined where \nit already existed, and made the moral argument against human \nenslavement as the basis for his opposition to its extension. Douglas \ndefended his bill. Douglas won the election to the Senate. When I sat \nin that seat for the first time, I made sure I was well positioned in \nit.\n\n  How very different our times might have been--had the outcomes of \ntheir conflict been different. Through the crucible of a great civil \nwar, our Nation redefined itself, to admit to citizenship those persons \nof color who were previously held as chattel. In his commitment to the \nUnion, Lincoln held out a hope of freedom to those who, themselves, had \nnever stopped hoping.\n  In his second inaugural address, Lincoln said with no small amount of \nanguish, ``With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness \nin the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to \nfinish the work we are in, to bind up the nations wounds, to care for \nhim who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, \nto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among \nourselves and with all nations.''\n  ``Let us strive on to finish the work we are in * * *''\n  Lincoln was referring to the war between the States. But to African-\nAmericans, the struggle against racism and for human dignity was to \ncontinue. Again, their contributions in that continuing struggle compel \nus today. Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois and \nBooker T. Washington, Paul Lawrence Dunbar and James Weldon Johnson, \nMary McCloud Bethane and S. Phillip Randolph, George Washington Carver \nand Jackie Robinson, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell, Langston \nHughes, Ralph Bunche. Each name conjures a story of heroism, of \npatriotism, of hope.\n  We are today the product of their sacrifice, their labor, and their \ncommitment to community. It is in the essential message of their \ncontributions that we find guidance for out times. These people were \ngreat because they reached outside of themselves to define and serve \nthe community as they hoped it would be. They saw, and enhanced the \npossibilities for America. They were protectors of the Constitution, \ncherishing and defending and promoting the promise of freedom. And in \ntheir many endeavors, they sought to guarantee that the value of \nliberty and the sanctity of human dignity would never be lost in this \ngreat Nation. They would not drop the flag because they believe in the \nRepublic. They were stewards of the Constitution and the values it so \neloquently established as the bedrock foundation of this country.\n  Dr. Kind once said, ``The arc of the moral universe is long, but it \nbends toward justice.'' African-Americans can take real pride in the \nfact that by our struggles for freedom, all people are made free. By \nour commitment and sacrifice, the weight of moral authority has helped \nbend that arc. By helping convert that Declaration of Intent into a \nfirm reality, by insisting on a definition of community that is \ninclusive of all people and nurturing of human potential, we build the \nfoundation for a 21st century that will move us beyond the painful \nstruggles and lost talent which so sadly characterized our past.\n\n  There is a term in mathematics known as Vector addition. Simply \nstated it holds that you add forces working together and subtract \nforces working against each other. This formula is as true for society \nas it is for mathematics. If we can continue on the path to human \ndignity, and in the direction of the Declaration and Constitution \ntogether, we will reach the goals set out there. We will create the \nAmerica that our ancestors prayed and died for.\n  We are not there yet.\n  Today, a lot of Americans want to believe that we have arrived. \nPeople now want to move away from the concept of inclusion, saying we \nneed go no further. But remember that I am still the only African-\nAmerican sitting in the Senate today, and I am the very first African-\nAmerican woman to win election to the Senate in the history of the \nUnited States. Of the 1,827 Senators in the history of the United \nStates, only 4 have been African-American. The numbers alone tell you \nwhere we are and how far we have to go.\n  I look forward to the day in American history when we will no longer \nhave reason to take note how many women and African-Americans are in \nthe Senate. I want to see that great day when ``We the People'' will \ninclude all Americans, that great day when skin color and ethnicity \nwill not matter. Gender will not matter. The great day when the \ndiversity that makes America so special in the history of the world \nwill finally achieve this perfect union that our Forefathers \nenvisioned.\n  We are, after all, in this together. Black and white, southern and \nnorthern, male and female, all these distinctions should point us to \nthe real truth--that we are all created equal, and we are all one \ncommunity. In our multi-color, multi-faceted, multi-dimensional \ndiversity, we are all one people. And in that diversity lies our \nstrength. When whites can take pride in the contributions of black \nAmericans, and blacks can take pride in the history of white Americans, \nwe can all be proud of our common heritage and common humanity.\n  And from that diversity we can stir the competitive pot, giving full \nplay to the complete range of talent that 100 percent of our people--\nnot just some of our people--can bring to bear on the challenges of our \ntime.\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n\n  When my own great State of Illinois rached beyond race and gender to \nembrace my candidacy, and carry me to an election triumph, they gave \nall of America a wonderful victory. It was first and foremost a victory \nfor ``We the People,'' a resounding advancement and maturing of the \nAmerican character, that it should promote leadership on the basis of \nindividual contributions and vision, not on the basis of race and \ngender.\n  Yes indeed, the people of Illinois can be proud of the patriotism and \nlove of country, which prompted this ultimate fulfillment of our \nFounding Fathers and mothers visions for what we could become. Like the \npeople of Massachusetts who elected Senator Brooks before me, the \nvictory was a mark of progress that all leadership and all \nparticipation. An act of inclusion that recognizes the worthiness of \nall facets of American life, and the need for all of America to benefit \nfrom that experience and expertise.\n  African-American history month is a celebration for all of us. It is \nnot jsut for black children deprived of role models and heroes of their \nheritage. It is not just for white children, who are fed media images \nof African-Americans as drug dealers and gang bangers. It is a \ncelebration for all of us, and a time for reflection on the kind of \nAmerica we want to leave as our legacy. But most of all, it provides us \nwith an opportunity for truth telling. Because there are tens of \nthousands of ordinary black Americans who have made significant \ncontributions in the arts, literature, politics, science, business and \ncommunity service. Most importantly of all, black history teaches that \nwe all have a role to play in making this country great. We all had \nplayed a role in shaping the past, and we all have a role to play in \nshaping the future. All of us--African, Irish, Italian, Heinz 57 \nvariety, we are all Americans and we will all individually and \ncollectively make the decision today which will determine tomorrow.\n  That is why this salute to Hirim Revels, Blanche Bruce, and Ed Brooks \nis a salute to America and a celebration of the history of the \ncontribution of Americans of African descent.\n  Mr. WARNER.

The term ``contribution'' \nincludes anything of value. When an organization or individual uses \nprinted or duplicated matter in a campaign attempting to influence \nlegislation, money received by such organization or individual--for \nsuch printed or duplicated matter--is a ``contribution.'' ``The term \n`contribution' includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit \nof money, or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or \nagreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make a \ncontribution''--Sec. 302(a) of the Lobbying Act.\n\n        (b) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN EMPLOYER.--(i) In general. Item \n``D'' is designed for the reporting of all receipts from which \nexpenditures are made, or will be made, in connection with legislative \ninterests.\n\n        (ii) Receipts of Business Firms and Individuals.--A business \nfirm (or individual) which is subject to the Lobbying Act by reason of \nexpenditures which it makes in attempting to influence legislation--but \nwhich has no funds to expend except those which are available in the \nordinary course of operating a business not connected in any way with \nthe influencing of legislation--will have no receipts to report, even \nthough it does have expenditures to report.\n\n        (iii) Receipts of Multi-purpose Organizations.--Some \norganizations do not receive any funds which are to be expended solely \nfor the purpose of attempting to influence legislation. Such \norganizations make such expenditures out of a general fund raised by \ndues, assessments, or other contributions. The percentage of the \ngeneral fund which is used for such expenditures indicates the \npercentage of dues, assessments, or other contributions which may be \nconsidered to have been paid for that purpose. Therefore, in reporting \nreceipts, such organizations may specify what that percentage is, and \nreport their dues, assessments, and other contributions on that basis. \nHowever, each contributor of $500 or more is to be listed, regardless \nof whether the contribution was made solely for legislative purposes.\n\n        (c) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE.--(i) In \ngeneral. In the case of many employees, all receipts will come under \nItems ``D 5'' (received for services) and ``D 12'' (expense money and \nreimbursements). In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, \nit will be presumed that your employer is to reimburse you for all \nexpenditures which you make in connection with legislative interests.\n\n        (ii) Employer as Contributor of $500 or More.--When your \ncontribution from your employer (in the form of salary, fee, etc.) \namounts to $500 or more, it is not necessary to report such \ncontribution under ``D 13'' and ``D 14,'' since the amount has already \nbeen reported under ``D 5,'' and the name of the ``employer'' has been \ngiven under Item ``B'' on page 1 of this report.\n\nD.

This ``Report'' form may be used \n   by either an organization or an individual, as follows:\n\n      (i) ``Employee''._To file as an ``employee'', state (in Item \n          ``B'') the name, address, and nature of business of the \n          ``employer''. (If the ``employee'' is a firm [such as a law \n          firm or public relations firm], partners and salaried staff \n          members of such firm may join in filing a Report as an\n          ``employee''.)\n\n     (ii) ``Employer''._To file as an ``employer'', write ``None'' in \n          answer to Item ``B''.\n\n   (b) Separate Reports. An agent or employee should not attempt to \n       combine his Report with the employer's Report:\n\n     (i) Employers subject to the Act must file separate Reports and \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their agents or employees.\n\n    (ii) Employees subject to the Act must file separate Reports and  \n         are not relieved of this requirement merely because Reports \n         are filed by their employers.\n\n\nA.

An employee is\nto file, each quarter, as many Reports as he has employers, except \nthat: (a) If a particular undertaking is jointly financed by a group of \nemployers, the group is to be considered as one employer, but all \nmembers of the group are to be named, and the contribution of each \nmember is to be specified; (b) if the work is done in the interest of \none person but payment therefor is made by another, a single \nReport_naming both persons as ``employers''_is to be filed each\nquarter.\n\nB. EMPLOYER_State name, address, and nature of business. If there is no \nemployer, write ``None.''\n\n=======================================================================\n\n    NOTE on ITEM ``C''._(a) The expression ``in connection with \nlegislative interests,'' as used in this Report, means ``in connection \nwith attempting, directly or indirectly, to influence the passage or \ndefeat of legislation.'' ``The term `legislation' means bills, \nresolutions, amendments, nominations, and other matters pending or \nproposed in either House of Congress, and includes any other matter \nwhich may be the subject of action by either House''--Sec. 302(e).\n    (b) Before undertaking any activities in connection with \nlegislative interests, organizations and individuals subject to the \nLobbying Act are required to file a ``Preliminary'' Report \n(Registration).\n    (c) After beginning such activities, they must file a ``Quarterly'' \nReport at the end of each calendar quarter in which they have either \nreceived or expended anything of value in connection with legislative \ninterests.\nC. LEGISLATIVE INTERESTS, AND PUBLICATIONS in connection therewith:\n    1. State approximately how long legislative interests are to\ncontinue. If receipts and expenditures in connection with legislative \n ___  interests have terminated, place an ``X'' in the box at the left,  \n|___| so that this Office will no longer expect to receive Reports.\n    2. State the general legislative interests of the person filing and \nset forth the specific legislative interests by reciting: (a) Short \ntitles of statutes and bills; (b) House and Senate numbers of bills, \nwhere known; (c) citations of statutes, where known; (d) whether for or \nagainst such statutes and bills.\n    3. In the case of those publications which the person filing has \ncaused to be issued or distributed in connection with legislative \ninterests, set forth: (a) description, (b) quantity distributed, (c) \ndate of distribution, (d) name of printer or publisher (if publications \nwere paid for by person filing) or name of donor (if publications were \nreceived as a gift).\n\n(Answer items 1, 2, and 3 in the space below. Attach additional pages  \n  if more space is needed.)\n\n4. If this is a ``Preliminary'' Report (Registration) rather than a \n``Quarterly'' Report, state below what the nature and amount of \nanticipated expenses will be; and, if for an agent or employee, state \nalso what the daily, monthly, or annual rate of compensation is to be. \nIf this is a ``Quarterly'' Report, disregard this item ``C4'' and fill \nout items ``D'' and ``E'' on the back of this page. Do not attempt to \ncombine a ``Preliminary'' Report (Registration) with a ``Quarterly \nReport.''.\n\n=======================================================================\n\n                       STATEMENT OF VERIFICATION\n\n                         [Omitted in printing]\n\n                               PAGE 1\n\n[[Page HL 64]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Page HL 65]]\n\n        NOTE on ITEM ``D.''--(a) IN GENERAL. The term ``contribution'' \nincludes anything of value. When an organization or individual uses \nprinted or duplicated matter in a campaign attempting to influence \nlegislation, money received by such organization or individual--for \nsuch printed or duplicated matter--is a ``contribution.'' ``The term \n`contribution' includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit \nof money, or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or \nagreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make a \ncontribution''--Sec. 302(a) of the Lobbying Act.\n\n        (b) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN EMPLOYER.--(i) In general. Item \n``D'' is designed for the reporting of all receipts from which \nexpenditures are made, or will be made, in connection with legislative \ninterests.\n\n        (ii) Receipts of Business Firms and Individuals.--A business \nfirm (or individual) which is subject to the Lobbying Act by reason of \nexpenditures which it makes in attempting to influence legislation--but \nwhich has no funds to expend except those which are available in the \nordinary course of operating a business not connected in any way with \nthe influencing of legislation--will have no receipts to report, even \nthough it does have expenditures to report.\n\n        (iii) Receipts of Multi-purpose Organizations.--Some \norganizations do not receive any funds which are to be expended solely \nfor the purpose of attempting to influence legislation. Such \norganizations make such expenditures out of a general fund raised by \ndues, assessments, or other contributions. The percentage of the \ngeneral fund which is used for such expenditures indicates the \npercentage of dues, assessments, or other contributions which may be \nconsidered to have been paid for that purpose. Therefore, in reporting \nreceipts, such organizations may specify what that percentage is, and \nreport their dues, assessments, and other contributions on that basis. \nHowever, each contributor of $500 or more is to be listed, regardless \nof whether the contribution was made solely for legislative purposes.\n\n        (c) IF THIS REPORT IS FOR AN AGENT OR EMPLOYEE.--(i) In \ngeneral. In the case of many employees, all receipts will come under \nItems ``D 5'' (received for services) and ``D 12'' (expense money and \nreimbursements). In the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, \nit will be presumed that your employer is to reimburse you for all \nexpenditures which you make in connection with legislative interests.\n\n        (ii) Employer as Contributor of $500 or More.--When your \ncontribution from your employer (in the form of salary, fee, etc.) \namounts to $500 or more, it is not necessary to report such \ncontribution under ``D 13'' and ``D 14,'' since the amount has already \nbeen reported under ``D 5,'' and the name of the ``employer'' has been \ngiven under Item ``B'' on page 1 of this report.\n\nD.
