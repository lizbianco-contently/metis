The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to take this opportunity to \ncommend Sheila Burke for the great job she has done and the service she \nhas rendered to this Senate and to this country. She is a lady of \nability, integrity, and dedication. We have been very fortunate to have \nher to serve as she has done so faithfully.\n  I also would like to congratulate Kelly Johnston for assuming the \nsecretaryship of this Senate. This is a very important position. It \ninvolves many activities that concern all of us, and I am sure, since \nhe is going to run the service, it will be efficient, capable, and \nhelpful to this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to join the others this morning \nin congratulating Kelly Johnston upon his selection to be the Secretary \nof the Senate. I, too, have known Kelly for several years. I have known \nhim to be always very efficient and very effective in whatever he has \ndone. His work with the Republican Party in the past, but particularly \nhis work at the policy committee, has been exceptional.\n  The papers, the studies, the analyses, the statistics that we receive \nfrom the policy committee--under the chairmanship of Don Nickles, but \nunder the stewardship, also, of Kelly Johnston as executive director of \nthe policy committee--has been outstanding. I always look forward to \nreceiving those documents. In fact, I have one of their very good \npieces right here before me this morning on the telecommunications \nbill.\n  He has done outstanding work. I think his ability to get along with \npeople and his knowledge of the Senate will serve us all very well. I \ncongratulate him and his family for the fine work he has done and look \nforward to working with him in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me also join in the welcoming of \nKelly Johnston as our new Secretary of the Senate. He has done \noutstanding work for the Senator from Oklahoma, and we are pleased at \nhis appointment.\n  I particularly wanted to emphasize the admiration that we have all \nhad for the job done by Sheila Burke. I had the utmost confidence in \nthe former Secretary, Joe Stewart. He had been around this body 40-some \nyears. I will never forget, recently, as we talked, he was commenting \non the outstanding job being done by Sheila Burke. He said she was the \nmost efficient Secretary that we had ever had in there. I am sorry to \nsee her not continue, but I understand that Kelly Johnston will be well \nable, after a short time, to perform equally well.\n  So I both welcome Mr. Johnston and I lament the loss of Sheila Burke, \nbut she will be continuing to work with us, I am sure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, may I just say a word about Sheila Burke \nand Kelly Johnston? I would like to join in praise. Sheila Burke has \nbeen absolutely amazing. She is somebody we can go to and get something \ndone right away. She will always have the answer. I join in the \ncongratulations to Kelly Johnston and I look forward to working with \nhim.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S7942-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO GEN. GORDON R. SULLIVAN, CHIEF OF STAFF, U.S. ARMY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of our \ncountry's finest soldiers, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Chief of Staff \nof the Army, who is retiring after a distinguished 36-year career.\n  General Sullivan began his service in 1959 when he was commissioned a \nsecond lieutenant of armor upon graduation from Norwich University. He \ncommanded troops at every level from platoon to division, including the \n1st Infantry Division, and served two tours of duty in Vietnam. He also \nspent an extensive amount of time overseas, serving four tours in \nEuorpe and one in Korea.\n  General Sullivan held a number of increasingly important duty \npositions at the corps, NATO, and Department of the Army levels. He \ninfluenced a generation of leaders at the Command and General Staff \nCollege, where he served as the Deputy Commandant. Throughout his \ncareer he exemplified selfless devotion to duty and totally committed \nleadership.\n  I believe history will show that General Sullivan led the Army \nthrough one of its most challenging periods with exceptional skill, \ncourage, and wisdom. Most importantly, he preserved the Army and its \nhigh standards of excellence during the turbulent post-cold-war \ndrawdown, and positioned the Army for the future. He is widely and \nrightly acknowledged as a visionary thinker, both within military and \nprivate industry circles. The Army of the 21st century will regard \nGeneral Sullivan as the bold, courageous architect of a preeminent \nmilitary force which is able to apply technology to maximum advantage.\n  Mr. President, our Nation owes General Sullivan its deepest \nappreciation for his truly distinguished service. I wish him and his \nwife, Gay, continued success and happiness in all future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S7942-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 652, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 652) to provide for a pro-competitive, \n     deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n       Pending:\n       Dole amendment No. 1255, to provide additional deregulation \n     of telecommunications services, including rural and small \n     cable TV systems.\n       Pressler-Hollings amendment No. 1258, to make certain \n     technical corrections.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we are resuming consideration of the \ntelecommunications bill. We had opening [[Page S7943]] statements last \nnight and we urged Senators to bring amendments to the floor. We \neagerly are awaiting the many amendments because we only have a certain \namount of time and we are urging all offices and all Senators who have \namendments to bring them to the floor. We are ready to go, as we have \nemphasized in our opening speeches last night.\n  Let me just reiterate, I think the movement of this bill is very \nimportant to America. It will create an explosion of new jobs, of new \ndevices, and of new activities. I know there are a variety of \namendments. We have welcomed them. I am prepared to yield the floor to \nany other Senator who has statements at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I restate at the beginning what I said \nlast evening; that is, I believe the distinguished chairman, the \nSenator from South Dakota, and the distinguished ranking member, the \nSenator from South Carolina, have done an awful lot of work on this, a \nlot of good work. I appreciate the work they have done. They allowed me \nto be involved in many of these steps.\n  But I say for emphasis, I cannot support this bill. I do not believe \nit provides the kind of protection for consumers that needs to be \nprovided. I believe many of the statements that have been made thus far \noverestimate the impact upon the economy and underestimate the \ndisruption that will occur to households throughout this country.\n  No Member should doubt this. Any Member who doubts the impact of this \nlegislation should go back and read clippings from 1984, when William \nBaxter and Judge Greene signed a consent decree, or when the U.S. \nGovernment and AT signed a consent decree in Judge Greene's court. \nTalk to consumers and talk to households and citizens in 1984 and 1985, \nand you will find an awful lot of those folks will say, ``Why don't you \nput the phone company back together?''\n  I believe that action was good. That action was taken by the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice. I say that for \nemphasis. Justice is given a consultative role in this legislation. But \nthey were the prime mover in breaking up the monopoly that many people \ncite as the reason for wanting to go even further today.\n  Second, you will hear people come to the floor and say and act as if \nsomehow the regulations are really tying up American business. I intend \nto come to the floor and bring profit and loss statements and to bring \neconomic analysis.\n  Where do you go in this world to find better phone service? Where do \nyou go in this world to find better cable? Where do you go in this \nworld to find businesses doing better than American businesses in \ntelecommunications? It may be in fact it is true that our regulations \nneed to be changed. But please let us not come down here and act as if \nwe have these corporations all handcuffed as if they are not making any \nmoney, sort of hamstrung and cannot move and cannot reach the customers \nthey want to reach to generate the revenue they are trying to generate.\n  This piece of legislation will touch roughly half of the U.S. \ncompanies in America and every single American household. Citizens who \nwonder how it is going to affect them need to pay careful attention to \nthe 146 pages of legislation that is before this body today. The law \nmatters. The law determines how people behave. This law governs the \nbehavior of American corporations in nine basic communications \nindustries. If you are a household or a citizen who is affected by the \nbroadcast industry, this legislation affects you because this \nlegislation affects the broadcast industry. If you are a home or a \ncitizen who has cable coming into your household, this affects you. \nThis legislation affects the regulations governing the cable industries \nof America and the telephone coming into your household.\n  This 146 pages in S. 652 affects you because this deregulates the \ntelephone industries in America in a very dramatic and I believe \ngenerally constructive fashion. If you are a person who goes to the \nmovies, or you are a person who buys CD-ROM's or buys records of any \nkind, this affects you because it affects Hollywood, and it affects the \nmusic recording business. It is written into this law.\n  If you have a newspaper coming into your household, or you subscribe \nto magazines or electronic publishing of any kind, it affects you \nbecause this legislation affects American publishers as well. If you \nbuy a computer or use a computer in the workplace, it affects you \nagain. If you purchase consumer electronics or are a consumer of \nwireless services or satellite services, all the nine basic \ncommunications industries, all growing relatively rapidly, all affect \neach and every single American citizen in their homes and in their \nworkplace.\n  Let no Member of this Senate underestimate the impact of this \nlegislation. We had a great debate over the budget resolution. I know \nfrom my own personal experience with that legislation that there was a \ngreat deal of concern. Gosh, what if you vote for it, is it going to be \na problem? Are people going to get angry with you? There are changes in \nMedicare, and cuts in programs. Are people going to get unhappy because \nwe finally are asking them to pay the bills of the Government? The \nanswer is probably yes. Probably they are going to get a little bit \nupset.\n  This piece of legislation is more dramatic than the budget \nresolution. This piece of legislation affects Americans far more \nintimately than that budget resolution. There is not an American \ncitizen that will not be affected by this piece of legislation.\n  Last night on the floor of the Senate the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota said:\n\n       The recent hearing process which informed the Commerce \n     Committee and led to the development of S. 652 began in \n     February 1994. In 1994 and 1995, the Commerce Committee held \n     14 days of hearings on telecommunications reform. The \n     committee heard from 109 witnesses during this process. The \n     overwhelming message we received was that Americans want \n     urgent action to open up our Nation's telecommunications \n     market.\n\n  Mr. President, I challenge that statement. I challenge the statement \nthat we can conclude from the hearing process that ``Americans want \nurgent action to open up our Nation's telecommunications market.''\n  Tell me who it was that in a town hall meeting stood up and said, \n``Senator Gregg, would you go to Congress and make sure you get down \nthere and change the laws to help our telecommunications market?'' \nWhere do we have polling data that shows what the people of South \nDakota or Nebraska or South Dakota or New Hampshire or elsewhere say \nabout this particular piece of legislation? Were they heard in the \nhearing procession?\n  If you look, in fact, at the hearings held on this bill, on January \n9, 1995, the committee had their first hearing. They heard from the \ndistinguished majority leader, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Dole. \nThey heard from the chairman of the House full Committee on Commerce, \nCongressman Bliley. They heard from the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTelecommunications, Jack Fields. That was panel No. 1.\n  Then on the 2d of March, the committee held another hearing. They \nheard from Anne Bingaman, who is the Chief of the Antitrust Division at \nthe Department of Justice. They heard from Larry Irving, Assistant \nSecretary of the National Telecommuncations Information Administration \nin the Department of Commerce, which is being proposed to be abolished, \nan interesting witness; Kenneth Gordon, representing NARUC, a State \nregulatory agency. That is panel No. 2 on the 2d of March.\n  Also, on the 2d of March another panel, Peter Huber, senior fellow \nfrom the Manhattan Institute; George Gilder, senior fellow from the \nDiscovery Institute; Clay Whitehead with Clay Whitehead & Associates; \nHenry Geller from the Markle Foundation; John Mayo, professor at the \nUniversity of Tennessee; Lee Selwyn, professor of economics and \ntechnology.\n  Then on the 21st of March the committee met again. This is the third \nhearing on this particular piece of legislation. On that day there were \nthree panels.\n  Panel No. 1: Decker Anstrom with the National Cable Association; \nRichard Cutler, Satellite Cable Services; Gerald Hassell, Bank of New \nYork; Roy Neel, U.S. Telephone Association; Bradley Stillman, Consumer \nFederation of America. [[Page S7944]] \n  Then the second panel: U. Bertram Ellis, Ellis Communications, Inc.; \nEdward Fritts, National Association of Broadcasters; Preston Padden, \nFox Network; Jim Waterbury of NBC Affiliates.\n  Panel No. 3: Scott Harris from the FCC, not on behalf of the FCC but \nhis own personal testimony; and Eli Noam, Communications Institute for \nTeleinformation. That was the third set of hearings.\n  On the 23d of March, the full committee had their markup, and the \nbill was reported out 17 to 2.\n  I would like to put on my glasses and read the small print of some of \nthe things that were said in these hearings. Just again, the idea here \nis I am respectfully challenging what I think is a very important \nstatement, a very important statement that lots of others are going to \nmake as well; that is, that the overwhelming message we received was \nthat Americans ``want urgent action to open up our Nation's \ntelecommunications market.'' Keep that in mind.\n  What do the households in your State want? What do the citizens of \nyour State want? What do the people who elected you and sent you here \nto the U.S. Congress want? What do they want?\n  Let us see what they wanted as we look at the hearings that were \nheld. They said: First, there were the three Members of Congress.\n\n       Senator Dole advocated quick passage of telecommunications \n     legislation. He noted that rural Americans are concerned \n     about telecommunications legislation, as it offers tremendous \n     opportunities for economic growth. He testified that \n     legislation should underscore competition and deregulation, \n     not reregulation.\n       Chairman Bliley stated that the goals of telecommunications \n     legislation should be to: one, encourage a competitive \n     marketplace; two, not grant special Government privileges; \n     three, return telecommunications policy to Congress; four, \n     create incentives for telecommunications infrastructure \n     investment, including open competition for consumer hardware; \n     and, five, remove regulatory barriers to competition.\n       Chairman Fields stated telecommunications reform is a key \n     component of the legislative agenda of 104th Congress. He \n     chastised those who speculated that Congress will be unable \n     to pass telecommunications legislation this year. He asserted \n     that the telecommunications industry is in a critical stage \n     of development, and that Congress must provide guidance.\n\n  I did not hear any of those three witnesses come and say ``Americans \nwant urgent action to open up the telecommunications market.'' They are \ntalking about American corporations. They are talking about American \nindustry and advising them that they want to do things that they are \ncurrently unable to do because the regulations say they are prohibited \nfrom doing it. That is what this bill is about, businesses that want to \ndo something that they are currently not allowed to do. That is what it \nis all about--change in the law. All of these various businesses do \nsomething that they currently cannot do. In many cases, I support it. \nBut I am not getting calls from people at home saying, ``Gee, Bob, I \nhope you are really getting there because we want to make sure that our \nNation's telecommunications markets get opened, there is a very urgent \nneed to do it.''\n  Listen to panel No. 1, second hearing:\n\n       Anne Bingaman testified that the administration favors \n     legislation that is comprehensive and national in scope, \n     opens the BOC local monopoly, and provides for \n     interconnection at all points.\n       She claims that local loop competition will bring consumers \n     the same benefits that long distance competition brought \n     consumers when the Justice Department broke up AT\n\n  I believe that Anne Bingaman is right, but I caution my colleagues it \ntook 7 or 8 years before the consumers gave you a round of applause. \nThere was a long period of time after 1984 when people, at least in my \nState, were saying what in the Lord's name is going on here? All of a \nsudden I cannot get a phone into my house; I have to go to a different \nprovider; I have competition; I have choice. What the heck is going on? \nWhat was wrong with what they had? they were saying to me. I said, \nwell, stay with this thing. It is going to work. We are going to open \nup the long distance market. We are going to have competition. It is \ngoing to be good. Trust me. I trust it is going to be good.\n  And it has worked. It was not coming from home, Mr. President. It was \nnot coming from households and citizens who said, Gee, Governor, would \nyou write a letter to the Justice Department, old Bill Baxter back \nthere, and see if he can get together with AT and file a document \ndown in Judge Greene's court because we would really like to see the \nRBOC's spun off, and all that sort of thing.\n  It has worked. Anne Bingaman is correct that it worked. But it took \nyears before we understood that citizens began to see the benefits.\n\n       Larry Irving agreed that opening telecommunications markets \n     will promote competition, lower prices, and increase consumer \n     choice. He stated that the government must maintain its \n     commitment to universal service. He stated the \n     administration's concern that private negotiations may not be \n     the best way to open the local loop to competition. He also \n     asserted that a date certain for elimination of the MFJ \n     restrictions will hurt efforts to negotiate interconnection \n     agreements with Bell operating companies.\n       Kenneth Gordon stated the State regulators, including those \n     in Massachusetts, were once a barrier to competition, but are \n     now at the forefront of promoting competition. He said that \n     States must also retain control of universal service.\n\n  And he goes on to make some other additional comments.\n  But these three witnesses are beginning to talk about the consumers. \nThey are beginning to talk about the impact upon the American people. \nThey are beginning to express, particularly the last witness, Larry \nIrving, they are beginning to express concern for what happens when \nderegulation and competition come in. But, again, no overwhelming \ntestimony here. None of them comes in and says we have to do this \nbecause the American people are banging down our doors and urging us to \ndo this; no statement that has the overwhelming support of the American \npeople; merely saying that we think it is right to deregulate; we think \nit will be good to deregulate; we think this will be good for the \npeople.\n  Now, how many of us understand the 1994 election? A lot of us here \nhave heard people come down to the floor and say it was this, that, and \nthe other thing. I agree with an awful lot of it. Most of us understand \none of the things that was going on in 1994, people said we do not \nthink you people in Congress understand. We do not have any power. We \nare disenfranchised. We do not feel a part of this process.\n  Mr. President, they have not been a part of this process, in my \njudgment. This is about power. Corporations should do things they \ncurrently cannot do. They are telling us it is going to be good for the \nAmerican people. They are telling us it is going to be good for \nconsumers. They are telling us it is going to be good for jobs. They \nare telling us it is going to be good for the people. It is not the \npeople telling us it is going to be good for them, Mr. President.\n  Then on that same date, on the second panel, Peter Huber noted that a \ndate certain for entry is necessary because the FCC and the Department \nof Justice are very slow to act. And this is a very important issue. We \nhave to get the witnesses coming in and saying that the FCC is a \nterrible regulatory body and they are very slow. This is all language \nto give you the impression that somehow American communications \nbusinesses are burdened down by these nasty bureaucrats over at FCC. \nPeter Huber said he advocated swift enactment of legislation with a \ndate certain for entry into restricted lines of business.\n  Then George Gilder, the greatest advocate of deregulation of all, \nalso advocated swift congressional action, claiming that \ntelecommunications deregulation could result in a $2 trillion increase \nin the net worth of U.S. companies.\n\n       He said the U.S. needs an integrated broadband network with \n     no distinction between long haul, short haul, and local \n     service.\n\n  Clay Whitehead comes in and says:\n\n       Congress should not try to come in and chart the future of \n     the telecommunications industry but should try to enable it. \n     He also advocated a time certain for entry into restricted \n     lines of business.\n\n  Then Henry Geller comes in. He agrees with the previous speakers that \nCongress should act soon.\n\n       He said that a time certain approach would work for the \n     ``letting in'' process, allowing competition in the local \n     loop, as well as the ``letting out'' process.\n       Geller advocated that the FCC should allow users of \n     spectrum the flexibility to [[Page S7945]] provide any \n     service, as long as it does not interfere with other \n     licensees.\n       John Mayo testified that the spread of competition in other \n     markets over the last decade supports the opening of the \n     local loop. He said that the interLATA telecommunications \n     competition has been a success and Congress should follow the \n     same model for local exchange competition.\n       Lee Selwyn asserted that there will be no true competition \n     in the local loop unless all participants are required to \n     take similar risks. Selwyn also testified that premature \n     entry by the Bell operating companies into long distance \n     could delay the growth of competition for local service.\n\n  I frankly do not know who all these individuals are. I do not know \nwhether they are consultants for one company or another. I suspect that \nall of them have a fairly defined sense of view, defined either by the \ncompanies or encouraged by the companies as a result of previously \nreached conclusions.\n  Again, I do not hear individuals coming in and saying, do you know \nwhat it is like out in the households today trying to get cable \nservice, trying to keep phone service? Do you know what consumers are \nsaying out there today? Do you know what individuals are saying when \nall of these entities have downsized over the last 4 or 5 years? Any \nexpression of concern for what technology does to families on the \nunderside of that two-edged sword? Any expression of concern from any \nof these highfalutin individuals that are paid a lot of money to \nprovide us with their advice about what is going on out there in \nAmerica?\n  No, just swift action, by God. Let us get the laws out of the way, \nget rid of the regulations. Let these companies do whatever they see \nfit, whatever they decide is best for the bottom line. Whatever they \ndecide is best for the shareowners will in the end be better for their \ncustomers.\n  Then on March 21, Mr. President, three panels come before the \ncommittee. This is getting a little lengthy. I do not think I will read \nevery single one of these.\n  Decker Anstrom, from the cable industry, they support \ntelecommunications legislation because the cable industry is ready to \ncompete.\n  Roy Neel agreed with Anstrom. He is with the U.S. Telephone \nAssociation. He agrees that cable regulation repeal would allow for \ninvestments incentive.\n\n       Richard Cutler testified that the 1992 Cable Act had a \n     devastating effect on small cable operators.\n       Bradley Stillman said that the 1992 Cable Act resulted in \n     lower programming and equipment prices for consumers.\n\n  Weighing in that in fact the Cable Act of 1992 did work.\n\n       Gerald Hassell stated that true competition will only \n     develop if both cable and telephone survive and flourish.\n\n  I happen to agree with that. I think if we are to have competition at \nthe local loop, we have got to make sure we have two lines coming in.\n  One of my problems with this legislation is it allows acquisition of \ncable in the area by the telephone company. You folks out there right \nnow in your households, you have a cable line coming in; you have a \nphone line coming in. You may not have both for long. You may have one \nline and only one opportunity to choose. That is not my idea of \ncompetition.\n  Panel No. 2.\n\n       Bertram Ellis testified that the local ownership \n     restrictions no longer serve the public interest. He said \n     that allowing local multiple ownership will permit new \n     stations to get on the air that would not otherwise be able \n     to survive. He also stated that local marketing agreements--\n     joint venture between broadcasters--\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. Open it all up. Let us get rid of the \nrestrictions. I do not care if they own 50 percent of the market, 100 \npercent of the market. I do not care who controls. Just let the flow of \nthe cap determine the public interest.\n  There is no public interest here involved any longer. We do not care \nwho controls the information, who controls the stakes, who controls the \nradio, the newspaper.\n  Mr. President, again, as I said at the start, this is about \ninformation. It is about communication. And it does matter who controls \nit. It does matter if we have one single individual controlling a \nsignificant portion of the local market, controlling our access to \ninformation. It does matter. There is a consumer interest.\n  I am an advocate of deregulating the telecommunications industry. I \ndo not know that I am, but I may be the only Member of Congress who can \nstand here and say that I signed a bill in 1986 that deregulated the \ntelecommunications industry in Nebraska, that removed the requirement \nof them to go to the local public service commission for rate increases \nbecause I thought, and believe still, it would free up capital and they \nwere in fact just spending a lot of money on lawyers and not really \nserving the public's interest requiring the companies to come forward. \nSo I am an advocate of deregulation. But I also believe there are times \nwhen we need to declare and protect the public interest. And I do not \nbelieve in many cases this piece of legislation does that. I have \nalready heard people come to the floor and say the best regulator is \ncompetition.\n  That is not true, Mr. President. If you want to get goods and \nservices delivered in the most efficient fashion, competition does \nthat. That is true. If you are trying to get goods and services at the \nhighest quality and lowest price, competition is the best way to get \nthe job done.\n  However, competition is not the best regulator. The only time we \nshould be regulating is when we say we have the public interest in \ndoing this. There is no other way of getting it done. The market is not \ngoing to be able to accomplish it. We agree there is going to be cost \non businesses to do it. We believe it is a reasonable cost. We measure \nthe cost. We assess the cost. We do not go blindly and say there is no \ncost to this deal. We understand the costs going in. But we say the \npublic interest is so great that we believe it is necessary to do that. \nThat is the purpose of regulation. Competition is not the best \nregulator. It is the best way to get goods and services delivered in a \nhighly efficient fashion. But competition, unless you believe, unless \nyou are prepared to come down to the floor and say American public \ncorporations performing for their shareowners and American CEO's \nperforming for their shareowners, worrying about what the analysts are \ngoing to say on Wall Street about the value of their stock, facing a \ndecision of laying off 1,000 people that would improve the value of \ntheir stock--and make no mistake about it, analysts love cold blooded \nCEO's. You read it in the paper all the time.\n  Some CEO just takes over a company, reduces the force by 20 percent. \nWhat do the analysts say? ``Buy the stock; this guy is doing the right \nthing.'' So they are rewarding the downsizing, they are rewarding the \ncutting of the employee base.\n  Does it improve the productivity of the company? Absolutely. Does it \nmake the company more competitive? Absolutely. Make no mistake, it has \na devastating impact upon those families, upon those individuals who \nwork for the company.\n  We do not find, I think, any evidence that CEO's are heartless, but \nwhen they are out there trying to perform for their share owners, they \nare not trying to satisfy some public interest, they are trying to \nsatisfy the interest of people who own shares in their stock.\n  On that same day, Preston Padden advocated deregulation; Jim \nWaterbury said retain some ownership rules; on panel three they had \nScott Harris testifying on behalf of himself, not the FCC, and Eli \nNoam, an expert in telecommunications. The two individuals debated a \nsection of our telecommunications law called 310(b), which is foreign \nownership. That is enough. That should give people some sense of what \nwent on.\n  There were three hearings--three hearings, Mr. President. Three \nhearings that were held, four if you include the statements made by the \nmajority leader, the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications. There were three \ntotal hearings, and I do not believe that the sum and substance of \nthose hearings justifies the conclusion that the American people \noverwhelmingly back this particular piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I was on a trip this past week, a trip with the \nIntelligence Committee on narcotics. We went to Colombia, Peru, and \nBolivia. One of the places I went was down in the Amazon River Basin on \nthe Ucayali River. I went to church on Sunday, to mass actually, more \nappropriately, a Catholic [[Page S7946]] church in Pucallpa, Peru. It \njust happened that Sunday was celebration of Pentecost. Being a good \nChristian man, I go to church regularly, but I must confess, I did not \nremember all the details of what Pentecost meant. I listened carefully. \nJust by coincidence, the service, the Pentecost is about communication. \nThe prayer of Pentecost is that we appeal to the Holy Spirit to come \nand fill our hearts with his love. That is the appeal.\n  The priest that Sunday said to the congregation that the tongue is \nthe most powerful organ in the human body, that it delivers the word \nand a word can unite us, it can divide us, it can cause us to love one \nanother, it can cause us to hate one another. The word coming from God \ncan change our life. The word coming from human beings can inform us, \nchange us and can cause us to reach all kinds of conclusions.\n  That is what this debate is about, Mr. President. You can turn on the \nnews tonight, you can pick up the newspaper in the morning, and you \nwatch and read what is going on. These people have the control over \nwhat they are going to put on the air, what they are going to put in \nthe newspaper, what they are going to have in the form of serving up \ninformation to you and me. It is about power, Mr. President, power to \ndo what they want to do.\n  Again, I am not against deregulation, I am not against changing the \n1934 Communications Act, but this piece of legislation is being driven \nby a desire of corporations to do things that they currently are not \nallowed to do.\n  I also brought down here this morning some additional things. I do \nnot know if the managers want to speak. I will be glad to yield or keep \ngoing and read some things that the press has said about this whole \nprocess.\n  I am not an apologist of the press. Sometimes they get it right, \nsometimes they get it wrong. Form your own impression. This is people \nobserving this whole process, and this is what they say about it. Let \nus see if you hear anything about the American people coming here in \nairplanes and buses and demonstrating out front with placards, \n``Deregulate the telecommunications industry.''\n  Here is one from Ken Auletta, ``Pay Per Views,'' in the New Yorker, \nJune 5, 1995. Mr. Auletta says:\n\n       The hubris was visible at the House Commerce Committee \n     briefings, on January 19th and 20th. Held in the Cannon \n     Office Building, they were closed to the press and to the \n     Democrats. At dinner the first night, Gingrich was the \n     featured speaker, and he took the occasion to attack the \n     media as too negative and too biased, and even unethical. \n     After the speech, Time-Warner's CEO, Gerald Levin, rose and \n     gently rebuked Gingrich for being too general in his remarks. \n     Surely Gingrich did not mean to tar all journalists with the \n     same brush--to lump, say, Time in with the more \n     sensationalist tabloid press? ``I hope you don't mean all of \n     us,'' Levin concluded. ``Yes, I do,'' Gingrich is reported to \n     have replied. ``Time is killing us.'' And, according to \n     several accounts, he went on to say that he had been \n     particularly incensed by Time's account of his mother's \n     interview with Connie Chung, of CBS . . .\n       [O]thers found it chilling that the Speaker would press the \n     CEO's to have their journalistic troops hold their fire. \n     ``We're at greater risk now of that kind of pressure having \n     an impact.''\n\n  The interviewee went on to say:\n\n       ``Traditionally, there has been a separation between news \n     and corporate functions. Given the consolidation, you may \n     have more instances where the top business executives, who \n     have many corporate policy objectives, may find it tempting \n     to impose control over their news divisions to advance \n     corporate objectives.'' . . .\n\n  Another observation is from ``The Mass-Media Gold Rush,'' Christian \nScience Monitor, Jerry Landay, reporting June 2, 1995:\n\n       The players are limited to the cash-rich: The regional \n     phone companies, networks and cable companies, and \n     conglomerates such as Time-Warner. Smaller ownership groups, \n     such as local television stations, are distressed. They \n     expect the balance of power to swing to the cash-rich \n     networks, which will gobble up many of them . . .\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       To influence the House legislation, legions of lobbyists \n     swept across Capitol hill, with bags of campaign cash. Over \n     the past 2 years the communications industry has handed out \n     some $13 million. Republican lawmakers literally invited \n     industry executives to tell them what they wanted. They're \n     getting most of it.\n\n  The next one is from Congressional Quarterly Weekly. The headline is: \n``GOP Dealing Wins the Votes for Deregulatory Bill.''\n\n       After doling out legislative plums to broadcasters, phone \n     companies and carriers, top Republicans on the House Commerce \n     Committee won bipartisan backing for a bill to promote \n     competition and deregulation in the telecommunications \n     industry. The committee's leaders--Chairman Thomas J. Bliley, \n     Jr., R-VA, and Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee \n     Chairman Jack Fields, R-Texas--engaged in a lengthy give-and-\n     take with committee members and telephone company lobbyists \n     over the bill's rules for competition in local and long-\n     distance phone markets. . . .\n       The intra-industry horse trading left consumer advocates \n     feeling frustrated and ignored on the sidelines. . . . The \n     biggest winners at the markup were broadcast networks, media \n     conglomerates and cable companies.\n\n  The next one is from the New York Times, Edmund L. Andrews. Headline: \n``House Panel Acts to Loosen Limits on Media Industry.'' Dateline, May \n26, 1995:\n\n       Rolling over the protests of several Democrats, the House \n     Commerce Committee voted today to kill most cable television \n     price regulation and lift scores of restrictions on the \n     number of television, radio and other media properties a \n     single company may own. . . .\n       ABC, NBC and CBS and other large broadcasters like the \n     Westinghouse Electric Company, the Tribune Company and Ronald \n     O. Perelman's New World Communications Group all lobbied for \n     sharply increasing the number of television and radio \n     stations a company could own nationwide. . . .\n       But industry lobbyists have seldom met more receptive \n     lawmakers. Committee Republicans have held numerous meetings \n     with industry executives since January, some behind closed \n     doors, at which they implored companies to offer as many \n     suggestions as possible about the ways Congress could help \n     them.\n\n  Next, an article that appeared in the Washington Post, a longer \narticle that I will take pieces from, written by Mr. Mike Mills on the \n23d of April, 1995:\n\n       The Bells--the folks who bring you local phone service--\n     like to play political hardball, and they have been \n     remarkably successful at it. This year, the Bells stand a \n     very good chance of winning most of the prize they've sought \n     for the last decade: Freedom from U.S. District Judge Harold \n     H. Greene. . . . If they get what they want, the Bells can \n     claim a place among history's most powerful Capitol Hill \n     lobbyists, ranking them with the oil industries of the 1970's \n     and the steel trusts of the turn of the cen- \n     tury. . . .\n       All that lobbying costs money. According to the Federal \n     Communications Commission, the Bells' individual phone \n     companies spent $64 million on State and Federal lobbying \n     expenses in 1993 and $41 million in 1992. Bell lobbyists \n     themselves say their annual budget for influencing Congress \n     has been $20 million a year in recent years, but has dropped \n     to half of that this year. . . .\n\n  It goes on and on:\n\n       ``Right now, the doors to the candy stores are wide open,'' \n     said Brian Moir, who heads a coalition of business telephone \n     users fighting the Bells.\n\n  These are the customers, Mr. President, make no mistake about it. \nThese business users are the customers. These are not the companies \nproviding the service. These are people using the service. This man \nsays, ``. . . the doors to the candy store are wide open.''\n  It continues:.\n\n       The Bells figure, ``Why focus on one thing? Just go in with \n     a frontloader.'' They're covering the waterfront. And why \n     not? Moir estimates that if States' regulatory powers are \n     limited, the Pressler bill will raise the typical Bell \n     residential telephone bill by $3 to $6 a month. For the \n     companies, that would raise it at least $24 billion over 4 \n     years.\n\n  An editorial in the Baltimore Sun called ``Communicating Again,'' \nApril 3, 1995:\n\n       Still, there are hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, \n     and the lobbying is as fierce as Washington has seen in many \n     years. Though the rivals like to make their cases in terms of \n     what's best for the consumer, the quarrel is really over who \n     gets a head start in capturing market share.\n\n  No one can deny that that is true.\n  Edmund L. Andrews, ``Big guns lobby for long-distance; insiders are \ntrying to influence bill,'' Raleigh News & Observer, March 28, 1995:\n\n       With so much at stake, and so little to pin on labels of \n     right and wrong, the various factions are seeking a personal \n     edge by throwing into the fray as many people with friends in \n     high places as possible. All of which made telecommunications \n     as much of a bonanza for lobbyists this year as health care \n     was last year. ``Everybody in this town who has a pulse has \n     been hired by the long-distance coalition or the Bell \n     operating companies,'' said Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, a member \n     of the Commerce Committee. ``It's just amaz- \n     ing. . . .''\n\n  Michael Ross with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 20, 1995. \nHeadline: ``Gingrich Defends Book Deal; [[Page S7947]] GOP Beats \nMurdoch.'' I am sorry I brought in all this. This article is talking \nabout this bill:\n\n       Besides Murdoch, there were 10 other executives at the \n     Capitol session, including Thomas Murphy of Capital Cities/\n     ABC; Robert Wright, NBC; Howard Stringer, CBS; Bill Korn of \n     Group W; and John Curley of \n     Gannett. Gingrich was to address a private dinner last night \n     for the communications firm chiefs in the Cannon House Office \n     Building. . . .\n       Gingrich said the meeting yesterday was closed because ``we \n     want their advice on how the United States can be the most \n     competitive country in the world, and we would just as soon \n     not have them give advice with the Japanese and Europeans \n     listening.''\n\n  I do not believe it is the Japanese and the Europeans they were \ntrying to keep out.\n\n       GOP organizers sought to keep the meeting secret, excluding \n     notice of the events from the official daily calendar. But \n     word leaked out from the executives, prompting protests from \n     consumer advocates and from the committee's former Democratic \n     chairman, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, now the ranking \n     minority member.\n\n  The last one is a piece that appeared in the Washington Post, again \nMike Mills:\n\n       Consumer advocates yesterday protested plans by House \n     Republicans to hold 2 days of private meetings with top \n     communications executives that will feature a dinner with \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich. . . .\n       Media will not be present so Members and chief executive \n     officers of various companies. . . . have honest and \n     informative discussions.''\n\n  Boy, if that is not a keyword to telling you to hang on to your \nbillfold I have not heard one.\n\n       ``What policies can the Congress promote or repeal that \n     would help your company to be more competitive and successful \n     domestically?'' the letter asked. ``And, second, what \n     obstacles does your company face when trying to do business \n     abroad?''\n\n  I do not mind in general saying to any company in America, is there \nanything we are doing we should not be doing, anything we are doing \nwith regulations or rules that do not make any sense at all? Lord \nknows, we have lots of things we do to small business and big business \nalike that add no value at all to the public interest, that you really \ncannot defend it all, have been around a long time, and you scratch \nyour head trying to figure out why they are even there.\n  But that is not this invitation. This does not say after you \nestablished what the public interest is, is there anything here you \nwould like to get out of the way that makes no sense at all; is there \nany nonsensical regulation? This did not add any qualifier in the \npublic interest.\n  This merely says is there anything out there adding cost to your \nbusiness that you would like to get rid of? It would be like me saying, \n``I would like to drive about 90 miles an hour, would that be OK? Can \nyou get the law of Nebraska to let me drive my automobile 90 miles an \nhour? I find that a major inconvenience. I like to drive fast. Why \ndon't you have a meeting and ask people driving automobiles what they \nthink about that? Maybe we can change the rules and regulations to \naccommodate them as well.''\n  Mr. President, I will wrap this up by quoting from an article, I \nbelieve it was David Sanger of the New York Times. The article \ndescribes the conflict between the United States of America and the \nJapanese over automobiles. It was assessing the impact of, I think, the \ncorrect decision by the Trade Representative to say to the Japanese, \n``It is time to open up your market and let our parts, in particular, \nbe sold and loosen the restrictions so we can begin to sell automobiles \nin Japan.'' It was trying to measure the impact. It interviewed a man \nwho was the trade minister from Indonesia, I believe.\n  You know, we are worried about Japan and the United States. They are \nthe big ones. They are the big elephants in this jungle. And they have \na saying in Asia. They say that when the elephants fight, the grass \ngets trampled. But even worse, they said, is when the elephants make \nlove. That is what we have here, Mr. President. We have a real lovefest \ngoing on.\n  Corporations have basically all signed off on this deal. They have \nhad the opportunity to look at the language. They have had the \nopportunity to examine the details, and they are saying it looks pretty \ngood to them. I say it is time for us to come to the floor to debate \nthis. I hope we are, in fact, able to enact legislation. I intend and \nexpect to support it. I cannot support it in its current form, but I \nwant the American consumer to be heard on the floor of the Senate. I \nwant the interests of American households to be considered and the \ninterests of the average American citizen to be considered when this \npiece of legislation, which is important, is being debated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending measure is amendment No. 1258 \noffered by the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on that amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We can go right ahead with the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If it has not been laid aside, and if it is proper at \nthis point, we will lay that amendment aside so that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota can offer his amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the managers' amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1259\n\n   (Purpose: To require certain criteria upon the designation of an \n            additional Essential Telecommunications Carrier)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1259.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On line 24 of page 44, strike the word ``may'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``shall''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the telecommunications bill there is a \nprovision with respect to universal service that describes certain \nconditions in which the State designates additional essential \ntelecommunications carriers that may impose certain requirements. I \nthink it is sufficiently important to say the State shall impose those \nrequirements. I would like to explain why this is important to me and \nwhy I think it is important to rural America.\n  Before I do, let me comment on a couple of broader points about this \nlegislation. Clearly, there would never be a circumstance where \nlegislation affecting the telecommunications industry would be moving \nthrough the Congress without their being an intense interest by the \ntelecommunications industry. The fact is that without congressional \ninvolvement in trying to set some new rules for competition, the \nindustry itself is out creating the rules.\n  That is why universal service legislation is necessary. We must \nestablish some guidelines about where we move in the future and what is \nin the public interest as we do that.\n  I come from a rural State. I know there are a lot of people in this \nChamber who worship at the altar of competition and the free market. \nThat is wonderful. But, I have seen deregulation. I have seen the mania \nfor deregulation that does preserve for some people in this country \nwonderful new opportunities of choice and lower prices: Example: \nAirline deregulation. There was a move in this country and in these \nChambers for airline deregulation, saying this will be the nirvana. If \nwe get airline deregulation, Americans are going to be better served \nwith more choices, more flights, lower prices, better service.\n  Well, that is fine. That has happened for some Americans but not for \nall Americans. Deregulation in the airline industry has had an \nenormously important impact if you live in Chicago or Los Angeles. If \nyou want to fly from Chicago to Los Angeles you check the official \nairline guide and find out what flights are offered. You have a broad \nrange of choices, a vast array of carriers competing in a market that \nis densely populated, where they have an opportunity to make big money. \nIn this market, there is intense competition for the consumers dollar \nin both choice and price.\n  But I bet if you go to the rural regions of Nebraska, and I know if \nyou go [[Page S7948]] to the rural regions of North Dakota and ask \nconsumers, what has airline deregulation done to their lives, they will \nnot give you a similar story. They will not tell you that airline \nderegulation has been good, providing more choices and lower fares. \nThat has not been the case.\n  In fact, airline deregulation has largely, in my judgment, hurt \nconsumers in rural America. We have fewer choices at higher prices as a \nresult of deregulation.\n  For that reason, when we talk about deregulation and setting the \nforces of competition loose in order to better serve consumers, we need \nto understand how it works. Competition works in some cases to an \nadvantage of certain consumers. In other cases, it does not.\n  That is why when the telecommunications legislation was crafted I was \nvery concerned about something called the universal service fund. For \nthose who don't know, I want to explain what the universal service fund \nis.\n  It probably stands to reason that it is presumably less expensive to \nput telephone service into New York City when you spread the fixed \ncosts of the telephone service over millions of telephone instruments; \nless expensive to do it there than to go into a small town of 300 \npeople that is 50 to 100 miles from the nearest population center. How \nwill you decide how to spread the fixed costs of telephone service over \n300 people? The fact is, you have a higher cost of telephone service in \nrural areas of our country.\n  We have always understood, however, that a telephone in Grenora, ND, \nis just as important as a telephone in New York City, because if you \ndon't have the telephone in Grenora, the person in New York City cannot \ncall them, and vice versa.\n  The universal service nature of communications is critical. The \npresence of one telephone instrument makes the other telephone \ninstrument, no matter where it is in this country, more valuable.\n  That is why we have, as a country, decided that an objective of \nuniversal service makes good sense. We have generally tried to move in \nthat direction to see that we use a universal service fund to even out \nthe costs and the price to the consumer.\n  Therefore, even in the higher cost areas, the lower populated, more \nrural areas, we are able to bring the cost down to the consumer with a \nuniversal service fund by moving money into those areas to try to help \nkeep prices down for the consumer. Therefore, consumers will be able to \nafford this service and we will have a more universal nature of that \nservice.\n  Well, in this legislation, Mr. President, we understood that there \nwill be substantial competition in many areas of telecommunications. \nTake my home county of Hettinger County, ND, a very small county, \nseveral thousand people, about three towns, the largest of which is \n1,200 or 1,400 people, no one will be rushing in to provide local \ntelephone service in Hettinger County.\n  This is not a case where you fire the gun and at the starting line \nyou have eight contestants lined up to find out who can win the \ncommercial battle to serve the telephone needs of that small rural \ncounty. You might, however, have someone decide to come in and serve \none little town in that county, because maybe it would be worthwhile to \nserve that little town, but only that town.\n  If they bring telephone needs to that town and take the business away \nfrom the existing service carrier, the rest of the services would be \nfar too expensive and the whole system collapses.\n  For that reason, in this legislation we described a condition in \nwhich, if someone comes in and decides to serve in one of those areas, \none of the conditions is that they would have to serve the entire area. \nThey would be required to serve the entire area as a condition of \nreceiving these support payments from the universal service fund.\n  Then the bill also said that in designating an additional essential \ntelecommunications carrier to come in and compete in a rural area, \naside from requiring they have to serve the entire area, they cannot \ncome in and cherry-pick and pick one little piece out.\n  Aside from that, the bill said that the States may require there be a \ndesignation; that the designation would be: First, in the public \ninterest; second, encourage development of advanced telecommunications \nservices, and third, protect public safety and welfare.\n  My universal service amendment very simply says that provision of law \nshall be changed from ``may'' to ``shall.'' In other words, the States \nshall require that there be a demonstration of those three approaches.\n  I think it is very important that those who live in rural America, \nwho are not going to bear the benefit of the fruits of competition, are \ngiven protection.\n  That is the purpose of my offering a universal service amendment. \nThis amendment is supported by the National Telephone Cooperative \nAssociation, National Rural Telecom Association, the USTA, Organization \nfor Protection and Advancement of Small Telephone Companies.\n  They understand, like I understand, that the chant of competition is \nnot a chant that will be heard in the rural reaches of our country. We \nare simply not going to see company after company line up to compete \nfor local service in many rural areas.\n  If that does not happen, and it will not, we need to make certain \nthat the kind of telephone service that exists in rural counties will \nbe the kind of telephone service that brings them the same opportunity \nas others in the country will be provided.\n  We should make sure that we have a buildout of the infrastructure, so \nthis information highway has on ramps and off ramps--yes, even in rural \ncounties of our country.\n  If we, in the end of this process, finish the building out of an \ninfrastructure in telecommunications by having a continued, incessant \nwave of mergers and consolidations into behemoth companies that are \ntrying to fight to serve where the dollars are, big population centers, \naffluent neighborhoods, but decide to leave the rural areas of the \ncountry without the build-out of the infrastructure and without the \nopportunities that they should have, we will, in my judgment, have \nfailed.\n  Mr. President, while I am on my feet I would like to comment on a \ncouple of other points in this legislation. I supported the legislation \ncoming out of the Commerce Committee and indicated then that I had some \ndifficulties with several provisions in it.\n  One concern I have deals with the provision in the legislation on the \nsubject of ownership restrictions.\n  It is interesting that we have in this bill the inertia to try to \nprovide more competition, and then we, in this attempt to say to those \nwho want to own more and more television stations, yes, we will lift \nthe barrier here, we will change the rules so that you can come in and \nconsolidate and buy and own more television stations.\n  That does not make sense to me. That is moving in the opposite \ndirection. The telecommunications bill is about competition. I do not \nthink we should say it is fine with us if one group or consortium \ndecides to buy more and more television stations and we lift the \nownership limit from 25 to 30 percent--some say to 50 percent--of the \naudience share. I think that flies exactly in the opposite direction of \ncompetition.\n  Consolidation is the opposite of competition. I intend to offer an \namendment on this and hope we will preserve the opportunity to decide \nwhat is in the public interest with the Federal Communications \nCommission. Instead of having an artificial judgment in this bill that \nsays let us lift the restrictions and allow people to come in and buy \nmore and more television stations into some sort of ownership group. I \ndo not think that comports at all with the notion of competition. I am \ngoing to offer an amendment on that at some point.\n  I would like to talk also about the issue of the role of the Justice \nDepartment. I know Senator Strom Thurmond and others are interested in \nthis subject. I intend to offer an amendment on the subject of the role \nof the Justice Department in this bill. The question of when the \nregional Bell Companies are free to engage in competition for long \ndistance relates to when there is competition in the local service \narea, in the local exchange. When will the Bell Service Companies open \nthemselves to local competition? When they do, when there is true local \ncompetition, then they have a right [[Page S7949]] and ought to be able \nto compete in the long distance markets.\n  The problem is that in the telecommunications bill, the role of the \nJustice Department--which ought to be the location of where the \njudgments about whether or not there is competition in the local \nexchanges--is rendered a consultative role. The Justice Department is \ndefanged here, and I do not think that ought to be the role of the \nJustice Department. Again, I think this flies in the face of all of the \ndiscussions I heard about the virtues of competition. If we are talking \nabout competition being virtuous, then let us make sure competition \nexists before we release the Bell Companies to engage in competition \nwith the long distance industry.\n  How do you best determine competition exists? With the mechanism we \nhave always used to determine it. The antitrust judgments and \nevaluations by the Justice Department. It does no service, in my \njudgment, to the American people to decide to take out the traditional \nrole of the Justice Department in preserving and protecting the \ninterests of competition with respect to this issue when the Bell \nCompanies will be set loose to engage in competition in the long \ndistance business. So I also intend to offer an amendment on that \nissue. That is a critically important issue.\n  In conclusion, I think there is much in the telecommunications bill \nthat is useful, valuable and will provide guidance to the direction of \nthe telecommunications industry and its service to the American people, \nbut this legislation is not perfect. This legislation has some \nproblems. I pointed that out when I supported it out of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I have a great friend on the floor, Senator Hollings, the ranking \nmember on the Commerce Committee, who I think is one of the best on \ntelecommunications issues. I have been pleased to work with Senator \nPressler, who I think has done a remarkable job in bringing this bill \nto the floor as well. But let us not say, ``Now, gee, this bill came \nfrom high on stone tablets and cannot be changed. We cannot accept any \nchanges here.'' I think universal service is one amendment we can \naccept, but there are going to be some big changes proposed, some of \nwhich will have merit.\n  You can say, ``This bill is carefully balanced on the scale. We read \nthe meter with expertise and just cannot make changes.'' It is like the \nargument of a loose thread on a $20 suit. You pull the thread and the \narms fall off. We have people coming here and saying if this amendment \nis agreed to, the coalition breaks apart, the balance of the bill \nsomehow is skewed, and the bill will fail.\n  We must, in the intervening days as we debate this legislation, take \na hard look at a whole range of issues. The Justice Department role, \nyes. I have not mentioned the foreign ownership issue, but that is also \nof concern to me. The concentration of ownership in this country of \ntelevision stations, as an example. Those are all issues I think are of \ngreat concern and we ought to weigh carefully.\n  I hope the Chair and the ranking member on this legislation will \nentertain constructive and useful proposals to strengthen and improve \nthis legislation in the public interest of this country.\n  Mr. President, I have sent the amendment to the desk. I believe this \namendment may be acceptable. In any event, at this point, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right to the point, Mr. President, the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota has a good amendment. I should make a couple \nof comments, though, with reference to his references and those of my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, who has been very \nparticipatory, and a cosponsor of the legislative reform in \ncommunications reform.\n  With respect to the general picture here on communications, the \nSenator from North Dakota is right. We do think this is balanced, that \nit cannot be balanced any more, that this bill did come down from on \nhigh and we are not going to accept any amendments.\n  That is out of the whole cloth. I learned long ago I could not pass a \ncommunications bill by itself, that the Democrats could not pass a \ncommunications bill by itself and the Republicans could not pass a \ncommunications bill by itself. We really have to work this out in a \nbipartisan fashion. Senator Pressler has given us the necessary \nleadership and I am committed to working with him in a bipartisan \nfashion. That maybe I have created an atmosphere where there will be no \namendments and we know it, the opposite is the case. We are begging \nSenators to come, as we begged the Senator from North Dakota to hasten \non and present that amendment.\n  A word should be said about the industry and the service that we have \nbecause comments have been made about all of these entities involved, \nand there are 30-some. People should understand. We have the long \ndistance industry, the cable industry, the wireless cable, the regional \nBell Operating Companies, the independent telephone companies, the \nrural telephone companies, newspaper industry, electronic publishing \nindustry, the satellite industry, the disabled groups, the broadcast \nindustry, electric utilities, computer industry, consumer groups, \nburglar alarm industry, telemessage industry, pay phone industry, \ndirectory publishing industry, software industry, manufacturers, retail \nmanufacturers, direct broadcast satellite industry, cellular industry, \nPCS, States, public service committees, commissions, the cities, the \nFederal Communications Commission, the Clinton administration, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Secretary of Education--all the public \nentities.\n  Communications is a very splendid thing. With respect to not wanting \nto open up all the markets, I had a good friend who took a poll with \nwhat you call a peer review group, testing thing, what do they call \nthat thing when they get them all together?\n  Mr. DORGAN. A focus group.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. A focus group. Thank you, Senator.\n  They had a focus group in Maryland last week and 90 percent of them \nhave never heard of the Contract With America. That is all I heard \nabout since January. In fact, it started in November, I think. But they \nstill had not heard of the contract. You can bet your boots the Senator \nfrom Nebraska is right; people are not storming the doors for a \ncommunications bill. In fact, with all of these entities calling on the \nSenators and having to make up their minds, yes or no, the Senators \nfrom the South say let that communications bill go, let us not call it \nup now, let us delay it, we did last year because there are so many \ntough decisions to be made. But on the information superhighway, \nCongress and Government are squatting right in the middle of the road \nand the technology is rushing past it.\n  The information superhighway is there. We have been a hindrance, \nobstacle to it, and what we are trying in this balanced approach and \nbipartisan approach is to remove the obstacle of Government, with the \nview of the Senator from North Dakota that universal service continue. \nHe is right on target. I have been very much concerned having \nexperienced the airline deregulation. So we want to make certain that \nthey can come in and render this service. In that light, our \ncommunications system has been the best in the world. Yes. The Bell \nOperating Companies, because these parties are so competitive--I have \nnot necessarily been in love with either side because it is hard--they \nare really individually competitive. But after all, AT, long \ndistance, has to file tariffs. They are controlled by the public, and \noperate in the interest of the public convenience and necessity. Every \none of the Bell Companies have to respond, not just to the FCC but to \nthe individual public service commissions. They operate on the basis of \npublic convenience and necessity. They have a monopoly, yes, but their \nprofits are controlled, and everything else.\n  If there is anything operating as a large corporate entity in the \ninterest of the public, it has been the Bell Operating Companies. They \nhave been most responsive. We have as a result the finest \ncommunications system in the world. Let us maintain it. On universal \nservice, let us extend it. Let us not be in any way doubtful about it \nbecause the lead-in word that goes into this particular requirement \nabout another universal service carrier is ``shall.'' \n[[Page S7950]] The language reads, ``If the commission with respect to \ninterstate services designates more than one common carrier as an \nessential telecommunications carrier, such carrier shall meet''--\n``shall'' meet. That is the law as we now propose it. But later on we \nsay the State ``may'' check off these things that are highly important. \nThe truth is they ``shall.'' And I hope we can accept the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Dakota and show that we did not think the bill \ncame down from on high.\n  Let us hear from the chairman.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we accept the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota on this side of the aisle. I want to commend him for \nhis work on this subject. He is a friend of mine, and an outstanding \nleader in this area. Let me say that this subject of serving the \nsmaller cities and rural areas is very important. I have spoken \nfrequently on that in our committee.\n  We are prepared to accept this amendment. We urge other Senators with \namendments to bring them to the floor. We are ready to go here on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know that the Senator represents areas \nsimilar to mine, the author of the amendment. I know that he wants the \nStates to have powers and to change the word ``may'' to ``shall,'' as a \nmandate to the State. What worries me about the Senator's amendment is \nnot that it is saying that the States shall require a finding by the \nauthorized agency, but that States may require additional \nconsiderations to be met. The word ``may'' in this bill right now gives \nthe State the authority to determine what findings shall be made by its \ndesignated agency. By turning this to ``shall'' I wonder if we are \nlimiting the States' discretion in terms of the findings that shall be \nmade by a designated agency before it permits an additional carrier.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to argue it now. I agree with the \nmanager of the bill to take the amendment. But I do want the Senator to \nknow, my good friend, Senator Dorgan, that I want to look at this in \nconference. I believe this section is going to have to be revised in \nconference anyway. It is in a different form than the House bill, as I \nunderstand it. But I do think that we should not mandate States as to \nwhat their findings must be before they can deal with additional \ncarriers. I believe that smaller States in particular would prefer to \nhave more flexibility.\n  I am just wondering out loud if the Senator's amendment is fixing \nthis so that the State has no alternative once it makes those findings \nto permit the additional carrier, and what the impact of the Federal \nlaw will have on the State should the State legislature attempt to \nstate that its agency must make additional or alternative findings in \nthis regard.\n  Again, I conferred with the managers of the bill. I think we \nunderstand where the Senator is coming from. We want the States to have \nauthority. But I really think he is confining the authority by changing \nit to ``shall.'' But I do believe the States might want to--any State--\nmight want to have other standards other than those stated in this \nbill. I wonder if the Senator might have us look at that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might respond, I too respect the point raised by the \nSenator from Alaska. My intention would not be to prohibit States from \nadding additional requirements. My intention is that this would \nrepresent a set of requirements at a minimum that we should expect to \nbe met. But to the extent a State would wish to add additional \nrequirements, I do not believe that would be prohibited with this \nlanguage. This language establishes the minimum requirements that must \nbe met. That is the purpose of the universal service amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I stated, I am not going to ask for a \nrollcall vote. I am not going to object to the change. But I do think \nthat when we get to conference we are going to have to figure out how \nwe give States greater flexibility. I do not think we ought to have a \nmandate that indicates that the States must find Federal requirements \nare met before it can designate an additional essential \ntelecommunications carrier, in that it cannot add any additional State \nrequirements, or it cannot reduce these designated findings and \nsubstitute others that might be more applicable to its situation with \nregard to size and competition and whatever else that might be \ninvolved.\n  It does seem to me that we ought to be very careful about delineating \nto a State what findings it must make with regard to the designation of \ncommon carriers as essential telecommunications carriers. We are \nbasically talking about the findings that are necessary to deal with \nuniversal service. The concept of that was really borrowed from the \nessential air service approach, and the way it is done actually, as I \npointed out to the Senator from Nebraska last night, reduces the costs \nof universal service about $3 billion a year. Those services are \nprovided by those who are users of this national system. This allows \nthe States to designate additional carriers. I would not want the \nrestrictions that are applied in this bill to lead to a lack of \nflexibility as far as the States are concerned to designate additional \ncarriers in circumstances which might be unique.\n  I could go on at length about some of our unique situations. I do \nthink we ought to have flexibility for the State to manage it, provided \nthat we understand that the impact of the multiple essential carriers \nis going to be that there be a change in the concept of universal \nservice.\n  The Senator's amendment deals with universal service concepts as \nmodified in this bill, and I would like to see the States have as much \nflexibility as possible, keeping in mind that there is a built-in \nlimitation in the Senator's amendment that will reduce the availability \nof universal service in rural States.\n  I hope that the Senator understands what I am trying to say. I agree \nto accept the amendment, but I do think we have to find some way as we \ngo further to say that this does not prevent the State from modifying \nthese findings in the event its legislature determines that other \nstandards are more adaptable to its circumstances with regard to the \nproviding of universal service within its boundaries.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional point, Mr. \nPresident, I understand what the Senator is saying, and I do not want \nto prevent anything being done to respond to peculiar or unique \ncircumstances or when a State determines that something else might be \nnecessary with respect to these kinds of requirements. It is not my \nintention to interrupt or to prevent that.\n  I do think, however, when we are talking about the use of the \nuniversal service fund, the requirement that this result in the build-\nout of the telecommunications infrastructure even to rural areas, boy, \nI think that ought to be a national requirement.\n  Those of us who come from rural areas want to say if you are going to \ncertify a new essential telecommunications area in an area that would \nbe eligible for universal service funds, we want that certification to \nbe based on a couple of themes that they think are important, one of \nwhich is this ought to result in the build-out of the infrastructure in \nrural areas. We know that build-out will occur in urban areas because \nthat is where the money is, and we are just saying we want that same \nopportunity to exist in rural areas.\n  But I am not suggesting that these three tests be limited. I think \nthat States may well find they have unique circumstances and want to \nadd additional tests or additional requirements, and I do not in any \nway want to prevent that. So I will look forward to working with the \nSenator from Alaska as we go to conference on this legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I tried to go into this a little bit last night, and I \ndo not know whether this is the time now, but I just point out to my \nfriend that the April issue of the bulletin known as Personal \nCommunications contains an article that mentions Donald Cox, who is the \nformer Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford. He has \ncalculated that digital-based station technologies will lower capital \ncosts for wireless customers to $14 compared to the current cellular \ncost of $5,555. [[Page S7951]] \n  What it really means is we have the possibility of moving into a new \ndomain as far as digital radio is concerned that will deal with \ntelecommunications competing with telephone companies. One of the \nthings in this amendment is that we will now require that the State \nmust find that there will not be a significant adverse impact on users \nof telecommunications services or on the provisions of universal \nservice.\n  I question whether at the time of the transition into these new \ntechnologies a State should have to make findings that are based upon \nthe use of the old technology. That is one of the problems. If you lock \na State into findings, I think you may hamper the transition to less \ncostly services and, of course, that is where I am coming from. That is \nwhy I support this bill. I think it will lower the cost ultimately of \nservice to rural areas by bringing in additional providers of service. \nIt should not be tied to the old wire services that we have relied upon \nin the past.\n  Mr. President, I do not have any opposition to the suggestion that we \nadopt the Senator's amendment, but I do want to serve notice that in \nconference, I may wish, because of the amendment, to modify the whole \nsection.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I have no objections to this amendment. \nI would like to point out, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, \nas well as the chairman and ranking member and the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska and others, worked very hard to try to craft this \nparticular title and this particular section of title I so as to make \ncertain that areas that are not likely to benefit from competition will \ncontinue to be served with the same high quality service that they are \ncurrently receiving.\n  This particular provision is a recognition, and I think most do \nrecognize, that competition all by itself will not work and that we do \nhave to allow competition to determine many things. But this particular \nsection I think has been very carefully put together, and it indicates \nhow an essential carrier is designated. It describes the obligations of \nthat particular carrier. It describes how we set up a multiple \nessential carrier. It describes resale enforcement and interchange of \nprinciples.\n  Madam President, earlier when I made a statement, my staff tells me \nthat I made a mistake at the beginning. If I did, I apologize. I was \npulling a quote from the chairman, and I do not know if I said Senator \nHollings or Senator Pressler, but it was the chairman's quote last \nnight, and I do not again mean to be intentionally confrontational when \nI say that statement that says, ``The overwhelming message we received \nwas that Americans want urgent action to open up our Nation's \ntelecommunications markets,'' what we are doing, in fact, is what the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota described and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Hollings, described as well. We are trying, \nwith this law, to work our way into a competitive environment and \ncreate a structure that will enable competition to occur in a fashion \nthat is minimally disruptive, but it will be disruptive.\n  Title I describes not just the transition to competition in the \nuniversal service, but it lays out all the various interconnection \nrequirements. It describes separate subsidiary safeguard requirements. \nThat is a structure that is offered as a protection. I believe the \nSenator from South Carolina in particular has been concerned about \nthat. It describes foreign investment and ownership reform, and \ninfrastructure sharing. Title I describes the removal of restrictions \nto competition, describes how that is going to occur, how we remove \nentry barriers.\n  There is limitation on local and State taxation of satellite \nservices. I might point out that for those concerned about putting a \nmandate upon the State, indeed, we are intervening with the State \nregulatory mechanism. This legislation intervenes and says--and I know \nthe Senator from Alaska understands that we are intervening, and we are \nsaying you cannot do rate-based rate of return regulation; you are \ngoing to go to price caps. You have a range of motion under price caps.\n  But we all need to understand what price caps do. It essentially \nmoves us in a direction where the market will determine what the price \nis going to be. It is a much different kind of regulatory scheme than \nwe have right now. There are many States, I guess 10 or so, on a price \ncap system of regulation. This would take the other 40 along. I do not \nobject to that. I think it is a fair and reasonable thing to do. But it \nis a relatively dramatic action to come to the State level and say that \nwe are going to require you to regulate in this fashion, and we say \nthere is a limitation on how you can tax your satellite services, and \nso forth.\n  Title I, as we remove the restrictions to competition, does lots of \nother things that I will look forward to describing at a later date.\n  Madam President, as I said, I do not object at all to the change \nasked for in this amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge adoption of the amendment, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 1259) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \ncomprehensive telecommunications legislation, S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. This \nlegislation has been incubating in the Congress for a number of years \nand throughout the past few years, the Senate has appeared to be on the \nbrink of passing this landmark legislation that would reform which is \narguably the most dynamic and fast growing industry in our economy--\ntelecommunications.\n  The underlying agenda of this legislation is to promote competition \nin all areas of telecommunications. We already have a competitive long \ndistance industry and there is some competition in cellular service \nthroughout the country. Clearly, telecommunications competition has had \na positive impact. Since the AT breakup in 1982, competition in the \nlong distance industry has lead a reduction in long distance prices and \nit has spawned the deployment of four nationwide fiber optic networks--\nthe backbone of the information superhighway.\n  This legislation attempts to promote competition in other areas of \ntelecommunications, such as in the local exchange and in cable. As a \ngeneral proposition, I support this notion of promoting competition. I \nthink competition will lead to lower prices and greater availability of \ntelecommunications services. However, Congress must proceed in caution \nas we break down barriers and ease regulation.\n  First, a one-size-fits-all approach to competition in the local \nexchange may have destructive implications. In large, high-volume urban \nmarkets, competition will certainly be positive. However, in smaller, \nrural markets, competition may result in high prices and other \nproblems. The fact is that some markets; namely, high-cost rural areas, \ncompetition may not serve the public interest. If left to market forces \nalone, many small rural markets would be left without service.\n  That is why the protection of universal service is the most important \nprovision in this legislation. S. 652 contains provisions that make it \nclear that universal service must be maintained and that citizens in \nrural areas deserve the same benefits and access to high quality \ntelecommunications services as everyone else. This legislation also \ncontains provisions that will ensure that competition in rural areas \nwill be deployed carefully and thoughtfully, ensuring that competition \nbenefits consumers rather than hurts them. Under this legislation, \nStates will retain the authority to control the introduction of \ncompetition in rural areas and, with the FCC, retain the responsibility \nto ensure that competition is promoted in a manner that will advance \nthe availability of high quality telecommunications services in rural \nareas. [[Page S7952]] \n  My second concern is that in our drive to deregulate and eliminate \nbarriers, that competition may be impeded. Currently, there are over \n500 long-distance carriers that offer service nationwide. Virtually \nevery American has a competitive choice as to what carrier they want to \nuse for long distance services. Long distance\n rates have reduced by over 40 percent in the past 10 years because of \ncompetition. The same choice does not avail itself to consumers with \nrespect to local exchange service.\n\n  The second danger we confront in passing this legislation is that we \ncould impede competition where it currently exists. Under S. 652, the \nregional Bell operating companies [RBOC's] would be permitted to \nreenter the long distance market. In the early 1980's, the old Bell \nsystem was divested because the monopoly in the local exchange \nseriously impeded competition for long distance services. After nearly \n14 years of separation from the long distance market, the RBOC local \nnetworks want to compete for long distance services. This legislation \nwill permit that.\n  The question is not whether or not the RBOC's should be permitted \ninto long distance. The question is under what conditions. \nUnfortunately, this bill is flawed in that it does not provide for an \nadequate role for the Justice Department to determine that RBOC entry \ninto long distance services will not harm what is already a \nsuccessfully competitive market.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to this legislation that will provide \nfor a role for the Justice Department. It seems to me that given the \nhistory of the AT breakup and the threat that the local exchange \nmonopolies could use their power to impede competition, the Justice \nDepartment must ensure that the appropriate conditions are present \nbefore the RBOC's can be permitted to offer long distance services.\n  In addition, I will offer an amendment that will improve the \nuniversal service provisions in the bill. Under the bill as reported by \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, only ``essential telecommunications \ncarriers'' [ETC's] would be eligible to receive universal service \nsupport. The reason is that ETC's would be required to take on the same \nuniversal service obligations as the incumbent carriers. I believe that \nthis condition is imperative to ensure that universal service is \nmaintained in rural areas.\n  However, the bill falls short in ensuring that when a State \ndesignates an additional ETC for qualification for universal service \nsupport, that the best interests of rural consumers are paramount. \nUnder my amendment, States would be required to ensure that the \ndesignation of an additional ETC in a market, that such designation: \n(a) protects the public interest; (b) promotes the deployment of \nadvanced telecommunications infrastructure; and (c) protects public \nsafety and welfare.\n  Finally, I have two other amendments that I intend to offer. I intend \nto offer an amendment that will strike the bill's provisions dealing \nwith the liberalization of broadcast ownership rules and require, \ninstead, the FCC to review and modify broadcast ownership rules on a \ncase-by-case basis. Under my amendment, the FCC would review and modify \nbroadcast ownership rules in such a way as to ensure that broadcasters \ncan compete fairly with other media sources while at the same time \nprotecting localism and diversity of voices in each local market.\n  Under the bill in its present form, the national television ownership \nlimits would be increased from the current 25 percent viewership cap to \n35 percent with permission to increase beyond that amount later. It \nseems to me that encouraging further concentration in the national \nmedia is not a desirable goal and it is my hope that we can correct \nthis provision in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the goals of this legislation are laudable. However, I \nbelieve that certain changes are necessary and I intend to work with my \ncolleagues to improve the bill and move this important legislation \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay the managers' amendment aside so our \nfriend from Arizona may offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I inquire as to the parliamentary \nsituation? The pending business is the managers' package of amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers' amendment has just been laid \naside.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I will make some \ncomments and remarks concerning this legislation, and then, if the \nparliamentary situation allows it, I will begin offering amendments.\n  I note the presence of my colleague from Alaska, who has agreed that \nwe would take up one of my amendments as soon as possible, and I will \nbe as brief as possible. But I am sure my friend from Alaska \nunderstands this is a very complex issue and one which probably, in my \nview, will have more impact on America than any other piece of \nlegislation that we will consider not only this year but for several \nyears.\n  Some estimates are that health care reform would have as little as \none-third the impact financially on America as this legislation does.\n  There is no doubt that there are tens of billions of dollars at \nstake. I personally, Madam President, have never seen an issue in my \nnow 9 years as a Member of this body have such intense and continued \nand high-priced lobbying. We have as head of one lobbying group a \nformer majority leader of the Senate. We have names who are well known \nto all of us in Washington. I doubt if there is a single lobbying group \ninside the beltway that has not had a contract at one time or another \nto lobby on this issue. All of that is not by accident. In fact, Madam \nPresident, it is because the stakes are enormously high here. One \nphrase, one comma, one or two words in the appropriate place has \nenormous and significant impact.\n  So I think this issue should be well debated. I think that there are \nopposing views as to what this legislation does, but let us not have \nany doubt about the impact of this legislation on the very future of \nour Nation. This is all about information and how Americans will \nacquire that information and how Americans will pay for it and who will \nbe eligible for it and who will not and to what degree we will regulate \nthis industry or deregulate this industry.\n  I wanted to start out by applauding the efforts of the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Pressler, who has worked on this issue not only \nas chairman of the committee but for many years. I have had the \nprivilege and opportunity of working with him. He has done an \noutstanding job. I know of no other committee chairman who has spent as \nmuch time on this issue as Chairman Pressler has. I am very \nappreciative of the work he and his staff have done. There are many \naspects of this legislation which I think are not only excellent \nmeasures but very important ones and will contribute to the \nderegulation of this industry.\n  I also would like to recognize the efforts of the distinguished \nranking minority member of the committee, Senator Hollings, who also \nhas been involved in this issue for many years. I respect his indepth \nknowledge of the issue. He and I have had disagreements about the \nphilosophy of regulation or deregulation, but there are no personal \ndifferences that we have. I not only respect but admire his advocacy of \nwhat he feels is the best type of legislation for us to pursue.\n  I understand the disappointment that the Senator from South Carolina \nfelt last year when he had worked so very hard for this legislation and \nhad it stymied at the very end of the session.\n  Before I go into details, Madam President, let me just state my \nfundamental philosophy and why these amendments that I will be \nproposing today flow from them. We need to have a deregulated industry. \nIn the past, we have deregulated the airline industry, the trucking \nindustry, the railroad industry in America, and there is very little \ndoubt in my mind that world events, as well as national events, \nindicate very clearly and very strongly that the free enterprise \nsystem, unfettered by Government interference and regulation, not only \nprospers best but provides the best services for the citizens of any \nnation, including this one.\n  The people will come to this floor and argue that the airline \nindustry is [[Page S7953]] in bad shape, that they have lost billions \nof dollars, and some of the great names in the airlines industry, like \nEastern Airlines and Pan Am, have disappeared from the scene. But the \nfact is my constituents can fly from one place to another in this \ncountry more easily and at a lower cost than they could in 1974 when \nthe airline industry was deregulated.\n  I will freely admit that I do not ride in the comfort that I used to. \nIn fact, when the four CEO's testified before the Aviation Subcommittee \nthe week before last, I wanted to relate that two mornings previously I \nhad flown from Phoenix, AZ. The airline, which will remain unnamed, \nadvertised a breakfast. And that breakfast turned out to be a banana \nand a bagel. I think that something has to be changed at least in their \ndescription of what breakfast is.\n  At the same time, I paid far less than I would have in 1974, 21 years \nago, for that airline ticket. If I had chosen to, although I would not \nhave, and paid a significant additional amount of money and rode in \nfirst class, I probably would have gotten more than a banana and a \nbagel.\n But we have deregulated those industries, and we have found that the \nless regulation and interference that exists in those industries, the \nbetter off we are.\n\n  Madam President, there are those that will argue this is a \nderegulatory bill. It is advertised as that. I do not deny that. And I \nthink some aspects are deregulatory in nature. Let me just quote from \nthe report itself, which indicates that there is a $7 billion increase \nin revenues that will be required, and a $1.5 million per-State \nadditional cost will be required to implement this law. And perhaps as \ncompelling as anything else, $82 million will be required in additional \nfunding for the Federal Communications Commission. ``CBO estimates the \ntelecommunications firms would have to pay an additional $7 billion \nover the next 5 years to comply with universal service requirements of \nthe bill and believes that these amounts should be included as revenues \nin the Federal budget.'' The managers have accounted for that with \nspectrum auction, is my understanding.\n  ``CBO estimates that enacting S. 652 would increase the spending \nrequirement for the FCC by about $81 million over the 1996-2000 \nperiod.''\n  Madam President, how can you have a bill that is deregulatory that is \ngoing to cost us an additional $81 million over a 5-year period in \norder to deregulate the industry? I do not think so. In fact, Madam \nPresident, there are additional--at least according to this morning's \nWall Street Journal, there are 80 new regulatory functions for the FCC, \nall designed, of course, to ensure fairness and competition. Eighty new \nregulatory functions for the FCC. And, of course, the most egregious of \nwhich, in my view, is the so-called public interest aspect of the bill, \nwhich, frankly, places an enormous amount of power and authority in the \nhands of the FCC.\n  Let me make it clear for the Record that this legislation is a \nsubstantial improvement over S. 1822 from the 103d Congress. With all \ndue respect, I have to say that any legislation that advertises itself \nas deregulatory and has a requirement for domestic content in it, \nwhich, according to the U.S. Trade Representative, was a direct \nviolation of NAFTA and GATT, of course, it is an insult to one's \nintelligence to call it deregulatory. So at least we got rid of the so-\ncalled domestic content aspect of it. And we have made other \nsubstantial improvements in this bill.\n  Let me note that it is an improvement, but it does little in the way \nof fundamental deregulation. Why is it that every time I talk to \nsomeone in this industry--and there are many--they say, ``I am in favor \nof total deregulation, but * * *'' There is always a ``but.'' And guess \nwhat? They have to have some kind of special dispensation for their \nindustry to make sure that they have a level playing field. Apparently, \nthe only way you get a level playing field is to have some kind of \nspecial deal for this or that segment of the industry.\n  As the Heritage Foundation noted in its report card on S. 652,\n\n       Unfortunately, while a modest improvement on current law \n     misses the opportunity to benefit consumers by opening the \n     industry to real competition, if this legislation becomes \n     law, as structured today, consumers will not be able to look \n     forward to serious telecommunications deregulation or \n     competition in the short-term.\n\n  The Heritage Foundation graded S. 652, unfortunately, albeit \naccurately--the bill scored an overall grade of a C-minus. It is my \nunderstanding that the managers are offering amendments that will raise \nthat grade somewhat. I applaud their efforts. Senator Packwood and I \nare also offering amendments which will raise the grade of the bill and \nwill result in substantially better, more deregulatory, more \nproconsumer legislation.\n  As I said before, Madam President, we will have one opportunity this \ndecade to substantially reform the telecommunications industry. I think \nwe are all in agreement that if we do not pass this bill within a \nrelatively short period of time the legislation will probably not be \nreconsidered until at least 2 years from now. And, of course, we do not \nwant that to happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that on November 8, the American \npeople demanded a change--less Government and more freedom to innovate \nand compete. S. 652, like last year's bill, is based on the belief that \nall the woes of the communication industry could be solved by the glory \nof increased regulation. History tells us that regulation binds and \nrestricts industry growth and innovation and transfers decisionmaking \nfrom entrepreneurs and thus customers to bureaucrats. These regulatory \nshackles do little to benefit the public.\n  Madam President, in free markets, less Government usually means more \ninnovation, more entrepreneurial opportunities, more competition, and \nmore benefits for consumers. This point was made exceedingly clear by \nthe Wall Street Journal when it stated on April 8, 1994,\n\n       It is truly humorous for politicians to think they can \n     somehow fine-tune or stage-manage the rapidly developing \n     world of advanced technologies that includes emerging \n     financial and corporate structure, entire armies of engineers \n     and software wizards. The people who will actually bring this \n     exciting future to life are put in lead shoes when the FCC \n     and the Congress micromanages.\n\n  Madam President, one of the arguments that will be made today by my \nfriend from Alaska is that this is a interim bill, that this is one \nstep on the path toward total deregulation. My response to that is that \nI would have to be convinced as to where that is needed and why. I note \nthat my friend from South Carolina is smiling at me. I understand that, \nsince we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina, I believe, did not support airline deregulation or \ntrucking deregulation, and does not probably support the kind of \nderegulation that I am in favor of. We have a fundamental philosophical \ndifference in the role of Government and whether the Government should \nregulate the market or let the free market play. I have heard many \ntimes my friend from South Carolina talk and how he laments that there \nis no longer the direct flights to Charleston, SC. I lament that, too. \nThere is not nearly the comfort or the convenience there used to be. \nBut the fact is--and I have provided the facts many times--that the \npeople of South Carolina can get back and forth from Charleston, and \nmost any other part of South Carolina less expensively and more \nconveniently than they ever had in the past, under Government \nderegulation. We used to have, under airline regulation, a special \nflight that went from here to a certain destination because there was a \ncertain Senator who was a chairman of a committee. That flight used to \nbe mostly empty, but that flight stayed in existence at least as long \nas that was the case.\n  It is important to note that without any regulations the television \nmanufacturing industry has managed to achieve a very high penetration \nrate for televisions in this country, even higher than that of \ntelephones. We must ask the fundamental question: Why do more American \nhomes have TV sets than have telephones? Whatever the answer, the facts \ndemonstrate that an industry can achieve virtual universal penetration \nwithout Government-imposed regulation.\n  Madam President, I want to highlight some of the problems I see with \nthis legislation. First and foremost, it is not deregulatory. According \nto estimates published by the FCC itself, this bill will require it to \ntake over 60 new regulatory or administrative actions. [[Page S7954]] \n  This bill also expands the current telecommunications service \nsubsidies scheme. As the Heritage Foundation notes,\n\n       Instead of attempting to reform or eliminate this \n     destructive subsidy system, the Pressler bill actually \n     expands its scope. For example, the bill maintains current \n     price controls, continues inefficient rate averaging, and \n     expands the telecommunications entitlements.\n  The Heritage Foundation continues:\n\n       The continuation of the failed subsidy policies of the \n     past, combined with an expanding definition of universal \n     service, mandated under the bill, places at risk almost \n     everything else the bill hopes to accomplish. Once personal \n     computers, online service, set top boxes, and other future \n     technologies become part of a package of mandated benefits, \n     to which every American must have access, it is likely these \n     technologies will be regulated and thus made less \n     competitive. Further, according to CBO, enacting S. 652 would \n     increase spending requirements for the FCC by about $81 \n     million over the period from 1996 to the year 2000.\n\n  I wish the managers would explain to me, how do you deregulate and \nincrease the cost to the enforcing agency of the enforcement of \nregulations? Is it to help them make a transition? Or is it, in \nreality, to enforce the additional 80 new regulations that are a part \nof this bill? I do not think any American would believe that a bill is \ntruly deregulatory if it costs $81 million, payable to the regulators, \nto enforce.\n  On this point, I want to again quote the Heritage Foundation.\n\n       The bill does not contain any serious discussion of the \n     future of the Federal Communications Commission. Policymakers \n     appear unconcerned with the role the agency plays in the \n     deregulatory process, and apparently do not realize it was \n     part of the problem they hope to correct.\n\n  I am going to--I hope, before we finish this bill--look at what the \nFederal Communications Commission has done when we have given them a \nbroad charter, such as determining what is in the public interest. I \nwill tell you what the record shows--that is, that they have never \nreally been able to determine what is in the public interest, and if \nthey have, their conclusion has been more regulation.\n  That is not a criticism of the FCC. That is the nature of \nbureaucracies, the nature of regulatory bodies when you set them up. \nHow should we expect anything else? That is their business.\n  The Congress should follow the model established by the congressional \nDemocrats in the Carter administration in the late 1970's when they led \nthe battle to deregulate the airlines. From the start, the future of \nthe Civil Aeronautics Board, which regulated the airline industry, was \non the table. It was well understood by most in Congress that \nderegulating the airlines would mean eliminating the CAB. A few years \nlater, the CAB was abolished.\n  Just the opposite occurs in this bill. The bill actually expands the \nability and policymaking ability of the FCC. As noted by the CBO, as I \nsaid, it will cost an additional $81 million over the next 5 years.\n  I want to enumerate some of the other problems in this bill. I \nmentioned it before, and I will mention it again, because it is really \na very crucial item. The FCC administered public interest tests, which \nallowed the FCC to use subjective criteria in determining whether an \nRBOC can compete in other lines of business. The public interest test \ngives the FCC policymaking authority. The FCC's authority and power \nshould be lessened, not enhanced. The public interest test allows the \nFCC to establish policy and control private companies and whole \nindustries. Such ill-defined discretionary power would prevent full \ncompetition in the communications industry for years, if not decades. \nIt should be eliminated, or at least amended so that compliance with \nthe competitive checklist is deemed to be in compliance with the public \ninterest test.\n  The Snowe-Rockefeller public users language in the bill should be \nstricken. The bill mandates at-cost telecommunication rates for \nschools, any medical facility, or libraries.\n  First, in my view, the Congress should not be establishing specific \nrates for specific groups. Such decisions should be made by the free \nmarket or, at a minimum, on the State level.\n  Second, many political causes that operate out of such entities, such \nas proabortion operations, would be given a federally mandated benefit \nthat others in society would not be able to receive. The provision \nshould be eliminated.\n  Mr. President, if we are interested in making sure that low-income \nindividuals have access to a telephone, we have a proposal\n that simply is to provide vouchers for those who need it.\n\n  It seems to me that to provide vouchers to those who are low income, \nAmericans who need a telephone service or anything else should be the \nrecipients directly of the ability to purchase that service. When we go \nthrough other bureaucracies, other industries, what we do is increase \nthe cost. Obviously, we distort the entire situation.\n  I intend to offer an amendment that would establish the voucher \nprogram in lieu of the urban rural subsidy scheme that currently \nexists. The current system and that envisioned under S. 652 seeks to \nensure that Americans receive telecommunication services at similar \nrates, by giving the corporations that offer such services a subsidy. \nInstead of giving subsidies often to well-to-do people, we should be \ngiving the funds directly to the needy consumer. I intend to discuss \nthis issue more fully when I offer the amendment.\n  Last, we must closely examine the universal service fund mechanism in \nthe bill. I have serious concerns about the potential of this \nlegislation, as drafted, to create a new telecommunications entitlement \nprogram.\n  Furthermore, I am very concerned that the Budget Committee has not \ndealt sufficiently with the budgetary impact of this legislation. CBO \nhas stated that the bill contains a Government mandate that will force \ntelecommunications firms to have to pay an additional $7 billion over \nthe next 5 years to comply with the universal service requirements of \nthe bill. CBO believes that these accounts should be included as \nrevenues in the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, the budgetary ramifications of this bill cannot and \nshould not be ignored. As CBO noted, the costs associated with S. 652 \nfall within the budget function 370. As such, they would increase \ndirect budget authority in function 370 by $7 billion.\n  Additionally, proponents claim that the new Federal tax contained in \nthis bill should not be counted on the budget but, instead, be \nconsidered off budget, since it is budgetarily neutral. That simply is \nnot correct.\n  CBO states that receipts generated by this bill would be on budget, \nand I believe they are correct. Regardless of how the money is used, it \nshould be counted in the budget.\n  There are those who argue that this bill saves consumers money. I \nwish that could be proven, but it cannot. In fact, the opposite appears \nto be true.\n  First, some have estimated that the current telecommunications \nsubsidy scheme totals $10 billion, and since this bill streamlines and \nmakes explicit some subsidies, that this bill results in $3 billion in \nsavings. That is not an accurate statement.\n  How much money totals in the subsidy scheme is not accurately known. \nSome state $10 billion; others claim the number is much closer to $20 \nbillion.\n  The reality is that the bulk of all this money is currently \ncontrolled by the States and is inherent in the rate scheme. In this \nbill, we are effectively federalizing $7 billion of the $20 billion. Is \nmoney saved by such action? I do not know.\n  I do know that CBO claims that it will cost $81 million to implement \nthis bill on the Federal level and $1.25 million per year per State to \nimplement this measure. I do know that the Federal Government does not \nhave an outstanding reputation for efficiency and cost savings.\n  I also know that it is impossible to estimate the future costs of \nthis legislation. The evolving definition of universal service \ncontained in the bill will allow the FCC to expand service. Any such \nexpansion of service will cost money.\n  The State of Colorado, for example, by the end of this year, will \nfinally implement a single-party dialing scheme throughout the State. \nDoing so is good for the people of Colorado. But I will want to note \nthat doing so costs money. It is not done for free.\n  Additionally, I am very concerned about the future costs of the \npublic user section of this bill. When we subsidize telephone service \nfor all schools, libraries, and medical facilities, there are costs in \ndoing so. Those costs must be borne by someone. [[Page S7955]] \n  The bill allows the FCC and a Federal-State joint board to determine \nwhat services qualify as universal service. These services are what \nthis new Federal telecommunications tax will pay for.\n  I want to emphasize after this bill passes, the FCC, not the \nCongress, will be determining how high this new telecommunications tax \nwill rise. Let me repeat this: After this bill is signed into law, the \nFCC will be determining how much is paid into the universal service \nfund. That is wrong, and the impacts are staggering.\n  Additionally, CBO estimates that the cost of the bill to State and \nlocal governments will be substantial. The CBO report states:\n\n       Implementing the provisions of S. 652 would result in \n     increased costs to most States. The bill would require States \n     to promulgate regulations, direct various audits of Bell \n     companies, and to participate in various joint Federal-State \n     boards.\n\n  CBO states, based on information from the National Association of \nRegulatory Utility Commissioners' estimates, that States will incur \ncosts approaching $125 million over the next 5-year period.\n  Again, I ask the question: What kind of deregulatory bill costs the \nFederal Government extra to implement and the State governments extra \nmoney to implement? It does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, we are moving this bill forward without fully \nunderstanding its impact, in my view, on the industry and the economy \nas a whole, and most importantly, the consumer.\n  I have been assured, Mr. President, that we will fix many of the \nbill's problems in conference. I have seen too many things happen in \nconference behind closed doors. I think there is no time, when special \ninterests have more impact in a conference behind closed doors. I have \nno confidence that this will be ``fixed'' in conference.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I hope we can improve the bill. \nDeregulation will result in winners and losers in the communications \nindustry. That is the unfortunate reality. But consumers will be the \nbiggest winners. They will have increased options and lower prices.\n  The bill we pass should result in that goal becoming a reality. If \nthe bill cannot do that, then we should amend it. If that is not \npossible, we should start again.\n  Mr. President, this morning in the Wall Street Journal, there is an \narticle called ``Locals' Access,'' and it begins with a quote that says \n``It's an inside-the-beltway game, a wise guy's game,'' a quote from \nLarry Irving, of the Commerce Department.\n  Mr. President, the article goes on to say:\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 8, 1995]\n\n                             Locals' Access\n\n       It's a harsh verdict, but after watching the House Commerce \n     Committee approve a misshapen telecommunications bill, we \n     reluctantly have to agree with Mr. Irving's assessment. The \n     once-grand enterprise of opening the Information Highway has \n     become a wise guy's game.\n       The recent committee markup was packed with lobbyists, many \n     of whom paid $1,000 for their seats by hiring a student to \n     wait in line for three days to reserve a spot. The bill that \n     emerged from this familiar Beltway bog was dripping with new \n     restrictions on competition--all of course in the name of \n     ``deregulation.'' This is what happens when Republicans \n     forget the November election and start behaving like the \n     locals.\n       The GOP decline on this issue was put in stark relief with \n     the release of a study on telecom deregulation last week by \n     the Progress & Freedom Foundation. The report, prepared by a \n     distinguished group of scholars and welcomed by Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich, sets a truly radical agenda: Abolish the FCC and \n     replace it with a smaller executive branch agency. Get rid of \n     the current regulatory hodgepodge, leaving in place only the \n     Justice Department's antitrust functions. Get the government \n     out of the spectrum business by creating ``property rights'' \n     on the I-Way. Shrink subsidies for the officially protected \n     groups down to the smallest possible level.\n       This vision, which combines Republican principles with the \n     realities of the 21st century marketplace, is what the GOP \n     should be doing--but isn't. Oh sure, Congressman Jack Fields \n     and Senator Larry Pressler--the chief architects of the \n     Republican approach--have promised that abolishing the FCC \n     will be the next item on their agenda. But after a bruising, \n     months-long battle over this telecom bill, Congress is hardly \n     likely to revisit the subject anytime soon.\n       The Fields and Pressler legislation comes to the Senate \n     floor this week, and far from phasing out the FCC, it gives \n     the agency some 80 new regulatory functions--all designed, of \n     course, to ensure ``competition'' and ``fairness.'' By taking \n     this approach, Republicans have aligned themselves with the \n     Clintonites' French Bureaucrat worldview and against the real \n     entrepreneurs.\n       In fairness, it must be said that the Republicans' failure \n     of political vision is matched and made possible by that of \n     industry. Over and over, telecom CEOs have told us that all \n     they want to do is compete without government interference. \n     But when confronted with a wide-open legislative process, the \n     temptation seems irresistible to seek provisions burdening \n     competitors.\n\n  Mr. President, having been lobbied by representatives of the \ntelecommunications industry, I can attest to that for a fact.\n\n       The problem here is a familiar one--the telecom companies \n     lean too heavily on their ``insider'' Washington \n     representatives, whose skill is chiseling arcane special \n     provisions out of an arcane process. These people are part of \n     the reason the public is cynical about Washington. The CEOs \n     know what's right, but are given to believe it's never \n     attainable. Consider ``universal service.''\n       Numerous telecom CEOs have told us how awful this \n     entitlement is: It distorts market signals. It offers huge \n     subsidies to recipients who aren't means-tested. It costs the \n     economy billions. But every CEO hastily adds: Of course, we \n     can't oppose universal service; remember the political \n     realities.\n       In short, the imagination that builds such remarkable \n     private networks and products stops at the Capitol steps. \n     Nobody is making the case to the public against universal \n     service. Where are the TV commercials pointing out that Harry \n     & Louise would be forced to subsidize telephone service to \n     their rich neighbor's summer home? Instead industry lobbyists \n     and Republicans have quietly united behind a new universal \n     service entitlement, whose cost, by CBO estimates, would be \n     $7 billion.\n       It would be a tragedy if this approach becomes law--for all \n     concerned. The telecom industry, which now represents one-\n     seventh of the economy, wouldn't create the 2.1 million new \n     jobs that real deregulation would bring by the year 2000. The \n     Republican Party would see its mantle as the party of new \n     ideas tarnished. And the American people would be delayed in \n     receiving the benefits of full competition--everything from \n     new cable channels to interactive television to services not \n     yet imagined.\n       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole have to get involved to prevent \n     their political managers from blowing this chance to \n     deregulate America's fastest growing industry. The leadership \n     should declare: Enough compromises, already. Let's get back \n     to first principles, with the Progress & Freedom Foundation \n     report an excellent place to rediscover them.\n  I want to read a letter I received yesterday from the Citizens for a \nSound Economy.\n\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing on behalf of Citizens for \n     a Sound Economy (CSE) to express our support for the \n     amendments you intend to offer during floor debate on S. 652, \n     the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995. We commend your efforts to improve the legislation by \n     streamlining regulatory review processes and taking steps to \n     rein in the current universal service system.\n       S. 652, as reported by the Commerce Committee, eliminates \n     or reduces a number of regulatory hurdles to \n     telecommunications competition, cable rate regulation, and \n     broadcast ownership restrictions. It provides spectrum \n     flexibility for broadcasters. It also eliminates some rate of \n     return regulation, and provides transition mechanisms to \n     competitive pricing, a periodic review of regulations, and \n     authority for regulatory forbearance.\n       Given the outdated regulatory scheme currently used to \n     regulate the telecommunications industry, this legislation is \n     a step forward. While we strongly urge adoption of the \n     amendments discussed below, which would strengthen the bill, \n     CSE believes the Senate should pass S. 652 even if these \n     amendments fail.\n       ``Public interest'' review. S. 652 would condition a Bell's \n     entry into the long-distance market upon a showing that the \n     company had undertaken specified steps (a ``checklist'') to \n     open its local network to competition. Even after the Bell \n     company complies with the checklist, however, the FCC would \n     have to determine whether Bell entry is consistent with the \n     public interest.\n       CSE supports your amendment to deem the public interest \n     standard to be met when a Bell company has met the \n     requirements specified in the checklist. The requirement of \n     an FCC ``public interest'' determination in addition to the \n     checklist requirements is unnecessary and will result only in \n     delay in bringing additional long distance competition to \n     consumers. Moreover, this ``public interest'' requirement is \n     ill-defined and thus invites virtually endless litigation \n     over whether Bell entry is in the public interest. Unlike the \n     public interest test, the checklist is objective, and \n     conditioning long-distance entry solely on meeting its \n     requirements provides some certainty in the process. \n     Objective criteria also reduce the temptation of existing \n     providers to use regulatory processes to protect their \n     market.\n       Universal service amendments. S. 652 takes some steps \n     toward making universal service subsidies explicit, which CSE \n     strongly supports. We also support your amendments to \n     [[Page S7956]] prevent potential unchecked expansion of the \n     current flawed system.\n       First, S. 652 mandates cost-based rates for schools, \n     libraries, and medical facilities. This provision should be \n     stricken, as your amendment proposes. The federal government \n     should not favor particular entities to receive preferential \n     rates. If local or state ratepayers wish to subsidize these \n     entities, that determination can be made at the local or \n     state level. Moreover, the community-user provision raises \n     difficult questions. For example, is a parochial school \n     entitled to the discounts? Should Americans who oppose \n     abortion be required to subsidize the telecommunications \n     services provided to an abortion clinic? Giving such benefits \n     to certain institutions in society raises questions of \n     fairness and touches upon constitutional issues. Therefore, \n     GSE supports elimination of this provision.\n       Second, S. 652 defines universal services as an ``evolving \n     level'' of services that includes, at a minimum, services \n     subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \n     customers. Your amendment would narrow this definition to \n     exclude entertainment services and telecommunications \n     equipment. There is simply no justification to require \n     consumers to subsidize access to interactive video games or \n     the purchase of computers.\n       Finally, CSE supports your amendment to require \n     congressional notification of the amount of universal service \n     contributions and of any increases. This is essential to \n     foster congressional oversight of a potentially fast-growing \n     entitlement. It also will facilitate accountability to \n     consumers who are paying for universal service support in \n     their telephone bills.\n       In conclusion, CSE supports your amendments to further \n     streamline the regulatory structure governing the \n     telecommunications industry. In addition, while we recognize \n     that S. 652 is not perfect, we urge the Senate to act on the \n     bill.\n\n  Mr. President, the Heritage Foundation also wrote a memorandum to me \nand to Senator Packwood, and I ask unanimous consent their letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Heritage Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 1995.\n     Re Improving S. 652\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Hon. Bob Packwood\n       I am writing on behalf of the Heritage Foundation \n     concerning S. 652, The Telecommunications Competition and \n     Deregulation Act of 1995, which the Senate is scheduled to \n     begin debate on as early as Wednesday morning. While the bill \n     makes considerable strides toward the liberalization of the \n     telecommunications market, the legislation is also riddled \n     with much unnecessary regulation and new mandates. Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt made this \n     clear when he announced recently that the agency ``will need \n     substantial resources'' to implement the legislation. ``We'll \n     need economists, statisticians, and business school \n     graduates,'' Hundt went on to say.\n       Although this may be the type of deregulation FCC \n     bureaucrats like, it is falls well short of what most experts \n     and consumers would view as true deregulation. I fact, a \n     recent scoring of S. 652 by the Congressional Budget Office \n     revealed the bill would require approximately $60 million in \n     additional FCC spending over the 1996-2000 period.\n       Realizing the need for a more deregulatory approach, you \n     plan to introduce a package of amendments on the Senate floor \n     that will correct much of the bill's overly regulatory \n     emphasis. Only by including amendments such as these can the \n     Senate assure S. 652 will be deregulatory in both rhetoric \n     and reality.\n       Cutting out the regulatory fat. Although S.652 makes some \n     important improvements over current law, most experts agree \n     too much regulatory fat has been added to the bones of the \n     bill. Whether it was added to appease special industry \n     interests or particular legislators makes little difference--\n     the fact remains that the bill contains dozens of new rule-\n     making powers and open-ended mandates for the FCC.\n       Your amendments would correct many of these flaws by \n     offering language that would do the following.\n       Eliminate lengthy potential delays that would result from a \n     ``public interest'' test on Baby Bell entry into new markets \n     by demanding that the FCC allow such firms to enter new \n     markets once they have satisfied a pre-determined checklist \n     of requirements.\n       End numerous unnecessary common carrier regulations by \n     requiring mandatory FCC forbearance when markets are deemed \n     competitive.\n       Sunset transitional regulations to ensure rules do not \n     become permanent fixtures.\n       Eliminate price controls and expensive mandates on carriers \n     that serve rural health care providers, schools, and \n     libraries.\n       Narrowly define universal service as basic phone service \n     and create a more efficient, pro-competitive delivery \n     mechanism.\n       Adopting these provisions would improve markedly the \n     deregulatory scope of the bill. In fact, comparing a report \n     card of the relevant section of S. 652 that your amendments \n     focus on, illustrates the magnitude of this improvement. (See \n     Table 1).\n\nA REPORT CARD ON THE PRESSLER PLAN FOR TELECOM (S. 652) WITH AND WITHOUT\n                       PACKWOOD-McCAIN AMENDMENTS                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Grade              \n                Report card item                    without   Grade with\n                                                  amendments  amendments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nElimination of barriers to entry and regulation   B-          A-        \n (telephony).                                                           \nElimination of telecommunications bureaucracy...  D-          B         \nElimination of telecommunications entitlements..  F           B+        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Many of the amendments that Commerce Committee Chairman \n     Larry Pressler (R-SD) plans to offer as part of a \n     ``manager's'' package could also broaden the deregulatory \n     nature of the bill. Specifically, if the Chairman offers \n     amendments further scaling back cable rate regulation, adding \n     more substantial broadcast deregulation, vacating the GTE \n     consent decree, eliminating asymmetrical regulations on AT, \n     as well as language broadening the scope of the spectrum \n     auctioning authority of the FCC, then this bill overall would \n     score a solid ``B''. But, again, this would be the case only \n     if all the free-market oriented amendments being proposed are \n     adopted.\n       Although the adoption of these amendments would clearly \n     improve the scores S. 652 receives, to obtain perfect marks \n     the Senate would need to include language that: \n     unconditionally eliminated all barriers to entry in every \n     segment of the market after one year; completely devolved all \n     authority for the delivery of universal service to the \n     states; repealed all cable regulations and created a clear \n     and unconstrained legal environment for the delivery of video \n     services; privatized completely the radio spectrum by \n     creating property rights in wireless spectrum holdings; \n     unconditionally repealed all protectionist foreign ownership \n     barriers; eliminated entire bureaus and departments at the \n     FCC; and made explicit mention of the preeminence of the 1st \n     Amendment in the emerging telecommunications legal \n     environment.\n       However, inevitable political trade-offs and compromises \n     probably diminish the chances such comprehensive reform \n     language could be inserted into the bill so late in the \n     legislative process. In addition, certain issues such as \n     continued downsizing of the FCC bureaucracy and the \n     privatization of the radio spectrum could be handled in \n     separate bills later this session.\n       Last chance till 1997. If the S. 652 fails to pass the \n     Senate, in all likelihood there is little chance legislation \n     would resurface until the next Congressional session in 1997. \n     Such deregulatory delay would cost both the industry and \n     consumers billions of dollars in lost economic output, higher \n     prices, and foregone job opportunities.\n       However, the overly regulatory baggage attached to S. 652 \n     would also impose significant costs on the industry and \n     consumers and, therefore, should be removed if Congress \n     desires a rapid and unfettered transition to free markets. \n     The Packwood-McCain amendments would strip out such elements \n     of the bill and facilitate such a beneficial transition. If \n     coupled with deregulatory language found in Senator \n     Pressler's amendment package, S. 652 could then be considered \n     truly ``deregulatory'' in both rhetoric and reality.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will quote from the memorandum from the Heritage \nFoundation. It says:\n\n       While the bill makes considerable strides toward the \n     liberalization of the telecommunications market, the \n     legislation is also riddled with much unnecessary regulation \n     and new mandates. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     Chairman Reed Hundt made this clear when he announced \n     recently that the agency ``will need substantial resources'' \n     to implement the legislation. ``We'll need economists, \n     statisticians, and business school graduates,'' Hundt went on \n     to say.\n       Although this may be the type of deregulation FCC \n     bureaucrats like, it is falls well short of what most experts \n     and consumers would view as true deregulation.

It shows increases in grade with this amendment.\n\n  The Heritage Foundation concludes by saying:\n\n       If the S. 652 fails to pass the Senate, in all likelihood \n     there is little chance legislation would resurface until the \n     next Congressional session in 1997. Such deregulatory delay \n     [[Page S7957]] would cost both the industry and consumers \n     billions of dollars in lost economic output, higher prices, \n     and foregone job opportunities.\n       However, the overly regulatory baggage attached to S. 652 \n     would also impose significant costs on the industry and \n     consumers and, therefore, should be removed if Congress \n     desires a rapid and unfettered transition to free markets. \n     The Packwood-McCain amendments would strip out such elements \n     of the bill and facilitate such a beneficial transition. If \n     coupled with deregulatory language found in Senator \n     Pressler's amendment package, S. 652 could then be considered \n     truly ``deregulatory'' in both rhetoric and reality.\n  That is what I am hoping we can add here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1260\n\n (Purpose: To require Congressional notification before the imposition \n            or increase of universal service contributions)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1260.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 42, strike out line 23 and all that follows through \n     page 43, line 2, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(j) Congressional Notification of Universal Service \n     Contributions.--The Commission may not take action to impose \n     universal service contributions under subsection (c), or take \n     action to increase the amount of such contributions, until--\n       ``(1) the Commission submits to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the \n     contributions, or increase in such contributions, to be \n     imposed; and\n       ``(2) a period of 120 days has elapsed after the date of \n     the submittal of the report.\n       ``(k) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on the \n     date of the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, \n     except for subsections (c), (e), (f), (g), and (j), which \n     shall take effect one year after the date of the enactment of \n     that Act.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would mandate that the \nCongress be notified in advance of any action taken by the Federal \nCommunications Commission that would result in increased receipts to \nthe Government. In other words, increasing taxes. There is a \nsubstantial debate about whether this bill mandates taxes or not. I \nbelieve it does. I believe this bill should be blue slipped by the \nHouse of Representatives due to the fact that the Constitution mandates \nthat all tax bills originate in the House.\n  According to CBO:\n\n       CBO estimates that telecommunications firms would have to \n     pay an additional $7 billion over the next 5 years to comply \n     with the universal service requirements of the bill and \n     believes that these amounts should be included as revenues in \n     the Federal budget.\n\n  What may be a receipt to many here is a tax to many in Arizona. We \ncan debate semantics for some time, whether a receipt is a tax or not. \nI do not intend to do so. But to my constituents, Government-mandated \ncollection of revenues, which we then spend, in my view and their view \nis a tax.\n  It is true many of the costs that CBO calculated in this bill \ncurrently exist. They are part of a large telecommunications subsidy \nscheme controlled by the States. That does not change the fact that we \nare now federalizing that money into some that constitutes a tax.\n  I am very concerned about this new tax. As I noted, the Constitution \nstates that all revenue measures originate in the House. I have \ncontacted the House Parliamentarian regarding this matter, and it is my \nunderstanding that they are very concerned about precisely this issue. \nAfter all the hard work of the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee--and they have worked very hard on this matter--I \nfear it may be for very little due to the tax problem.\n  Further, under provisions of this bill, not the House nor the Senate \nbut the FCC will have the ability to originate or increase taxes, \nfederally mandated taxes to be paid by companies. Either way, I believe \nthat is an abrogation of congressional duty.\n  Under the evolving definition of universal service contained in the \nbill, the FCC in conjunction with a Federal-State joint board can at \nany time change the definition of universal service. Although I applaud \nthe committee for accepting the suggestion I made for tightening the \nbill's definition of universal service, I remain concerned. However, \nthe definition is changed. The FCC in the future could mandate call \nwaiting, three-way calling, and any other number of services that no \none has yet thought of for all Americans. Such services do not come for \nfree. They come with a substantial cost.\n  The bill allows the FCC to force all telecommunications companies to \npay into the universal service fund an amount necessary to subsidize \nsuch services. And, yes, these costs, the costs of paying federally \nmandated access, will be passed on to the consumer. When American \ncompanies are taxed, when American consumers are taxed, when anyone is \ntaxed in this country, the Congress--not an executive branch agency--\nshould be making these decisions.\n  Because of the structure of the bill it is not possible to allow the \nCongress to veto FCC authority we give them. Such a legislative veto \nbill violates the Chadha decision. This amendment, however, does \nmandate that the FCC notify the Congress of its intent to raise the \nfees that it charges communications companies. The Congress could then \nact to stop the FCC. We could choose to do anything. But it is \nimperative that we know of such changes and have time to act.\n  I understand that some will state that any such changes promulgated \nby the FCC would appear in the Federal Register, and, therefore, the \nnotification requirements mandated by this amendment are not needed. I \ndisagree. We should not allow tax-for-fee increases to occur merely \nafter notification in the Federal Register. Direct notification is \nappropriate. Congressional committees should concur. That is exactly \nwhat this amendment does.\n  I ask that it to be adopted.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the managers of the bill are receptive \nto this amendment. I would ask for the yeas and nays. But I am not sure \nit is necessary to do so.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We will accept this amendment. We commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his support.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I join in recommending that it be accepted. But I want \nto point out some things to my friend from Arizona.\n  I, too, have no objection to this concept of notification of \nincreased requirements for the requirement to report if there is going \nto be increased cost for universal service and if there is going to be \nan increase in the universal service contributions.\n  I point out in the first instance that I believe the House is \noperating under a misinterpretation of this bill. If we do not enact \nthis bill, the cost of the universal service under existing law will be \nabout $10 billion. If we do enact it, it will be more than $3 billion \nless. I do not understand why the House indicated it would have an \nobjection to a bill that would reduce the existing cost of universal \nservice. Because of the change in this system the Congressional Budget \nOffice has indicated that even though private contributions do not come \nthrough the Treasury, and private expenses do not come through the \nTreasury, as I said before since it is a mandate, it would be included \nin the budget process. But I have every reason to believe, and I do \nbelieve, that the cost of these systems will decline dramatically in \nthe period ahead, and it is because primarily of this bill opening the \ndoor to telecommunications competition.\n  Again, I want to quote my friend George Gilder who indicated that \n``the computer industry will double its cost effectiveness every 18 \nmonths. The wireless conversions of digital electronics and spectronics \nwill allow the industry to escape its copper cage and achieve at least \na tenfold drop in the real price of telephonic service in the next 7 \nyears.''\n  I believe, and everything I have read comes to the same conclusion, \nwith more competition and the addition of the new technology, tumbling \nas it is, we should see an ever-decreasing cost of telecommunications \nservices. We have modified this bill so that it reflects the approach \nof the essential air [[Page S7958]] service. It is not a universal \nservice concept as exists under existing law. It is certainly not a \ntax. There is no way that this could be determined a tax. It is \ncontinuing the process that the industry itself started in the \ninterstate rate pool. The interstate rate pool to my knowledge has \nnever been included in the budget process. But because now we are \nlimiting it, the Congressional Budget Office has decided that it ought \nto be referred to in the budget process.\n  Again, Mr. President, that is merely taking into account the money \nthat customers pay and then having that money paid out pursuant to the \nprovisions of the bill. But it is not paid to the Government. Surely it \nis stretching the Budget Act, as I have said before.\n  But I do want to say to my friend from Arizona, Mr. President, I made \nsome comments about the long statement my friend made before. Let me \nsay this at the very outset. The intention of this bill is to take the \nregulation of the telecommunications service away from the courts. What \nwe have done is restored the States rights and we have reestablished \noversight in the FCC. If you want to look at the cost of the courts \nover the last 10 years under the modified final judgement and add it to \nwhat we have put out for the Justice Department antitrust operation in \nthat time, we are reducing the cost to the Government of the \nadministration of the telecommunications law because the courts will \nnot have jurisdiction over these cases that they have had before under \nthe modified final judgment.\n  I do believe that we have a series of matters we ought to discuss. \nBut I certainly want to compliment the Senator from Arizona in terms of \nhis approach of pushing further and further for deregulation. But the \nderegulation comes about as we increase competition. If we just \nderegulate the monopolies in their own areas, we will not end up with a \nkind of telecommunications competition that will bring about this \nconstant reduction in costs because of the entrance into this \ntelecommunications area of these new technologies.\n  Above all, I urge Members of the Senate to look at the studies that \nhave been made about what is going to happen as we do in fact bring in \nthe new technologies and allow them to compete. We are really not going \nto be talking about telephones. My friend from Arizona said we ought to \nhave telephone service for these people. Telephone service in the \nfuture is going to be like giving people vouchers to ride in an Edsel. \nWe are not talking about telephone service anymore. We are talking \nabout telecommunications connections which will enable people in rural \nAmerica to have computer services just like everyone else. As George \nGilder points out, the computer is going to be so pervasive that it \nwill be the means of communication for most Americans by the turn of \nthe century. It will not be telephones. There will be what amounts to \nphone connections in the computers.\n  By the way, the cost of the computers themselves is coming down at \nsuch a great rate. The cost of the base stations that will implement \nthe interconnections are coming down. If we have the ability to use the \nbroadband radio the way it has been described and use it for \ninterconnections, I tell my friend from Arizona the report from the \nFCC, if anything I would modify it and say let us know the extent to \nwhich the costs are being reduced as well as increased because the \nprogress is going to be in reduction, just as this bill reduces it by \nalmost 30 percent just by the changes we have made. The communications \nindustry itself in 7 years is going to reduce that tenfold.\n  I do not believe that we should oppose an amendment which would \nrequire a report from the FCC of increases in universal service \ncontributions.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not know whether or not this might be \nthe appropriate time for us to have a rollcall vote on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  Prior to making some comments about that amendment, I point out to my \ncolleagues that many of the things that the Senator from Arizona said \nin his statement I said last night and again today. It might surprise \nsome to hear me say this, but I, in fact, might embrace a lot of the \nthings that the Senator from Arizona is trying to propose. I do think \nif you are going to move to a competitive environment the quicker you \ncan get there the better off in many ways, and that to hold this thing \nback might make it difficult for us to get consumers to understand how \nit is we are going to adjust because there is going to be substantial \nadjustment to the changes we are proposing in a regulatory structure.\n  I must say again, as I have said a number of times, I am not getting \na lot of complaints from citizens saying, ``Gee. I do not like the way \nthis is thing is working.'' I do not get a lot of people coming to me \ntalking about enhanced services and all of that. I do not hear people \nsay the current regulation makes it difficult for technology to be \ndeployed. And I happen to be a relatively high-end consumer. I must \ntell you I have not been struggling to get existing technology, and \nhearing the companies say that it is not cost-effective.\n We are not going to provide you the kind of services that existing \ntechnology allows under variety.\n\n  It really is not that the regulation prevents them from doing it. \nThey just are not doing it. So in a competitive environment, if they do \nnot provide it to me, I will go someplace else. I will get somebody \nelse to provide the service for me.\n  As I see this legislation it is attempting to move us to a point \nwhere I at the local level--and I know competition, by the way. Let me \nstop here a little bit and define it. Competition for me means I \nchoose. If I do not like what you are giving me, I will go someplace \nelse. In my particular business, if my customers do not like what I put \non the table in front of them, they have a lot of choices, lots of \nplaces they can go. To me, the idea of competition is not AT \ncompeting with MCI or Bell Atlantic competing with CTI and all that \nsort of stuff. Those are big companies coming into a competitive \nenvironment.\n  What I think of competition is potentially a whole generation of \nentrepreneurs who are not here lobbying, by the way, that are not \ntalking to us, that are not asking for anything. In fact, if you look \nat the jobs created in the State of Nebraska in technology, they are \ncreated by businesses that have not even contacted my office. They are \ncreated by people who are not even aware of S. 652. When I am at home \non the weekend, and I say what do you think about S. 652, is it going \nto help or hurt? They say what the heck is that? I have to ship it to \nthem and show them what it is all about.\n  The new entrepreneurs that are coming in for services with the ones \nthat are likely to have customers are saying, boy, this is working; \nthis is terrific.\n  I say, as I envision competition, there are four big areas where \npeople are going to be able to compete, if we transition this thing \nproperly. One is people are going to come in and say to me as a \nconsumer you do not have to buy dial tone separately; you do not have \nto buy video separately; you do not have to buy all your information \nseparately.\n  I have about $70 or $80 for local and long-distance telephone \nservice. I have about $40 or so for cable--I do not know the exact \ndollar amount--and about $30 for other sort of published accounts, \npublished documents, newspapers, and magazines that are coming in. I \nhave $150 a month. If we deregulate properly, entrepreneurs coming \nknocking on my door or contacting me through E-mail or however they \nwant to get to me say, Bob, you are spending 150 bucks a month, we can \ndo it for $89.95, and we can give it to you in a different form, \nfaster, clearer, and better than what you are getting right now.\n  In that kind of an environment--instead of buying dial tone \nseparately, cable separately, and all these other sorts of services \nseparately, I buy them in a package--I believe the consumers will be \nexcited about it, because I believe price will go down and quality will \ngo up.\n  Second, we are going to have competition in switching. By that I mean \npeople say, well, gee, the phone is the one that is doing all the \nswitching. It is not true. There are a lot of entrepreneurs coming \nonline today that are doing switching, that have the technology, that \nhave the gear, that have [[Page S7959]] the hardware, the software in a \nremote location and they are switching long-distance calls, and they \ncan do it cheaper and do it faster and better.\n  There is going to be competition in switching. You have this idea \nthat you have somebody down in an office still sort of either doing it \nmanually or digitally, moving these packets about. Well, that can be \ndone in lots of different locations in lots of different ways and there \nis going to be competition, the second area of switching, of getting \nwhatever information you got, whatever bundle of goods and services you \nwant to move from point A to point B. They are going to get those \nbundles wherever you want and retrieve whatever you desire to retrieve \nin a most competitive fashion.\n  Third, there is going to be competition in content, if we do it \nright, if we do not yield to people who say, as the Senator from \nArizona was saying, I really like competition but could you just kind \nof protect me a little while until I figure out how I am going to \ncompete with somebody who has 2 people working in his office instead of \n2,000. How do I compete against an entrepreneur that understands that \nhe has to keep his salary down and his fringe benefits down and other \nsorts of things down in order to be able to compete.\n  The fourth area is there is going to be a tremendous amount of \ncompetition in a whole range of services. As I said, I consider myself \nrelatively high in, but this stuff still confuses me an awful lot, and \nI am going to be paying people to tell me how to connect this hardware \nwith that hardware and how to get on this network and that network, how \nto make it work inside my office or make it work inside my home--all \nkinds of questions that I am going to have on all kinds of new \nservices. There will not be one company that comes when you have a \nproblem in your home to call up and say, gee, I have a question here. \nAnd the company says, well, I can get to you next Thursday or next \nFriday or, gee, we do not really get into that kind of thing, Bob. We \nare not involved with that kind of thing.\n  That whole world, if we write the language of this law correctly, can \ncreate a competitive environment that I think will benefit consumers \nand I think prices will go down and quality will go up.\n  So I share many of the concerns the Senator from Arizona raised and I \ndeclare it right up front. It may be there is potential for compromise \nwhere it may not be so obvious that there is potential for compromise \nbetween myself and the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nOregon, who have an amendment. Unfortunately, I have not seen that one. \nWe are talking about this one smaller amendment that deals with the \nuniversal service fund, and I would like to talk about that now.\n  The universal service fund that we have right now is rather \ncomplicated. I will not even pretend to describe it to you because \nfrankly I do not understand it. But I do understand one thing, and that \nis that we do have subsidies going on to people who are not using them \nquite right. Sometimes it is used to keep the price of residential \nservice artificially low. You can go to some places in America today, \nthey are paying $6, $7, $8 for basic residential service where you go \nto a city with no universal service fund where they are paying $14. The \nbusiness rates are substantially lower and the technology has not been \nupgraded.\n  In many cases the universal service fund is not being used in a \nfashion that you think of when you hear it described. You say, well, \ngee, I need the universal service fund because I have people out there \nwho cannot afford it. Well, that is terrific; if they cannot afford it, \nlet us help them get it. The idea of a voucher may have merit. In fact, \nit may have merit to go in that direction rather than having this very, \nvery difficult to administer thing and very difficult for us to \nunderstand from our vantage point. In fact, there are an awful lot of \nus who, up until the last 2 or 3 years, were not even aware that there \nwas a universal fund being administered and checks written and \nredistributed out throughout the country, and they come and tell us \nsuch things as the entire State of Georgia as I understand it is a \nuniversal service fund. I do not know if that is true or not, but I was \ntold recently that is the case.\n  Well, I mean that just indicates how difficult it is to sit here in \nWashington, DC, with a good idea in mind; little people cannot afford \nto buy the local or residential service, making sure they are able to \nbuy the product. It is a terrifically good idea to help somebody be \nable to communicate out of their home that otherwise might not be able \nto communicate. But it is difficult for us with that good idea to put \nit in practice. And I think if we were to have a lengthy debate about \nhow the current universal service fund operates it might inform an \nawful lot of us as to why this system needs to be changed. We are \nbasically accepting the status quo, and I declare and disclose, I \nparticipated with the farm team as we tried to keep this universal \nservice idea alive.\n  As the Senator from Arizona cited, some corporate entity that he \ndiscussed this issue with, they said, well, we do not like it, but you \nknow the politics of it; we have to keep it in place, and we sort of \npresumed the same thing.\n  It may be there is the mobility of altering the way we operate that \nuniversal service fund, but let us presume for the moment that we are \ngoing to keep the universal service fund the way it is. As I said, I am \nopen to suggestions of ways to do it differently. Presuming that is the \ncase, if you look at the language of this bill, what it is attempting \nto do--and I now turn to my friend from Arizona because I really have a \nquestion as to how he sees this thing working. The idea that we have in \nsubsection (c) on page 40 of the act, which is referenced in this \namendment, is that if you are going to have a universal service fund, I \nmean if that is the idea that we are going to keep this universal \nservice fund concept alive and use that method of funding, what is \ngoing to happen is you are going to get new telecommunications \ncompanies coming into the arena.\n  The idea is they should make a contribution as well; that it should \nnot be just the phone companies or should not just be the existing \nentities that are making a contribution to the universal service fund; \nthat, in fact, it should be everyone who is now providing these new \ninformation services should be making a contribution.\n  As I see this--maybe the Senator from Alaska, who understands this \nwell, can comment--as I see what this does, it actually provides an \nopportunity for a reduction in the assessment that the established \ncarriers are paying into a universal service fund because it broadens \nthe base of contribution. That is the idea of subsection (c). I do not \nhave strong feelings against this amendment. I do not mind having the \nFCC notify. I think it makes genuinely good sense. It was blank on my \ncopy of the amendment. As I understand it, it is 120 days. The Senator \nfrom Arizona in his amendment is saying from the time notification of \nthe committee occurs and the time the assessment can occur there will \nbe a 120-day period lapse?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Will the Senator from Alaska comment? Am I right, are we \nnot trying in subsection (c) to say we are broadening the contribution \nbase? If I had new companies coming on-line providing service at the \nlocal level, they should make a fair share contribution to the \nuniversal service fund? As I say, I am not trying to oppose this \namendment, I want to make sure we do not get something in here that \nends up coming back to haunt us.\n  We are trying to actually broaden the base of the universal service \nfund contribution which should for telephone ratepayers result in a \nreduction of the levy that they currently have for a universal service \nfund payment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield to allow me to \nanswer that question, that is the intent of the bill. When new \nproviders of service enter into competition, they will contribute to \nthe fund as those who are currently providing the service. So it will \nbroaden the contribution to the fund.\n  The courts have held that the current universal service system is not \na tax. I do not view this as a tax. I view it as one of the \nrequirements to enter the system in a competitive spirit. I think CBO \nitself did not say it was a tax but said it had to be taken into \naccount in the budget process. [[Page S7960]] \n  What we are saying is those who provide the services will contribute \nto the fund. It will broaden the base, as the Senator indicated.\n  I accept the Senator's amendment. If nothing else, it will give \nCongress notice every year how the cost of this system is going down by \nvirtue of what we have done.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would, in fact, love to have the FCC provide in \nnotification some explanation of how this fund works. I would not mind \nthat at all, if I could understand the thing once and for all.\n  The question I have is really the 120-day period. Notification is not \na problem for me. The question is, does this delay? Would this have the \nimpact, do you believe, of delaying an opportunity for reducing the \nlevy on other carriers?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Nebraska, if he will yield, it is \nonly if there is an indication of an increase would the 120-day prior \nnotification----\n  Mr. KERREY. The language of the amendment says ``may not take action \nto impose universal service contributions under subsection (c), or take \naction to increase the amount of such contributions, until--''.\n  Subsection (c) is an attempt to broaden the base of contributions, to \nget new providers of services who are currently not contributing to the \nuniversal service fund to make a contribution to the universal service \nfund.\n  My concern is that if that is what we are trying to do, we could \ndelay the actual reduction that is currently being imposed on other \ncarriers. I do not know if that is right or not. I just raise the \nquestion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will say to my friend from Nebraska, \nthat is not the intent of the legislation. I can see how it would \npossibly be interpreted that way. But what we were trying to say is \nthey may change the formula, which would not have an immediate impact, \nbut then would have an impact later on.\n  That is why the first part of it says ``may not take action to impose \nuniversal service contributions.'' In other words, the immediate impact \nmay not be an increase in rates but the long-term impact would be. As I \nsay, I will glad to modify the amendment in such a fashion that if \nthere is a rate reduction, which would be contemplated in any event, \nthis would not apply.\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify the amendment to reflect the \ncolloquy just discussed between myself and the Senator from Nebraska. \nWe will write it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he can modify \nhis amendment, but the Chair will need the modification. The Chair does \nnot have the modification.\n  Mr. McCAIN. With the indulgence of the Chair, we will have it in \napproximately 1 minute. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1260, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and ask \nfor the appropriate portion to be read by the clerk. It is a new \nparagraph.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 2, after line 6 of the amendment, add the \n     following: (3) The provisions of this paragraph shall not \n     apply to any action taken that would reduce costs to carriers \n     or consumers.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 42, strike out line 23 and all that follows through \n     page 43, line 2, and insert in lieu thereof the following;\n       ``(j) Congressional Notification of Universal Service \n     Contributions.--The Commission may not take action to impose \n     universal service contributions under subsection (c), or take \n     action to increase the amount of such contributions, until--\n       ``(1) the Commission submits to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the \n     contributions, or increase in such contributions, to be \n     imposed; and\n       ``(2) a period of 120 days has elapsed after the date of \n     the submittal of the report.\n       ``(3) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to \n     any action taken that would reduce costs to carriers or \n     consumers.\n       ``(k) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on the \n     date of the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, \n     except for subsections (c), (e), (f), (g), and (j), which \n     shall take effect one year after the date of the enactment of \n     that Act.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope that will satisfy the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. It most assuredly does. I appreciate the change made, and \nI believe it is an improvement. I have no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  So the amendment (No. 1260), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1261\n\n       (Purpose: To prevent excessive FCC regulatory activities)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Packwood, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. \n     Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 1261.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 90, line 6, after ``necessity.'', insert: ``Full \n     implementation of the checklist found in subsection (b)(2) \n     shall be deemed in full satisfaction of the public interest, \n     convenience, and necessity requirement of this \n     subparagraph.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that my colleague from Alaska \nhas a very important commitment. He wanted this amendment raised at \nthis time. I am more than happy to do so. I understand that it is a \nvery important one, in his view. As always, I look forward to vigorous \ndiscussion of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would clarify the role of the FCC \nregarding public interest tests contained in the bill. It is supported \nby Senators Packwood, Craig, Abraham, Kyl, and Gramm and a letter \nsupporting this amendment was signed by Senators Packwood, McCain, \nCraig, Burns, Kyl, Gramm, Hatch, Thomas, and Breaux.\n  As S. 652 is currently drafted, it contains two substantial hurdles \nfor a regional Bell operating company before the company can fully \ncompete in any marketplace. I believe the consumer would be better off \nif such hurdles did not exist and companies were allowed to compete at \na date certain.\n  I understand that some believe there is a need for a competitive \nchecklist. Originally, the approach that others and myself favored \nallowed competition at a date certain. It was my understanding, in \ndealing with my colleagues on this issue, that the compromise would be \na checklist that the regional Bell operating companies would have to \ncomply with.\n  During the compromise, obviously, that changed. And so in addition to \nthe checklist, we went back and placed judgment of this in the hands of \nthe FCC in the form of public interest.\n  Entrepreneurs, not the Congress, nor the FCC, should make these kinds \nof decisions, in my view. Neither I nor anyone else in the Senate wants \nthe FCC to act contrary to public interest. My concern is that \ndifferent individuals will have different interpretations of what is in \nthe public interest. I strongly believe that our interpretation and \nthat of the commissioner of the FCC would be different.\n  A finding of public interest is an ill-defined, arbitrary standard \nwhich implies almost limitless policymaking authority to the FCC. The \npublic interest test gives the FCC policymaking authority. The purpose \nof this bill should be to lessen the FCC's authority, not to enhance \nit. The public interest test allows the FCC to act to establish a \npolicy and control private companies and whole industries. I believe \nthat it can prevent full competition for a very long period of time. \n[[Page S7961]] \n  The bill States that the FCC must find that allowing a Bell company \ninto other areas of business is ``consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience and necessity.''\n  Mr. President, this amendment would not radically change this bill. \nIt preserves the competitive checklist that everybody agrees will \nensure that local markets are open. Competition is in the public \ninterest. I do not think we need the FCC to tell us that. The amendment \nwill pare down the bureaucracy envisioned by the bill. As FCC \nCommissioner Hunt stated, ``The FCC will need substantial resources to \nimplement this legislation. We will need economists, statisticians, and \nbusiness school graduates.''\n  I do not know how much of the additional $81 million that will have \nto be spent by the FCC in order to implement this spending legislation \nwould entail in determining what is in the public interest. But I would \nimagine that, given my knowledge of the nature of bureaucracies, it \nwould consume a very large amount of money. And as the Commissioner of \nthe FCC himself has stated, ``We will need economists, statisticians \nand business school graduates.''\n  I am sure business schools around the country are pleased to note \nthat there will be new job openings. However, I would like to see that \nemployment in the private sector rather than on the taxpayers' payroll.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burns be added as \nan original cosponsor to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I know that this issue is a contentious one. I \nalso understand that there is substantial and significant opposition to \nthis amendment. But the whole thrust of this amendment, in my view, is \nto accelerate what is the stated goal of the legislation, which is a \nderegulatory climate, and one which has less and less Government \ninterference and regulation, rather than a continuum, where a somewhat \namorphous definition of public interest which is defined not by those \nwho are competing, not by consumers or the Members of this body, but an \nunelected bureaucracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. First let me thank my friend from Arizona for his \ncourtesy. I understand Senator Packwood and others wish to speak on \nthis matter. I have a long-standing appointment that I think is very \nimportant to the national defense. I do wish to make that appointment. \nI am pleased that we can take up this amendment now.\n  I would like to set the stage a little bit for the amendment, because \nI think Members may not understand the context of the Senator from \nArizona's amendment.\n  This bill adds a new section, section 255, to the Communications Act \nof 1934. This will set forth the process for the entry of regional Bell \ncompanies into long-distance services. This is the provision that \nbrings to a close the restrictions of the modification of final \njudgment.\n  This section has been the most controversial section in this bill. It \nhas been the subject of intense negotiation between all segments of the \nindustry. As the Senator from Arizona mentioned, there are some people \nthat have been involved in it for a long, long time, that are coming \nback to talk to us about it. Members of the Senate have been involved \nnow for well over 2 years in the whole negotiation of this section. It \ngoes back to the days when the Senator from South Carolina was \nchairman.\n  By necessity, the language in this bill represents a compromise \nbetween a series of competing viewpoints.\n  Under the language of the bill, a regional Bell company may provide \nlong-distance service when the FCC determines that the Bell company has \nfully implemented a specific checklist, which is found in the bill, \nwhich the Senator from Arizona mentioned; that the Bell company has \ncomplied with the separate subsidiary requirements; and the approval is \nconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. It is \nthis last concept that the Senator from Arizona wishes to change.\n  This determination by the FCC must be made on the basis of the record \nas a whole, after a public hearing and consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, and is subject to the substantial evidence standard of review \nby the courts.\n  Let me point out that, although CBO has scored that this bill will \ncost, I think, $61 million over a 5-year period--more than the current \nFCC requirements--it does not score the decrease in costs of the \ninvolvement by the Attorney General or the involvement by the courts. \nSo this is one of the penalties of the system that we operate under. \nBut it is not a significant amount when one looks at the total amount \nof revenue being brought in now by the FCC under the spectrum auction \nconcept that I authored, which will reach $10 billion in the near \nfuture. I think that the $61 million over a 5-year period, compared to \nthe billions of dollars they will bring in--and more will come in under \nthis bill than if the bill is not enacted. But we do not score that \nunder the budget process, Mr. President. So it is a very difficult \nthing to handle.\n  Some argue that the three-pronged test is too difficult--that there \nshould be no discretion left to the FCC to consider the public \ninterest. Others argue--I am sure you are going to hear this--that it \nis too weak, and that an independent review and approval by the \nDepartment of Justice is necessary to protect the public interest.\n  In other words, I think you are going to have an amendment come in \nhere that is the opposite of what Senator McCain wishes--to delete the \nFCC's involvement--to one that says the FCC's requirement is not \nenough, that we must also have the Attorney General involved to protect \nthe public interest.\n  In my judgment, this compromise we have worked out is just right. The \nFCC has a long history of considering public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity. That was the bedrock principle of the 1934 Communications \nAct.\n  In order to transition to this new era and take the courts out--\nbecause under the modified final judgment, the courts have been \ndetermining communications policy through administrative hearings under \ncourt jurisdiction. In order to take them out, the parties involved \nwanted to be assured that, at least for this transition period, the \noversight role of the FCC would be restored. And the determination by \nthe FCC in this case is subject to a heightened standard of review.\n  Now, mind you, we have not just put it back to the way it was before \nthe modified final judgment. It is no longer a case of the FCC not \nbeing arbitrary and capricious, which is the standard under a long \nseries of precedence in the courts; the FCC must have substantial \nevidence on the record as a whole to support a decision to either grant \nor deny a request by a Bell company to enter a long-distance market.\n  In other words, in this compromise, the FCC comes back, the matter is \ntaken from the courts, it comes back to the FCC, but under a standard \nthat was stronger than it was before the FCC's jurisdiction was removed \nto the courts under the modified final judgment.\n  That evidence must support any determination by the FCC that the \napproval is not in the public interest, just as it must support any \ndecision that the approval is in the public interest. To make any \nfinding under this provision, the FCC must have substantial evidence. \nThat means there will be an opportunity for all to be heard. That may \nbe what has caused the $61 million over 5 years increase in costs to \nthe FCC.\n  This is a heightened standard of review, and it is a double-edged \nsword that will accomplish one of the main goals of the bill, and that \nis to end the rule of the courts over telecommunications policy in this \ncountry.\n  I think that the substantial evidence standard will prevent abuse by \nthe FCC of the public interest review, just as it will help protect the \nFCC decision in the grant of approval from a suit by competitors.\n  If the Senate takes out the public interest test and asks the FCC to \nbase their decision only on the statutory checklist, I think that would \ninvite abuse. Instead of considering the checklist on the merits and \naddressing any policy concerns in the public interest portion of the \nreview, the FCC would have no alternative but to try to manipulate the \nchecklist if they feel the application should be denied on policy \ngrounds. [[Page S7962]] \n  Likewise, I think the courts would have an incentive to question the \nfact-finding process used by the FCC in making the determination solely \non the basis of a checklist.\n  Now, I do believe if the court wants to find the process inadequate, \nwe would be right back where we are now with the courts taking \njurisdiction once again over the decisions and affect the \ntelecommunications policy of the country.\n  The checklist contains 14 technical requirements for interconnection \nand unbundling of the Bells' local exchange networks. However, the list \nis not self-explanatory or self-implementing. One of the requirements \nis there must be the capability to exchange telecommunications between \ncustomers of the Bell company and an interconnecting carrier.\n  Now, I believe the reading of the checklist itself shows where the \nFCC is going to be involved in discretion in some way. The Senator from \nArizona argues that the checklist is all that is needed and it should \nbe straightforward for the FCC to implement. Paragraph 4 of subsection \n(b) of this bill specifically prohibits the FCC from limiting or \nexpanding the terms of the checklist.\n  But the trouble is, how will the FCC decide that the capability to \nexchange communications exists? If we have just the checklist and the \nFCC decides that the capability to exchange communications efficiently \ndoes not yet exist, then it would be off to the courts again, because \nobviously no person that seeks approval of the FCC is going to take \nthat denial without going to court. As a matter of fact, no protester \nis going to take the denial without going to court. I say it should \nonly go to court with the increased standard that exists under this \nbill.\n  If it goes to court, the court will decide if the broad terms of the \nchecklist have been met. They will second-guess the FCC in endless \narguments over what the FCC based its decision on.\n  Our provision is clear, and will prevent abuse by both the FCC and \nthe courts.\n  One of the reasons the FCC must be involved is to ensure that there \nis a concept of understanding of what is the public convenience and \nnecessity, whether or not anyone is going to be harmed by the \navailability of the new service, and under what conditions those people \nare going to be harmed.\n  Now, we are going into a whole new concept of how rates are computed. \nWe are going into a whole new concept of how service is provided. I \nbelieve that the gatekeeper in this process, in this period we are in \nnow, must be the FCC, but under the standards we have agreed to now, \nwhich are higher standards than the FCC has had before and certainly \nhigher than even the courts have followed under the period of the \nmodified final judgment.\n  In other words, I tell my friend, we do have the occasion of being \nopposed here on the floor quite often. I understand what the Senator \nwants to do, but again I am hopeful that we succeed in not making the \nchanges that the Senator from Arizona wants at this time because I \nthink without this bill the final step of the integration of Alaska and \nHawaii with the rest of the United States will not come about. Without \nthis bill we will not have the stimulus, the development of this \ncompetition between the regional Bells and the long distance carriers, \nbetween the Bells themselves, and even more than that, between \nproviders of new communication, through new technological systems that \nI think will ultimately lower the cost for everybody.\n   Let me, in closing, say this to my friend from Arizona: One of the \nthings that has gotten me involved in this over the years is that when \nI came to the Senate, on every advertisement concerning phone service \nwas a little tag line at the bottom of the television or on the radio \nannouncement saying ``Not applicable to Hawaii and Alaska.''\n  My friend Senator Inouye and I, serving on the Commerce Committee, \nstarted what we called rate integration from the offshore States. That \nled, really, into a whole concept of what that meant, why we had higher \ncosts to start with and how we could bring about a reduction in the \ncosts of communications to our States and at the same time an increased \namount of service.\n  Actually when I came to the Senate, the Army was running the \ntelephone service for Alaska. Alaska communication service was an Army \nconcept. We brought about the sale of that to a private carrier, and \npart of that sale was a commitment that telephone service would be \nexpanded rapidly within the State of Alaska. That has been done--but \nnot totally even yet.\n  One of the reasons I am deeply involved in this, I say to my friend \nfrom Arizona, is I still believe that the process we are going through \nis decreasing the cost. I think we can show that the whole process, \neven of rate integration that Senator Inouye and I instituted, brought \nabout a reexamination of the interstate rate pool, a determination \nthat, yes, it could be expanded to Alaska and Hawaii. It was expanded \nto Hawaii first, and it is still being expanded to Alaska.\n  As that came about, the contributions from individual consumers rate \npool has declined in the past. It will continue to decline now. It was \na private mechanism, integration of the telephone service. It continues \nto be a private mechanism under this bill. But with the competition \nthat this bill now will bring in to the providers of telephone service \nper se, communication service will come through satellite service, like \nDBS; it will come to us through radio service; through fiber optic \ncable, in one instance; through the old links that are there, the \nsystems that have existed even before we became a State.\n  What I am saying is that the net impact of this bill will be the \ncompletion, really, of the process that Senator Inouye and I started in \ntrying to integrate Alaska and Hawaii totally into the telephone system \nof the United States.\n  When this bill passes, there will be no distinction between the \nservice to any portion of the country. We will have the concepts of \ntelecommunication and the freedom to enter and compete, to bring new \ntelecommunication systems into the arena, and to have the ability to \ncompete with existing carriers, existing carriers whose costs of \ninstallation may have been a magnitude of 10 for 100 times what the new \nservice will be.\n  My request to the Senate is that the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona be defeated. Again, I hope the time comes when we are both in \nthe Senate when we can join together and say we passed through this \ninterim period and it is time to totally deregulate telecommunications \nof this country.\n  I think we will live to see that day. I do not think it is here now. \nI do not think it will even come about without this bill, because \nwithout this bill we are still under the courts. This is the bill that \ntakes back to the legislative process the regulation of the \ntelecommunications industry in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nallowed that he and I had different philosophies. He is right. But let \nme talk about different facts, which brings about a confidence in this \nparticular Senator's philosophy.\n  As the Senator from Arizona was talking about the improvements of \nderegulation in the airlines we went out and doublechecked. If you want \na round trip ticket on USAir, Charleston, SC, to Washington, it is \n$628. But if you want to go 500 miles further, right across Charleston \nto Miami and back to Washington, it is only $658. Miami is 1,000 miles \naway, Charleston is a halfway point at 500 miles. So what you have in \nessence--and this is the fact, not the philosophy, and it is a very \nunderstandable one--you go an additional 1,000 miles just for $30.\n  It is what you call economies of distance in the airline industry. \nFearing this, listening to certain experts at the time--Senator Howard \nCannon, of Nevada, was the chairman of the Commerce Committee. I was \nengaged then in a communications bill. I was chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Communications and I could not make all the hearings \nand check. I said, ``Be sure the small- and medium-size towns are \nprotected.''\n  He said, ``Oh, yes, we have the protection. We have the protection. \nDo not worry. This is going to work in the public interest.'' \n[[Page S7963]] \n  And the opposite, of course, has been the fact. The fact is, yes, I \nhad three airline routes coming up, three direct to Washington and \nthree going back with National Airlines. I now have only one. For a \ntime I had none. We worried about National Airlines continuing. They \nsold out to Pan Am. National is gone. We wondered about Pan Am's \nsurvival. Pan Am is gone. We wondered about Piedmont and Piedmont is \ngone. Air Florida crashed out here. And the very rights, the slots that \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona and I debate, were sold off by \nAir Florida, and we lost those landing rights that had been premised \nand founded on public convenience and necessity.\n  What has happened in the transportation industry, both by truck and \nairlines and otherwise, is the public convenience and necessity--the \ncommunities got the airports and facilities and developed them. They \nenticed an airline to come along with them to Washington. They had \nhearings before the old Civil Aeronautics Board. And on the basis of \npublic convenience and necessity, proper service at an affordable \nprice, they were awarded the routes and the carriage and everybody was \nmaking money, holding fire. The equipment was sound. They were \ncompeting. And everyone was happy until someone came to town with this \nvirus to get rid of the Government, deregulate, deregulate, deregulate.\n  So what has happened is exactly what we feared. I voted for airline \nderegulation, so I am a born-again regulator. I learned anew there is \nno education in the second kick of a mule. I can tell you here and now, \nI have learned the hard way, trusting going with the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona in doing away with convenience and necessity of \nthe public. Because we go right immediately to what has occurred. What \nhas occurred, the fact is that all of the American airlines are on the \nropes. And who is taking over? The regulated ones. KLM is coming over \nand coming in and saving Northwest. British Air is saving USAir. Those \nare all the regulated airlines in Europe are taking over the so-called \nderegulated where we are running around like ninnies: Deregulate, \nderegulate, market forces, market forces.\n  It is just like this silly trade crowd running around hollers about \nfree trade. Free trade, free trade--there is no such thing as free \ntrade. The Japanese mercantilist, protectionist system is taking us \nover.\n  I was talking last night with the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey. He was talking about Bellcore and the research. Do not worry \nabout Bellcore. The Japanese are right next door, hiring the same \nresearch scientists from Bellcore like gangbusters. They do not have to \nmove. They are in the same homes. Their children go to the same \nschools. And they are taking it over.\n  We are against industrial policy. We run around saying we cannot have \nindustrial policy. We have the Japanese industrial policy here. That is \nwhat we have. How much do you think it costs for that Lexus? $55,000. \nHow much does it cost back in Tokyo? It costs $85,000. And that is why \nI oppose the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, because the size, \nthe financial size can take over here.\n  How are you going to regulate? We are not against size in the Bell \nCompanies, but they built themselves up into the largest financially-\nwealthy-sized company that you can find in this country. On cash flow, \nthe average, for example, AT, is 19 percent cash flow margin. The \ncash flow margin of a Bell Company is 46 percent. Why do you think the \nBell companies are not all in with zeal for a communications bill? Who \nwants to get out of a cash flow margin of 46 percent to get into a \nbusiness that is 19 percent? Come on. So, if one is going to occur, \nthey want to make darned sure that it occurs very, very gradually.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona is that if you take off \nthis convenience and necessity, then they can get down this checklist \nthey have about the unbundling, interconnection, dial parity--go right \non down the checklist. But using their size they come like Japan. They \nwill have loss leaders, as we call it.\n  I practiced law in the antitrust courts for a large grocery chain, \nthe Piggly-Wiggly, in South Carolina. We got up to 120-some stores. \nThey said we had a loss leader for a half-gallon of milk. We proved \notherwise, but I had to go all the way to the Supreme Court to prove \nit. So we know about Robinson-Patman. We know about Sherman. We know \nabout the Clayton Act.\n  But the public convenience and necessity goes to the philosophy and \ndifference. The distinguished Senator from Arizona, when he says \npolitics and politicians take over--I think it was Elihu Root--I hate \nto quote a Republican--but Elihu Root, the Republican Secretary of \nState for Teddy Roosevelt, who said that politics was the practical art \nof self government, and someone has to attend to it if we are going to \nhave it. And going along talking he concluded with a very cogent \nobservation: ``The principal ground for reproach against any American \ncitizen should be that he is not a politician.'' In representative \nAmerica we all count. In this particular body that is what we are here \nfor. We are representing the public convenience and necessity.\n  I know one way we can agree. The Senator from Arizona and I will \nagree we have the best communications system in the world. He nods.\n  ``Let the record show, if your Honor please, that the witness \nnodded.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I have the Communications Act of 1934 in my hand \nand I can read from it, I understand the Senator from Alaska has other \ncommitments.\n  But I have it documented. Reading here again, as the Senator from \nArizona was speaking, it appears 73 times-- the ``public interest'' and \n``convenience.'' In title I of the 1934 act it appears five times; in \ntitle II of the act, eight times; in title III of the 1934 act, 43 \ntimes; in title IV, one time; in title V, zero times, but in title VI, \n12 times; in title VII four times. Seventy-three times back in 1934 \nwhen they believed in Government, when the Government at that time was \ntaking this ``market forces, market forces,'' throwing us into the \ndepths of the Depression. The Government saved us, and got us out of \nthe Depression and saved this great United States of America. The minds \nof the representatives of the people here in this Congress were \nthinking right. They were thinking the public interest, public \nconvenience and necessity--73 times.\n  So it is that as we come here the networks all came to Washington--\nABC, NBC, CBS, and the rest. And on the basis of public convenience and \nnecessity were licensed to use the public spectrum. The public \nconvenience and necessity has gone along all the way, and we cannot do \naway with it. We are never going to pass a communications bill in this \nCongress, I am convinced, with these kind of market forces--\n``deregulate, deregulate, market forces controlling.'' On the contrary, \nwe want to get out of the way of the technology. A new technology could \ncome in that we do not know about.\n  The Senator from Alaska is reading very interesting articles which \nare being written in these various magazines, and communications \neditorials. Yes. There could be a takeover by computerization from \ntelephones. What will happen there about the public convenience and \nnecessity? It will not be a checklist down there for computers. We have \nthe unbundling and all the checklists. But there still has to be that \nFCC, the public airwaves, the public being protected and particularly \nfor universal service.\n  So we are very supportive, very strongly of the philosophy that the \nmarket forces are best. We have found that there are many instances, \nparticularly in public transportation, public health, public safety, \nand public communications that, as I said on yesterday or last evening \nwhen we opened up, the one industry, the communications industry, was \nthe one that came and begged for regulation. They were not begging for \nmarket forces. They tried it on for size.\n  I will go back two sentences. Our friend David Sarnoff was on top of \nthat Wanamaker Building at the sinking of the Titanic. He picked up the \nactual radio signal, directed some of the rescues, picked up the names \nof survivors, stayed on station there for some 72 hours. And everyone \ngot themselves a wireless. By 1924, everybody had a wireless. So nobody \nhad a wireless because they just jammed the airwaves. So they came to \nHerbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce. And they said, \n[[Page S7964]] ``Mr. Secretary, for Heaven's sake, regulate us.'' The \nmarket force of the people's spectrum up here is jammed. No one can get \nno one. As a result, we passed the 1927 act, and then the formative \nact, of course, in 1934.\n  So we wanted to take hold of our senses here in the National \nGovernment as we try to get ourselves out as a roadblock to the \ninformation superhighway, because the technology is on course, and the \nsuperhighway is already being developed. We in Congress can go home and \nadjourn for 10 years. They are going to get it. But whether they are \ngoing to get it in a monopolistic fashion, and whether concerned about \nthe rural areas, about the less-populated areas, concerned about the \ngeneral public convenience and necessity against monopolistic practices \nand prices, they can come in.\n  I can tell you right now. If I ran one of those Bell companies, you \nwould just deregulate everything. I would go down the checklist, and if \nyou did not have this public convenience and necessity provision in \nhere, I lost leave of you. I would price it below cost. Just go like \nthey are pricing this Lexus. I got a Toyota Cressida. I just checked \nthe price of that--$21,800 in downtown Washington; $31,800 in Tokyo. \nLook at Business Week at the end of the year. Last year, they took \nover--in spite of Detroit's comeback, having a quality product, and \nmaking big profits--the Japanese took over 1.2 percent additional of \nU.S. market at a loss of $2.5 billion.\n  You give me one of these Bell companies and the checklist, and I got \nit. I can comply with it. But I can put you out of business unless you \nhave public convenience and necessity. This is what the Bell companies \nwant so they can run amuck.\n  The other one is going to come with the Department of Justice. My \nsenior colleague is going to come with it. That is the long-distance \ncrowd. So they can muck it up over there at the Justice Department.\n  So you have the Bell companies wanting a little. And we have the \nlong-distance crowd wanting a little favor over here. We have not tried \nto fight them. For what? The public convenience and necessity.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a time be \nset for a vote on this at 2:15 and that the time from now until then be \nequally divided between the Senator from Arizona and myself. I would \nlike to vote at 1:30. There is a Senator at the White House, another \nSenator wants to speak at 2 and cannot; no amendments, and an up-and-\ndown vote, at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, I always appreciate the \neducational experience of listening to the Senator from South Carolina \non a broad variety of issues, including the airlines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator reserve the right to object?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would like to lay aside my request until we hear from \nthe leader. And then the Senator will yield to me to ask unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the request withdrawn?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, temporarily.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If there is anyone who would ever be interested, I would \nenjoy a long, extended public debate on the issue of airline \nderegulation, although that is not the issue before the Senate today. I \nfelt compelled to call the travel organization here in the Senate. And \nthe Senator from South Carolina might be interested in knowing that \nthere are six USAir flights between Dulles and Charleston, and three \nUnited Airlines flights between Dulles and Charleston, and many of \nthose seats are available for $249. I will find out and submit for the \nRecord what exactly that cost was in 1974 before the deregulation of \nthe airlines.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote \noccur on this amendment, and no further amendments, up or down, at \n2:15, and that the time between now and then be equally divided between \nthe Senator from Arizona and myself, and that all Senators be on notice \nthat the vote will occur at 2:15. I think we have accommodated \neverybody. We have to move this bill forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have to momentarily object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I informed the Senator from Alaska that one of the \nSenators requested that we hold it until 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators McCain and Packwood, in offering this amendment to define the \npublic interest test.\n  As currently written, S. 652 gives the Federal Communications \nCommission in my opinion exceptionally broad discretion in defining a \nBell company's fitness to provide interLATA long distance services.\n  The bill authorizes the FCC to block, if you will, the Bell companies \nfrom offering interLATA services if it deems that their entry into the \nlong-distance business is not ``in the public interest''--even after \nfull compliance with a comprehensive interconnection and unbundling \nchecklist, which is now included in S. 652.\n  The current language in the bill gives the FCC an open field to \ninterpret the public interest standard any way it wishes. The FCC \ncould, for example, decide that a market share test is required before \nBell company entry into long distance on the grounds that the test is \nin the public interest.\n  A market share test in my opinion is anticompetitive and will only \nserve to prolong long-distance competition. It would put the fate of \nthe Bell companies' long-distance plans in the hands of their \ncompetitors. And in a market environment, it is always amazing to me \nthat somehow Federal regulations would allow that kind of thing to \nhappen. Potential competitors could choose to delay their own entry \ninto the local phone market in order to prolong the entry of one of the \nBell companies into the interLATA market.\n  In order to avoid the potential abuse of the public interest \nstandard, it should at a minimum state that any kind of market share \ntest be barred from the FCC's consideration of this standard.\n  Mr. President, of particular concern is the extraordinary time and \nresources it takes for the FCC to make a public interest determination. \nThe FCC's typical review process includes hearings and rulemakings and \ncomments and replies and painstaking analyses. The committee report on \nS. 652 states that the public interest test for all Bell company \nprovisions of long distance service must be based on substantial \nevidence on the record as a whole.\n  The report goes even further than the current FCC public interest \nstandard by requiring the applications of heightened judicial scrutiny \nof the substantial evidence standard as opposed to the lesser arbitrary \nand capricious standard. In other words, in a bill that is deregulatory \nin some areas, Mr. President, this appears to be a bill that in this \narea is even more regulatory. And that is, of course, exactly why this \namendment is now in this Chamber.\n  In an industry where new technologies are evolving at a record pace, \nthis regulatory bureaucracy is counterproductive and it unnecessarily, \nin my opinion, delays delivery of beneficial services to the customers. \nAnd I would suggest, Mr. President, we are in the Chamber today \ndebating a new world for the consuming public and not a new world for \nthe companies involved, if that, of course, is the intent of S. 652.\n  A case in point is the history of cellular phone technology. Back in \nthe 1970's, AT asked the FCC to allocate spectrum for the development \nof cellular services. Because of all of the encompassing nature of the \npublic interest test, it took a decade--let me repeat, it took a \ndecade--for the FCC to determine how best to allocate the spectrum.\n  Now, that is a 10-year delay in the ability of a communications \ntechnology that has become one of the fastest growing consumer products \nin America's history. Of course, we know, since the day we entered the \ncellular world, we have seen more growth in 10 years and more \nproductivity and more jobs than the bureaucratic nightmare of the 10 \nyears it took to open up the marketplace.\n  Another example of how time consuming and labor intensive the public \n[[Page S7965]] interest test can be is to look at video, the concern \nover video dial tone. The Commission first addressed the idea of \nadditional cable TV competition from television companies in early \n1991. It has taken more than 4 years for the FCC to create a general \nframework for video dial tone, and with each successive ruling more and \nmore constraints have been placed on telephone companies wishing to \noffer cable TV services.\n  That is not the way to foster competition. And it is not giving \nconsumers the additional cable choices they have all asked for and they \nthink in a free market they ought to be able to receive. In effect, the \nFCC 4-year delay has prevented robust competition in the cable \nindustry. I would argue that this is hardly in the public interest and \nyet, in this legislation, that kind of bureaucracy would largely still \nexist and might even be enhanced over current law.\n  Cable industry competition would have been far preferable to the \nstifling regulations that have been imposed under the 1992 Cable Act. \nMy last example concerns the Commission ruling in the mid-1980's \nallowing telephone companies to provide new services like voice mail \nthat enhanced basic telephone service. In other words, some people \nwould ask you today: What did we do before voice mail? Well, I will \ntell you what we did. We had a great, complicated process in many of \nour offices just to get communications through to the individual, and \nwhere you did not have the ability to hire the person to take the phone \ncall, often your phone went unanswered or a call went unreturned. \nToday, we know voice mail works marvelously well.\n  Boise, my State capital, was among the first US West cities to offer \nvoice mail service, and the service is now available from telephone \ncompanies across the Nation. It is clear to me that services like voice \nmail provide real benefits to consumers and to businesses yet, even \nafter a decade, the public interest issue is still unresolved.\n  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has twice questioned the FCC's \npublic interest determination when it allowed telephone companies to \noffer new services to consumers. Because of the legal situation \nsurrounding these FCC orders issued nearly a decade ago, phone \ncompanies are currently offering voice mail and other services under, \nbelieve it or not, a special waiver--not a standard rule of the \nmarketplace, but a special exception or a special waiver.\n  Mr. President, with the heightened public interest standard included \nin S. 652, a decade-long wait for cellular service or resolution of \nvoice mail issues, believe it or not, could take even longer while the \nconsuming public believes that now to be a standard of the industry.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to share a few quotes \nfrom a March 8, 1995, paper on S. 652 entitled ``Deregulating \nTelecommunications,'' written by Thomas Hazlett from the University of \nCalifornia, Davis.\n  In this article, he reviews the public interest standard.\n  While he praises the deregulatory provisions included in the bill, \nand there are some and they deserve to be recognized, he qualifies that \npraise by stating that the bill, through the inclusion of the public \ninterest test, ``fails to move us beyond the highly regulatory paradigm \nunder which we live today.'' Hazlett argues that S. 652 retains the \nsource of all anticonsumer policies since the 1934 act that we are now \nchanging under this legislation, the public interest test. He states \nthis:\n\n       This is not a proconsumer standard. This fundamental defect \n     is further revealed in the bill's [four] announced \n     objectives: Nowhere is consumer protection listed as a goal \n     of this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that. In a bill that is argued to be \npositive for consumers, nowhere in this bill is consumer protection \nlisted as a goal of the legislation. I think this is wrong, and Mr. \nHazlett says he believes it is wrong, also.\n\n       Indeed, the very first aim of this or any \n     telecommunications policy should be: ``Lower prices, improved \n     choice, and better, more innovative services for consumers.'' \n     The glaring omission of this goal is far more than a systemic \n     problem.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Hazlett goes on to discuss the origins and purpose \nof the public interest standard at its inception in the 1927 Radio Act, \nand the subsequent 1934 Cable Act, which we are now amending today. \nThis standard was included at the behest of incumbent radio \nbroadcasters:\n\n       The industry liked it because it would allow Government a \n     legal basis for denying licenses to newcomers. Senator C.C. \n     Dill, the author of both the 1927 and the 1934 acts, liked it \n     because it would not only allow the industry what it wanted, \n     it would give policymakers such as himself political \n     discretion to shape the marketplace.\n\n  Let me repeat that. It would allow public policymakers political \ndiscretion to shape a marketplace; in other words, a political free \nmarketplace and not the marketplace that creates the kind of \ncompetition that is self-regulating at best.\n\n       This was terribly important to the Senator at the time, \n     Dill wrote later, because established principles of law were \n     already shaping spectrum access rights as private property.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, the public interest test was the \nregulatory means by which the policymaker--that is us--not the \nmarketplace and certainly not the consumers, could control the \ndevelopment of technology in the market. And we know that has never \nworked. The explosion of service and the quality of service that the \nAmerican consumer now expects in telecommunications has only been \ncreated in the last decade as we move toward a more deregulated \nenvironment.\n  This was hardly a competitive criteria, and let me suggest that in \nthis legislation, that test will stifle the kind of competitive \nenvironment that we want to create.\n  One last point I would like to share from this article brings us to \nour current situation. Mr. Hazlett argues, and I would agree, that even \nafter years of use of public-interest standard, we still do not know \nwhat it means.\n  In 1993, FCC Commissioner Duggan lashed out at Commission critics who \nclaimed this, saying it was not impossible to define public interest, \nand that the Commission would proceed to do so. That was 1993.\n  William Mayton wrote an interesting article in the Emory Law Journal \nin 1989 which pointed out how curious a standard the public-interest \nstandard is by defining whatever a Government agency does in the public \ninterest is the public-interest standard.\n  I find that fascinating, and yet the FCC today still struggles in its \nability to define and to appropriately announce to the policymaker and \nto the consuming public. In short, Mr. President, anything could be \ndeemed either in or against the public interest, and unless you treat \nit in the marketplace where the public ultimately makes the decision, \nthen the public interest is in the eye and in the mind of the \nCommissioner or the policymaker, and that is not necessarily, and in \nalmost all instances has never been, in the public interest.\n  Therefore, it is a standard that has no standard. This is the most \nsubjective test possible, and I would argue that it will not, in \neffect, serve the interests of the American people.\n  Congress should clearly define the parameters of the public-interest \nstandard and outline the factors that should be weighed in the making \nof the determination.\n  I submit that the competitive interconnection and unbundling \nchecklist is in the public interest and fully meets the standard, and \nthat should be the only provision in this law as an amendment to the \n1934 act that frees the marketplace and determines the public interest. \nThat is why I am in strong support of this legislation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator need not do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am through.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We finally, after much negotiation, arrived at the time \nof 2:10 for the vote on this amendment. I shall move to table at that \ntime. I ask unanimous consent that we vote at 2:10 this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Idaho does not have the \nfloor at this time----\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has yielded the floor. \nThe Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. I will not be long, but I want to agree \nwith my friend from Idaho in one respect. Public interest is kind of \nlike art or beauty: It is in the eye of the beholder.\n  When we talk about putting up different barriers, we are really \nsaying that it is going to be a select few who will decide who gets in \nthe business and who does not, where I think most of us believe that \nthe marketplace should dictate that, because from that comes \nperfection, and from that comes a very competitive medicine: Lower \nrates for everybody who wants to use that service.\n  There are those who serve in this body and those who will serve \nwithout this body that can take a public service interest before the \nFCC and completely delay the advancement of any kind of technology or \nany kind of deployment of any kind of services in the \ntelecommunications industry by just a delaying tactic that would \nprevent any kind of progress to be made in that area.\n  Whenever we start talking about this industry, what are we referring \nto? The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] was saying there is no \npublic clamor for change in this area, but there is a clamor to allow \nnew technologies to be introduced, to do more things with the tools \nthat we have now. That is what it is all about. We talk about great \ndistances, and we talk about remote areas and new services that will be \nprovided to our rural areas and our remote areas. We are trying to \ndictate technology such as digital, digital compression, and all of \nthose kinds of new technologies, trying to deploy it under an act that \nwas written some 60 years ago and that has served this industry very \nwell, by the way. But we are talking about the nineties-and-beyond \ntechnology. In other words, we are trying to do something in the \nnineties with a horse-and-buggy kind of regulatory environment that \ndoes not serve either one very well.\n  Unnecessary delay will hinder job creation because it will prevent \nopenings of communications markets to competition simultaneously. One \nhas to have incentives in order to progress in this industry or in any \nother industry. If there is no competition at home, there is no \ncompetition internationally because this is where we hone our skills.\n  This amendment only helps to clarify and define the public interest. \nIt is like I said, there are many definitions of public interest. That \nis why I support this amendment. It will do things not only in this \nindustry but other industries and send a strong signal that we are a \nstrong country within and without in the competitive marketplace, \nespecially in new technologies and the deployment of those new \ntechnologies.\n  This bill already removes all legal barriers, as well as mandates the \nBell companies fully comply with the requirements concerning \ninterconnection, unbundling, resale, portability, and dialing parity. \nIn other words, we have already gone through this business of \ninteroperability of competition on the same lines. And that, too, has \nto be confronted in this bill.\n  So I rise in support of this amendment and just believe that it has \nto be done in order to make this bill in final passage truly a \nprocompetitive and proconsumer piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity standard is the bedrock of the Communications Act of 1934 and \nthe foundation of all common carrier regulation. I am surprised that \nthis standard has come under attack.\n\n\n                  where ``public interest'' originated\n\n  The public-interest standard has been part of English common law \nsince the 17th century. In a treatise on seaports by Lord Hale, this \nfundamental concept was stated: When private property ``is affected \nwith a public interest, it ceases to be subject only to private \ncontrol.''\n  This public-interest concept is the basis for the government's \nauthority to regulate commerce, in general, and common carriers, in \nparticular. The public-interest standard has been a cornerstone of U.S. \ncommon carrier law for more than a century.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court applied the public-interest concept to \nAmerican commerce for the first time in 1876. In Munn versus Illinois, \nthe Supreme Court considered the possible constitutional limits upon \ngovernment regulation of business. In Munn, the Court relied on Lord \nHale's statement regarding public interest. The Supreme Court added \nthat this principle ``has been accepted without objection as an \nessential element in the law of private property ever since.'' Two \nhundred years of English common law supported this precedent.\n  The 19th century U.S. Supreme Court summarized the common law public \ninterest test as follows:\n\n       Property does become clothed with a public interest when \n     used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect \n     the community at large. When, therefore, one devotes his \n     property to a use in which the public has an interest, he in \n     effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and \n     must submit to be controlled by the public for the common \n     good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created.\n\n  The public interest is fundamental to the law of common carriage. The \nSupreme Court in Munn noted that this common-law principle was the \nsource of ``the power to regulate the charges of common carriers'' \nbecause ``common carriers exercise a sort of public office, and have \nduties to perform in which the public is interested.''\n  The Communication Act's public interest,\n   convenience, and necessity standard grew out of this common-law \nnotion of property that is ``clothed with a public interest'' and \ntherefore subject to control ``by the public for the common good.''\n\n  The public-interest standard was first codified in the Transportation \nAct of 1920, which extended Federal regulation of railroads. The \npublic-interest standard governed the grant of licenses under the Radio \nAct of 1927, the forerunner of the Communications Act's broadcast and \nspectrum licensing provisions.\n  The phrases ``public interest'' and ``public interest, convenience \nand necessity'' appear throughout the Communications Act of 1934 as the \nultimate yardstick by which all of the FCC's different regulatory \nfunctions and responsibilities are to be guided. For example, the \npublic-interest standard specifically applies to the physical \nconnections between carriers (section 201(b)); the acquisition or \nconstruction of new lines (section 214); the imposition of accounting \nrules on telephone companies (section 220(h)); the review of \nconsolidations and transactions concerning telephone companies (section \n222(b)(1)); and the grant, renewal, and transfer of licenses to use the \nelectromagnetic spectrum.\n  Thirty-two States and the District of Columbia have public-interest \nstandards in their communications statutes similar to the standard in \nthe Communications Act.\n\n\n                       public interest and s. 652\n\n  Despite the fundamental nature of the public-interest standard to \ncommunications regulation, questions have been raised about the \ninclusion of the public-interest standard in relation to the \ncompetitive checklist in S. 652. Critics say the public-interest \nstandard will frustrate the Bell companies' ability to enter the \ninterLATA market. The fear appears to be that the FCC will use the \npublic-interest standard to keep the Bell companies out of the \ninterLATA market even though they have, in fact, opened their markets \nto competition by complying with the checklist.\n\n\n                       public interest has limits\n\n  These critics assume the FCC's discretion is unrestrained. This is \nnot\n the case. The FCC's functions and powers are not open-ended. The \nCommunications Act specifies in some detail the kinds of regulatory \ntasks authorized or required under the act. In addition, the act \nspecifies procedures to be followed in performing these functions. Such \ndelineations of authority and responsibility define the context in \nwhich the public-interest standard shall be applied. By specifying \nprocedures, the act sets further boundaries on the FCC's regulatory \nauthority.\n\n  S. 652 is no different. The bill would require the FCC to make two \nfindings before granting a Bell company's application to provide \ninterLATA telecommunications service: First, that the Bell operating \ncompany has fully implemented the competitive checklist in new section \n255(b)(2); second, that [[Page S7967]] the interLATA services will be \nprovided through a separate affiliate that meets the requirements of \nnew section 252. In addition, the Commission must determine that the \nrequested authority is consistent with the public interest convenience, \nand necessity.\n  Opponents of the public-interest standard in section 255 argue that a \nBell company could fully implement the checklist, meet the separate \naffiliate standards, and be arbitrarily denied authority to provide \ninterLATA service by the FCC. This simply is not the case.\n  The FCC's public-interest review is constrained by the statute \nproviding the agency's authority. For example, the FCC is specifically \nprohibited from limiting or extending the terms used in the competitive \nchecklist. In addition, the procedures established in S. 652 ensure \nthat the FCC cannot arbitrarily deny Bell company entry into new \nmarkets.\n\n\n                The Truth of public interest in S. 652.\n\n  In S. 652, Congress directs the FCC to look at three things: the \nimplementation of the checklist, separate affiliate compliance, and \nconsistency with the public interest. The FCC's written determination \nof whether to grant the Bell company's request must be based on \nsubstantial evidence on the record as a whole. A reviewing court would \nlook at the entire hearing record. If the FCC would find that a Bell \ncompany meets the checklist and separate affiliate requirements, but \ndenies entry based on the public interest, the agency's reasoning must \nwithstand this heightened judicial scrutiny. Those who oppose public-\ninterest review would ask us to sanction action that the FCC \naffirmatively finds to be inconsistent with the public interest. How \ncould this be good public policy?\n  Mr. President, on earlier points, I will point out that the Citizens \nfor a Sound Economy has endorsed the bill that is before us. It has \nendorsed some of the amendments, but also the entire bill.\n  This bill is much more deregulatory than any we have had before us. \nIt is not a perfect bill. But it will be a great step toward \nderegulation and a pro-market competition.\n  Let me also say that we will be reducing the costs of the Justice \nDepartment administration. It seems for some reason the Justice \nDepartment wants to stay in the regulation business. The Justice \nDepartment is to enforce certain antitrust standards and to carry out \ncertain other functions.\n  In our bill, the FCC refers their decision to the Attorney General \nand the Attorney General can make a recommendation as to whether to use \nthe 8(c) test or whether to use the Clayton standard test, or indeed \nwhether to use the public interest standard, or any other standard that \nhe deems necessary. So we still have involved consultation with the \nJustice Department in our bill.\n  There are many other points to be made here regarding this bill. But \nI believe we have completed debate on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment vote \noccur at 2:10, and the time between now and 2:10 be equally divided in \nthe usual form, and no amendments be in order. I further ask unanimous \nconsent to table the McCain amendment at 2:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby my colleagues--Senators McCain, Packwood, Craig, and others--to \nclarify the public interest standard in the bill.\n  This public interest test will certainly cause unnecessary delays in \nthe deregulation of the telecommunications industry. The public \ninterest is a vague and subjective standard. A deregulatory bill, as \nthis bill is supposed to be, should establish clear and objective \ncriteria to open the industry to competition. This bill does not. \nInstead it dictates that a few folks at the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC] will decide when true competition begins on the \ninformation superhighway.\n  The FCC's regulatory track record is horrendous. In addition, \nallowing the FCC to interpret what is in the public interest introduces \na perverse incentive for FCC officials to slow down deregulation. \nIncreased competition decreases the agency's workload and diminishes \nits need for existence. At a time when we are downsizing Government, we \nought not to be expanding the role of the FCC. The bottomline is that \nFCC officials cannot create competition with bureaucratic entry tests.\n  By delaying true competition, this bill hurts consumers. According to \nseveral studies, this delay could result in billions in lost economic \noutput and millions of new jobs. With such severe economic costs, it \nmakes little sense to delay competition with this public interest \nstandard. Quick deregulation will ensure that all companies face the \nmost ruthless regulator of all--the American consumer.\n  This amendment puts all parties on equal footing--the Bells can offer \nlong distance services when long distance companies can offer local \ntelephone service--no sooner, no later.\n  Mr. President, the bottomline is that competition is in the public \ninterest. It expands consumer options, lowers prices, creates new jobs \nand increases our international competitiveness. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this proconsumer amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, after many years of failed attempts, this \nCongress will have the overdue opportunity to reform the 1934 \nCommunications Act. Senator Pressler, the chairman of the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee, is to be commended for his \nefforts to get legislation passed out of the committee and onto the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation \nAct of 1995, S. 652, is a very comprehensive bill covering all areas of \nthe telecommunications industry. S. 652 is a vast improvement over the \nstatus quo.\n  However, it could be made more deregulatory, better enhancing \ncompetition in the marketplace. Therefore, I hope that the final bill \npassed by the Senate will incorporate a number of deregulatory \namendments.\n  As I mentioned, this is a very comprehensive bill, so I will limit my \nremarks at this time, to more general issues of concern and interest. \nFirst, and foremost, it is important that we do not lose sight of the \nultimate goal of reforming the 1934 act, which should be to establish a \nnational policy framework that will accelerate the private sector \ndeployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies \nand services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets \nto competition.\n  In addition, working toward that goal should spur economic growth, \ncreate jobs, increase productivity, and provide better services at a \nlower cost to consumers.\n  Passing legislation that will open competition in this $250 billion \nindustry will have broad-reaching effects.\n  It is important that we seize this opportunity to limit the \nGovernment's role in this vibrant sector of our economy.\n  Last year we debated health care--that is, impact. It is not often \nthat the Congress has an opportunity to write telecommunications \nlegislation. Therefore, it is important that we pass legislation that \nis clear, forward-looking, and does not perpetuate regulations that \noutlive their usefulness or create monopolies.\n  It is my position that the best way to achieve this is to move toward \na competitive system by removing barriers to access in the various \nsectors of industry. Let me emphasize this point, because I think it \nreflects some of the differences of opinion on how to get to \ncompetition, competition will exist when all barriers to market access \nhave been removed.\n  To deregulate through regulation reminds me a little of the term \nwidely referred to in last year's health care debate, ``Managed \nCompetition.'' I am very concerned that efforts to control deregulation \nthrough regulation will put the Government in the position of \ndetermining the winners and losers in the marketplace.\n  This is not a role for the Government to play. As a conservative, and \none who [[Page S7968]] strongly believes in limited Government, I am \nvery concerned about the powers delegated to the FCC in S. 652, which \ncould allow unnecessary\n delays in fully opening the telecommunications market.\n\n  In short, S. 652, as I read it, deregulates through regulation. It \ngives an inch with new competitive freedoms--then takes a mile with new \nlayers of regulatory conditions and market entry barriers. It is my \nhope that we can preserve the pro-competitive aspects of S. 652 and \nclarify those sections that unnecessarily restrict competition.\n  With that in mind, there are several amendments that I will be \nsupporting during debate on this bill, which will promote deregulation \nand competition.\n  First and foremost, we must ensure that the bill provides for the \nelimination of obsolete regulations, once certain competitive \nconditions are met. In order to achieve those competitive conditions, \nthere should be clear, reasonable and objective requirements or \nconditions that will remove access barriers that currently protect \nmonopolies.\n  Having said that, once those barriers protecting monopolies are \nremoved, a competitive marketplace is established and there should be \nopen competition. More specifically, if a market is contestable, \nregulators should not interfere with natural competitive forces.\n  Competition will provide the lowest price, the best delivery of new \nservices, and infrastructure investment--not regulators.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to emphasize that this is not \njust an industry bill. This legislation has the potential of creating \nthousands of new jobs and enhancing access to a wide array of \ncommunication and information services to all Americans, but especially \nfolks who live in rural or remote communities.\n  According to a recent study by the WEFA group, which is an \neconometric forecasting agency, competition in the telecommunications \nindustry will dramatically benefit the American economy.\n  The WEFA study concluded that delaying competition just 3 years will \nresult in a loss of 1.5 million new U.S. jobs, and $137 billion in real \ngross domestic product by the year 2000.\n  Conversely, the study found that the immediate and simultaneous \nopening of all telecommunications markets would create 2.1 million new \njobs by the turn of the century, and about 3.4 million over the next 10 \nyears.\n  The study also shows that during the next decade, full competition in \ntelecommunications would increase GDP by $298 billion; save consumers \nnearly $550 billion through lower rates and fees for services; and \nincrease the average household's annual disposable income by $850.\n  In Idaho alone, thousands of jobs would be created with simultaneous \nand immediate competition. According to the WEFA study, Idahoans would \nbenefit from the creation of 7,400 new jobs by the year 2000.\n  In addition to the issue of job creation, rural States have a great \ndeal at risk if we do not pass legislation to deregulate \ntelecommunications.\n  There are many examples in my home State of Idaho that demonstrate \nhow current regulations reduce customer choice, restrict growth and \naccess to new technologies.\n  In March 1994, U.S. West Communications was forced to cancel two new \ninformation services in Idaho, Never-Busy fax and Broadcast fax, due to \nthe MFJ requirement that equipment providing the services must be \nlocated in each LATA. Because of population density, there were not \nenough customers to support the cost of maintaining the necessary \nequipment in the Boise LATA.\n  Technically, one piece of equipment can serve several States, but the \nlaw requires the extra expense of replicating equipment in each LATA \njust to meet outdated regulations that are not consistent with market \ndemands.\n  In addition, Boise was selected by U.S. West to be one of the first \nareas in the company to be wired for broadband service, giving \nresidential and business customers access to voice, video, and data \nover a single line. Due to the long timeframe associated with the FCC \napproval process and limitations of current MFJ regulations, the \nproject has been delayed indefinitely.\n  In 1988, the Idaho Legislature approved one of the first modified \nregulation structures in the country.\n  All services except local exchange services with five or fewer lines \nwere completely deregulated. As a result of opening the marketplace, \nover 150 companies now provide long-distance calling within the State.\n  The total volume of calling has increased by 60 percent and the long-\ndistance market share of U.S. West has declined by over 15 percent. The \nend result has been a reduction in both the prices paid by the long-\ndistance carriers to gain access to the network and the price paid by \nthe consumer for services. This, in spite of the fact that local \nexchange services were still perceived to be what some would term as a \n``monopoly'' service. Opening Idaho's market has enhanced competition \nand improved prices for consumers.\n  In both an article and an editorial, the Idaho Statesman outline how \nbusinesses in Idaho were able to save millions of dollars through \nincreased productivity and improved services because of the \ninfrastructure and services offered by the local telephone company as a \nresult of the modified regulation made possible by legislation I have \ndescribed.\n  The Statesman recognizes the value of a competitive communications \nmarketplace, and has been proactive in its editorials in encouraging an \nopen telecommunications industry.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to discuss some \nconcerns on the need for deregulation on the cable industry. Let me \nbegin by saying that I opposed the Cable Act of 1992, and voted against \npassage of the bill.\n  Since the enactment of S. 12, I have received numerous complaints \nfrom fellow Idahoans who felt that the changes resulting from S. 12 \nworsened rather than improved their cable service and cost. In \naddition, a number of very small independent cable systems in Idaho \nhave been in jeopardy of closure because of the astronomical costs \nassociated with implementing the act.\n  A rural community hardly benefits, if it loses access to cable \nservices because the local small business that provides the service \ncannot handle the burden of Federal regulations. Quite the opposite is \ntrue.\n  Competition, not regulation, will encourage growth and innovation in \nthe cable industry, as well as other areas of telecommunications, while \ngiving the consumers the benefit of competitive prices.\n  As I mentioned before, Mr. President a central goal of S. 652 is to \ncreate a competitive market for telecommunications services. Cable \ncompanies are one of the most likely competitors to local telephone \nmonopolies. Cable companies will require billions of dollars in \ninvestment to develop their infrastructures in order to be competitive \nproviders.\n  The Federal regulation of cable television has restricted the cable \nindustry's access to capital, made investors concerned about future \ninvestments in the cable industry, and reduced the ability of cable \ncompanies to invest in technology and programming.\n  Mr. President, rate regulation will not maintain low rates and \nquality services in the cable industry. Competition will.\n  New entrants in the marketplace such as direct broadcast satellite \n[DBS] and telco-delivered video programming will provide competitive \npressures to keep rates down.\n  In short, Mr. President, deregulation of the cable industry is \nessential for a competitive telecommunications market--and it is \nnecessary as an element of S. 652, and the competitive model envisioned \nin the bill.\n  It is my preferred position that S. 652 should completely repeal the \nCable Act. However, I am very supportive of efforts to repeal rate \nregulation for premium tiers, and\n complete relief of rate regulation for small cable companies, who have \nbeen hit so severely by the 1992 Cable Act.\n\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to share \nsome interesting letters I have received from various groups outside \nthe telecommunications industry. First and foremost, I was very \ninterested as a member of the Senate Veterans affairs Committee to see \nthe great interest veterans service organizations have in seeing a \nderegulatory bill passed.\n  In a letter form James J. Kenney, the national executive director of \nAMVETS, he states the following:\n\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\n       America's veterans and their families have a real stake in \n     the debate in Congress over competition in \n     telecommunications.\n       We know that full competition--now--means millions of new \n     jobs spread throughout every section of our economy. A recent \n     study by the WEFA group calculated that 3.4 million new jobs \n     would be produced over the next ten years if all \n     telecommunications companies were allowed to compete right \n     away. These jobs are desperately needed for the estimated \n     250,000 men and women who are being discharged every year due \n     to downsizing of the military . . . .\n       Veterans want Congress to be on our side in this fight--to \n     stand up for us--for new jobs and lower prices. We don't want \n     to have to wait for the benefits of new competition. . . .\n       On behalf of AMVETS and all of America's veterans, I urge \n     you to move forward quickly in assuring that S. 652 will be a \n     telecommunications reform bill that will allow immediate and \n     simultaneous competition in the marketplace.\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to stand up for our veterans, and other of \nour citizens. I think this letter shows just how important this bill is \nto all Americans and the benefits that we can all enjoy from a robust \nand competitive telecommunications market.\n  Another interesting letter on this legislation, written by former \nSurgeon General C. Everett Koop, M.D. and Jane Preston, M.D., and \npresident of the American Telemedicine Association, also urges the \nCongress to ``Pass telecommunications reform legislation that opens up \nfull competition in both local and long distance communications without \ndelay.''\n  Their interest in S. 652 is the potential advances it can bring to \nthe medical field through greater access to telemedicine.\n  As a member of the Senate/House ad hoc Committee on Telemedicine and \nInformatics, I agree with the interests outlined in this letter.\n\n       One of the single largest obstacles to the Deployment of \n     Telemedical services LATA boundaries. Many of those involved \n     in the field of telemedicine see LATA boundaries as ``toll \n     booths on the information highway.'' The existence of LATA \n     boundaries, (and accompanying high rates for long distance \n     services) was not a problem in the early stages of \n     telemedicine research and demonstration projects. . . . \n     However, with the development of telemedicine projects as on-\n     going, financially viable operations and with the steady \n     increase in telemedical interactions, the cost of long \n     distance services has become a major program. Therefore, we \n     ask you to eliminate this barrier by lifting existing \n     restrictions and allowing all companies to compete \n     immediately for local and long distance services.\n\n  The letter goes on to describe the many health care uses of the \ntelecommunications infrastructure such as the training and education of \nhealth care professionals, consultation, and diagnostics, in addition \nto all the administrative functions that use the system. This is \nespecially important to the future of the delivery of health care in \nremote and rural communities.\n  Mr. President, I don't support the unnecessary Government regulation \nof private industry. Some will argue that the regulations incorporated \nin S. 652 are not only necessary, but they are the only way we can \nreach a competitive marketplace. I disagree. There will be a number of \namendments offered to curb the regulations that remain in this bill. \nWith these clarifications and improvements, I am confident that S. 652 \nwill positively change the telecommunications landscape for the \nbetterment of American consumers and the national economy. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in support of those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally against \nboth sides.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. GRAIG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask \nthat no time elapse equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I inquire about the time arrangement at \nthis point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point we have a vote on the McCain \namendment set for 2:10. At this point, there are remaining 2 minutes 3 \nseconds on Senator Pressler's time for discussion on that amendment, \nand 20 minutes remaining on Senator McCain's amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me ask it this way. Is there time in here that I may \nuse that is not designated on one side or the other?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to proceed in \nthat fashion. But the effect would be potentially delaying the vote if \nthe advocates and proponents of the amendment were to withhold this \ntime.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak against the amendment for the next 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object, so \nlong as it comes off both sides. I understand that is agreeable to \nSenator McCain. We still want the vote at 2:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are only 2 minutes left of Senator \nMcCain's time. If that were to be equally divided, it would exhaust all \nthe time he has left plus additional time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Pressler has 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe Senator McCain has 2 minutes because \nthe last speaker spoke, I thought, in support of the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I understand it, consistent with \nSenator McCain's desire, just take the time and allow the Senator to \nspeak.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we all understand that. I will be \nbrief. I want to be recognized briefly to speak against this amendment. \nI think what we have here is a classic case of the defeat of the good \nin pursuit of the perfect. Perhaps this legislation is not perfect, but \nit has been worked out very laboriously in a bipartisan way. It may not \nbe totally perfectly deregulatory. I am sure it would be wonderful if \nwe could eliminate the FCC. A lot of us would like to see no need for \nthe FCC. But we are going from what has been a monopolistic system, an \nantiquated system, to a new, dynamic, open, more competitive, and much \nless regulatory system. This language, the public interest standard, \nthat is included in the bill is a very important part of the core. It \nwas a part, an important part, of putting together the agreement on the \nentry test. In my opinion, it is sort of part of the checklist. Once \nthe Bell companies meet the checklist, there is this one additional \nthing, the public interest question. I think it is important to make \nsure that we have a fair and level playing field. This is part of that \neffort to make sure that we have done it right.\n  Our purpose here is to have more competition and less regulation. But \nI do not believe it is going to be constructive at this point if we \ntake that public interest language out of there.\n  So I urge my colleagues, if we are going to keep this compromise \nagreement together, we need to leave this language in there.\n  I urge the defeat of the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I really am struck by the comments of the Senator from Mississippi \nbecause it is exactly what is in this editorial of the Wall Street \nJournal. It is not a good idea to have the public interest provision in \nthe bill, but let us do it because we have a compromise here. Let us \nmake a bad deal, but it is a deal. I cannot tell my colleague from \nMississippi how deeply I am disappointed in his position on this issue.\n  I had many conversations with him when we were talking about a \nchecklist and how a checklist would satisfy the concerns of those who \nwere in opposition to this legislation. Now, obviously, that was not \nenough. But we are going to make a deal. Let us change the debate \naround here. Instead of debating a piece of legislation, let us make a \ndeal. The fact is the public interest aspect being added onto a \nchecklist negates the entire checklist. What in the world is the need \nto have a checklist to say we comply with the checklist and then send \nit over to the [[Page S7970]] FCC to decide what the amorphous position \nof the public interest is? The reason we will not do away with the \nchecklist is we went down this road of concession after concession. We \ndecided first that we will not have a checklist, then whether we needed \na checklist. Then that was not sufficient to get enough support, so we \nadded the public interest clause. So we end up with a meaningless \nchecklist.\n  What in the world is the sense of having a checklist then after the \nchecklist has been complied with? OK, it has been complied with, but it \nis up to you, FCC. What relevance does a checklist have?\n  Mr. President, I continue to be disappointed at what the Wall Street \nJournal describes as the ``problem here is a familiar one.'' Companies \nlean too heavily on their insider Washington representatives whose \nskill is chiseling arcane special provisions out of an arcane process. \nThese people are part of the reason the public is cynical about \nWashington. The CEO's know what is right, but they are given to believe \nit is never attainable considering universal service.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that this amendment will probably not be \npassed. But this is a clear example of what is wrong with the way we do \nbusiness here in Washington. In the face of principle, we now \ncompromise, and instead of doing so, let us have a bad deal, but it is \nbetter than no deal at all. I do not agree with that. I believe that we \ndo a great disservice to the people whom we represent in the name of \nderegulation to add 80, according to the Wall Street Journal, 80 new \nregulatory functions, all designed, of course, to ensure competition \nand fairness.\n  Part 1 of those 80 new regulatory functions--part of the $81 million \nthat the FCC is going to need to enforce this deregulation, and, of \ncourse, in the words of the Commissioner of the Federal Communications \nCommission, they will need accountants, statisticians and business \nschool graduates. So let us call this what it is--a plus to some \nspecial interests and perhaps some improvement in the status quo but \ncertainly not deregulatory legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield such time as is remaining to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment. The most difficult thing to \nhave happen in the law that we are deliberating here is the competition \nat the local level. That is the most perplexing and most difficult part \nof all. By competition, I do not mean competition for phone service. I \ndo not mean competition for cable service. I do not mean competition \nfor information businesses that want to preserve this kind of line of \nbusiness distinction. I mean competition to package information \nservices, not coming from the big guys that we talk to all the time in \nthis town, but from that new entrepreneur that hires their lawyers at \n$50 an hour, not by the dump truck load, who need to make certain they \nwill have an opportunity to compete.\n  This checklist, such as it is, I do not know if the checklist is \ngoing to work. There are 14 things on the checklist. Take a look at it. \nYou tell me. One of the problems that I have in this whole mechanism is \nthat it says the FCC is supposed to determine whether or not we have \ncompetition. How do I determine? Well, I have a checklist.\n  Then I have one final test that, by the way, has been litigated many, \nmany times over the course of time. The Supreme Court has spoken many \ntimes on this issue. They understand the intent with a lot more clarity \nthan meets the eye in this area. This is an effort to make certain that \nin fact we do get competition at the local level. I assure my \ncolleagues, if we do not get competition at the local level, our \nconsumers, our citizens, households are not going to be happy because \ntheir rates will not come down for overall information services. Their \nquality will not go up. Only in the competitive environment will that \nhappen. Only if the provider of services knows that the customer can \nwalk and go someplace else is there going to be a competitive \nenvironment, and only if the law encourages and allows new \nentrepreneurs and startup companies, as I believe the language in this \nbill allows, and that the amendment will strike.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Arizona. I \napologize for being late. The Finance Committee met from 9:30 until \nabout quarter of 1. I have just gotten here now.\n  I realize the time constraints we are under, and I am not going to \nmake a lot of long opening comments. This amendment is a simple \namendment. No matter how anybody cuts it and attempts to parcel the \nbill, there are two competitive tests in this. I am going to refer to \nthem as section A and section B, and they are genuinely competitive, \nobjective tests. But then there is a conjunction at the end of the \nsecond section. We get into this public interest. It reads, ``And if \nthe Commission determines that requested authorization is consistent \nwith the public interest, convenience and necessity,'' and what not.\n  What that means is that if any applicant meets the first two, which \nare objective and measurable, they still have to get over the hurdle of \nthe third test, which is the public interest test. That is amorphous. \nThat is anything the Federal Communication wants it to be. It is an \nunneeded test. It is going to be a test that is going to tie up every \napplicant not for weeks, not for months, but for years as we go through \nnot some kind of an objective what is the public interest but on every \nsingle application to extend service to consumers, every single \napplication to get more competition into the communications field, \nevery one of those is going to have to pass a subjective public \ninterest test, because I can assure the Presiding Officer and I can \nassure this Chamber that anybody who opposes one of your competitors \ngetting into your business is going to say it is not in the public \ninterest and you are going to have to prove that it is in the public \ninterest.\n  And here is where I wish to complain about established bureaucracy \ngenerally, and I do not mean it critically, but I do mean it in the \nsense that there is a great tendency of any regulatory body to like \nwhat is. And there is a triangle between applicants and regulators and \nemployees who used to be with the regulators, who now represent the \napplicants and who will also be representing the opponents of the \napplicants. And there will be a cozy tendency not to want to expand.\n  I am just going to give 3 minutes of history here on deregulation \nefforts I have seen since I have been on the Commerce Committee. I have \nbeen on it now since 1977, and I have been through every single \nderegulatory phase that we have had. Airlines in 1978--no one in the \nairline industry except United Airlines, to their credit, favored \nderegulating the airlines, nor did any of the unions that worked for \nthe airlines want deregulation. In 1980, truck deregulation was opposed \nby the American Trucking Association and the Teamsters Union and not \nvery enthusiastically looked at by the Interstate Commerce Commission, \nwhich then regulated trucking. We deregulated trucking by and large in \n1980, and the Interstate Commerce Commission has shrunk from about, as \nI recall, 2,200 employees in 1981 down to around 500 or 600 now. My \nhunch is that the life of the Interstate Commerce Commission is not \nlong in being. But because we deregulated, they shrunk down.\n  Now, what is the one thing that we left unregulated--I should not say \nwe--that was left unregulated. When AT agreed with the antitrust \ndivision for the modified final judgment in 1982, the one thing that is \nnot part of that judgment was cellular phones. Why? Because nobody \ncared. In 1982, you had 100,000 cellular phone customers. Do you know \nwhat the historical analogy is?\n  It is England and France after World War I, when they decided to \ndivide up the Turkish territories, Turkey being an ally with Germany in \nWorld War I, and they lost. Turkey had control of the entire Middle \nEast. England and [[Page S7971]] France divided it up. England took \nIsrael, Jordan, and Iraq; France took what became Lebanon and Syria. \nNobody wanted Saudi Arabia--nothing but a desert. So it was left to \ndrift on its own. No one knew there was any oil. I am sure Britain and \nFrance would have carved it up also if they thought they wanted it.\n  Nobody cared about cellular phones in 1982, so with 100,000 then, 25 \nmillion now, and 28,000 new customers a day, we will be at about 120 \nmillion cellular phone users by the year 2002. There are only 150 \nmillion telephone subscribers now. The reason this service is growing--\nand is it competitive? Read the advertisements. Hear the television. \nListen to the radio. Competitive? Are the prices coming down? Is it big \ncompetitor after big competitor about some interesting small-niche \ncompetitors that understand this business, and because they are small \nand often personally held, they can beat AT or MCI or Bell Atlantic? \nThat never would have happened had they been included in the modified \nfinal judgment.\n  I can see exactly what is to happen if we do not get rid of this \npublic interest part of this bill. In is going to come a smart young \nengineer who worked for AT until he or she was 38 and decided to \nleave and form a little niche company of their own, and they are going \nto want to get into Bell Atlantic's territory. We think this is Bell \nversus AT They are going to want to get into that territory, and \nthey are going to make an application. And they are going to be kept \nout, or Bell Atlantic is going to be kept out if they want to get into \nAT's territory because they do not meet the public interest test.\n  Mr. President, of all of the areas of business in this country that \nno longer need regulation, communications is it. The argument is made \nthat we are operating under an act that was passed in 1934. That is \ntrue. If we pass this act today, this takes us up to about 1964, 1974 \nat most.\n  Mr. President, we are not 5 to 10 years from the day that wired \nsystems are going to be irrelevant. We are going to go back to \nbroadband broadcasting where your computers are going to be hooked up \nby radio waves or the equivalent rather than wires, and we are going to \nhave more spectrum than we know what to do with. And we are going to be \nhobbled because this bill will not give the freedom to competitors that \nis necessary, and the public interest test will do more to stop that \nfreedom of competition than any other single thing.\n  I hope very much the Senate will adopt this amendment. This amendment \nby itself will do more to make sure that we have the equivalent of the \nkind of competition we have seen in cellular in the last 10 years than \nany other single thing this Senate will consider.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thomas be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to table.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona yield back his \ntime?\n  The Senator yields back his time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the motion \nto table the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Erica Gum, \nan intern in my office, be permitted privilege of the floor during the \nremaining debate of this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1262\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1262.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike Section 310 of the Act and renumber the subsequent \n     Sections as appropriate.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike the provisions \nin the bill that force private companies to give preferential rates to \ncertain other entities.\n  Specifically, the bill mandates that any health care facility, \nlibrary, or school receive telephone service at cost. In other words, \nthe telephone company must offer such service at reduced rates.\n  We all support helping education, furthering the ability of all \nindividuals to have access to libraries, and helping people get medical \nhelp.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that the provisions of this bill \ngo too far. Rural health providers will be provided with these low, \npreferential rates. I question whether such action will help low income \nrural Americans receive health care or will it help wealthy doctors \nbecome even wealthier when their telephone bills are reduced.\n  I question whether such an across-the-board mandate for schools to \nreceive preferential rates is really necessary for wealthy suburban \nschools?\n  And for all of these provisions, I must question does anyone truly \nknow the cost involved here?\n  For the following reasons, the public users section of this bill \nshould be struck.\n  First, these provisions amount to an unfunded mandate. Earlier this \nyear we passed legislation to discourage us from passing unfunded \nmandates on to companies. Make no mistake, this is an unfunded mandate.\n  Second, many States are already giving some entities preferential \nrates. There is no reason we should federalize a legitimate function of \nthe States.\n  Third, if we are to pass such a provision, at a minimum, it must be \nmeans tested. There is no reason to give preferential rates to \nindividuals who do not need them.\n  Fourth, we do not have an accurate assessment of how much this \nentitlement will cost. [[Page S7972]] \n  Last, these provisions contain huge loopholes that many will exploit. \nWill abortion clinics apply for preferential rates as medical \nfacilities? Will law firms with legal libraries seek preferential \nrates? These terms are not precisely defined in the bill and are open \nto exploitation.\n  Mr. President, as an example of what would be provided, it says in \nthe bill on page 134, paragraph 3:\n\n       Health Care Provider. The term ``health care provider'' \n     means post-secondary educational institutions, teaching \n     hospitals, and medical schools.\n\n  After reading through the bill language and also after consultation \nwith staff, I am told that the term ``elementary school'' means a \nnonprofit institutional day or residential school that provides \nelementary education as determined under State law.\n  Does that mean a nonprofit private school falls under this? Does it \nmean, as I said before, that clinics that perform abortions are a \nmedical facility? Does it, under the term ``secondary school,'' mean a \nnonprofit institutional day or residential school that provides \nsecondary education, as determined under State law, except that such \nterm does not include any education beyond grade 12?\n  Does this mean private schools? I know that some private schools such \nas private parochial schools are not very wealthy. I also know that we \nall know there are certain private schools that are extremely well off.\n  Mr. President, I just think this is a wrong idea. It passed by a vote \nof 10 to 8 in the committee without a large amount of debate.\n  I hope we can strike this from the bill. I have no idea how much this \nwould cost. I believe that we have spoken very loudly and clearly that \nunfunded mandates are something that we are rejecting. I urge the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we might \nreturn to morning business for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S7942-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN O'GRADY\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the nation sighed with relief this morning \nas we heard reports that Air Force Capt. Scott F. O'Grady, the United \nStates pilot downed by a Serbian surface-to-air missile, had been found \nin good health, and was resting comfortably on a United States aircraft \ncarrier.\n  Yesterday, in the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary of \nDefense Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShalikashvili, gave a presentation on United States policy towards \nBosnia. As was clear from this hearing, there is little agreement on \nwhat United States policy should be towards this war-torn region, and \nmany deeply troubling questions continue to surface regarding the depth \nof United States involvement in Bosnia, and the need for a strong and \ncoherent United States and NATO policy.\n  But today, I would like to focus on a good news story, and extend \ncommendations to Captain O'Grady and the American military personnel \nwho were involved in his remarkable recovery.\n  Although details of the rescue effort are still being released, it is \nclear that many American military personnel put themselves at great \nrisk in the all-out attempt to locate Captain O'Grady and safely bring \nhim out of Bosnia.\n  The ability of Captain O'Grady to evade capture by the Bosnian Serbs \nfor nearly 6 days in heavily wooded areas is a great tribute not only \nto the courage and survival skills of Captain O'Grady, but also to the \noutstanding training he has received as a U.S. Air Force pilot.\n  Equally outstanding was the courage and competence of the marines who \nwent into Bosnia under extremely dangerous conditions. Early reports \nindicate two CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters under attack by both \nSerbian surface-to-air missiles and small arms fire were able to land \nwithin 50 meters of where Captain O'Grady was concealed. The commander \nof these marines, Col. Martin Berndt, reached out, grabbed the young \npilot, and took off in a matter of seconds.\n  Finally, many American pilots risked their lives during the past 6 \ndays, flying through a highly sophisticated Serb integrated air defense \nsystem in an attempt to pinpoint the location of Captain O'Grady. Many \nof these flights were extremely hazardous routes in and out of \nthunderstorms. During the actual rescue mission, additional American \npilots covered the Marine helicopters with fighter and electronic \nmonitoring aircraft.\n  Mr. President, the training, competence and experience that led to \nthe spectacular success of this rescue mission gives credit to the \noutstanding job done by Secretary of Defense Perry and General \nShalikashvili, as well as Adm.

Is there further debate on amendment No. 1262?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as we know, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, on the Commerce Committee, has \nbeen the lead Senator on our side, and the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, on the majority side of the Commerce Committee \nwith respect to the public entities. They did not realize this \namendment was coming up and they are on their way to the floor.\n  My friend from Arizona got some quick figures and questioned the \nfigures I had given relative to the air fares. So let me once again \nstate that the USAir fare from National to Charleston round trip is \n$628. United from Dulles round trip to Charleston is $628. There is a \nContinental flight at $608 round trip from National.\n  With respect to USAir going down to Miami, we talked about flying 500 \nmiles further and of course the 500 miles coming back, 1,000-mile \ndifference. There is a USAir $658 round trip to National, and if you \nwalk up to the counter, there is a special of $478 for the 10 seats \navailable that the clerk at the counter can give at that reduced rate.\n  Perhaps that is what was the case with respect to the quoted figure \nof going from Dulles to Charleston, D.C. to Charleston, the $249 fare \nround [[Page S7973]] trip--that was the 21-day advance, nonrefundable \nfare under USAir.\n  In my investigation, though, it did prove salutary that I found out \nthe Government fare to fly out from Washington to Charleston is $192, \nbut the Government fare all the way out to Phoenix is $135. So we found \nout, in the airline industry, who the chairman is of the subcommittee \non air travel.\n  I am going to get my office to call and see if I cannot persuade the \nSenator from Arizona to get me a little bit better consideration on \nthis Government rate. They go 1,000 miles further, I say to the senior \nSenator, the President pro tempore of the Senate, 1,000 miles further \nand they get it $47 cheaper than you and me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his additional information. The fact is, there are still one-way \ntickets available for $249. And the fact is, the number of departures \nfrom Washington, D.C., to South Carolina since deregulation has gone up \n16 percent. The number of available seats since deregulation from \nWashington, D.C., to South Carolina has gone up 50 percent since \nderegulation. The President's Council of Economic Advisers has said \nthat consumers have saved $100 billion since the airline industry \nderegulated.\n  I would also point out to the Senator from South Carolina, who is so \nenamored of the trip from Washington, D.C., to Phoenix, if I choose to \nleave from National Airport there is no direct flight. It has to stop \nsomeplace in between because of the arbitrary barrier to the markets \nimposed by the so-called perimeter rule, which was imposed by the \nformer Speaker of the other body, Mr. Wright, which happens to reach \nthe western edge of the tarmac at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport.\n  So, as one who commutes back and forth every weekend and has done so, \nnow--this is the 13th year--I can assure the Senator from South \nCarolina I am in favor of far more deregulation. What the Senator from \nSouth Carolina calls distance market is what is called the free market. \nIt is called supply and demand. When there are enough people who \nutilize a service the price of that service goes down.\n  It is a strange thing we find out when the free market works. If \nenough people want to use a certain service, and the cost of that \nservice is divided up amongst more people, then the cost goes down. I \nam sure the Senator from South Carolina can appreciate that phenomenon. \nIt has happened in the airline industry and the trucking industry and \nevery other industry that we have deregulated. I am very sorry we are \nnot going to see that in the telecommunications industry, because we \nhave basically a bill that is more reregulatory than deregulatory.\n  But as I said earlier, I look forward to the opportunity of extended \ndebate on the issue of airline deregulation with my friend from South \nCarolina, who obviously feels very strongly on the issue and has a lot \nof knowledge and experience. But I would remind him, the issue before \nus today is telecommunications deregulation, although I always enjoy a \nspirited exchange with my dear friend from South Carolina.\n  I thank him and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, quickly because the Senator from West \nVirginia is here, the number of flights has gone up in the context of \nthe population and travel. It certainly has not gone up in the context \nof service and price.\n  With respect to the service, now, those direct flights that I had are \ngone. I know it. I know it severely. I spend more time in Charlotte, \nNC, than I do in my hometown of Charleston.\n  I told Harvey Gantt, when he was mayor, I was going to run against \nhim and run for mayor of Charlotte because I am beginning to know more \npeople in Charlotte than I do in Charleston. With respect to price, \nobviously some time back, it was a round trip, $64. That is what I used \nto pay. It is now up to $628. Inflation could quadruple the price but \nnot go all the way up to $628.\n  The price has gone up and I am subsidizing those long hauls. Eighty-\nfive percent of the medium- and small-size towns in West Virginia and \nin South Carolina are subsidizing the long hauls out to the west coast \nand Phoenix, Los Angeles and the rest, because the airlines make money \non those things. Because that is where, under the economy of distance \nand the airline fuel costs and the crew and everything else, nonstop, \nthey can make the money. And we have to subsidize it.\n  The service has gone down, and the airlines are broke, and the \nEuropeans are taking them over and we are thanking them for taking them \nover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there are times when I wish I had \nnever offered an amendment in the Commerce Committee having to do with \nperimeters for flights, 1,250 miles, because the doing of that and the \nwinning of that in the Commerce Committee has, I think, fundamentally \nangered my very good friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I \nthink it has caused a whole series of things to happen as a result. The \nhearing with respect to United Airlines, a hearing with respect to--\nwell, no other hearings, but then I think this amendment. I think he \nwas very deeply disturbed by that.\n  I just want to say one thing. As I walked in the door over there I \nheard him mention that $100 billion had been saved in terms of cost of \nderegulation of airlines. I want to inform the Senator from Arizona \nthat--sure, a lot of that must have been saved in West Virginia. \nBecause you do not get to West Virginia now by jet airplane. Yes, there \nare one or two. Corporations have theirs. But when I go it is by \npropeller. I remember when we had American and Eastern and United, and \nthey came in regularly into our airports. That was years and years ago.\n  Within two or three months of deregulation it was gone. I am talking \nabout this amendment when I am talking about airlines; that is what \nhappens when the free market is allowed to entirely set what the rules \nof the game will be.\n  West Virginia has suffered substantially. West Virginia has suffered \nprofoundly because of deregulation of airlines which is glorified by \nthe Senator from Arizona and which is very deeply hurtful to the \nlivelihoods of the people of the State of West Virginia who have to \nmove to other States, often, because there is not enough work because \nbusinesses have to be able to count on reliable air service and they do \nnot want it to be some small propeller plane where your chin is resting \non your knees--as is the case in the seated position of the junior \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  It is incredibly important, not just to West Virginia but to every \nsingle State that has any part of it which is rural, that the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona be defeated and be defeated soundly. We are \ndealing with some very, very fundamental principles here.\n  For example, as we build on this information superhighway we must \ninclude an on-ramp for students and adults to ensure that every \nAmerican has the opportunity to plug in and be part of this technology.\n  The bill before us, ably shepherded through by Senator Hollings and \nSenator Pressler, includes this amendment. I think this amendment--I \nsaid this a couple of times in the last few days--I think it is so \nimportant that this language stay that schools, elementary schools, \nsecondary schools, no matter where they are, be included as part of the \ninformation process, that they be wired up, that public libraries be \nincluded as part of this process, which in many cases in rural areas \nand other areas they may not be and will not be, because, like airline \nderegulation, you go where the population is.\n  And, terribly important particularly for rural areas, that the \ntelemedicine be available through rural health centers and through \nrural hospitals. And they will not be if the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona prevails. They will not be because the market will not \nallocate the resources to make that available. I am as certain of that \nas I am of having to take a propeller airplane whenever I go to West \nVirginia. In fact, the only time that I do not take a propeller \nairplane when I go to West Virginia is if I go to Pittsburgh first. And \nthe principle is exactly the same. The market will seek out where it is \nprofitable to go as they are deregulated, as we will do and we will do \n[[Page S7974]] with my full support in this bill, but where it is not \nprofitable for them to go they will not go.\n  I want every Senator from every one of the 50 States--I do not care \nif it is New York State, which is thought of as being urban but has an \nenormous rural section, that people who live in Binghamton, NY, or \nOneida or other places outside of that, they are not going to get \nservice. Their elementary and secondary schools, their rural hospitals, \ntheir rural health clinics are not going to get service. They are not \ngoing to be wired up. They are not going to be part of this information \nhighway. It is not going to happen because the market will make other \nchoices.\n  As a result of that, I have said what I think is probably a hyperbole \nin listening to myself say it, but I find believing myself saying it so \ncompelling that I need to say it on the floor of the Senate, that if \nthis language is allowed to stay in the bill and, thus, if the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona is defeated, this Senator as an \nindividual junior Senator from West Virginia will probably have done \nmore in one series of paragraphs of sentences in a bill to help his \nState than anything he has done in his public career.\n  I feel so strongly about that amendment. The amendment to strike this \nlanguage is so wrong. It is so wrong for rural America. It is so wrong \nfor places that cannot defend themselves. It is so wrong for choices \nthat will be made by the marketplace to avoid elementary schools, \nsecondary schools, libraries, rural health clinics, and rural \nhospitals. If you are not there with the technology, you might as well \nnot be there.\n  If you are a kid, if we want to create in this country a first-tier \nand a second-tier society--and I am not talking about rich and poor in \nfinancial terms. I am talking about even more important terms; that is, \nhaving a future. If you want to have a two-class society in this \ncountry, those who know and those who do not, then you vote with the \nSenator from Arizona because that is what you will have. You will have \npeople that go on-line, with America-On-Line, that can search and have \ntheir home pager and do all kinds of things, and they will make 15 \npercent more in salaries than people that do not have those abilities; \nprobably 30 percent more.\n  I remind you that in the computer business, the productivity, the \ntechnology, has been doubling for the last 30 years every 18 months.\n  So what are these rural schools, what are these rural hospitals to do \nwhen they are not wired up? I cannot imagine anything that affects the \nfuture of this Senator's State, of the State of the Senator from North \nDakota or the Senator from Nebraska in a more fundamental way in terms \nof its young people finding a chance to take their place in America as \ncitizens with possibilities and pride and confidence than how this \namendment is disposed of.\n  Senator Pressler and Senator Hollings have worked together and have \nkept this as a part of the bill. They deserve praise for that.\n  I want to share one story. Then I will sit down and yield to the \nothers. I will have more to say about my home State of West Virginia \nand this amendment, which I feel is just--I feel so strongly that it \nhas to be defeated for the sake not just of my State, but of every \nState, the rural and the out-of-the-way parts of every State. Let me \nshare one story about West Virginia. It has to do with the West \nVirginia Library Commission, which is a very aggressive group. They \nhave very aggressively worked for years to develop the network, and \nthey recently won a Federal grant to provide computers for over 150 \nlibraries in our State.\n  Our State commission is currently investing in that equipment and \ntraining for every library to be linked to the internet. But each \nlibrary must pay for its own telecommunication link, and they cannot. \nMy wife Sharon and I have our farm in Pocahontas County. That is one of \nthose little public libraries--when I was a Governor I was there--a \nlittle octagonal building that uses solar ray because they cannot \nafford the fuel. And it is interesting to use solar panels in that part \nof the State because the sun does not shine that often. It rains 45 \ninches every of year. There is no way they can possibly match.\n  So that is taking the students of Pocahontas County, WV, and \ncondemning them to second-class citizenship in terms of going into a \nlibrary or the adults who want to improve themselves through library \nservices. They are struggling financially. They cannot match. They \ncannot pay what they would be required to pay.\n  We have something in this law called ``public interest.'' If there is \never a case of public interest, it is that people who are born in poor \ncircumstances, in rich circumstances, in rural areas, in urban areas, \nor somewhere in between on either of those fronts have an equal chance \nin terms of the education system and the computer system and the health \nsystem of this country.\n  No, we did not pass health care last year. Maybe we bit off too much. \nBut here is something we can bite off which will really help. It is \ncalled telemedicine. It will only affect those parts of the State which \nare rural, and they will never get it unless the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona is defeated and defeated soundly.\n  Our part of the bill on this is not intended to give something away \nfor nothing. It merely assures financially strapped public institutions \nlike libraries and schools will get affordable rates for access.\n  There are many others who want to speak. I will speak more on this \nsubject. But I say again that the defeat of this amendment, I think, is \ncentral to the bill. I think it is central to the future of the young \npeople and adults of my State. I have rarely felt so strongly about \nanything in my public life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment.\n  Some provisions of the legislation I believe are not necessary would \npromote bureaucratic intervention and intermeddling in the system. I \nbelieve the provisions of the legislation which will provide for \nsubsidies and will provide for special privileges for certain entities \nis unnecessary.\n  I believe that the suggestion that this is similar to the airline \nindustry is misleading and counterproductive. The truth of the matter \nis that technology is going to change dramatically the impact of \ndistances as it relates to the transmission of data and information. If \nyou are bouncing information off the satellite, it does not matter \nwhether you are in a rural area or in an urban area. It does not matter \nwhether you are in a remote area or an approximate area. They are all \nequally accessible in that respect.\n  So to speak about the airline industry and the amount of traffic that \nis generated to one area, and that that traffic somehow does not \njustify a lower cost to that area like it does another area ignores the \nfact that the transmission of data, especially the wireless \ntransmission of data, simply really does not have costs related to the \nlocation of the receiver of the data.\n  The data can be transmitted or received via satellite regardless of \nthe location. So I do not think it is particularly instructive to try \nto get bogged down in the debate over airline deregulation here. We are \ntalking about a different technology. And arguments which are locked \ninto the technology of the past are based on ideas like the airline \ntechnology and what it takes to transmit a passenger instead of \ntransmitting data, those are misleading arguments.\n  The provision which is, I think, noble in its objective to try to \nhelp us have educational institutions with good access and health \ninstitutions with good access would require a costly accounting \nprocedure and intermeddling by governmental entities to try to \ndetermine what would be ``reasonable rates'' or what would be \n``incremental costs.''\n  If we say that elementary schools, secondary schools, libraries--and, \nincidentally, that is not public libraries in the legislation. The word \n``libraries'' is used without reference to whether it is public or \nprivate--if we say that they are entitled to special rates for the \ntransmission of data or communications which they would choose to \ntransmit or provide, it seems to me that we have set up a provision \nwhich requires governmental rate setting, governmental cost accounting, \nand massive and significant intervention of the Government in this \nprocess. And if those rates are established by the Government at less \nthan the full cost of [[Page S7975]] the proceeding, that means \neveryone else who uses the system is going to be subsidizing the \noverall cost of these institutions and these entities.\n  Much has been made of the rural setting and the fact that it might be \na lot more expensive according to some that in order to have provision \nof telecommunications to rural settings----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield for a unanimous-consent \nrequest, it will take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, there has been agreement on both sides \nfor a vote on the McCain amendment at 3:30 today and that the time \nbetween now and then be equally divided--I do not intend to use mine; I \nwill give it to anyone who wants it--in the usual form with no \namendments in order to the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no unanimous-consent request made at \nthis point. There was an explanation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the \nMcCain amendment at 3:30 today.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  In order for some groups to have a specially reduced rate of \nservices, other groups will have to pay and subsidize that rate for \nservice. Now, whether those services are laudable or important or \nnecessary or would not otherwise be available is debatable. There seems \nto be the thought that a lot of rural hospitals exist now without \ntelecommunications access. I have been to many rural hospitals during \nthe last year. I actually worked in several rural hospitals. They all \nhave a number of the kinds of transmission devices that were very \nimportant to transmitting and receiving the kinds of things that would \nbe involved in telecommunications. All of them had cable television, \ncoaxial access, and the like.\n  The point I would make here is that on page 132 of the bill, at lines \n19 through 22, it provides that the rates would be affordable and not \nhigher than incremental costs.\n  This places the Government in a position of having to try to \nascertain what affordable rates are, having arguments about what \nincremental costs are, and injects the Government back in the process \nof regulation at the micro level. I think it is counterproductive. I \npointed out that it not only applies to schools, elementary and \nsecondary, but it applies to libraries, and it does not mean that it is \nonly public libraries. The statute just says ``libraries.''\n  I wonder if you might literally have a library that became an \nelectronic library. It could be commercial in nature but it could \nprovide information on the telecommunications highways but demand the \nright to do so at subsidized rates merely because it is mentioned in \nthis section.\n  It occurs to me that the promise of telecommunications deregulation \nmeans that access to new service, both digital and wireless, is going \nto be available to individuals around the country and institutions \naround the country. It also occurs to me that as that access is \navailable and becomes cheaper as a result of the proliferation of \nservices--and it is estimated that our costs in telecommunications will \ngo down very substantially--a bureaucracy to start setting rates and to \nregulate the rates and to provide special subsidies for one part of our \nsociety as opposed to another is not only unnecessary but is \ncounterproductive.\n  So I stand in support of the fact that the marketplace will do a good \njob of providing service. And I just elevate for your consideration \nsomething of what has happened in terms of cellular phones. Some have \nindicated that because there are rural areas there would not be \ncellular phones. My State, which has substantial rural area, is covered \nwith cellular phones. Virtually every part of the State is accessible \nto them. And I was charmed the other day, when meeting with some \ncellular phone operators, to find that one of the rural cellular \noperators includes in the package that is offered free long-distance \nphones so that if you pay for time on your cellular telephone, you can \ncall anywhere you want to in the United States of America at the same \nrate you can call the next phone.\n  This is sort of the prejudice that they are alleging, I \nsuppose, is going to ruin us if we do not have this \nmicromanagement in the telecom- munications \nindustry.\n  That is not prejudice at all. That is just the fact that \nentrepreneurs are at work in rural America as well as they are in urban \nAmerica, and as a matter of fact in rural America sometimes \ntelecommunications services are substantially enhanced and can even be \nat a competitive advantage, comparably stronger, offered with a more \nattractive array of advantages and features, than they would in the \nurban setting.\n  It is with that in mind I think this amendment is well taken, that I \nthink it is unnecessary to set rates and to have micromanagement and \nspecial privileges and subsidies built into this bill at a time when \ntelecommunications is going to be more and more available as a result \nof technology, when the rates will be going down as a result of a \nproliferation of providers and services. And for us to single out a few \ngroups, some of them inordinately narrow, perhaps providing additional \nadvantages to public schools as opposed to private schools, some of \nthem inordinately broad, providing this subsidy to all libraries, \nhowever they may be defined or constituted, it seems to me this section \nwould be a section without which we could do well. And for that reason \nI support the amendment as proposed by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I grew up in North Dakota, in a town of \nabout 300 people. I graduated in a high school class of 9. It is always \ninteresting to come to the Senate floor and listen to folks who talk to \nus about the marketplace and competition and the advantages of this \nfree market system as the allocator of goods and services. Frankly, in \nmy hometown, a small town 50 to 60 miles from the nearest big town, \nwhich was 12,000 people, we did not receive a lot of the marketplace \nadvantages that big cities have. And we did not complain a lot about \nit. We had a lot of other advantages living in a small town. We did not \nhave a theater in Regent, ND. I guess you have a theater in big towns.\n  I do not come to the floor of the Senate suggesting somehow from a \npublic policy standpoint we need to have theaters in my hometown or in \nsmall towns in order to enjoy the arts. We missed out on a lot of the \nadvantages that the market system brings to big communities because the \nmarket system works in search of revenue and income and profits.\n  The market system works when competition is developed around a \ncircumstance where competitors can provide a service or sell a product \nand make money. Where are they going to do that? They are going to do \nthat where people live because the more people, the bigger the market, \nthe more potential for profit.\n  That is the way the market system works. We understand that. All of \nus have likely studied Adam Smith, who talked about the cloak of the \ninvisible hand in the market place. Adam Smith would be rolling over in \nhis grave these days because he preached these things before there was \nthe modern convenience of the corporation --the artificial person that \nis born, lives, and never dies. Adam Smith actually talked about the \nmarketplace and the cloak of the invisible hand when we had people who \nparticipated in the marketplace who lived and then died.\n  But, in today's marketplace, the corporations dominate and they do \nnot die.\n  It is a different life and a different time. So Adam Smith, I \nsuppose, would adapt.\n  It is useful, I think, to talk about this issue of deregulation and \nthe issue of airlines, even on this amendment. The Senator from South \nCarolina was, [[Page S7976]] I think, still addressing the core subject \nwhen he talked about deregulation of airlines on this amendment, \nbecause this amendment really provides an opportunity for people to see \ncompeting visions of what we ought to be doing.\n  Some stand up and say, ``It doesn't matter what it is.'' It does not \nmatter if it is communications, health care, transportation. It does \nnot matter what it is, let the market system decide who gets served, \nwhen they get served, and how they get served.\n  I am glad we had folks in Congress who did not believe that back in \nthe thirties when they decided how to move some electricity around to \nprovide advantages in this country and nobody in the world wanted to \nserve the farms in rural America because it was too expensive. If you \nhad one customer for every 2 miles, you are not going to run a line out \nthere and try to serve a farm because it is not profitable. The result, \nif you lived out in the country, is you did not turn on a light switch \nbecause you did not have electricity.\n  Congress said there are some things universal in nature, some things \neverybody ought to enjoy the advantage of in this country. Electricity \nwas one. So enough people in Congress felt differently than those who \npropose this amendment, and said, ``Well, we understand the \nmarketplace, we understand competition, but we understand also there \nare some universal needs one of which is electricity.'' Therefore, they \nconstructed an REA Program and brought electricity to farms, \nelectrified rural America, and unleashed productivity never dreamed of \nbefore.\n  That would never have happened if we worshiped at the altar of the \nmarketplace and said rural America will get electricity as soon as the \nutility companies decide to run a line out there. When will that be? \nNever.\n  The Senator from South Carolina, as he stood and spoke about this \namendment, talked about airline deregulation. Airline deregulation had \nat its roots the notion of let the marketplace decide who gets air \nservice, at what price, and what convenience in this country.\n  We know what has happened with airline deregulation despite all the \nlittle statistics and charts people keep bringing to my attention. If \nyou live in rural America and you access airline service, you have less \nchoice and higher prices. It is a plain fact. If you live in Chicago, \nGod bless you, then you have more choice and lower prices. That is just \nthe way it works. There is no denying it. All the data in the world \ndemonstrate that is the case.\n  ``Oh,'' some will say, ``gee, there are more little flights here and \nthere.'' Yes, there are little propeller airplanes running around. The \nfact is the minute a regional jet carrier tries to start out, one of \nthe large carriers tries to squash them like a bug and do it \nsuccessfully. I think it is interesting what is happening in the \nairline industry is the big have gotten bigger, the big carriers have \ngotten much, much bigger by merging and absorbing little carriers.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle who preach competition and who \ntalk about the virtues of the marketplace never stand up and say, \n``Wait a second, when the big get bigger and you concentrate more power \nin the hands of the few, you have less competition.'' In other words, \nthose who bring these amendments to the Senate floor talk about the \nvirtues of the marketplace, preach about competition but they do not \npractice it. If they practiced competition, they would care about \nending up with only four or five very large airlines who have absorbed \nall the regional carriers. You do not hear that. You never hear from \nthe folks who talk about competition, what we need to do to keep \ncompetitive and what we need to do to fight monopolistic tendencies.\n  In the airline deregulation issue, it was decided that the Department \nof Transportation shall make judgments about whether a merger is in the \npublic interest or not, and the Justice Department shall be consulted.\n  Mr. President, do you know what has happened? What has happened is a \nmerger is proposed by a large carrier buying up a smaller carrier and \nit goes to the Department of Transportation. The Department of \nTransportation raises its hands and says, ``Hosanna, this is just fine, \nwe have no problem.'' The Department of Justice says, ``No, this is not \nin the public interest,'' but the Department of Transportation approves \nit anyway.\n  That brings me to the telecommunications bill. We have the same \nproblem. They say, ``Let's defang the Department of Justice and let the \nFederal Communications Commission decide when the regional Bells should \nbe allowed to enter into long distance. What is the competitive test, \nwhen does competition exist and when does it not, regarding local and \nlong distance services.''\n  Same old thing. We apparently have not learned with respect to \nairline deregulation and giving the Department of Transportation the \nauthority and rendering the Department of Justice to a consultative \nrole.\n  Some of us will offer amendments on the role of the Justice \nDepartment, which I hope the Senate will accept. If we are going to \nstand here preaching competition on the floor of the Senate, let us all \npractice the virtues of competition. Let us nurture the benefits of \ncompetition by deciding that we want competition in a real way to exist \nin this country.\n  I do not understand sometimes those who say there is no other \ninterest we have except having the marketplace and the potential \nprofits dictate who gets what in this country. There are apparently no \nother influences or interests they have in terms of what advantages \nAmericans should enjoy, what kind of things are universal in nature--\ntransportation, communications, and others.\n  I recall a book written by Upton Sinclair as a result of research he \ndid at the turn of the century. I do not want to ruin anybody's dinner, \nbut Upton Sinclair is the person who toured the meat packing plants and \ndiscovered the scandal of the rats in the meat packing plants. \nProducers put arsenic on slices of bread and placed them around the \nmeat packing plant so the rats would eat the arsenic and die. The rats \ndied and they shove the bread and the rats in the hole with the meat, \nand they produce the mystery sausage. That is what America was eating.\n  Upton Sinclair said this is what is going on. Then America rose up \nand said, ``We don't want to eat that.'' The barons of industry \nproducing meat laced with rat poisons and rats apparently going down \nthe same chutes were pursuing profits but not very interested in the \nhealth of our country.\n  So Congress said maybe we ought to inspect meat. Maybe those folks \nwho say the free-market system should not be interrupted are prepared \nat this point to say, ``Let's not inspect meat because we are \ninconveniencing the folks who run the meat packing plants.'' Maybe we \nshould not inspect airlines for safety because we inconvenience the \nairlines.\n  I have heard some disciples--not anybody in the Congress--but I have \nheard the free market advocates and some of the theorists suggest if \npeople are putting out bad infant formula, babies will die and people \nwill realize that the company is selling bad infant formula. Pretty \nsoon, consumers will not buy any more infant formula and the company \nwill go bankrupt. So the penalty for killing babies is bankruptcy.\n  Maybe the same theory is on airline safety. You do not have a \nGovernment role on airline safety. If the airline is not safe, if they \ndo not have their own internal safety mechanism, planes crash and \npeople will say, ``We won't fly that airline anymore, and, therefore, \nthe market system is a self-regulatory system, so we do not want to \nworry about airline safety,'' they would say. ``We don't have to worry \nabout meat inspection,'' they would say. ``Those are all inconveniences \nto the market system. Let's let the income stream of the market system \nand competitive forces determine who does what in this country.''\n  I have taken a long tour to get back to the central point. I \nrecognize that. This is a perfect place for us to talk about the \ndifferences between us and them, and by them I am talking about those \nwho stand and say there is not a public good that is involved here when \nyou single out libraries or hospitals in rural areas with respect to \nrates charged and the buildup of infrastructure of the actual \ncommunications industry. They say, ``No, that's meddling, that's \ntinkering.'' We have heard all these voices before. They say the market \nsystem will work, and if the market system does not get these services \nto those rural areas, to those hospitals, [[Page S7977]] to those \nschools, those libraries, then tough luck, it was not meant to be.\n  I would appreciate it, if anybody is keeping score, if they would put \nme down as a meddler, at least a tinkerer. Maybe someone who believes \nthat it is worthy as we build up the infrastructure of \ntelecommunications to have some on-ramps and some off-ramps, yes, even \nin the smallest portions of this country,\n even in rural towns, even at small libraries, even in rural hospitals. \nIf we do not believe that, as far as I am concerned, I do not want to \nparticipate in building it. Is that selfish? Probably. But I come from \na part of the country where they crossed with wagon trains, years and \nyears ago, to get where they were going, and they understood back then \nthe concept of moving together. You did not move wagon trains ahead \nunless all the wagons were ready. You do not move ahead by leaving some \nbehind. That is part of the focus of this debate, I believe.\n\n  This can be a remarkable opportunity for our country by seeing the \nexplosion, the breathtaking new technology in telecommunications that \nimproves our lives. But it can also be the development of a system of \ncommunications, producing services and products that leaves out a \nsignificant portion of our population if it is not done properly.\n  I hope that as we go through this debate, we will expose over and \nover again the basic conflict between the two theories expressed on \nthis floor--one by some who say let the market system allocate and \ndecide and do not meddle and worry about whether folks in the rural \nareas are beneficiaries of this breathtaking new technology. And others \nof us say, no, this is something of a more universal need and a more \nuniversal nature, and we want all of America to benefit from it.\n  That is what this amendment is about, I suppose, and why I oppose it. \nI think it contravenes that basic need that we have in this country to \nmake sure all Americans benefit from the potential good that comes from \nthis new telecommunications industry.\n  So, Mr. President, I would like to make one additional point. I know \nthat the chairman of the committee and the ranking member are very \nanxious to move forward. We have a vote ordered now or one that is \nabout to be ordered. Is there a vote pending at this point?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No. We are working on an agreement.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understood earlier this week that the antiterrorism \nlegislation should be moved quickly, and I cooperated with that. It was \nimportant to do that. The majority leader was absolutely correct. But I \ndo not think there is a compelling need to suggest that we ought to be \ndealing with hundreds of billions of dollars in American industry and \nthe rules for the telecommunications industry and be worrying about \nwhether we get 20 or 30 minutes to fully debate something that is going \nto have a profound impact on our country. Let us take some time on \nthese amendments and explore them thoroughly, and let us have good \ndebate and substantial debate, and then let us make judgments.\n  But there is no reason, in my judgment, to believe that we have to \nfinish this bill by 6 o'clock tonight or 9 o'clock tonight or 10 \no'clock tomorrow. This bill ought to take whatever time it needs for us \nto devote our best energies and intellect to make sure this is the \nright thing for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the \namendment that has been offered by Senator McCain. It certainly is \ndisturbing to think that some Members in this body cannot accept a \nprovision that will provide affordable access to rural schools, \nlibraries, and health care providers, given that we have become part of \nthe information age, and this issue is absolutely critical to our \nNation's future.\n  The Senator from Arizona has offered an amendment that will strike \nthe provision that was offered by Senator Rockefeller, Senator Exon, \nSenator Kerrey, and myself in the Commerce Committee which requires \ntelecommunications carriers, upon a bona fide request, to provide \nimportant telecommunications services to schools and libraries and \nrural health care providers.\n  This principle of affordable access is not a new concept. The \nuniversal service concept has been embodied in our national \ntelecommunications policy since 1934, to ensure that all parts of \nAmerica had access to the telephone. It was important to ensure that \nall Americans had access to the essential service at the time, \ntelephone service.\n  But universal service needs to be updated, and in fact, the bill \nrecognizes that universal service is an evolving concept. The bill \npresently ensures universal service for telemedicine, and educational \nservices, which I believe will make a difference, not only for America \nand its ability to compete with other countries, but also for \nindividuals in preparing themselves for the work force of tomorrow, \nwhich we know will be constantly changing. And ensuring that our \nNation's children gain access to the important technologies of the \nfuture will make a significant difference in the standard of living \nthey and their families will enjoy for years to come. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  The Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, is offering an amendment to \nstrike this language. His amendment will result in a nation of \ntechnology haves and have-nots, and that is not an outcome that I am \nwilling to accept.\n  I do not believe that we in Congress should pass a new \ntelecommunications policy--I might add, the first revision of the \nCommunications Act since 1934--which divides our Nation between the \ntelecommunications haves and the have-nots. Many of the \ntelecommunications providers are going to reap enormous gains from this \nlegislation. Most will, and some will not. But the point is, in \nderegulating the telecommunications industry, we must make sure that we \ndo not deny important areas of our country affordable access to \ntelecommunications services.\n  We know the densely populated urban areas will benefit from \nderegulation. They will have the benefit of all of the advances in \ntechnology for today and tomorrow and thereafter. But what about the \nrural areas? We know now that telecommunications services are far more \nexpensive in rural areas than they are in urban areas, for example, \naccess to Internet costs more in rural areas because the Internet nodes \nof access often are not in local calling areas, meaning that rural \nconsumers must pay toll rates.\n  What is going to happen now? If we do not guarantee some affordable \naccess to telecommunications services in rural schools, libraries, and \nhealth care centers, where are they going to be tomorrow? Where will \nour Nation be? It is in our national interest to ensure that these \nareas are part of the information superhighway.\n  If we want young people to be familiar with technology and to have it \nbecome second nature to them, to understand that it is their future, I \ncannot understand why we would support Senator McCain's amendment, \nwhich would take out the one provision that provides enormous public \ngain for all of America.\n  Look at telemedicine. It is the here and now and it is the wave of \nthe future. I have talked to many rural health care centers in my State \nof Maine. They need affordable access to telemedicine. They need the \nhelp so that they can provide the same kind of services and health care \nfor their rural constituents as enjoyed by residents of more densely \npopulated areas.\n  I received a letter recently from Eastern Maine Health Care Services, \nwhich is located in a rural area of the State. They write:\n\n       In the past several months, a network of hospitals have \n     begun to collaborate in our region of Maine. One of the \n     outstanding issues within that group is the need to use \n     telemedicine as a tool for providing cost-effective quality \n     health care from the smallest to the largest towns in our \n     region. Telemedicine in our region is defined as the \n     transmission of data --voice, image, and video--over \n     distance. We have come across many obstacles in this \n     endeavor, but one of the greatest obstacles is the \n     transmission of these media over the present \n     telecommunications lines at an affordable cost. Many of the \n     hospitals and health centers in our service area have \n     extremely limited funds.\n  I thank the Senator, the chairman of our committee, Mr. Pressler, for \nincluding important refinements to this language in the managers' \namendment. I know that there are some, such as the sponsor of the \namendment to strike this language, who believe that the \n[[Page S7978]] marketplace should be free of regulations and that \nsomehow, someway, affordable telecommunications will be available for \neverybody at affordable rates.\n  Other Senators have mentioned here on the floor today, as an example \nof deregulation and the impact that it has had on many rural parts of \nour country, the impact of airline deregulation. I can certainly speak \nfirsthand to that, as far as how it has affected the State of Maine. It \ncertainly has denied us the kind of airline service I would have \nthought might have developed from deregulation, and it simply has not \nhappened.\n  Many of the areas that at one time had the benefits of airline \nservice--and I might add jet service--do not even have the benefits of \ncommercial airline service.\n  Our largest city in the State of Maine, Portland, ME, is losing jet \nservice as a result of deregulation. That is occurring this year.\n  Since we have had deregulation--this is about 17 years ago --the \nsituation has gotten worse. It has not improved in the rural areas of \nour country. That is a fact.\n  I can speak to it firsthand because I use those airlines every week. \nWe have commuter services. We do not have jet service for the most \npart, anymore, in the State of Maine. Most of the areas, like Presque \nIsle and Portland, that used to have jet service do not have the \nbenefits of commercial airline service.\n  So that is why I cannot understand why we want to apply the same \nnotion here when it comes to telecommunication services. What will \nhappen to the rural area? Who will make sure that our schools, \nlibraries and health care centers are going to have the benefits of our \nnational information infrastructure, if we do not provide for that in \nthis legislation?\n  House Speaker Newt Gingrich said ``If our country doesn't figure out \na way to bring the information age to the country's poor, we are buying \nourselves a 21st century of enormous domestic pain.'' He said, \n``Somehow there has to be a missionary spirit in America that says to \nthe poor kid, the Internet is for you, the information is for you.''\n  Well, that is exactly right. But I think that we have an obligation \nas a Nation to ensure that our young people have affordable access to \nthis kind of service.\n  The National Center for Education Statistics reports--and I think it \nis interesting to note these statistics because I think it proves the \npoint--that 35 percent of public schools have access to the internet, \nbut only 3 percent of all instructional rooms, classrooms, labs, and \nmedia centers in public schools are connected to the internet.\n  Of the 35 percent of the schools with access, 36 percent cited \ntelecommunication rates as a barrier to maximizing the use of their \ntelecommunication capabilities.\n  Some would suggest that the Snowe-Rockefeller-Kerrey amendment is \nopening a Pandora's box, a new array of entitlements for schools, \nlibraries and hospitals. No, it is not.\n  As I said earlier in my remarks, universal service provisions for \nresidential consumers existed in the bill prior to the adoption of this \namendment, to this legislation, in the committee.\n  Those provisions guaranteed access to essential telecommunication \nservices for residential consumers. Our amendment simply provides that \nassurance for key institutions in rural areas. Our objective is to \nensure that rural areas are on an equal footing in terms of schools, \nlibraries, and health care facilities in urban areas.\n  I should also mention the fact that we have worked with some of the \nBell telephone companies to address their concerns. We made some \nchanges in the language, to address their concerns about incremental \ncosts language. The revised language ensures affordable access to \neducational services for schools and libraries, and discounts will be \ndetermined, as for residential consumers, by the joint board in \nconjunction with the FCC and the states. The discount must be an amount \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to use the telecommunications \nservices for educational services.\n  Some have suggested that these discounts would be wasted on some \ncommunities with poor schools, low literacy rates, high levels of \nunemployment, or other social problems. I disagree. This language will \nopen doors, not close them. Those communities stand to gain enormously \nfrom the telecommunication network. It will open up a whole new world \nto these communities. Senator McCain's amendment will deny those gains, \nbenefits, and opportunities for troubled areas.\n  We do not know what the future will be all about. We do not have a \ncrystal ball. We do know, however, that technology and the information \nage is going to be very much part of our future, I think in ways which \nwe cannot now fully anticipate or appreciate even today.\n  This is the first time we have addressed telecommunication policies, \nI mentioned, since 1934. There probably will be years and decades \nbefore we come back to this issue as a Nation and as an institution.\n  How can we seek to deprive some areas of the country of the knowledge \nthat they need in order to thrive and to develop, and to be productive \nfor the future, for their future and this country's future?\n  Knowledge is power. To cut some areas off from the information \nsuperhighway is not only denying them the future that they deserve, but \nit is denying the kind of future this country deserves, because their \nfuture is going to affect America's future.\n  I hope that the Senate will reject this amendment of Senator McCain \nto strike out our universal service language, which, I might add, is \nnot a new concept. In fact, it is interesting to note that the Commerce \nCommittee in the last Congress approved a bill by a vote of 18 to 2 \nwhich contained adopted similar language on this very issue, extending \nthe universal service concept to these key institutions, schools, \nlibraries and rural health care facilities. Last year's bill went even \nfurther than this year's bill--it contained universal service discounts \nfor museums and zoos and so on.\n  We narrowed our language to ensure that we were just addressing the \nneeds of key entities that are so important to the development of this \nNation.\n  Funding is a major barrier to access, it is the one that is most \noften cited in the acquisition of users of advanced telecommunications \nin public schools.\n  Smaller schools, with enrollments of less than 300, are less likely \nto be on the internet than schools with larger enrollment sizes. Only \n30 percent of the small schools reported having internet access, while \n58 percent of schools with enrollments of 1,000 or more reported having \ninternet access.\n  So we know that there is a gap between the high expectations of an \nincreasingly technologically-driven society and the inability of most \nschools, particularly rural schools, to prepare students adequately for \nthe high-technology future.\n  Almost 90 percent of K through 12 classrooms lack even basic access \nto telephone service. Telephone lines are used to hook up modems to the \ninternet. When classrooms do have phone lines, schools are typically \ncharged at the corporate rate for service. Schools and libraries in \nrural areas often pay more for access to information services because \nthe information service providers are not located in the local calling \nregions, meaning they have to make long-distance calls.\n  A recent study conducted by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries \nand Information Science found that 21 percent of public libraries had \ninternet connections. Only 12.8 percent provide public access \nterminals. Internet connections were 77 percent for public libraries \nserving a population base of more than 1 million, but declined to 13.3 \npercent for libraries serving fewer than 5,000. Maine, I might add, has \na population of 1.2 million. The largest city representing Maine has no \nmore than 80,000 people.\n  I hope that Members of this body would understand the importance and \nthe value of maintaining the language that we have included in this \nlegislation. It is so important to our future and to our children's \nfuture. It is fundamental that we, as a Nation, assure that all areas \nin America have access to essential telecommunication services for the \nfuture.\n  I, for one, will not vote to deprive schools and libraries and \nhospitals of the affordable telecommunication services that they need \nand require. [[Page S7979]] \n  I hope that Members of this body will vote to defeat Senator McCain's \namendment. His amendment will go a long ways toward denying the \nimportant opportunities that we should afford our young people. No \nmatter where they live in America, everyone should be entitled to have \naccess to the information superhighway which will be so much a part of \nour future. So I urge Members of this body to defeat the McCain \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak just briefly on this \namendment that Senator McCain has offered to strike out section 310 of \nthe telecommunications bill and indicate my strong opposition to that \neffort. The provision which he is intending to strike was added by the \nSenator from Maine in the committee markup with the help of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia and I know with the urging of the Senators from \nNebraska and others. I think the provision that was adopted in \ncommittee is an excellent provision and one we need to keep in the \nbill.\n  I became interested in this set of issues because of the needs in my \nown State of New Mexico to provide telecommunications services to rural \nschools in particular, but also to rural hospitals and to rural \nlibraries. In our State, we have one model program which came to my \nattention several years ago, and that is at the Clovis Community \nCollege on the east side of New Mexico. It is a 2-year school. They \nbegan a pilot project several years ago to provide instruction from \nthat community college into nine of our rural high schools in that part \nof the State. We still have, today, in this school year which is just \nnow ending, classes taught at the community college that students in \nthose small, rural high schools are able to access in their own \nclassrooms. That has been a very successful project and it is a model \nfor what we ought to be doing throughout my State and throughout this \nentire country.\n  However, we are not able to do it throughout my State and throughout \nthis entire country because of the enormous cost of taking advantage of \ntelecommunications services. What is needed is special provisions, \nspecial rates so that educational services can be provided to schools \nat reasonable cost; and can be provided to rural hospitals and rural \nlibraries at reasonable cost.\n  I am persuaded that technology can either be a great boon to mankind \nand to the people in this country in coming years, or it can prove to \nbe a great divider of our people. Either it will help us all to pull \nourselves up and realize the opportunity that is present in this \ncountry, or it will further divide the rich from the poor, the urban \nfrom the rural, the ``haves'' from the ``have nots.''\n  The provision that the Senator from Maine proposed in committee, \nwhich is now in the bill and which we need to keep in the bill, goes a \nlong way toward helping us ensure that technology brings us together \ninstead of dividing us. I do think it is essential that we take some \naction in this area as a public policy matter. You cannot leave \neverything up to the free market system.\n  I heard the Senator from North Dakota speaking, Senator Dorgan, \nearlier this afternoon. He was pointing out that left to its own \ndevices, the free market system will provide technological opportunity \nand new technology and benefits to those who can pay the bill. We want \nthat to happen. But we also want some access to that technology for \nthose who may not be able to pay as much and that is what this \nprovision is intended to do.\n  There is another example in my State which I just would allude to \nbecause it is a very small example but perhaps one that people can \nunderstand. There is a small community in New Mexico called Santa Rosa, \nwhich is east of Albuquerque on our Interstate 40. That is the \ncommunity that you have to go to if you live in Guadalupe County and \nyou want to go to high school. You have to travel to Santa Rosa.\n  North of Santa Rosa about 60 miles is the much smaller community of \nAnton Chico. If you live in Anton Chico you have school right there up \nthrough the elementary level, and then you have to get on a bus and \ntravel 60 miles each way to go to high school.\n  What the school district there in Guadalupe County has done very \neffectively, is use telecommunications to provide instruction from the \nSanta Rosa schools to a classroom in Anton Chico, for those students \nwho wish to continue past the eighth grade and take instruction in the \nninth grade without having to travel all the way to Santa Rosa.\n  This has allowed them to keep students in that school for that extra \nyear, and in many cases keep those students involved in education long \nenough that they will stay in school through twelfth grade.\n  This is dealing with a very, very real problem we have in New Mexico \nof students dropping out. They drop out for a variety of reasons, but \none of the reasons that students drop out in some of the rural parts of \nour State is because of the physical problems of getting to the high \nschool that they need to attend each day.\n  Modern telecommunications services can help us to solve this problem. \nOne of the great opportunities that we have as a country, as we try to \nimprove our educational system, is to take proper advantage of new \ntechnology to keep students interested, to help students raise the \nstandards that they are achieving in school, and to eliminate the \ndifference that exists between the quality of instruction in urban \nschools and that of rural schools.\n  In order that technology is successful or is able to help us in this \nregard, we need to deal with the problem of the cost of using that \ntechnology. This provision allows that. I hope very much we will keep \nit in the bill. It is one of the better provisions in this \ntelecommunications bill and I think it would be a very sad day if the \nSenate were to agree to strike this part of the bill.\n  I compliment the Senator from Maine, the Senator from West Virginia, \nthe Senators from Nebraska, and others who have worked hard to get this \nprovision in the committee-reported bill. I urge my colleagues to keep \nit in there and to defeat the McCain amendment when it comes to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to try to give a sense of a \nlittle bit of the overview of this, and do it within a relatively short \namount of time. I want to also say that there have been some very \nconstructive conversations that have been taking place, which reflect \nthemselves in the managers' amendment.\n  For example, there was a very constructive conversation yesterday \nafternoon involving the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, myself, and others with, for example, Bell Atlantic, \nwhich represents my State, Ameritech, NYNEX. We were able to reach \naccommodation in a very constructive, positive way, in ways which are \nreflected in the managers' amendment. So I do not want people to think \nthis is kind of a pitched battle only. There have been some people who \nhave been trying to do some good work on this, on both the corporate \nand senatorial side.\n  I have to say we have heard some absolutely amazing statements from \nthe Senator from Arizona and some of his allies. Make no mistake about \nwhat they are trying to do. They are trying to say to all of these \ntelecommunications giants: Go ahead and charge exorbitant rates on the \nbacks of America's schools and libraries and rural health institutions, \nand keep those community institutions off the ramps of learning and \ntelemedicine. Or go ahead, in the alternative, and milk schools and \nlibraries for as much money as you can get.\n  I can fly, under airline deregulation, from Huntington, WV, to \nWashington, DC, in 1 hour. But it is cheaper to fly from Washington, \nDC, to Los Angeles. I think you understand the point. Where people \nthink they can put it to you and they are in a profitmaking business \nand they do not have a sense of corporate responsibility or a broader \npicture, as some that I have mentioned do have, they will do it. And \nthey have done it. And it hurts.\n  We should reject that kind of thinking out of hand in this Chamber. \nPrivate telecommunications companies [[Page S7980]] are being given an \nopen ticket in this bill to get into new businesses, exciting \nbusinesses, important businesses, making all kinds of profits and \nreaping incredible dividends. And I do not object to that. I do not \nobject to that. I think what we are looking at is an extraordinary \nexcitement.\n  I had dinner with the President of a computer company last night--\nwith six of them, in fact. He said within a very few years any citizen \nof the world will be able to talk with any other citizen of the world \ndirectly, through e-mail or some such, based upon the name of the \nperson, the service that the person provides, be it a business or a \nlocation. There will be worldwide direct person-to-person communication \nin as fast a time and with as much clarity as you pick up your local \ntelephone to dial your mother-in-law.\n  All we are doing in our provision is to say, in return for this \nexplosion of excitement and opportunity and profits, which create, \nindeed, more opportunity for all of that growth, for all of those \nprofits that you will now be able to get your hands on, make sure that \nyou bring libraries, schools, and hospitals along with you. That is \ncalled a fair deal.\n  Mr. President, let us be clear about what the Senator from Arizona is \ntrying to do also with this amendment. This amendment strikes a dagger \ninto the heart of Main Street U.S.A. Just about every issue associated \nwith the telecommunications industry sounds incredibly complicated and \nconfusing. As soon as you start talking about it, the jargon and the \nterms are from a world of their own--cyberspace, internet, on-line, you \nname it.\n  The Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey amendment in this bill--and the one \nthat the Senator from Arizona wants to strip from this bill--has an \nextremely simple, basic mission. It is the way to make absolutely sure \nthat America's schools, elementary and secondary, libraries and rural \nhealth care institutions are part of this information superhighway that \nis unfolding before our eyes. I do not think anyone is confused about \nwhat we mean when we say that schools, libraries, and rural hospitals \nshould be one of this country's and this body's highest priorities. \nWithout a doubt, I can say that is how the people of West Virginia \nfeel--that our schools, our libraries, and our rural hospitals and \nclinics are a lifeline that we hold most dear. And that is true for all \nStates.\n  The provision in this bill, and the one being attacked by the McCain \namendment, which we hope loses, designates these vital institutions--\nagain, schools, libraries, rural health facilities, and hospitals--as \ncommunity users and then requires communications companies to charge \nthis category of community user affordable rates for universal service. \nThrough this part of the bill, we guarantee that America's children and \nlibrary users and health care providers in rural communities can take \nadvantage of the exciting range of technologies that are in fact the \nnew roads, the new interstates, to education and lifesaving medical \ninformation.\n  I applaud the Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, for her work in \nincorporating this provision into the telecommunications bill. It is \nher amendment. Together we presented this idea to our colleagues in the \nCommerce Committee, and her commitment to this idea helped win the day \nwhen we had the vote on our provision. Both Senators from Nebraska, \nSenators Kerrey and Exon, have been stalwart partners in this work. \nThis provision, section 3010 of the bill, is a major reason to enact \ntelecommunications reform. Looking at it from my State's perspective, \nit is the major reason. This is a historic chance to ensure that \nschools, libraries, and rural health care providers will acquire \naffordable access to advanced communications services, not only now but \nin the future, and all kinds of possibilities that we can only begin to \nimagine today.\n  The telecommunications bill before us, carefully crafted by Senators \nHollings and Pressler, presents us with an opportunity that will not \ncome again. It is time to unleash an industry into the realm of \ncompetition, innovation, job creation, product creation and profit. But \nin return, Mr. President, we should make sure that the most basic \ninstitutions of our community and our society can hitch a ride onto \nthis great journey.\n  Once a few of the kinks and other parts of this bill are worked out--\nby that I mean things that are being worked on by the leadership as I \ntalk--the passage of this bill will be good news for business, good \nnews for workers and consumers, and good news for our country as a \nwhole. And it will be great news for our basic institutions, the \ninstitutions through which all of us have to pass in order to achieve \nadulthood--schools, libraries, in this case rural health facilities--\nbecause they know they will not be left behind. If the McCain amendment \npasses, they will be left behind. If it is defeated, those schools, \nlibraries, and rural health facilities will not be left behind.\n  The Senator from Arizona thinks this is a part of the bill that can \nbe amputated or weakened. If that is what he thinks, let me be very, \nvery clear about what that means to schools, libraries, and rural \nhealth institutions. You are telling the organizations that are the \nbedrock of America that they will just have to stay on the back roads \nof communications. The organizations with the big money and clout can \nspeed their way onto that information superhighway as fast as they \nwant. But the institutions that educate our children and our adults, \nthat serve Americans with the keys to knowledge, that treat and cure \nthe people of rural communities will have to settle for the back road.\n  Mr. President, I do not want anybody to be at all unclear about this. \nOne of the things that we have learned in the Commerce Committee and in \nour own conversations is, if we think the world has begun to change in \nterms of telecommunications up until this point, we have not seen \nanything yet. Remember, I said a moment ago that every 18 months the \ncapacity of computers has doubled for the last 30 years. That is going \nto speed up. So what we are talking about now is going to be far \ngreater in the future. Therefore, what we deprive people of now will \nhurt much more in the future than we can possibly imagine.\n  Our provision in the bill says to these institutions that they will \nhave their place on the modern roads of telecommunications--schools, \nlibraries, rural health clinics, and hospitals.\n  We intend to open the new worlds of knowledge and learning and \neducation to all Americans, rich and poor, rural and urban. Browsing a \nPresidential library, reviewing the collections of the Smithsonian, \nstudying science or finding new information on the treatment of an \nillness are becoming available to all Americans through new \ntechnologies in their homes or at their schools, libraries and rural \nhospitals. And our provision, the one that the Senator from Arizona \nwants to strike, is designed to make sure that these links do get made \nto our children and citizens.\n  Mr. President, our provision is targeted. It promises affordable \nrates to institutions that are the heart and soul of the communities of \nthe United States of America, and we all know it. Our provision deals \nwith the new realities and opportunities that face schools and \nlibraries and rural health institutions in the towns and States that we \nall represent--every single one of us--rural or urban.\n  We hear a lot about the explosion of computers in America's homes. \nBut let us keep in mind that a lot of families cannot afford their own \ncomputers and equipment for their children.\n  They cannot afford that. This Senator can. Some other Senators here \ncan. Most people cannot. We are talking, Mr. President, about thousands \nof dollars that many, many families in my State of West Virginia and \nelsewhere simply do not have for this kind of purchase. The Presiding \nOfficer may be aware that in 1994, for the first time, the purchase of \npersonal computers surpassed the sale of television sets in this \ncountry. The Presiding Officer may be aware that those who are on \nInternet are now 30 million, and that that number is growing at 10 \npercent per month, but it is not growing in Welch, WV. It is not \ngrowing in Alderson, WV, and it is not growing in the Presiding \nOfficer's rural areas and some of his urban areas because the people do \nnot have the capacity to get on line to join up with that information \nhighway. [[Page S7981]] \n  Schools and libraries are the institutions that serve our communities \nand that serve our children, no matter what. That is why we want to \nmake sure that these institutions can count on affordable rates to get \non line, to tap into telecommunications services and to bring in the \nlearning and the information from distant places for our children and \nadults and other users to learn from.\n  No matter where one lives, we want every citizen to have a chance to \ngo to the local library and visit a world of information available as a \nresult of these new technologies.\n  I am very sorry to hear some talk of different ways to achieve our \nbasic goal. Let us face it. Some communications companies do not want \nto be forced to offer rates to even the most basic institutions serving \nour communities. But let me be clear. Our approach is the simplest way \nto achieve the simplest goal I believe that all of us support--\naffordable access to communications that these community institutions \nin fact do need. The Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerrey part of this bill \nprovides the way to ensure that elementary and secondary schools and \nlibraries have access to essential universal telecommunications \nservices, which will be defined, incidentally, by the universal service \nboard described in this bill, at rates that are affordable. The \naffordable rate will be determined by the FCC and the State commission, \ndepending upon whether you are talking interstate or intrastate.\n  What does this mean for thousands of elementary and secondary schools \nin America? A 1995 study by the National Center for Education \nStatistics discovered, to my shock, that only 3 percent of classrooms \nin public schools in America were connected to something called \nInternet, which is the whole future, a large part of the future--only 3 \npercent. Why? One reason has to be the lack of funds to even buy the \nequipment.\n  But another reason, which becomes more serious as schools do scrape \ntogether the money for the one-time expense of buying equipment, is \ntheir inability to pay excessive rates to hook into those services. It \nis one thing to have the computer on the table or the desk. It is \nanother to have that hooked up to the wall and then through that wall \nto the other wall. That is expensive.\n  Look at the study of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries. They \nfound that 21 percent of public libraries are connected to the \nInternet. And I thought that was pretty good news. But that figure then \nsuddenly drops to 13 percent when it comes to public libraries in rural \nareas and small communities.\n  Why does it drop? Because there are libraries that do not have the \nmoney and will not have the money to pay commercial rates to be on-\nline. And therefore you just count them out of it.\n  I described in Pocahontas County--and I see my senior colleague from \nWest Virginia here--the small, octagonal library that was barely \nscraped together, the only library in the county. It is one of the \nlargest counties east of the Mississippi and it has about 7,000 people \nin it. And we scraped together the money to put that octagonal building \nup, all made of wood and put solar panels on the outside because fuel \nis expensive.\n  Now, of course, there is a problem; it rains 45 inches every year in \nPocahontas County so the solar panels do not work, so they have to \nspend money on fuel. But that is typical of a rural community, of a \nlibrary trying to make it. And then you ask them on top of that to have \nto pay money to hook up to these information systems. It cannot work \nand it will not work, and it is not fair to those people. Why is \nsomebody born in a big city any better than somebody born in a small \nrural area? The answer is he or she is not. But I refuse to be a part \nof creating a two-tier society. We appear to be on our way to doing \nthat in other ways. I do not want it to be done in terms of the ability \nto learn and to grow.\n  In West Virginia, our schools are determined, by hook or crook, to \nget computers into every one of our 900 elementary and secondary \nschools because our Governor has made it a priority and so has our Bell \nAtlantic company. They have made a special project of West Virginia. \nClassrooms in 50 different places already can connect to Internet. But \nthis is not the way most of it works, Mr. President. This is a special \nset of circumstances.\n  Let us be clear. If the schools of West Virginia cannot count on \naffordable rates--and that is what this part of the bill is about--many \nof them are never going to be a part of the world that \ntelecommunications offers regardless of what they have.\n  Teachers in West Virginia cannot wait to use these computers, Mr. \nPresident, and their links to distant places. They are excited about \nit. It transforms them as it transforms us as we get into the business \nof learning computers. They want to get into libraries. They want to \nget into colleges, to courses on every topic imaginable, to art \ncollections, to whatever for their students.\n They have come before the Commerce Committee and boasted about what \nthey can do for their children in schools when they have computers.\n\n  Think of what this means for children of small schools in remote \ntowns in West Virginia or South Dakota or Alaska or South Carolina or \nMaine. Through their computers, students can take a language class that \nis being given in Texas, visit a museum's collection on Fifth Avenue in \nNew York, communicate with a computer pen pal in Asia or Russia or \nSouth America, and explore the jungles and the rivers and the plains of \ndistant places to learn about science and biology and nature. \nExtraordinary opportunities, if it will be provided for them.\n  Most classrooms in America still look the same as they did 60 years \nago when we wrote the first telecommunications act. They have chalk and \nblackboards, desks and chairs. Yet, with the tools of our modern-day \noffice, how can we possibly expect our children to become productive, \ninformed, innovative contributors to the economy out there, beyond the \nschools, when they learn with a blackboard and they do not have a \ncomputer? It will not work. If our children are to use technology \nthoughtfully and appropriately, they must have access to it in their \nformative years.\n  Our bill also has a special provision to guarantee access to the \nhealth care providers in rural communities, like rural hospitals and \nclinics, by promising them universal telecommunications services at \nrates reasonably comparable to the rates charged urban health care \nproviders, language carefully worked out.\n  Why do we single out our health care providers in rural areas? Why do \nwe do that? Because their remoteness makes it far more likely that they \ncannot afford the cost of telecommunications that are now being used to \nsave lives and help train health care professionals and provide other \ncritical services. Most of this is known as telemedicine. It is the \nwave of the future. It is what is going to hold down the cost of health \ncare.\n  My own home State of West Virginia is a pioneer, as Senator Byrd well \nknows, in the frontier of telemedicine. Our mountaineer doctor \ntelevision program that we are struggling as best as we can to make \nwork has created a network using interactive video and other \ntelecommunications services that hooks up two of our academic health \ncenters to our large teaching hospitals, two veterans hospitals--two \nveterans hospitals are involved in this--and six hospitals in rural \nareas, all hooked up and linked together through this network. Senior \nmedical professors and practitioners are guiding and training \nphysicians at hospitals hundreds of miles away.\n  Just about a week ago, a resident in one of West Virginia's rural \nhospitals was confronted with a broken neck. He had never treated this \nresident, obviously, and had never treated a broken neck before. Thanks \nto that mountaineer doctor program, called telemedicine, the chief of \nemergency medicine at West Virginia University helped that resident \nthrough the steps of stabilizing that patient and preparing a transfer \nof that patient to a more sophisticated medical facility.\n  Through this telecommunications network, West Virginia's chief of \nneurology helped a medical student and primary care doctor in a Grant \nCounty hospital determine if a Medicare patient was suffering from Lou \nGehrig's disease. This consultation by interactive video saved that \npatient a brutal [[Page S7982]] 140-mile trip, allowed him to remain \ncomfortable in his own community's rural hospital, and saved Medicare \nabout $2,500 in extra costs. Examples like this go on and on and on \njust in West Virginia.\n  I know from listening to statements made by Majority Leader Dole, by \nthe chairman of our committee, Senator Pressler, and my good friend, \nthe Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, that they are among many in \nthis body who know all too well what telemedicine means to their \nStates. Talk about being rural, you better talk about Montana, as well \nas West Virginia and Maine.\n  Again, the Snowe-Rockefeller part of this bill simply ensures that \nthese institutions can count on affordable rates to take advantage of \ntelemedicine and other unfolding communications technologies. \nAffordable telemedicine will allow patients in rural America to receive \nin their own communities the care they need. They will not have to \nsuffer the costs and the hardship of travel, and they will be able to \nreceive care at their local hospital, thus helping to preserve that \nhospital.\n  The Snowe-Rockefeller language is an economic development tool and it \nis an empowerment vehicle. It ensures that our children will become \nproductive members in a world that is growing more technological and \ncompetitive every single hour. It ensures that our citizens in rural \nAmerica will be able to stay in their communities and receive quality \nhealth care. It ensures that we will not create information haves and \nhave-nots in our country.\n  I will close, Mr. President, and I apologize to my colleagues for the \nlength of what I have said, but I wanted to lay this out. One of our \ncolleagues who is opposed to this bill and who supports the McCain \namendment, which I hope will be defeated or tabled, said on this floor \nearlier that rural hospitals and rural clinics already have access to \naffordable rates. That is absolutely without any merit or basis in \ntruth whatsoever. The lack of adequate telecommunications \ninfrastructure is a major barrier to the development of telemedicine \nand those systems in our rural communities.\n  Let not that statement get by. Rural areas have the equivalent of a \ndirt road when it comes to telecommunications. When Texas implemented \none of the very first telemedicine projects in the country, they found \nthat people still had party lines in west Texas--party lines. They had \nto install dedicated T-1 lines at very significant costs because T-1 \nlines are powerful instruments. Basic startup costs are coming down, \nbut according to all the experts in this field, transmission costs must \nbe lowered to make telemedicine economically feasible.\n  The small rural hospital in West Virginia was told that it would cost \n$4,300 a month to hook up with a major, larger hospital for \nadministrative and quality assurance support. They decided they could \nnot afford the technology, and so they did not do it. And there you \nhave it.\n  The University of Arizona, not a small rural hospital, established \nthe Arizona international telemedicine internetwork in 1993. They used \nstraight telephone lines and they used compression to transmit static \nimages. They say cost is a barrier to upgrading.\n According to them, their carrier--in this case U.S. West--has been \ninflexible in making any sort of cost concessions.\n\n  Mr. President, I have said what I want. There are many others on the \nfloor who want to speak. I was determined to try and give a broad \noverlay of what the Hollings-Pressler bill does, and I have done my \nbest to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the language that \nwas passed by the committee, which my friend, the Senator from Arizona, \nis proposing that we strike. I would like to speak to that part of the \nbill that makes advanced telecommunications more affordable to public \nschools and libraries.\n  During the consideration of the telecommunications bill last year, I \noffered legislation very similar to the language that we are \nconsidering today, to ensure that every school and classroom in the \nUnited States has access to telecommunications and information \ntechnologies. I proposed an educational telecommunications and \ntechnology fund to support elementary and secondary school access to \nthe information superhighway.\n  Regrettably, last year's telecommunications bill was not taken up by \nthe full Senate before adjournment. The provision in the bill before \nus, introduced by Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, and Kerrey of Nebraska, \nwill make advanced telecommunications connections more affordable for \nschools and libraries. Specifically, the provision allows elementary \nand secondary schools, as well as libraries, to receive \ntelecommunications services for educational purposes at an affordable \nrate.\n  Currently, schools all over the country, including those in my own \nState of Virginia, are forced to pay business rates for access to the \ninformation superhighway. That means that schools are subsidizing \nresidential customers. Without more affordable rates, schools, by the \nthousands, will not have adequate, and, in some cases, not have any \naccess to the Internet. As a result, too many American children will be \nleft by the wayside.\n  For those of our colleagues that have any doubts about the value of \nelectronic communications in the classroom, I challenge them to sit \ndown at a computer with Internet access and surf. They will be visiting \none of the most up-to-date and fastest growing libraries in the world. \nYou can chat with experts from across the globe. You can set up the \nvideo link with teachers at distant schools using a small camera \ncosting as little as $100. You can share data or results in a joint \nresearch effort spanning continents. You can take an electronic tour of \nthe White House, or visit the so-called web page of a Member of \nCongress. I have such a page, and many of our colleagues have those, \nMr. President. You can even see images of molecules or galaxies. The \npossibilities are endless.\n  In discussions with school administrators, it becomes clear that \nstudents are fascinated by the Internet. Students that might otherwise \nbe indifferent are eagerly pursuing new subjects and sharing their \nnewfound knowledge with the global community of students.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, the child with access will be at a \ndistinct advantage and better prepared for future employment. And those \nwithout access are simply going to be left behind.\n  We cannot afford to let our school systems slip behind those of our \nleading competitors when the technology is at our fingertips--the \ntechnology that was pioneered here in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to support the most cost-\neffective education we can offer our Nation's children. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Snowe-Rockefeller-Kerrey provision and oppose \nthe amendment offered by my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see my friend from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, on the floor. I will be brief, I say to my colleague. I \nknow he has been waiting for some time.\n  I just have a couple of comments to make. Our States have done a lot \nin this area. I know that, for example, some of the States in the South \nhave done things.\n  This describes that in the State of Alabama, there is pending \napproval within the next few days where the Educational Network Service \nwill offer DS-1 and 56-KBP service for any educational institution at a \ndiscount rate.\n  In Florida, there is legislation waiting signature, where the LEC's \nare required to provide advanced communication services to eligible \nfacilities, including public universities, community colleges, area \ntechnical centers, public schools, libraries, and teaching hospitals.\n  In Georgia, the Public Service Commission approved the Southern Bell \nreduced rate telephone service for schools, called the Classroom \nCommunication Service.\n  In the State of Kentucky, the State government provides high-volume \ndiscount access to schools, hospitals, libraries, and government \nagencies.\n  In Louisiana, all schools in Orleans Parish receive an additional 33-\npercent [[Page S7983]] discount, and public and parochial schools pay \nresidential rates as opposed to business rates.\n  Mississippi has two special pricing arrangements targeted toward \neducation in the classroom communications services, distance learning, \nand transport services.\n  South Carolina has somewhat the same thing.\n  Tennessee has in-classroom computer access service, distance \nlearning, video transport service, et cetera.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that nearly every State in America has \nsome kind of accommodation for this. I am appreciative of the fact that \nthe Senator from West Virginia may not share my view about the role of \nthe Federal Government versus the role of the State government, but the \nfact is that the State governments, who I think are much better attuned \nand much more cognizant of the needs of their respective States, are \ndoing these kinds of things. To my view, this is vitiating the \nrequirement for, again, another unfunded mandate, which this is.\n  Mr. President, I heard the Senator from West Virginia, who makes some \nvery emotional arguments that there are some libraries that will never \nbe able to afford a computer, or some hospitals. Who are they, Mr. \nPresident? So to cure the problem we are just going to give a blanket \nagreement to wealthy, private schools, wealthy hospitals, wealthy \nlibraries. There is no means testing. If the Senator from West Virginia \nand the Senator from Maine had, in any way, brought in some kind of \nprovision for means testing as to who needs it and who does not before \nwe proposed this unfunded mandate, I would have been much more open to \nsome compromise or agreement on it. I am sorry that virtually all \nschools, all hospitals and libraries are going to receive this.\n  Mr. President, I think we are being a little discriminating in our \nmorality here. I would like to see the Disabled American Veterans have \nthis same kind of facility. They are people who have fought and served \nand sacrificed. Do they deserve something? I do not see them included. \nWhat about the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Salvation Army? They \nare organizations I have admired enormously. They get all of their \nfunds from contributions, at least about 95 percent of them.\n  What is it that makes us discriminate with these institutions and not \nwith others? I understand that--and I was not told this directly by the \nSenator from Maine--she intends to make a motion to table this \namendment. If this amendment is tabled, then I may have an amendment \nexpanding this to other needy and deserving Americans and groups of \nAmericans that also may be as equally as deserving as private schools \nare, for example, or as wealthy hospitals are, or the Getty Library.\n  So I think that the flaw here, Mr. President, is who are we really \ntrying to help, and who are we not? It seems to me that there are many \nwho are deserving of our help who are not included in here, and there \nare many who are not who are included. I would like to see us be much \nmore discriminating.\n  I believe the whole thrust of the American people is that they \nbelieve local government is best. I would like to see the States be \nable to continue what they are doing and tailor what is best for their \nrespective communities and localities and counties and cities and \ntowns, rather than the Congress acting in a far more sweeping and all-\nencompassing fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in strong support for the provision authored by my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller. I oppose the attempt to remove it from the bill.\n  It has long been an axiom in the development of America that rural \nAmerica be provided basic telephone services, under the concept of \nuniversal service. Universal service is, again, a central part of the \nbill before us. Mr. Rockefeller's amendment, together with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, attempts to ensure that \nour schools, our libraries, our health care facilities have access to \nthe best that is available across our country for the well being of our \nchildren, our elderly, our rural dwellers at affordable rates. This \namendment allows a child in Beckley, WV, to access the Library of \nCongress to enhance his education, allows the provision of medicine \nfrom the best facilities in America to be available to health care \nproviders in communities which cannot afford to have all facilities \navailable at their fingertips. It is a mechanism to enhance standards \nthroughout the country. It is a force enhancer, a multiplier, an \nadvanced bootstrap for rural America at reasonable cost.\n  I have, for the last several years, supported funding for medical \ndoctor's television, so that experts in universities can conference \nwith doctors in rural remote areas so that they have the best that \nmedicine has to offer in the State. The Rockefeller provision extends \nthis concept for all citizens to have access to the best that is \navailable across the country. This is the fruit of the technological \nand telecommunication revolution that is meaningful, that makes sense, \nand will build human capabilities and infrastructure in our land.\n  I commend my colleague for this provision. It is a builder of \ncommunities throughout our land, a benefit that our technological \nprogress gives us as a society. I support the provision, and urge my \ncolleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I just want to address a couple of points \nthat have been raised by Senator McCain because I think it is important \nto address his comments with respect to what would be provided, and to \nwhom, under the manager's amendment that was incorporated in the \nlegislation which Senator McCain seeks to strike.\n  I cannot think what would be more in the public's interest than \nschools, libraries, and hospitals. As I said earlier, in the last \nCongress, the Committee, on a nearly unanimous vote, sought to provide \nuniversal service to zoos, aquariums, and museums. We do not include \nthose entities under this language because we think we should strictly \nlimit it to very essential institutions, schools, libraries, and rural \nhospitals.\n  Universal service happens to be a national priority. That is what \nthis issue is all about. Senator McCain said leave it to the States. \nStates are involved, in the sense that there is a joint board in this \nlegislation that will help determine the rates for the communities \nunder the universal service provision.\n  But this happens to be a national priority, a national issue, and it \nis too important just to leave it to the States on an ad hoc basis and \nsay whatever happens, happens. The States are certainly doing their \nbest. They understand the importance of this issue, and have been very \ninnovative and progressive. But they cannot do it alone. Presently, \nthere is a disparity between the States.\n  We all recognize how important the information age is to the future \nof this country and to individuals and to families. It is so important, \nand therefore I think it requires a national policy and should be \nestablished as a national priority. Certainly, universal service can be \nsupplemented by the States. The fact is, they cannot do it alone.\n  This is a major telecommunications policy. If that was not the case, \nwe would not be here discussing today the amendment before the Senate.\n  But it is an important telecommunications policy. It is essential \nthat we establish some parameters to universal service. There may be a \nday when it will not be required. But right now, we need a transition \nwith respect to telecommunications. That is why the universal service \nlanguage becomes an imperative.\n  We have to recognize the changes that have evolved and will continue \nto evolve over time. We have to anticipate the needs of America. I \ncannot think of entities with a greater need to affordable \ntelecommunications services than schools, libraries, and rural \nhospitals. I never would have expected anybody to have questioned that.\n  The language in the bill extends the idea, included in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, of universal service. That is all we are \nsaying, with the language in the bill, sponsored by myself and Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Kerrey and Senator Exon and adopted by \ncommittee. The language simply extends universal service to schools, \nlibraries, and rural hospitals.\n  Under the language, essential telecommunication providers will get \nreimbursements. They can recoup the [[Page S7984]] discounts given to \nthese public entities from the universal service fund.\n  In the case of schools and libraries, the discount is an amount \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to telecommunications services \nfor educational purposes. This is a modification we made in the \nmanagers' amendment that was offered last night.\n  By changing the basis for the discount from incremental cost to an \namount necessary to ensure an affordable rate, the Federal-State joint \nboard in conjunction with the FCC and the States have some flexibility \nto target discounts based on a community's ability to pay.\n  The discounts will not be indiscriminate, as the Senator from Arizona \nsuggested in his previous remarks. There will be some parameters, \nbecause we do not have an unlimited fund.\n  There have been a number of letters from supporters of the language \nin the bill that various Senators have received. I would like to quote \nfrom a couple of them. I think it gives everyone an idea of the \nimportance of this issue. One letter that I will quote from is from an \neducation technology specialist.\n  She writes to one Senator, and I received a copy of this letter:\n\n       Two key issues for rural States like ours are affordable \n     and equitable access. Cost is the barrier cited. A recent \n     survey shows only 3 percent of the Nation's classrooms have \n     access to Internet or use information services for \n     instructional services. Preferential rates for school and \n     libraries at cost would be a step toward eliminating this \n     barrier. As a Nation and as a State, we must recognize the \n     need for improvement in our educational system and seize the \n     opportunities offered by technology and telecommunications. \n     The dream of access, equity, and excellence for all Americans \n     for life means acting now to ensure these essential elements \n     for better education, bound in decisions currently under \n     consideration. We urge you to make certain the voices of K \n     through 12 educators are heard and their needs addressed in \n     the drafting and passage of this legislation.\n\n  In another letter:\n\n       I hope that Members of Congress will stop and consider the \n     impact that schools and libraries had upon their lives. Then, \n     if they will project what these entities can provide when \n     they are equipped with appropriate connectivity, we can begin \n     to understand the quality of true education our young people \n     will possess that will equip them for bright futures. With \n     your help, thousands of young lives will be able to \n     experience the rush that comes with free exploration of \n     knowledge sources.\n\n  And then we received a list of different associations that are \nsupporting this legislation, again, I think, expressing the thought \nthat this legislation and this provision is so important to the future \nof this country. The organizations are part of a coalition supporting \naffordable telecommunications access for our Nation's schools and \nlibraries, and there are a number of different associations. I am not \ngoing to read them all, but I ask unanimous consent to have them \nprinted in the Record, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Support Affordable Telecommunications Access for our Nation's Schools \n                             and Libraries\n\n       Supported by a coalition including:\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of School Administrators.\n       American Association of School Librarians, a division of \n     the American Library Association.\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Federation of Teachers.\n       American Library Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       Association for Advancement of Computing in Education.\n       Association for Educational Communications and Technology.\n       Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.\n       Center for Media Education.\n       Coalition of Adult Education Organizations.\n       Consortium for School Networking.\n       Council for American Private Education.\n       Council for Educational Development and Research.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       Council of the Great City Schools.\n       Council of Urban Boards of Education.\n       Educational Testing Service.\n       Instructional Telecommunications Council.\n       International Society for Technology in Education.\n       International Telecomputing Consortium.\n       National Association for Family and Community Education.\n       National Association of Elementary School Principals.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of State Boards of Education.\n       National Education Association.\n       National School Boards Association.\n       Organizations Concerned about Rural Education.\n       Public Broadcasting Service.\n       Software Publishers Association.\n       The Global Village Schools Institute.\n       The National PTA.\n       Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Ecucation.\n       United States Distance Learning Association.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. For example, the American Association of Community \nColleges, the American Association of School Administrators, American \nAssociation of School Librarians, American Council on Education, \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, American Library Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the Council of Urban Boards of \nEducation, the Educational Testing Service, the National Association \nfor Family and Community Education, National Association of Elementary \nSchool Principals, the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, the National Association of State Boards of Education, the \nNational Education Association, the National School Boards Association, \nthe National PTA, the United States Distance Learning Association.\n  That gives you an idea of the cross-section of organizations and \nassociations across America that support this language. Even I was \nsurprised at the extent to which the language that we incorporated in \nthis legislation received such strong and widespread support.\n  The FCC Chair, Reed Hundt, recently stated:\n\n       There are thousands of buildings in this country with \n     millions of people in them who have no telephones, no cable \n     television, and no reasonable prospect of broadband services. \n     They are called schools.\n\n  This all goes to show how important this issue is. I hope that \nMembers of this Senate will oppose the McCain amendment and will \ncontinue to support the provision that is incorporated in the managers' \namendment and in the underlying legislation that was supported by \nmembers of the Commerce Committee--not a unanimous vote but a broad \nvote--because this is so important to the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the McCain amendment. Mr. President, I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wanted to suggest the absence of a \nquorum. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska who cosponsored the \namendment has not had a chance to be heard.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You cannot reserve the right to object to \ncalling off the quorum.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I withdraw my request.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \ntabling motion and to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. \nSenators are doing different things. We are trying to give a little \nadvanced notice when these votes will occur. I am not trying to cut \nanybody off or anything of that sort. I am wondering if we could vote--\nI ask the Senator from Nebraska when he would suggest we have a vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that. What I would propose is that I make my \nstatement. We have been led to believe there are a couple of other \npeople who would like to speak, but if they do not make it down to the \nfloor by that [[Page S7985]] time, we might be able to set a time \nrelatively quickly after I get done talking. I just do not know whether \nthere will be other Members actually getting down, having said they are \ncoming.\n  Senator McCain asked earlier. I said it could be 6 or it could be 8. \nI think we pretty well heard most of the arguments on this particular \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Maine to vitiate the yeas and nays and withdraw her motion \nto table?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an agreement \nto vote at 5:15. Or would that be objected to?\n  Mr. KERREY. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I say to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nebraska seek the floor?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. You run a tight ship, Mr. President.\n  I say to the Senator from South Dakota, I am not trying to \nunreasonably object. I am uncertain as to how much longer is a \nreasonable time.\n  I myself would be surprised if I am going to talk for 30 minutes, and \nif no one comes down here at that particular time, between now and the \ntime that I stop I think we can put a time on this pretty quickly.\n  Mr. President, again I hope colleagues understand that this bill is \nbeing asked for largely by American companies and corporations that \nwould like to do things, lines of business they currently cannot do. I \nhave heard colleagues after I have said that say, no, we have lots of \npeople in our State who really understand and would like to have this.\n  That may be the case indeed. On this particular section there are \nquite a few people who understand the potential and positive impacts. \nIndeed, I would argue that--perhaps somebody has a countervailing \nargument--but I would argue, of all the sections, this section has more \nAmericans excited about what might happen if this proposal were to \nbecome law. There has been more straight grassroots citizen support for \nthis section of the bill than any other section of the bill.\n  We have heard from companies, we have heard from a whole range of \npeople. The Senator from Arizona raises some valid and interesting \npoints. I do not dispute all the points he raised.\n  But one of the points that is raised, dealing with K-12 education, \nwhere we have the largest amount of support, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine earlier read off a list of organizations that are in \nsupport. I will not go through all these again: American Association of \nSchool Administrators, the American Federation of Teachers, the \nNational Education Association, school boards, and other people who \nunderstand that, if you leave the status quo in place, these schools \nare going to get further and further behind. That really is a given. It \nis not going to go away.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Arizona comes and says there is \nlots of progress being made out there, it is true there is progress \nbeing made. But colleagues should not be taken in by that argument \nbecause this law takes away the incentives that schools have used to \nget State public service commissions to negotiate for them. That is \nwhat has been going on.\n  What has been going on in Georgia and other States is that they have \nnegotiated and given the regional Bell operating company the right to \nprice differently in exchange for connecting the schools. They did not \ndo it for eleemosynary reasons or as a consequence of saying we can \ngive away a little of our cash flow.\n They did it to get something in return.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation goes into every State public service \ncommission, and says you shall allow price cap regulation. There is no \nmore incentive for an RBOC to negotiate the sort of things we have seen \nhappen in State after State after State.\n  So understand that the reason that section 310 is needed in this \nlegislation--and it is contained significantly, I point out to \ncolleagues, in the title III portion that calls for the end to \nregulation--is because in other sections of the bill, we take away the \nvery incentives that have been used to get the progress that we have \nbeen seeing in other States.\n  So do not come to the mistaken conclusion that if this title is \nstricken you are going to continue to see the kinds of progress that we \nhave seen in States. You will not see it. It will stop.\n  I would like to make a point and talk a little about why we need \nthis. Again, I understand there are lots of other areas of concern--\nlibraries, hospitals, and so forth. My No. 1, 2, and 3 concern is the \neducational environment. The question is why is it important? Is there \na sense of urgency attached? Is there any reason for us to be excited \nabout this? Is there any reason to believe that the promise of this \ntechnology will be different than the promise that lots of us heard 40 \nyears ago when people were saying we are going to put this television \nset in your home. They bring a television set into your room, into your \nhome. Television was going to be a great learning technology. We are \ngoing to learn more. That was the idea. In some cases, with children's \neducational television, we have seen some improvement in test scores. \nBut for many of us adults, we hold I think the correct conclusion that \ntelevision has produced a distraction, larger and larger volumes of \ntime being consumed with young people watching television, not doing \nhomework, not doing the work required in school, and as a consequence, \npeople say maybe this technology is just another one of those items, \njust another promise to do something, another easy solution to the \ndifficult work of education.\n  Mr. President, this technology is different. Computer technology is \nmuch different than we have seen in other educational applications, in \nother technology applications. We can cite research. You can use \nanecdotes. You can talk about any measurement you want out in your \nlocal community. But computer technology, particularly when it is \nnetwork and particularly when there is access to a database outside of \nthe school, particularly when the network concludes a connection \nbetween the home and the school itself, there are advances in \nmathematics, impressively so. There are advances in reading, almost \ncounterintuitive for those of us who have seen this technology. How can \nyou possibly learn to read and write better? But there are improvements \nin test scores in both areas when the technology is available to young \npeople.\n  The fact of the matter is this technology does offer substantial hope \nto do something for public education that a lot of us have begun to \nbelieve--we are wondering whether anything is going to work. We are \nwondering whether anything is in fact going to do something to turn \naround what we see as decline in test scores in many significant areas.\n  I note that the National Assessment of Educational Performance not \nlong ago said that high school seniors, a full third, cannot read at \nthe basic level; that approximately a third can read at the proficiency \nlevel or above, down 10 percent from 2 years ago. You cannot graduate \nfrom high school anymore--and half of our young people will graduate \nand go right into the work force and are not able to read and write, \nand do multistep mathematics, to be able to think in creative, in \ncomplex ways, and expect to earn very much in the workplace. It may \nhave been true when most of us went to high school and graduated that \nyou could do that, but not anymore. Today you have to know more. You \nuse that computer in the workplace, and you have to know a lot more \nbesides the sorts of things that were required when I got out of high \nschool in 1961.\n  Mr. President, there is an urgency attached to this section. That is \nwhat I am trying to describe to my colleagues. Not only is there a \ndemand for it. Not only in this case do we have people in the community \nsaying: Senator Kerrey, this is one where I know it is going to help. I \nam not certain about all the rest, and I am a little bit nervous about \nwhat is going to rate telephone or cable. I do not know about all this \npromise about new jobs. I have some stats I am going to talk about \nlater when I talk about this promise of employment. An awful lot of \npeople [[Page S7986]] were turned out onto the bricks as a consequence \nof technology. They get a little nervous when I tell them there are \ngoing to be a lot of jobs. They do not know about all of that. They say \nto me, I know because I have seen computer technology work in my home. \nI have seen it work in the school. I know it can work. We are trying to \nnetwork it inside our school buildings. We are trying to make progress \nthere.\n  What are we up against? We are up against a number of things. The \npeople are saying to me and with schools that I have worked, that the \nprinciple among those things is that if you want to fund it, you have \nto fund it out of property or sales and income taxes.\n  I am going to get to a subject that will probably put my colleagues \nto sleep because I talk about it perhaps too much; that is, how we fund \nnot just education, but how we fund other things that we try, other \nservices that we try to provide to our people. In the State of \nNebraska, we have about 275,000 people in the K through 12 environment. \nWe have 275,000 people over the age of 65. We spend $1.3 billion on \nthat K through 12 environment, and $4.5 billion on people over 65. Now, \nthe source of revenue for retirement and health care is payroll taxes. \nIt is relatively easy to get that from people in the work force; \napparently about 16 percent of total wages. The source of revenue for \nthe schools is property, sales, and income tax.\n  The incremental cost expenditures from the schools will be $50 \nmillion against the $1.3 billion base. On that retirement and health \ncare data, the differential is going to be close to $500 million. The \nreason the cost increase is so low is that the people at the local \nlevel are saying: We are fed up with property tax increases, and we are \nnot very excited about sales and income tax increases, either. And our \nschools get squeezed.\n  I had a rather unpleasant encounter with an educational organization \nthat said this is not going to be a big deal because it is only going \nto address the cost to the schools, about 16 percent, and phone \nactivity is not a problem, and affordable dial tone is not a problem. \nIt is a problem. It is true that States have been able to negotiate \nwith the public service commissions. But that only affects interLATA \ncosts. It does not affect long distance calls, and it does not let \nthese kids get on line and access databases in long distance education. \nIt does not provide the kind of high-speed activity these schools need.\n  We are not asking for a bailout. Schools are still going to have to \nput a ton of money in software, a ton of money in hardware. They are \ngoing to still have to make a good-faith effort and contribution in \norder to make this work. This is not a subsidy that is unreasonable. It \nis a subsidy that is not only quite reasonable but it is a savings. If \nwe do not provide it, we are going to lose a tremendous opportunity to \nbring education technology to our children and give them, I think, a \nlearning tool that can enable them to increase math, increase reading, \nincrease verbal scores. I have seen it work. I have looked, as I said, \nat research data. I have seen anecdotal evidence, as well. It in fact \ngets the job done.\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments again that we hear a lot, or at \nleast I have heard a lot--I am not sure how much it applies to this \nparticular amendment; perhaps it does, perhaps it does not; I believe \nit does--is that we are giving special attention to a particular group \nof people, and that they do not deserve the special attention. I am not \nreally talking about the comments of the Senator from Arizona. I heard \ncomments made by others. Why would we want to single out one particular \ngroup? We have 100,000 school buildings in the public school system, \n16,000 school districts out there, 45 million students, government-run \noperations, pure and simple, and we have to figure out some way to help \nthem out.\n  But what very often is annoying to me is the argument--and I have \nheard it from the business sector, mostly; it is made by businesses who \nhave been given special protection, who have been given a monopoly \nfranchise, and now are complaining when we give somebody else special \nattention. It is not like the RBOC. It is not a mom-and-pop started in \nCharleston, SC. This is a regulated monopoly. It is not like they \nstarted from scratch or something. It is with tremendous cash flow, and \ntremendous resources.\n  I am prepared to let them compete. I am prepared to provide \nderegulation to them so they can get out there and go head to head. I \nthink there will be benefits from it.\n  But please spare me when it comes to trying to help 45 million school \nchildren with this argument that I am giving them special attention. \nFor god's sake. You would not even exist were it not for a franchise \ngranted to you by the people of the United States of America. At least, \nthat is how I see it. I would be very interested to hear, and I asked \nearlier if the Senator from South Carolina would be willing to give his \nown description of that.\n  It seems to me that when a regional Bell operating company--I have \ngood friends, at least I used to have good friends in that particular \nsector--when they come and say why would you want to provide special \nattention to these schools like this, it seems to me that I am \ndeserving of saying to them, well, did we not give you a special \nfranchise? Did we not give you a special right to do business in a \nmonopoly way? And did we not keep all the internet competition away so \nthat you could do all this stuff over the years?\n  Am I missing something, I ask my friend from South Carolina?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I think he is \nright on target with respect to the regional Bell operating companies. \nThey are not just a guaranteed monopoly but a guaranteed return on \ninvestment.\n  But they used to have a percentage return of profit, and they did not \nlike that because they found, quite to the point, if they could get \nwhat they said, pay caps, the actual size and operation growing, \nminimizing, of course, the general cost of operation, and superimpose \non that downsizing, which is firing, to me, the employees--and \neverybody thinks this is a wonderful thing, that everybody is \ndownsizing, but that is what they are doing, and so they are increasing \ntheir return on investment but more particularly what they call the \noperating cash flow margin. That is the principal measure of the \nfinancial worth of a company by Wall Street and the financial \ncommunity.\n  Specifically, I say to the Senator, I have a chart--I swore I was not \ngoing to use charts, but I am going to have to get this one blown up \nfor the Senator because I have the operating cash flow margin by \nindustries from computers to chemicals, household products, autos, \ntrucks, alcoholic beverages, long-distance companies, the soft drink \nindustry, semiconductors, railroads, drug industry, electric utilities, \npetroleum-producing corporations, and, of course, the regional Bell \noperating companies.\n  This is a small sort of chart. We will have it enlarged. But you can \nsee right at the bottom edge, in the lowest so-called operating cash \nflow margin of 10.3 percent is computers. Come right on up midway, 19 \npercent for the long-distance companies, and for the regional Bell \noperating companies it is 46 percent. It is above all the others.\n  If you want to get to the actual return, you would find in Standard & \nPoor's in a composite of the top 1,000 corporations in America, their \naverage would be 10.4 percent, but the regional Bell operating \ncompanies is 16.6 percent.\n  Now, if you want to go then up to their cash flow margin, as they \ncall it, that would be 46 percent rather than the average of 34.1. If \nyou go up to the actual operating income margin, it is 26 percent with \nthe U.S. average of 10 percent.\n  But they tell me in the financial community, if the Senator will give \nme just a second more, it is not only the 46 percent, but we had it in \nthose hearings that the RBOC's had a cash flow of about $5.5 billion. \nThey paid some $600 million in taxes, Mr. President. I think the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer was there when this was brought out. Of \nthe $5.5 billion in cash flow, $600 million was in taxes, $1.6 billion \nwas paid to keep Wall Street happy--that was the dividends--which left \nthem $1.7 billion to invest.\n  Excuse me. That $1.7 billion they reinvested in upgrading the \nequipment and optic fibers and everything else of that kind. It left \nthem $1.6 billion in their back pocket so they could walk \n[[Page S7987]] into any bank: I have $1.6 billion in my back pocket, \nand I would like to make a loan.\n  Well, heavens above, what financial power. And they wanted to know a \nlittle while ago why we had to have the public interest test included \nin this thing. With that $1.6 billion in their back pocket, they are \nalready into New Zealand. They are putting in communication links \nbetween Moscow and Tokyo. That is these telecommunications companies. \nThey are in Hungary.\n  I landed last year, I say to the Senator, in Buenos Aires, and the \nAmbassador came out and met me in the car. As we were driving into \ntown--this is Ambassador Cheek, an Arkansas native--he turned to me, \nand he said: Well, our section is doing good.\n  I said, how is that?\n  He said Bell South here operates--I think they have about 14 to 16 \nmillion in Buenos Aires, and Bell South runs the local telephone, and \nthey are getting a tremendous return on their investment. I know they \nare into Mexico and everything else.\n  I commend them. I do not know of a better operating company in my own \nsort of hometown, Bell South and Southern Bell. But they should not \ncome here--and I do not think, frankly, these companies are coming.\n  I find it, I say to the Senator, as a result more or less of pollster \npolitics. You go to run for Congress and the Senate, and the first \nthing you do is you get a poll and the poll gets you five to seven hot-\nbutton items. Crime, everybody is against crime. Taxes, everybody is \nagainst taxes. Jobs, everybody is for jobs. It is a jambalaya of the \nsame nonsense, where you have the contract.\n  One thing, this communications bill, you know what, is not in the \ncontract. And you know why? Because this communications bill is going \nto do something. You can take that 10-point contract, it is all \nprocess. It is all procedure. It is all pap. It is all line-item veto, \nterm limits, paper shuffling or whatever--unfunded mandates, balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. It is all process, making sure you do \nnot do anything but what the pollster tells you to hit and identify. Do \nnot ever be for or against. Identify with the problems but do nothing \nabout them.\n  Here we are trying to do something about them and you know what they \ncome up with? They take the very responsibility they have fundamentally \nfor education, for the schools, for the libraries, for the nonprofit \nhealth care, community health service, rural health centers and \neverything else and talk against them, using expressions like \n``micromanagement, meddling, bureaucracy'' and everything else, like \nsomehow something was wrong with that.\n  I thought that is what we were here for. If we are not here for the \ncommunity health centers, who is? If we are not here for the schools, \nwhere are they going--all private schools with vouchers and people with \nmoney running around butting into each other? We are going the way of \nEngland. We are getting two levels of society now. Those with jobs are \nmaking 20 percent less today than what they were making 20 years ago.\n  And the census figures, I say to the Senator--I will yield right \nnow--will show that in the age group 17 to 24, 73 percent of that age \ngroup cannot find a job or they cannot find a job outside of poverty. \nAnd here the people's representatives are coming here and talking \nagainst the people's institutions because the pollsters tell them to do \nthat. It is a sort of an ideological bent: Get rid of the REA, a \nmagnificent entity; get rid of public communications that is doing some \ngood. And they tell you, yes, you know, public broadcasting--sure, it \ncan make a profit. We can sell those VHF channels like gangbusters, and \nthey can put on some more of the giggle shows or whatever you call \nthem. You turn them on and there is some little wise kid about this \nhigh and the grownups tottering around, the wise kid makes the smart \nremark and everybody goes ``hee-hee-hee'' and that is all you get \nunless you have public television.\n  So I think that the distinguished Senator is getting right to one of \nthe most valuable discourses I have seen because you have seen the \nrural Senators come with the metropolitan areas saying since we have \nthe satellite and you can beam down into the rural area as well as down \ninto the urbanized megacity you do not need these things--you do not \nneed schools; you do not need hospitals; you do not need libraries \nanymore. And if you do, let the market forces operate them.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that. In fact, I am sure people will be \ninterested--and I believe there is a lot of promise of jobs, by the \nway, in changing our regulation and going more to competition.\n  But do not count on the jobs coming from the companies that are \ntypically coming up here on Capitol Hill urging us to do one thing or \nanother. I have some interesting facts in that regard.\n  Regional Bell operating companies in 1984 in the United States of \nAmerica employed 556,561 people. In 1993, that was down to 395,639. \nThey dropped over 160,000 employees in that period--160,000 employees \nin approximately 10 years. The LEC's/Independents went from 180,000 \ndown to 140,000. So now you are down 200,000 employees over that period \nof time.\n  The cellular industries everybody talks about really added a whole \nbunch of employees. They have added 40,000. So now you are back to a \nnet loss of 160,000. So you hear from the RBOC's, LEC's and you hear \nfrom cellulars. They are talking about jobs saved. I am down 160,000 \nthus far. Are you going to keep going in that direction and give me \nmore of the same?\n  The broadcast industry has gone from 170,000 down to 150,000, so \nanother 20,000. Now I am up to 180,000 jobs. I bet you an awful lot of \nthose people did not get jobs that paid the same as they previously \nhad.\n  In cable television, you see increased employment in cable \ntelevision, 67,000 or so up to about 109,000. So you are still about \n150,000 jobs or so down.\n  We have the computer industry that we talk about an awful lot, a \nsurprising number. I heard--I cannot remember who it was--a colleague \ncome down and talked about we ought to do it like the computer industry \nhas done. For your information, the computer industry in 1985 employed \n542,000 Americans. Guess how many employees in 1993? 400,000 employees, \ndown 150,000. When you are at home in your hometown meetings and they \nsay to you, ``Senator, what is this telecommunications deregulation \nbill going to do for me?'' and you say, ``Jobs,'' you better be \nprepared to say where those jobs are going to come from. You better be \nprepared to answer that person who says, ``Thus far, technology has not \nbeen all that kind. I used to make $40,000 a year and now I am down to \n$15,000. How is that working for me?''\n  I hope that this particular attempt to strike this section will be \nrejected.\n  As I said earlier, the reasons I would cite are the following: One, \nit is about the only hope we have, I believe, of improving the quality \nof education both in the home and in the school. It is working. It is \nworking out there.\n  Secondly, if you believe that the progress that is being made out \nthere in the States right now is exciting, understand that the language \nin other sections of the bill takes away the incentives the RBOC's have \nhad to do those things. It truly does. There is no disputing that. In \nevery single State--every single State--where this kind of effort has \nbeen made, it has been made in exchange for regulatory relief, \nparticularly going from rate-based rate of return to price caps. The \npremier example is in the State of Georgia, but it is not alone.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this well-meaning attempt to strike this \nsection should be tabled because this is one of the few pieces of this \nlegislation where, indeed, we are hearing from our citizens, where, \nindeed, we are hearing from mothers and dads and the PTA, the PTO that \nare coming to us and saying, ``This one is going to work. We're trying \nto figure out how to make computers work in our school. We are up \nagainst the property tax lid, we are up against sales and income. We \nare trying to figure out how to do it, and this is going to give us a \nlittle help.''\n  Do not believe it is a giveaway. These schools are going to make a \nmaintenance effort on top of that. They have to. They have to spend a \nlot of money on software and hardware. This is just a little bit of \nhelp asked for by the companies that, indeed, can afford to do it given \nwhat this legislation allows [[Page S7988]] them to do, given what this \nlegislation provides for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one note on commending our distinguished \ncolleagues. The Senator from Maine, the Senator from West Virginia, and \nthe Senator from Nebraska have joined together on this amendment and \ngiven leadership.\n  It should be noted that when we started, easily 4 years ago, the then \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, Al Gore, was the one who \nparaphrased the ``information superhighway.'' Part and parcel of his \ndrive for the information superhighway was just this: education, \nhospitals, libraries, public entities and public interest groups that \nwe had even expanded in the original treatment some 4 years ago in our \nCommittee of Commerce. Vice President Al Gore has to be credited with \nthis part of the information superhighway.\n  We had at our hearings this year the Secretary of Education, \nSecretary Riley, come forward and testify on this particular score \noutlining the various uses and needs of this particular consideration \nby the public to go ahead and take entities that are on a nonprofit \nbasis--public schools are not for profit, not-for-profit hospitals, \nlibraries and otherwise--and give them consideration, which is just \nlike the universal service fund, to get the communications facilities \nout into the rural or sparsely settled areas.\n  So I commend Senator Snowe, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Kerrey, \nbut I particularly wanted the record to show that the Vice President of \nthe United States has been the leader on this information superhighway, \nand particularly the educational, health and library facilities to be \nafforded these particular services at a reduced rate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment. I want to commend the previous speakers who have emphasized \nvery eloquently what this will do for the critical areas, especially of \neducation. I am, as my colleagues know, the chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Education. I have just completed a number of trips \naround this country visiting the schools in the urban areas of this \nNation, from Baltimore to New York to Detroit to Washington, DC, as \nwell as Los Angeles and San Diego. I have also examined the statistics \nof where our schools are at this particular point in our history when \nit is so essential and so important that we improve our educational \nsystem to be competitive in the world that awaits us out there and the \nmarkets that are necessary for this Nation to expand its economy.\n  The number one problem we see is the ability of our schools to be \nable to take advantage of the wonders that can come about through the \ninformation age. As I talk with them and travel with them, there is no \nquestion but that one of the most critical and important barriers they \nhave to being able to participate in a meaningful way by the \nutilization of computer technology to provide the education through the \nsoftware that would be made available and the opportunities that come \nthrough that is the inability to have affordable telephone \ncommunications. Without that, there is no hope that they will be able \nto make the kind of leap that we have asked them to make, for, as you \nknow, we have passed Goals 2000, strongly indicating that we must by \nthat time improve substantially the education of our young people.\n  I have been through my charts. I have gone through them many times, \nand I will many more times, to try to let everybody know the serious \nproblems we are having.\n  First, I pointed out over and over again, when you compare our young \npeople in the younger groups with competitor nations across this world, \nthose nations which we would be competing with and gradually losing our \ncompetitive edge, we are last--last--in math and science among 14 of \nthose nations.\n  Most probably, the most devastating statistic that we have facing us \nis the knowledge that 55 percent of our young people now that go \nthrough the school system come out functionally illiterate, because if \nyou are not going to college, we do not worry about you. They are going \nto be the skilled work force of tomorrow in America. But if we do not \nfurnish them the tools in schools and are not able to provide the kind \nof software that is out there and the ability to bring them up to speed \non skills and on education, math, reading and all, we will not make it.\n  This is the best and biggest step forward we can make, by ensuring \nthat there will be access to telephone lines.\n  Let me give you an example of how bad off it is. About 3 percent of \nour schools in this Nation right now have access to internet or outside \ncommunications for the utilization of the information age. When I go \naround to cities, I say, ``I want to see your best and your worst.'' I \nhave seen the best, and I have seen what they can do with the \ninformation age. I have seen so many young people sitting there with \neyes lit up and looking at fantastic software and learning well above \nthe capacity that we have ever had before.\n  Do you know how many of those schools there are in this Nation? Maybe \n1 percent. Then I said, ``I want to go to the worst that you have.'' I \nremember very vividly in the city of New York going down to a school on \nthe lower east side. We went in there, and I think it was an old \nfactory building. There were six floors that you have to walk up and \ndown. I said, ``Let me see what you have to offer your young people.'' \nShe showed me four computers. I said, ``How old are these?'' She said, \n``I think they were from the 1970's.'' I asked, ``What kind of software \ndo you have?'' She said, ``Let me show you.'' It was something I had \nseen back in the mid-1970's. But she said, ``I am excited. We just got \na grant for $250 to upgrade our software.''\n  Well, anybody that knows anything about computers and software knows \nwhat you are going to get for $250 is not going to do much for anybody. \nI saw similar things in Los Angeles and San Diego. I saw the best and \nthe worst.\n  This one provision in the bill will do as much as we can do for \neducation as anything else--the dimensions of what it will cost in \nthese schools to be able to bring the communications in without this \nkind of help is devastating. For instance, there is $300 million in \nbacklog of repairs and renovations needed in the city of Washington in \norder to upgrade structure to do the things that are needed to be done. \nIt is $100 billion nationwide. But if you can afford to get the phone \nlines in and give them a reasonable rate, then we have an opportunity \nto take advantage of that tremendous software that is out there. I have \nseen systems which are imaginative and wonderful. But it will not work \nunless there is access to it. The only way we can start making that \naccess--and we need to worry about the ability to have power to run \nthese and other things that go along with it. But if do you not have \nthe phone access, you will not get there.\n  So I urge very strongly, if you believe as I do that education is so \ncritical and important to the future of this Nation, the one best thing \nyou can do right now is to vote against the McCain amendment and make \nsure the provisions are in here to assist our country, to be able to \nelevate our educational system on a fast track instead of the slow, \nslow snailpace process we are undergoing now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain amendment. \nI guess when I first came to the Senate and I took a look at my State--\nlong distances, sparsely populated--nobody has made more speeches on \neducation, telemedicine, and all of those good things that can happen \nthrough wide-band, broadband telecommunications.\n  Once we start down the road of preferential treatment, there is no \nend to it, and that technology will not be deployed at any price. That \nis the reason that we are doing this piece of legislation, to give some \npeople incentive to deploy new technologies. If there is a way that we \ncan serve education and telemedicine in rural areas, it will be done. \nIt is being done in my State. For [[Page S7989]] the first time, we \nhave school boards that are setting aside money now for equipment and \nsoftware and, yes, charges in order to accommodate it, to give some \npeople incentive to deploy it.\n  What this does as a result is create a whole new class of \npreferential telecommunications service entitlements for a diversity of \ngroups. I have no disagreement with my colleague with regard to the \ncontribution which advanced telecommunications can make to society, \nespecially in rural America. My home State of Montana is one of those \nrural areas in the country. I have worked very hard to make sure that \nwe have this new technology. But we have to find ways to be \nentrepreneurial and allow some competition into it to make it work. You \nknow what? It works in an area where telephone companies and those \ncompanies that work outside of the regulatory environment--country \ntelephones, REA's, people who have an interest in community that makes \nit available to their schools because they know what the investment is \nin that school and what it is worth to that community.\n  They can do that because they do not have to go to a PUC and explain \nwhy they are doing it for a school or why they are doing it for a rural \nhospital. The RBOC's are inside that regulatory, and what we are trying \nto do is relieve ourselves of them so they can do some special things. \nThis new technology is not going to go out there, and we are not going \nto tell Government to force it out there. It is not going to make it \nfriendlier or cheaper for preferential users.\n  When the heavy hand of Government reaches out to mandate that \nbusiness prevent preferential rates to certain groups, business is not \ngoing to be the one who pays. You know who will pay for it? Consumers \npay for it. That is what we have lost here a little bit --that the \npaying public of every telephone will pay for this preferential \ntreatment. You can almost call that double taxation, because they are \nalso paying school taxes and also probably to some of the hospitals for \nsome of the work they are doing there. We just tend to forget. Make no \nmistake about it, businesses will pass along such costs to consumers \nthrough higher rates--the same consumers that will be looking for lower \ncosts and more services once this legislation passes.\n  So philosophically, section 310 takes a mandated approach that moves \nexactly in the opposite direction from the entire legislation, and it \nis an approach that is really tough to support. It defies logic on \npreferential treatment. You just cannot simply ignore the future impact \nthis will have on the consumers in Montana, and they will come at a \nhigher cost--a higher cost--if this legislation passes with this \nsection intact.\n  Whenever there are a lot of people who want to get into that \nuniversal service and they want to use it for themselves, keeping in \nmind that the integrity of universal service is in question now because \nof preferential treatment, the Senator from Nebraska is 90 percent \nright. He understands what it did for Nebraska. I understand what it is \ndoing in Montana. But it takes dollars in order to get that technology \nout there. If the Federal Government wants to step up to the plate and \nget some money out there, that is fine and dandy. I would support some \nof that for infrastructure inside the schools.\n  But we are going in exactly the wrong direction. It is a great \nthought. It has probably broad support because you always find more \npeople who want something for nothing than you do people who want \nnothing for something. And that is just exactly the wrong direction. \nThe marketplace is already moving in the right direction. It does not \nneed this legislation in some areas\n to provide more service and more technology. But that progress could \nbe stymied through mandates from this Government and--probably the Wall \nStreet Journal was right this morning--placing more mandates. Every \ntime we have a mandate, somebody pays. And it will be the consumers of \nthis country who will pay for it, because this does not get out there \nfor nothing.\n\n  I think it is a wrong approach. I say to my colleagues, if they are \nserious about building a national health and education infrastructure \nthrough telecommunications, this is the wrong direction to go, because \nwith competition in the marketplace we will find somebody that will \nprovide the services a little bit cheaper maybe than the next guy to do \nbusiness in an area where there is a high volume of business as there \nis in education and health care provision in rural areas.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Before the Senator from Montana leaves, I appreciate the \nstatement. I must say, Mr. President, I appreciate very much that \nSenator from Montana included a couple sections of language in this \nlegislation on my behalf, section 304. It does deal with education. We \nadded elementary and secondary schools for advanced telecommunications \nincentives. That is the connection. That is the fiber that would go to \nthe school. It does not cover affordable rates and does not get some of \nthe other things section 10 does, but last year when S. 1822 passed, \nthe vote was 18-2. The Senator from Oregon, Senator Packwood, and the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, voted against it, but last year \nsection 104 that the Senator from Montana supported did provide \npreferential rates.\n  Section 104 says the purpose of this provision--a new provision of \nthe 1934 act to provide for public access actually much broader than \nwhat 310 does: disseminate noncommercial, educational, cultural, civic, \nand charitable, so the public has access to telecommunications \nnetwork--the purpose of this provision is to ensure that these entities \nmay be able to obtain, at preferential rates, advance services and \nfunctionalities for all their communication needs.\n  The chairman of the committee voted for it last year--last year's \nranking member, this year's chairman. All members of the committee, not \njust Republicans, but all members of the committee, voted for that last \nyear with the exception of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  I know there is a good explanation as to what happened between last \nyear and this, but last year, preferential rates were part of the bill, \nand this year they are some kind of a slippery slope.\n  Mr. BURNS. To reply to the Senator from Nebraska, had it been part of \nthis bill out of committee--that is the only place I voted for, was out \nof committee. I would probably have voted for it again to get it out of \nthe committee to get it to come to the floor of the U.S. Senate in \norder to move this legislation along.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator has included S. 1822, some special comments \nthat indicate which provisions of S. 1822 he did not particularly like, \nand I have read that and I do not find any objection to providing the \npreferential rates to the various institutions.\n  My focus is the K-through-12 institutions.\n  Mr. BURNS. I say to the Senator that was a year ago, and I would have \nvoted to get it out of committee.\n  Once we look at who will pay for it and who will pick it up, \nsomewhere in this mix we have lost the consumer. That is where it is \ngoing to come. It will come in the form of higher rates for everybody.\n  I say if we do not do that, then the deployment of the technology \nwill be slower to happen. That is where I am coming from.\n  Mr. KERREY. Those Members concerned about higher rates, I point out \nthat the managers' amendment, that I am quite sure will be accepted, \nhas some changes that allows for universal funding to be used to \nprovide these preferential rates, which avoids the necessity for any \nkind of concern for rate increase.\n  Again, I close briefly, the Senator from Maine was kind earlier to \nvitiate a tabling motion. I am prepared to end this in this debate.\n  I say in summary, for me, we are making progress out there right now \nin States precisely because we have an opportunity to negotiate with \ntelephone companies because they are trying to move from a rate-based \nsystem of regulation to a price cap system. This legislation takes away \nthat leverage by saying that all States will move to price cap \nregulation. The progress we see being made out there will stop.\n  This piece of legislation with section 310 intact, this particular \nsection intact, will give every single Member [[Page S7990]] who votes \nto retain this section in there, I guarantee, an awful lot of pride. I \npromise, from personal experience and visiting schools that are using \ncomputer technology, those schools that use this provision--and they \nwill, there will be very few schools that do not find themselves saying \nthis is a way to leverage the purchase of computers, the purchase of \nsoftware, to begin to use the technology for math scores, reading \nscores, and writing scores--all the things that have been frustrating, \nas citizens, will allow Members to get quite excited.\n  I hope that Members will not support this well-intentioned motion to \nstrike the section and allow section 310 to remain in S. 652. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, just a few final points that I think are \nimportant to make in response to one of the previous speakers, Senator \nBurns.\n  First of all, the language that has been incorporated in the \nlegislation before the Senate that was offered by Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Kerrey, Senator Exon, and myself in committee extended the \nalready existing universal service provisions within the legislation. \nUniversal service has been a fundamental part of our telecommunication \npolicy, and rightly continues to be part of our telecommunication \npolicy before this Senate.\n  We extended the provisions to include schools, libraries, and \nhospitals because we think it is in the public interest. It is in our \nnational interest.\n  Furthermore, I think it is important to note that this ultimately \nwill save money. When we talk about the deregulation of the \ntelecommunication industry, which is what this legislation is all \nabout, many providers will reap enormous benefits as a result of the \ngoal of this legislation. We want to make sure that the rural areas \nalso reap benefits, that they are not removed from affordable access to \nthe technological growth and development of the information \nsuperhighway. It will save money through telemedicine. Making sure \nschools have access will ultimately increase the economic growth of \nthis country. This language is a wise investment that will ultimately \nsave money.\n  In talking to rural health care centers and hospitals, they point out \nthat through telemedicine they could communicate with some of the \nspecialists, without transporting the patient or going to another \nhospital in order to get those services. They can do it through \ntelemedicine.\n  Access may be there to some citizens, in a limited fashion in some \nrural health care centers, as Senator Burns mentions. It is not \npervasive, and certainly not in my State.\n  Without this language in the bill, then rural areas will not reap the \nfull benefits of the information age because it will be more \neconomically feasible for carriers to provide those services in densely \npopulated areas, in urban areas--not in the rural areas of our country.\n  We have to ensure that there is a minimal threshold of affordable \naccess to telecommunications services to our schools and our libraries \nand rural hospitals. We cannot make it more basic than that.\n  Finally, I would like to note that three of the Bell telephone \ncompanies support our provisions. We refined our language to conform to \nsome of their concerns. NYNEX, Ameritech, and Bell Atlantic do not \noppose these provisions.\n  I hope Members of this body will defeat the McCain amendment, which \nwould strike the language that we have incorporated in the legislation \nbefore the Senate. I move to table the McCain amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], \nthe Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski], the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], and the Senator \nfrom Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 244 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Biden\n     D'Amato\n     Helms\n     Murkowski\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 1262) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I note that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator suggests the absence of a quorum. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I hope Senators will bring up their \namendments. We are ready for amendments. As far as I am concerned, I \nwould like to go deep into the night, but maybe others disagree.\n  I have been trying all afternoon to get the voting speeded up. We are \nready for the next amendment, as far as I am concerned. I do not know \nif anybody has an amendment ready. And I have been seeking time \nagreements. But we can really move much faster. We could theoretically \nfinish this bill tonight if we really get going. So I would appreciate \nMembers' support in moving this forward. We are ready for amendments. \nSenator Hollings and I ready for any amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have talked with both managers of the bill \nto see what we could do to accommodate our colleagues who have \ncommitments for the next couple of hours. But then you have colleagues \nwho have commitments tomorrow morning. I am not certain we can \naccommodate everybody. But the key is to get an amendment laid down \nthat will take a couple of hours.\n  I think the Senator from South Carolina may be prepared to offer his \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Not yet.\n  Mr. DOLE. He is in doubt.\n  There is the managers' amendment that still has not been adopted, and \nthe amendment by this Senator, and then the amendment by Senator \nDaschle.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We are trying to work those out. We will work those out \nif we can get another amendment up and relieve our colleagues here.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have given a copy of my amendment to Senator Kerrey \nbecause I know his concern with the bill. If we need to furnish any \nadditional information, we will be happy to do so. But we do need to \nget an amendment here.\n  Do we have a list of amendments?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If the leader will yield, we invite any amendments. But \nwe are prepared to go to third reading very soon if Members do not \nbring up their amendments.\n[[Page S7991]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, the Senator from Maine, Mr. Cohen, is \nprepared to offer an amendment which will take approximately 1\\1/2\\ \nhours. I am not sure how much the people in opposition might want.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. As I understand, Senator Thurmond will have an \namendment and Senator Dorgan. Those are the only outstanding amendments \nthat I know of.\n  Will someone correct me if that is not true?\n  We have the Cohen amendment and we have the Thurmond amendment and \nthe Dorgan amendment coming up. That is all that I know of.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator from Maine is prepared to enter into a time \nagreement of 1 hour and 30 minutes equally divided, if that is all \nright with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. May we make that request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have no objection to the unanimous \nconsent to set a time for this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOLE. No second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, may we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have agreed to an \nhour and a half equally divided, expecting a vote no later than--I \nwould say what--a quarter of 8?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COHEN. If it can occur sooner, can Senators be on notice that if \ntime is yielded back we will vote prior to that time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. For the convenience of Members, perhaps we can agree it \nwill be an hour and a half. It does not make any difference to me. I am \nfor voting as soon as possible.\n  Mr. COHEN. A 7:30 vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. And we will divide the time equally.\n  Mr. COHEN. I ask unanimous consent that there be no second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1263\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the competitive availability of addressable \n                            converter boxes)\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], for himself and Ms. \n     Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 1263.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 8, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (15) When devices for achieving access to \n     telecommunications systems have been available directly to \n     consumers on a competitive basis, consumers have enjoyed \n     expanded choice, lower prices, and increased innovation.\n       (16) When recognizing the legitimate interest of \n     multichannel video programming distributors to ensure the \n     delivery of services to authorized recipients only, \n     addressable converter boxes should be available to consumers \n     on a competitive basis. The private sector has the expertise \n     to develop and adopt standards that will ensure competition \n     of these devices. When the private sector fails to develop \n     and adopt such standards, the Federal government may play a \n     role by taking transitional actions to ensure competition.\n       On page 82, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 208. COMPETITIVE AVAILABILITY OF CONVERTER BOXES.\n\n       Part III of title VI (47 U.S.C. 521 et seq.) is amended by \n     inserting after section 624A the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 624B. COMPETITIVE AVAILABILITY OF CONVERTER BOXES.\n\n       ``(a) Availability.--The Commission shall, after notice and \n     opportunity for public comment, adopt regulations to ensure \n     the competitive availability of addressable converter boxes \n     to subscribers of services of multichannel video programming \n     distributors from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors \n     that are not telecommunications carriers and not affiliated \n     with providers of telecommunications service. Such \n     regulations shall take into account--\n       ``(1) the needs of owners and distributors of video \n     programming and information services to ensure system and \n     signal security and prevent theft of the programming or \n     services; and\n       ``(2) the need to ensure the further deployment of new \n     technology relating to converter boxes.\n       ``(b) Termination of Regulations.--The regulations adopted \n     pursuant to this section shall provide for the termination of \n     such regulations when the Commission determines that there \n     exists a competitive market for multichannel video \n     programming services and addressable converter boxes among \n     manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors that are not \n     telecommunications carriers and not affiliated with providers \n     of telecommunications service.''.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening, along with Senator \nSnowe, to offer an amendment that is a pro-consumer amendment. It is a \npro-competition amendment that is focused on one narrow area of \ntelecommunications that I truly believe needs more competition.\n  Basically, what we have is a situation in which cable companies will \noffer their cable service and offer the so-called set-top boxes, a \ncable box essentially, that you need to rent in order to carry the \ncable signal.\n  Obviously, cable companies are in the business to sell their signals \nand their programming, and they want to protect the integrity of that \nsignal and that programming. I think that is not an unreasonable \nrequest. It is one that we ought to protect.\n  The difficulty, however, is that there is little, if any, competition \nin the set-top box market. As a matter of fact, what you have is an \nessential monopoly that has been granted to the cable companies.\n  We had a situation in Maine a short time ago where one company \nincreased the monthly charge by almost $3, just for the privilege of \nrenting a box in order to carry signals that subscribers were already \ncarrying. A furor erupted over that.\n  There is no real way to deal with this situation other than \nintroducing competition. What I am seeking to do by this amendment is \nto allow the FCC the authority to call upon the private sector to \ndevelop a standard that would say, ``Here is the technology whereby we \ncan protect our signals but also allow for competition in the \nmanufacture and distribution of these set-top boxes.''\n  If we go back historically, we look at what happened to telephone \ncompanies. Decades ago, telephone companies would say, ``You have to \nrent our telephone. If you don't rent our telephone, you don't get any \ntelephone service.''\n  Of course, times have changed. We now can walk into Circuit City, \nRadio Shack, Best Buy, or any of the supermalls, and we can find 20 or \n30 different types of telephones. The signal has been protected. We can \nplug the telephone into the wall. We still have to pay the Bell \ncompanies, AT, MCI or whoever is carrying the signal. But the signal \nis protected.\n  As a result of competition, we have a wide variety of choices in \nother markets--VCR's, television sets, computers, video game players, \nand stereo systems. In these markets, we have competition. What this \namendment seeks to do is introduce competition into the set-top box \nmarket.\n  Mr. President, I really believe that those who are opposed to this \namendment--I have seen a letter circulated--argue that somehow this \namendment represents more regulation. Those who argue against this \namendment are for monopoly, not for more competition.\n  What we seek to do is to allow the FCC to call upon the private \nsector to develop the standards, and those would come--they should \ncome--in a reasonably short period of time. We can do it today with \nanalog technology. I am told that digital technology is moving along \nvery rapidly. For example, one [[Page S7992]] could take a credit card, \nor something that looks like a credit card, and the cable company that \nis sending the signal would have their code on that card. You could not \nreceive the programming without inserting that card into the set-top \nbox.\n  That is something that is not too far away on the horizon. It may not \neven be necessary to have a set-top box the way technology is running \ntoday. But even if we are dealing with analog technology, competition \ncan exist in the manufacture and distribution of the boxes, just as we \nhave competition in the manufacture and distribution of telephones \ntoday.\n  So for those reasons, I am submitting the legislation. I am hoping \nthat the Members of the Senate will agree that if we are trying to \nstimulate more competition, give consumers more choices at lower \nprices--which, after all, is the goal of this legislation--then it \nshould be accepted.\n  I understand there are several States where these set-top boxes are \nmanufactured, and the manufacturers like being able to go to the cable \ncompanies and say, ``Here, buy our box.'' If I were they, I would enjoy \nthat as well.\n  But if we are really talking about competition and giving consumers \ngreater choices and lower prices, there is absolutely no reason why \nthis amendment should not be accepted by the overwhelming majority of \nthose people who are supporting deregulation, who are supporting this \ntelecommunications revolution, and who want to see more competition.\n  With that in mind, Mr. President, there may be others on our side. I \nknow Senator Snowe is here, and she is a chief cosponsor of the \nlegislation. It is something that is long overdue. The problem we have \ntoday is there is no free market. If we were back 30 years ago in the \ntelephone industry, we would still have the old black phone and still \nbe paying rent to AT If we had this information superhighway, we \nwould say basically you cannot own a car, you have to rent one of our \ncars.\n  What this amendment says is we are going to give the consumer the \nopportunity to buy set-top boxes from any source they choose and, at \nthe same time, allow for the protection of the signal by the cable \ncompany that is sending it forth. I believe this represents a \nreasonable approach.\n  By the way, there were questions raised about my earlier legislation \n(S. 664) on this issue. Was I really trying to bring in the computer \nindustry? The answer is no. Was I trying to bring in the cellular phone \nindustry? Again, the answer is no. To address the concerns of these \nindustries, our current amendment focuses on the lack of a competitive \nmarket for cable boxes. We have excluded cellular telephone \ncommunications. We have excluded anything relating to computers. The \nlegislation is designed solely for set-top boxes. We have no desire or \nintent to regulate cellular phone or other telecommunications markets.\n  I urge those who are now advocating competition in order to give \nconsumers lower prices and more choice to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Cohen, and I \njoin in cosponsorship of this legislation to ensure that set-top boxes \nare competitively available. I commend him for offering this \nlegislation because I think in the context of the legislation before us \ntoday, this becomes a very important issue.\n  Currently, as Senator Cohen has noted, consumers have absolutely no \nchoice with respect to set-top boxes. They are forced to rent them from \ncable companies, often as a requirement to receiving cable signals.\n  This issue was highlighted recently when a cable operator in Maine \nplanned to scramble signals and require their customers to rent set-top \nboxes at a predetermined price.\n  This obviously did not go over very well because it did not offer a \nchoice to the consumers. Rather, they were required to rent set-top \nboxes for an additional fee added to their cable costs in order to \nunscramble the cable signal.\n  Fortunately, the issue was resolved, but I think it underscores an \nimportant point, the need to ensure that consumers seeking to access \ncable services have options. This amendment would allow consumers to \npurchase the set-top box from a local retail store, or to lease or \npurchase a box from their cable provider. They would be able to choose \nboxes that will work with their own television set and continue \nreceiving the cable programming channels to which they have subscribed.\n  When set-top boxes are available in a competitive market, consumers \nwill benefit from lower prices, increased flexibility, and a higher \nquality product. Competition will ensure technological innovation in \nset-top boxes, as companies compete to provide a better product at \nlower prices.\n  I recognize that as companies try to provide consumers with new and \nchanging technological features, there are bound to be growing pains. \nIn the case of the State of Maine cable provider, the requirement to \nrent set-top boxes was intended to provide consumers with added \nflexibility through addressable programming--but instead it limited \nconsumer choices because it required them to rent the set-top boxes and \nbear the additional cost, even if they wanted to receive the same \nservices. I do not think that is a mandate, nor is it a price, that \nconsumers should be forced to bear. I think certainly we should \nencourage competition, and I think this amendment does this.\n  This amendment requires the FCC to assure that set-top boxes used by \nconsumers to access cable programming are available in a competitive \nmarket. This amendment also continues to recognize the legitimate \ninterest of cable operators in ensuring the delivery of cable services \nonly to those consumers which have paid for them.\n  Present technology, however, can ensure the integrity and safety of \ncable operators' signals without requiring delivery of set-top boxes \nonly through the cable company.\n  In fact, the Electronic Industries Association has developed a draft \nstandard for security cards, similar to credit cards, that could be \ninserted into set-top boxes by cable companies to protect their system, \nwhile allowing consumers to use a commercially-sold set-top box.\n  I think it is important to mention this issue because I know that \ncable companies were concerned about providing safeguards for their own \nsignals. And this legislation provides for that, takes that into \naccount. Under the amendment the FCC has the responsibility and \nobligation to consider the legitimate needs of owners and distributors \nof cable programming to ensure system and signal security, and to \nprevent theft of programming or services.\n  It is interesting to look back on telephones prior to the \nderegulatory environment, specifically, think back to 1978--to give an \nexample of how much costs have dramatically changed in telephone \nservices, back in 1978, it cost $8.10 a month to rent a touch-tone \ntelephone from AT noncompetitive rental that would cost about \n$18.60 in 1994 dollars, plus the touch-tone and extension fees. As you \nknow, the AT monopoly was broken up back in 1984. With that decision, \nthe non-competitive telephone rental market was concluded.\n  In today's competitive market, a similar phone can be purchased for \nless than twenty dollars--about the same cost as a monthly rental from \nAT would have cost in today's dollars. In 1983, it cost $3.03 to rent \na standard black telephone--$4.63 in 1994 dollars. Later that same \nyear, when AT customers were allowed to buy the phones already in \ntheir homes, the very same phone could be purchased for $19.95.\n  We have learned that competition did not threaten the security of the \nphone networks, and consumers benefited from technological innovations, \nlower prices, and expanded choice. So I think that a ``yes'' vote on \nSenator Cohen's amendment will bring competition to the market for set-\ntop boxes, I think, benefiting consumers all across America. I think \nthe case has been made absolutely clear. I urge a ``yes'' vote for \nconsumer choice and improved competition.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  [[Page S7993]]\n  \n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I must rise in opposition to this \namendment. But I do want to praise Senator Cohen, Senator Snowe, and \nothers who have worked on this, and who have done a good job of trying \nto find a solution.\n  I know that the intention of the amendment is to permit unbundling of \ncable boxes so that vendors other than cable companies can offer them.\n  While it is a good concept, the amendment is faulty.\n  Consumers should be able to obtain their set top boxes from vendors \nother than their cable provider. However, urging the FCC to step in to \nfind a solution may not be the right way to proceed.\n  This amendment is drafted in such a way that I cannot imagine the FCC \nreacting in any other way but to try to issue standards governing set \ntop boxes.\n  Standards should be set by industry. And, I understand that there has \nbeen difficulty in getting cooperation from industry in establishing \nstandards. A uniform standard would make it easy for vendors and \nmanufacturers who wish to get into the business. However, there is no \nuniform standard among the nation's cable operators.\n  Cable is going to have to change. Competition will force change. DBS \nhas licensed several satellite dish providers, and the cost of DBS will \ncontinue to decline. The percentage of DBS will increase, and cable \nwill have to compete to keep its customers.\n  There simply is no need for Congress to mandate further FCC studies \nor regulations on the subject of set-top boxes. The proposed amendment \non set-top boxes is not sound for a number of reasons, including: The \nretail sale of cable descramblers could increase cable theft; increased \ncable theft will raise costs for cable systems and customers; \nwidespread cable theft will surely discourage increased investment in \ncable programming and cable distribution facilities.\n  The proposed amendment is premised on the following four myths:\n  Myth 1: Cable boxes are no longer necessary to secure video \nprogramming.\n  Myth 2: The use of new digital technologies with replaceable ``smart \ncards'' will solve cable's security concerns.\n  Myth 3: Cable boxes are like telephones.\n  Myth 4: Retail availability of cable boxes will reduce prices to \nconsumers.\n  Decoder boxes in homes are the only viable form of security for video \nservice. While there are other ways to secure a program service, all of \nthe known techniques have problems that make them useful only in \nlimited circumstances. For example, negative traps cannot be used with \nmultiple pay services without interfering with the signal quality of \nother programs delivered. Interdiction technology is costly and not \ntotally reliable.\n  Since cable theft raises the cost of doing business for cable systems \nand, ultimately, cable consumers, product security is essential to the \neconomic well-being of cable operators, cable consumers, and program \nnetworks. In addition, product security is vital for continued \ninvestment in cable programming and cable distribution systems.\n  Theft of cable service is a multi-billion dollar problem today. The \nretail sale of cable descramblers and would increase cable signal theft \nsignificantly. A person with a desire to modify cable boxes would be \nable to purchase any number of them at retail, modify them to illegally \nreceive encrypted services, and then resell them to others at whatever \ncost the market would bear.\n  Signals protected by digital techniques are not immune to attack. The \nsecurity of other television services that have depended on digital \ntechniques and smart cards have been quickly compromised. Indeed, such \nsecurity systems used by program providers in Europe were broken within \nmonths of their deployment.\n  Proponents of set-top box legislation argue that even if system \nsecurity is breached, the smart card can be changed. The problem for \nboth consumers and cable operators is the expense of such a scheme: \nSmart cards cost $30-$40 apiece. Sending out new cards to all customers \nevery time signal security is breached would become a prohibitive \nrecurring cost.\n  Telephone architecture and cable architecture are radically \ndifferent. The telephone instrument itself does not grant consumers \naccess to the services being sold by the telephone company. The \ntelephone set is merely the instrument that consumers need to use the \nnetwork. Access to telephone services is provided by a line that \nconnects consumers to the telephone company's central office. In order \nto prevent consumers from using a service, such as dial tone, the \ntelephone industry physically disconnects the consumer's wire at the \ncentral office.\n Consumers cannot steal the service.\n\n  Cable companies, however, must protect their services at the \nconsumer's home, since the signals of all program services are present \nat all times in the cable system's distribution system.\n  Cable operators scramble or encrypt program signals to prevent their \nunauthorized reception. Access to the encrypted product which is \npresent in every home is given only to consumers who have purchased it \nby providing a set-top box containing the appropriate descrambling \ncircuitry.\n  Even telephone companies entering the video-delivery business have \nrecognized that the most efficient way to deliver a video to consumers \nis to replicate cable television architecture, and they are deploying \nthat approach in their new distribution networks.\n  Current law requires cable operators to provide decoders and \ndescramblers to consumers at cost. S. 652 does not change existing law. \nThe retail cost of a descrambler is 10 times higher than the annual \nrental fee consumers now pay.\n  Cable companies deploy new set-top technology every 5 to 7 years. \nThis obsolescence cost is far less for a consumer paying an annual \nrental fee based on actual cost than for consumers at retail.\n  Cable companies utilize different scrambling technologies from market \nto market, requiring cable boxes to be franchise specific. Consumers \nmoving from one franchise area to another pay far less by renting their \nset-top equipment than by purchasing new boxes at retail.\n  For all the reasons I have mentioned, we do not need to place yet \nanother requirement on this industry, particularly one which harms both \npaying customers and cable operators.\n  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to add a few \ncomments.\n  First, let me add my distinguished colleague, Senator Thurmond, as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  Let me try to respond briefly to the comments that have been made. It \nseems to me these are the very same arguments that AT made 30 years \nago: ``If you do not allow us to control the phone, we will lose our \nsignal. We will have people who will be getting access to our telephone \nservice without paying for it.''\n  The objective of this amendment is to make sure the FCC calls upon \nthe private sector to develop the standard that will protect the cable \nsignal. I do not want to see the cable companies lose the benefit of \nprogramming and the costs of doing business by having people engage in \nthievery. What we want to do is make sure that they are, in fact, \nprotected. That is precisely the wording and the intent of the language \nof the amendment.\n  The Senator from South Dakota said competition will force change. But \nthat is the problem. There is no competition in the set-top box market; \nthere is a monopoly. We want to have competition. We want to force \nchange. We want to have 10 different types of boxes or whatever other \ndevices might be developed in the future, and not grant a monopoly to \nany one of the cable companies.\n  Yes, competition does force change. We have seen it in virtually \nevery aspect of our lives, from the telephones, the VCR, to the \ncomputers, to everything. We go to Circuit City, Radio Shack, any of \nthese major malls, and we see an absolute abundance of electronic \ndevices by virtue of having a free market.\n  There is no free market today with set-top boxes. Take, for example, \none cable company in Arlington, VA. Here is what they say in their \n``Policies and Procedures'':\n\n       Please remember . . . that channel selector boxes with \n     descrambling capability can only [[Page S7994]] be obtained \n     from Cable TV Arlington. In fact, should you see \n     advertisements for cable equipment that have descramblers in \n     them (so-called ``pirate boxes'' or ``black boxes'') you \n     should understand these devices are illegal to sell or to \n     use, unless authorized by CTA [Cable TV Arlington]. Because \n     of the need to protect our scrambled services, Cable TV \n     Arlington will not authorize the use of any descrambler not \n     provided by CTA. CTA does not recommend purchasing channel \n     selector boxes from other sources.\n\n  Companies say ``Rent our boxes.'' People cannot buy them.\n  If you have more competition, you obviously will have greater \nconsumer choice. You will have more manufacturers. You will have \ndiversity. You will have quality, as well.\n  Our amendment has a security provision, and for those who are \nconcerned about whether the FCC is now going to interject itself and \ntake over, we have also added a sunset provision. I do not want to see \nthe FCC have long-range regulatory authority. But we are talking about \nbreaking up the monopoly by saying the FCC shall go to the private \nsector, give them enough time to develop a standard, and if they do not \ndevelop a standard, propose a temporary standard. And it is temporary \nunder this legislation as drafted.\n  Who supports this, Mr. President? Well, I have a letter here from the \nInformation Technology Industry Council [ITI]. I will have it printed \nfor the Record.\n  We also have the support of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry \nAssociation [CTIA]. They were originally concerned with the bundling \nprovision in my earlier legislation. Because of this concern, I deleted \nthe bundling provision in the amendment. So they are now in support and \ndo not oppose the amendment.\n  Who is opposed to it? Obviously, the cable companies are opposed to \nit. They are the ones who are saying no; we like having this monopoly. \nWe want to control the boxes. We want to rent them. We do not have to \nworry about competition. We do not have to worry about it at all.\n  The companies, obviously, who manufacture the boxes like going to a \ncouple of cable companies and saying, ``Here is our product.'' They do \nnot want to be forced to engage in competition for the manufacture of \nthese devices, be they boxes or some other type of device that the \nfuture will show us.\n  I think we have also addressed the issue of security. We have \naddressed the issue of limited FCC regulatory power by saying it is \nonly temporary. The core of this amendment is more competition, lower \nprices, better quality, and more choice.\n  Mr. President, I make these comments on behalf of many of my \ncolleagues who have served on the Judiciary Committee, as well. Perhaps \nthey will be coming to the floor before debate is concluded.\n  The notion that somehow we have to be concerned that if we allow any \ncompetition, this will actually increase the theft of cable signals, I \nthink is precisely the same argument that was made by the telephone \nindustry 30 years ago.\n  I think we have come a long way since then by virtue of competition. \nThe consumer certainly has benefited. I think that this is precisely \nwhat needs to be done with this area of telecommunications that is now \ncontrolled by monopolies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe material previously mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                                     June 8, 1995.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC 20510.\n       Dear Bill: ITI, the Information Technology Industry \n     Council, supports your amendment to S. 652 that would enhance \n     the competitive availability of equipment used to access \n     multichannel video programming services. Competitive markets \n     for these devices, like the one in which the computer \n     industry has thrived, will benefit consumers and industry \n     alike.\n       ITI represents the leading U.S. providers of information \n     technology products and services. Our members had worldwide \n     revenue of $227 billion in 1994 and employ more than one \n     million people in the United States. It is our member \n     companies that are providing much of the hardware, software, \n     and services that are making the ``information superhighway'' \n     a reality.\n       We have been working with Kelly Metcalf of your staff over \n     the last several weeks and believe that, as modified, the \n     proposed amendment will improve consumer choice and stimulate \n     competition and innovation in the market for the converter \n     boxes and other devices that consumers will use to access \n     video and other services provided by video programmers. This \n     will ensure that consumers of multichannel video services--\n     whether provided by cable systems, direct broadcast \n     satellite, video dialtone networks, or other means--will be \n     able to purchase equipment necessary to receive programming \n     and services separately from the video services. This will \n     allow independent manufacturers and retailers, who have no \n     relationship to the service provider, to offer such equipment \n     directly to consumers.\n       We appreciate your leadership and your willingness to work \n     with us to address our concerns on earlier versions of the \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rhett Dawson,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Cellular Telecommunications\n\n\n                                         Industry Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cohen: The wireless industry, through CTIA, \n     has worked closely with you and your very capable \n     professional staff regarding concerns of the commercial \n     mobile service industry about restrictions and regulations \n     being considered which would affect the industry's \n     competitive and highly diverse marketing and distribution \n     channels for mobile telecommunications equipment and \n     services.\n       We are pleased that the amendment which you have offered \n     does not affect the commercial mobile radio services \n     equipment market, nor impose additional regulatory \n     restrictions which would slow or deter the current ability of \n     existing and new CMRS competitors, as well as retailers and \n     manufacturers, to aggressively market mobile equipment and \n     services to consumers from numerous outlets, including \n     national, regional and local retailers, specialty stores and \n     dealer stores.\n       The wireless industry appreciates the concerns that you \n     have expressed about some aspects of the telecommunications \n     equipment marketplace and we thank you for narrowing the \n     scope of your amendment to address those legitimate concerns.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Thomas E. Wheeler,\n                                                    President/CEO.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like 10 minutes to speak in favor \nof the Cohen amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have viewed the amendment and the \ncompany documents and listened to the Senator from Maine. I must say, \nhe is entirely consistent with what this legislation, at its best, \nproves in a couple of ways. We will have the opportunity to discuss and \ndebate this later.\n  It says that if consumers have a competitive choice--and by that, I \nmean that if I do not like what I got, I go someplace else.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair has been in business and \nunderstands what choice is. If you have a product that your customer \nwants to buy, your customer buys it. If you do not, if the price or \nquality is wrong, he goes somewhere else. And in that kind of \nenvironment it tends to focus the mind. It tends to say to you, ``I \nbetter figure it out and give that customer the right price.''\n  The customer says to me, ``I do not like black, I like blue, and if \nyou do not give me blue, I will go down the road here where they are \nmanufacturing it in blue.'' That is the kind of competitive choice that \nproduces the kind of quality and the kind of choices that in fact we \nhave seen in other sectors of our economy and that we are trying to do \nwith this particular piece of legislation.\n  I understand the opposition to it. I understand certain sectors of \nthe industry are worried about what is going to happen in a competitive \nenvironment. But let us not say to our citizens, as we are going \nthrough this debate as we are, that we are going to try to use \ncompetition to give you something that you currently do not have right \nnow and then kind of pull back, which is what we would do if we do not \naccept this amendment, in my judgment.\n  I understand there are some concerns about what sort of impact this \nmight have upon rural cable or smaller cable operators. I am prepared \nto surface that kind of concern. We just did that, in fact, with the \nSnowe-Rockefeller amendment in education. [[Page S7995]] \n  If you have a particular problem where somebody is not able to \nsurvive, if you can make a good case where there ought to be some \ndirect subsidy to enable them to survive, let us do it. But let us not \ntake the entire sector, this piece of the electronics market, and shut \ndown development of it, which in my judgment we are about to do unless \nwe allow competitive choice to occur as we again are trying to produce \na piece of legislation that pretends to be in favor of competition as a \nway to make the U.S. economy and this sector of our economy not only \nmore productive but satisfy the needs of the consumers at the other \nend.\n  As I said in some earlier comments--and I will try not to run beyond \nmy 10 minutes; you can hammer me down when I have gotten to the end \npoint--on previous occasions, this piece of legislation we are \nconsidering, S. 652, is not a small bill. It is a big bill. It is going \nto have a major impact on every household in America.\n  From my experience with the divestiture in 1984, I remember for the \nfirst 2 or 3 years people were not happy. They were upset. They did not \nlike all the choice. They were confused about it. We have to make sure, \nif there is a philosophy here that we believe will produce lower prices \nand higher quality, we have to be sure we will stick with it. But if we \ndo not stick with it, what is going to happen is you are going to \ncontinue to have artificial separations that make it difficult for \nthose entrepreneurs to come to our households and say, ``I am prepared \nto sell you a packaged service. Here is my price and what I will give \nyou. And if you do not like it, there are lots of other people who will \ncome here and try to nail down your business.''\n  That is the environment we are trying to create, and if we do not \ncreate it, consumers will say to us, our citizens will say to us as \nconsumers, that we have gotten a good deal out of this thing. It has \nbeen good for us.\n  If we preserve any sort of monopoly out of concern, ``I am not sure \nwhat is going to happen here, maybe I better hedge my bet a little \nbit,'' it seems to me we are going to find ourselves wondering why we \nsupported this legislation.\n  I make it clear, even with this amendment adopted, I need to have \nsome additional changes in this before this bill is going to get my \nsupport. But this particular amendment is entirely consistent with what \nI think this legislation needs to do before we enact it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join as a cosponsor of this amendment and \ncommend my colleagues for their leadership. Just last year, Senator \nThurmond and I proposed an amendment along the same lines to promote \nconsumer availability of converter boxes. We were delighted when our \ncolleagues from Maine took up the fight and previously noted our \nsupport when they appeared before the Antitrust Subcommittee earlier \nthis year.\n  This amendment seeks to encourage consumer options and competition. \nIt uses regulatory authority only as a last resort when competition is \nnot working, when consumer choice is not available, and where the \nprivate sector and the marketplace fail to develop standards that \nensure competition. It is, of course, our hope that this regulatory \nauthority never need be exercised.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment requires the Federal \nGovernment to jump in and set standards for technology and this will \nhave a chilling effect on new technologies. Not only that it will \ncompromise the security devices used in cable TV that enable parents to \nprotect their children from indecent and violent programming on \ntelevision. Allowing the FCC to set standards for technologies will \nhave an adverse impact on new technologies being developed.\n  Mr. President, in order to protect their services, cable television \noperators have used increasingly sophisticated and cost-effective \nmethods to secure that signals against theft. Current technology does \nthis by including the security devices in a converter placed on or near \nthe television set.\n  Security for these programs is essential for parents who wish to \nprotect their children from the deluge of violent and explicitly sexual \nmaterial so regrettably abundant on many cable channels. If the FCC, \nfor whatever reason, sets a weak or easily compromised standard, it \nwill be much easier for our children to gain access to trashy and \nviolent programming.\n  Let me state for the record a few examples of the type programs to \nwhich children may gain access: HBO's program (called ``Real Sex'') in \nwhich a former porn state describes sexual acts and how men can dress \nlike women: and the Playboy Channel, the X-rated movies on pay-per-view \nchannels, and the violent R-rated movies.\n  Concerns over the lack of security are very real: the cable \ntelevision industry is already experiencing a significant level of \ntheft of service-approaching 15 percent in the largest systems. This \ncost cable operators and owners of intellectual property an estimated \n$4.7 billion per year. Satellite television was victim to theft of \nservice rates in the late 1980's which approached 65 percent of the \nmarket.\n  This amendment would turn over to Federal bureaucrats the \nresponsibility for making the determination as to how much security is \nadequate. That determination will be binding on owners of intellectual \nproperty and network providers. This obviously is unacceptable.\n  The Federal Government should not be charged with setting the \nstandards for technology. Standard setting for technology belongs in \nthe hands of those in the private sector who have the expertise and the \nincentive to protect intellectual property.\n  A national and uniform security standard actually facilities theft by \ngiving criminals a single target; it also stifles the necessary \ninnovation for security to stay ahead of high-technology hackers.\n  Mr. President, I am unalterably persuaded that property owners, and \nthose acting for them, should have the right and responsibility to \ndetermine the level and method of security appropriate for their needs. \nThat is clearly an economic business decision--not a matter for \nbureaucrats determination.\n  We must let new technologies develop to preserve security, experience \nthe development of increased retail availability of equipment and avoid \nthe consequences of the law of unintended results that usually \naccompanies regulation.\n  The Cohen amendment should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Maine would \nallow us, within the unanimous consent agreement, to go to the \nmanagers' amendment that we have worked out and we wish to have agreed \nto. We are not going to change anything here. This will take about 5 \nminutes at the most.\n  Mr. COHEN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. For the information of everybody, we will stick with \nthe 7:30 vote. There is no change. There are more amendments to this \nand other speakers are welcome to come to the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, could the Senator refrain for just a moment?\n  It is all right, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COHEN. I assume it will take about 5 minutes after the time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes. It will take no more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is a managers' amendment. We worked \nit out on both sides and we think this is a good use of time. We have \nbeen looking for the opportunity. We cleared it with those Senators. I \nyield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nCohen amendment for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 1258\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 1258. This is a modification of the managers' \namendment.\n  I send to the desk a modification of our amendment, the amendment of \nSenator Hollings and I, and ask the amendment be modified accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 7 of the amendment, beginning with line 22, strike \n     through line 4 on page 8 of the amendment and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Registered public utility holding company.--A \n     registered company may provide telecommunications services \n     only [[Page S7996]] through a separate subsidiary company \n     that is not a public utility company.\n       ``(2) Other utility companies.--Each State shall determine \n     whether a holding company subject to its jurisdiction--\n       ``(A) that is not a registered holding company, and\n       ``(B) that provides telecommunications service,\n\n     is required to provide that service through a separate \n     subsidiary company.\n       ``(3) Savings provision.--Nothing in this subsection or the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1995 prohibits a public utility \n     company from engaging in any activity in which it is legally \n     engaged on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications \n     Act of 1995; provided it complies with the terms of any \n     applicable authorizations.\n       ``(4) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     terms `public utility company', `associate company', `holding \n     company', `subsidiary company', `registered holding company', \n     and `State commission' have the same meaning as they have in \n     section 2 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n     1935.''.\n       On page 8 of the amendment, between lines 5 and 6, insert \n     the following:\n       On page 36, line 13, strike ``within 9 months'' and insert \n     ``not later than one year''.\n       On page 18 of the amendment, between lines 10 and 11, \n     insert the following:\n       On page 74, line 1, strike ``(2) SEC jurisdiction \n     limited.--'' and insert ``(2) Removal of SEC jurisdiction.--\n     ''.\n       On page 18 of the amendment line 12, before the period \n     insert the following: ``and insert `to grant any \n     authorization'''.\n       On page 18 of the amendment, between lines 17 and 18, \n     insert the following:\n       On page 74, line 12, strike ``contracts.'' and insert \n     ``contracts, and any authority over audits or access to books \n     and records.''.\n       On page 19 of the amendment, between lines 3 and 4, insert \n     the following:\n       (4) Commission rules.--The Commission shall consider and \n     adopt, as necessary, rules to protect the customers of a \n     public utility company that is a subsidiary company of a \n     registered holding company against potential detriment from \n     the telecommunications activities of any other subsidiary of \n     such registered holding company.\n       On page 22 of the amendment, beginning with ``The'' on line \n     23, strike through line 24.\n       On page 13 of the amendment strike lines 14 through 17 and \n     insert the following: ``is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:''\n       On page 13 of the amendment, line 25, insert closing \n     quotation marks and a period at the end.\n       On page 14 of the amendment, strike lines 1 through 3.\n       On page 9 of the amendment, line 24, strike ``120 days'' \n     and insert ``180 days''.\n       On page 7 of the amendment, line 9, before the period \n     insert ``so long as the costs are appropriately allocated''.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, these modifications represent minor and \ntechnical changes in the public utility company provisions, preserve \ncurrent law regarding the sunset provision of section 628 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934, and extend the period for certain market \nopportunity determinations from 120 days to 180 days.\n  Mr. President, following the remarks of my colleague, I urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it has been cleared on this side. I join \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1258), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendments \nincluded in the managers' amendment be treated as original text for \npurposes of further amendment during the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. This manager's amendment allows the FCC to modify those \nprovisions of the modified final judgment (MFJ) that are not overridden \nor superseded by the bill. Does this provision of the Manager's \namendment allow the FCC to change the provisions regarding the entry of \nthe Bell operating companies into long distance or manufacturing?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No. The amendment is intended, to allow the FCC to \nmodify those provisions of the MFJ that this legislation would not \nmodify or supersede.\n  Mr. KERREY. The manager's amendment changes the definition of \n``telecommunications service'' by deleting a sentence concerning the \ntransmission of information services and cable services. My question is \nwhether the deletion of this sentence will affect the scope of many of \nthe bill's substantive provisions.\n  For example, section 254(a) preempts State entry restrictions on the \nprovision of ``telecommunications services.'' Does the new definition \nmean that States would be allowed to restrict entry into the business \nof transporting information services?\n  Section 254(b) ensures that States can preserve universal service for \n``telecommunications services.'' Does the new definition mean that \nStates could not preserve universal service for the transmission of any \ninformation services?\n  The bill provides detailed requirements that must be satisfied before \nthe Bell companies may offer interLATA ``telecommunications services.'' \nDoes the deletion of that sentence mean that the Bell companies may \nprovide interLATA transmission of information services without \ncomplying with the requirements of this legislation?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The answer to each of those questions is ``no''.\n\n       The deletion of this sentence is intended to clarify that \n     the carriers of broadcast and cable services are not intended \n     to be classified as common carriers under the Communication \n     Act to the extent they provide broadcast services or cable \n     services.\n                           Amendment No. 1263\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I now move to go back to the Cohen \namendment. I say to Senators, a vote has been set for 7:30. Any \nSenators wishing to speak on this amendment or on the bill, I invite \nthem to the floor, if that is agreeable with the Senator from Maine.\n  I do have some closing, about 5 minutes of closing remarks on the \nCohen amendment, but I will hold those over for a bit.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Who controls the time in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senator from \nKentucky wishes.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not want very much. I rise more in being inquisitive \nhere rather than being in opposition to the amendment.\n  I understand what my friend from Nebraska says about competition. You \ncome in the front door with a piece of equipment and you offer it for a \ncertain price and if that is a little too high, there is always \nsomebody else who will knock on the door and sell you something \ndifferent.\n  Not many people go out in rural areas and drive 5 miles from customer \nto customer. They like to stay in town where you have houses and lots \nand there are 15 customers on one block rather than two customers in 15 \nmiles.\n  My rural cable people are very concerned about this particular \namendment, and I will tell you why. One, they are not sure what this \nwill do to the small cable operator who would have maybe 250 or 500 \ncustomers, maybe 1,000, in a rural area. Will they be able to \naccommodate? Can they get the accommodation? Will they be able to carry \nthings that will not be unscrambled through the boxes? Of course, our \nfriend who promotes this amendment says everything is protected; there \nare temporary rules. Temporary rules that go into permanent rules? How \nsoon will that be done? I have a lot of concern for the little people, \nparticularly in rural areas.\n  There must be something special from all these technology groups. \nThey must make the boxes and they want to manufacture them and sell \nthem. I do not blame them.\n  I hate for me to be the vehicle to help them sell their products. I \nthink they ought to be competitive, and if they have a better product, \nthey can sell to the cable companies, if that is what is in it. But I \nam going to be concerned about my rural area and, somehow, I think if \nwe could have a short study period here, perhaps we could eliminate \ntheir fears. Because, if the small rural cable operator cannot make it \nand then he has a financial problem and he is being pressured by the \nlarger cable companies to buy him out, we find there will be less and \nless competition in the cable community than there is now out there. \nAnd the struggling small cable operator, I think, is \n[[Page S7997]] getting in trouble more and more all the time. They are \nnot concerned; they are frightened.\n  They are not concerned; they are frightened. When you talk to them \nabout having to borrow money to enlarge to try to keep up with the new \ntechnology and with the new rules, all of that, it becomes almost \nunbearable weight; to hire lawyers, to do all these things, and the \nexpense is just almost unbearable weight.\n  I hope that Senators will look at this and have a study. I do not \nwant a long study. I just want somebody to look at it and to convince \nthe small cable operators that this is a good thing for them, that they \nwill not be hurt, that they will be able to have--not many small \ncommunities have Radio Shacks. They may have a Wal-Mart about 15 or 20 \nmiles away they can drive to, but they are not going to have a Radio \nShack or Electric Avenue or all of these things right close by.\n  So, Mr. President, I am expressing some frustration as it relates to \nwhat we do to the small operator, the small entrepreneur. Let us put \nhis life into it. And he is still struggling to be in competition with \nthe major that is knocking on his door every day saying, ``You cannot \nmake it fellow. Let us take it over.''\n  I would want the Senator from Maine, if he could--he is a smart \nindividual and is a good word merchant--if there might be some way that \nwe could have a short period of study that would maybe just apply to \nsmall cable operators and not major ones. I hear they are going to have \na credit card. Just stick it in the box, punch it, and you get your \nprogram. Not many out in the rural areas are going to have a box you \ncan put a credit card in, punch it, pull it out, and you will get \ncertain programs. It will be very difficult for them to do.\n  I am here trying to protect the small operator in my rural \nconstituency, and I hope I will not have to oppose this amendment. I \nhope we can have some sort of a study as it relates to really finding \nout whether all of these things are possible, all of these things are \ndoable, this competition is going to be out there, and that everything \nis going to be great. If you can convince my small operators or me, I \nwould be more than willing to be an advocate of this amendment. But I \nwas always brought up believing when in doubt, do not. I am in doubt \nabout what this does to my small cable operators.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will give serious consideration to a \nstudy. I do not want a long one, but at least a period of time to be \nsure that my small cable operators will not be damaged in their \noperation and that their financial future will not be jeopardized \nbecause of this.\n  To go back to Abraham Lincoln, who said, ``When progress is made \nsomebody gets hurt.'' That is when Abraham Lincoln was defending the \nrailroads against the barge and ferry operators when trying to build a \nbridge across the Missouri River. The railroad won and it hurt the \nferry operators and the barge operators. So Mr. Lincoln said, ``When \nprogress is made somebody gets hurt.''\n  I am trying to prevent the hurt here. I have not been convinced that \nthis will not hurt my small operators.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator for giving the time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I think the goal of the Senator from \nMaine is very laudable, and I also believe we have to jog a little the \ncable industry to set a standard because they have been very slow to do \nso. I think the cable industry needs to get the message that we want \nbetter action from them in setting the standards. But when I get to \nboiling down to my concern about this amendment, it is that it says, \n``The commission shall, after notice and opportunity for public \ncomment, adopt regulations to ensure the competitive availability of * \n* * convertible boxes, subscribers, and services of multi-channel video \nprograms and distributors from manufacturers,'' et cetera. The part \nthat worries me is that the ``commission shall adopt regulations.''\n  I am concerned that this might lock technology in. I fear it may be \nlikely that the industry will not adopt a common standard in a timely \nfashion, thus involving potential standard setting by the FCC. The \nstandards created by a Government entity may result in technology being \nlocked in place which could result in stifling innovation. If the \ncomputer industry had been subject to a similar legislative mandate \nwhen interoperability was a real problem for early users of personal \ncomputers, I doubt our industry would be as competitive as it is today. \nAfter all, what is the top box but a small computer. If we have a \nstandard developed by the FCC for these boxes, I think we will not have \nthe future improvements and innovations that could occur if we simply \nleave the standard setting to the industry.\n  I cite the innovations that we have had in computers where there has \nnot been a standard set by Government and innovation has gone forward \nvery quickly. On the other hand, I would jawbone the cable industry \nvery much to set a private standard so there could be more competitors.\n  Mr. President, this concludes my remarks on this particular \namendment. I am sure there are other speakers. We have from now until \n7:30, depending on Senators coming to the floor, but we are open for \nopening statements or statements on this or any other part of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is getting \nready to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in the June 2, 1995 edition of the Washington Times, \nthere appeared a front page article which was another reminder of the \nserious problem of theft of intellectual property. The article makes \nreference to the extraordinary efforts to which signal thieves have \ngone to steal programming carried by cable television systems, such as \nmovies and special programs. They obtain cable television converters, \nnormally through illegal means, modify them to compromise the security, \nand then sell them to either knowing or unwitting consumers so that \nthey can steal the programming.\n  Indeed, in a recent article reported in the February 20, 1995 edition \nof MultiChannel News that these signal thieves are increasingly \nresorting to armed robbery to obtain these boxes.\n  Mr. President, as both articles point out, this theft is a crime. It \nis viewed very seriously by Federal law enforcement officials because, \nleft unchecked, such theft could undermine our national \ntelecommunications networks. Let us not forget that, in the late \n1980's, theft of satellite service almost destroyed that industry.\n  Mr. President, given the high value placed on this equipment by these \nthieves, I am very concerned about the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, to make such equipment available at \nretail. Aside from the fact that the proposal would put the FCC right \nin the middle of setting standards and designing equipment for advanced \ndigital technologies, this proposal fails to adequately address the \nproblem of these signal thieves.\n  The current situation is that the limited numbers of warehouses where \nthese cable television security boxes are kept are a major target for \nthese signal\n thieves. Here you have a situation where the equipment is considered \nso valuable that signal thieves are risking armed robbery to obtain it. \nCan you imagine how much worse the situation would become if that \nequipment were widely available at retail? Under these circumstances, \nit would become virtually impossible to keep it out of the hands of \nsignal thieves.\n\n  Let us not forget that these thieves are not stealing these security \nboxes so that they can display them on their fireplace mantles. They \nare using them to steal programming. The more easily \n[[Page S7998]] they can be obtained, particularly in quantities, the \nfaster and cheaper it is for these signal thieves to mass produce \nmodified boxes to steal programming.\n  Mr. President, I sympathize with the goal of the Cohen amendment. But \nI think that the approach taken is fatally flawed. It rests on the \nassumption that the Government can know that some security technique, \nlike smart cards, can be used to facilitate retail sale. I do not know \nthat to be true. Not even the experts at the FCC can know that to be \ntrue.\n  Yet the principle which underlies the amendment is that the \nGovernment can and will make the determination as to how much security \nis adequate. That determination will become binding on owners of \nintellectual property and network providers. This is not acceptable.\n  I believe that property owners and those acting for them should have \nthe right to determine the level and method of security appropriate for \ntheir needs. That is an appropriate, economic business decision and not \na matter for Government determination.\n  Moreover, it is entirely consistent with the deregulatory goals of \nthis legislation that the chairman has consistently and clearly \nadvocated during the debate on the underlying legislation and this \namendment in particular.\n  This amendment is not proconsumer but it is proregulation. Therefore, \nI strongly urge that the pending amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes. The other side has 13 minutes \n54 seconds.\n  Mr. COHEN. This side has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. KERREY. I was actually going to ask the managers--I do not know--\nif the opponents to this amendment were going to use all 13 minutes?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. The opponents have used time. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. KERREY. Did the Senator want to respond?\n  Mr. COHEN. I am just curious; the Senator is going to speak for the \namendment or against it?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am still speaking for the amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. All right. The Senator wants me to give him some time \nthen.\n  Mr. KERREY. I wish to speak more generally about the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield sufficient time to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank very much the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is important, but I say to the Senators \nwho will be perhaps watching, or the staffs who will be over the next \n30 minutes trying to figure out OK, what is going to happen next? Where \nare we in this piece of legislation? Remember, there are 9 sectors of \nthe telecommunications industry, all directed to approximately 100 \nmillion American households. That is where they do business. They are \nselling to commercial customers as well, but they are focused on those \nhouseholds, and that is where we are going to hear whether this \nlegislation is successful or not. That is where, a year from now, a \nyear and a half, 2 years from now, you are going to hear people say, \nyou know, this really did work. You were telling us it was going to \nwork. It did work.\n  Nine sectors. I will run through them briefly again. Broadcasting is \nthe big one, cable is one, telephone is one, Hollywood and music \nrecording--that is music and the images--publishing is one, computers \nis one, consumer electronics, which is the subject of this particular \namendment, wireless is one, and satellite is one.\n  All nine of them, Mr. President, represent hundreds of billions of \ndollars' worth of sales into the American household on a constant \nbasis. They are making judgments about what to purchase and what to \nbuy. What has happened is that the technology has changed so that it is \npossible now for people to buy in a package, and what we are trying to \ndo is give them real competitive choice.\n  It is going to be traumatic. What we need to do is to say what is \nmore important to us, the trauma faced by those consumers, those \ncitizens in the households, or the trauma of businesses as they face \ncompetition for the first time in their business lives?\n  Mr. President, not only does this amendment need to be adopted, but \nwe need to change the underlying bill so that the Department of \nJustice, which has been the prime mover in this--I know that many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle think the Department of \nJustice should be left out, with just a consultant role, if necessary. \nI really urge you to think about that. That is going to be the next \norder of business. The DOJ, the Department of Justice, is the one that \nstarted this in motion in 1948, in a consent decree, with the \nDepartment of Justice action against AT That is what produced the \ncompetitive environment in long distance.\n  If you hook the Department of Justice of that Republican \nadministration to another Republican administration to a Democrat \nadministration, they have consistently been the best advocates in this \nNation's Capital for competition. They are the ones that said: Look, I \nknow you want to own all the market. I understand what you are trying \nto do. But you cannot. We have to keep this competitive because not \nonly will consumers benefit, but the economy will benefit as well.\n  I understand people said oh, no, that is not going to work. I have \ntalked to the companies about this. I know why they do not like it.\n  The Department of Justice needs to be more than just a consultant in \nthis thing. Otherwise, I tell you, Mr. President, my colleagues, I \nthink you are going to regret this vote. You are not going to get the \nkind of vigorous competition that is needed in all of these sectors, in \na package fashion, that is going to have our consumers say I was paying \n$120 a month for all of my information, all these things taken \ntogether, all nine of them, and now I am paying $80. This is terrific. \nThis is working.\n  Disregard, if possible, the companies that are coming in and saying, \ngee, I do not want to do it that way because this is going to be a \nbetter way.\n  Think about those consumers in the households. Think about those \nindividual families in the households. This amendment is going to look \na lot better, the DOJ role is going to look a lot better under those \ncircumstances.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that another particular portion of this \nlegislation that says a local telephone company can buy a local cable \ncompany, we cannot allow that in the local area, because then you are \nonly going to get one line to 75 percent of the homes.\n  So I hope as we go through this thing colleagues will see that there \nis an intent with this legislation to produce a competitive environment \nabout which, if we do it, the citizens we represent will say this did \nwork; we are glad you provided that for us.\n  It is not completely unregulated. It is not completely unfettered \ncompetition. The structure here that we are trying to produce allows \ncompetition to satisfy not just a public interest that we understand is \nstill present but also a consumer interest.\n  So once again I understand very much the concern raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky and perhaps there is some \naccommodation that can be made in the area of a study. I do not know. I \ncertainly would not necessarily object to that, if the distinguished \nSenator from Maine could work it out. But I think we have to really \nmake sure we understand that if competition is something we are going \nto use to reduce prices and increase quality, then we have to turn back \nsome folks who are going to be coming to us, and I really think the \ntoughest one of all is going to be the Department of Justice role. And \nI understand people are digging in on it, but I hope you do not dig in \ntoo much because you are the one who is going to have to live by this \nvote. You are the one who is going to have to explain whether this \nworks or not.\n  I would not be on the floor all day today and last night not feeling \nvery strongly as I do. Unless we get this thing right, we are going to \nlive to regret it.\n[[Page S7999]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. After this amendment passes, how long does the Senator \nthink it would take the companies to go to China and have these boxes \nmade for practically nothing and come back over here and flood the area \nwith them?\n  Mr. KERREY. There is no question the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is raising a very legitimate concern. When we lift the \nrestrictions on manufacturing in general, which we are doing in here--\nand we heard earlier the distinguished Senator from Arizona coming down \nand saying that we finally got out of this domestic content stuff in \nthere. That was there out of a concern we try to keep some of this \nmanufacturing business in the United States. There is no question that \nis a legitimate concern.\n  Mr. FORD. Not only, would I say to my friend, is my concern for the \nsmall cable operator. I would encourage those who are promoting this \namendment to give us an opportunity to study it. All of a sudden we get \nthis amendment out on the floor and people have an opportunity maybe to \nstudy it for a short period of time. Competition is great, but \ncompetition putting out a lot of cable operators, small entrepreneurs \nstruggling for a long time, does not set very well with me, and I am \nsure it does not set very well with the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am not the sponsor of the amendment. The distinguished \nSenator from Maine is. However, he would decide in that regard. I \ncertainly would have no objection to what the Senator proposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchison and Senator Leahy be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I will respond briefly to the comments of \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  He mentioned that he is from a rural State. So am I. I do not know \nwhat the population of his State is, but we have little over 1 million \npeople in the State of Maine. I used to be the mayor of the third \nlargest city in Maine--38,000 people. So we have a rural population in \nmy State as well.\n  I doubt very much whether there are many States--no matter how \nrural--that do not have a Radio Shack or a Wal-Mart or a Sam's or some \nother major type of outlet in their States. That really is not the \nissue. If you live in a rural area and you do not have a Wal-Mart, \nSam's, Circuit City, or Radio Shack, what you do is just keep renting \nyour box from your cable company.\n  That is all you have to do. You have a choice. You do not have to buy \nanything. You can continue to pay the rent for the box. Your small \ncable company rents the box to you, and you continue to pay the rent. \nIf you get unhappy with it, you may decide you want to make the trip 12 \nmiles to buy another converter box.\n  What I am saying is consumers cannot take that signal of the cable \ncompany and steal that signal by virtue of having access to the box. \nThat was the purpose of having the private sector develop a standard \nwhereby cable operators protect their signal.\n  What the FCC does is turn to the private sector, just as they did \nwith the phone jack. The standard for the telephone jack was developed \nby the private industry.\n  That is what we are talking about here. If you are talking about \ntheft, what do we tell Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, or IBM or any of the \nother major computer developers and manufacturers today? You know \nsomething, we have a big problem--hacking. We have hackers all over the \ncountry, all over the world. They can get into the computers at the \nPentagon.\n  The Senator from South Carolina knows about this. All the people who \nare here, the Senator from Kentucky and all of you, have had access to \ninformation. They can gain access to the computers in the Pentagon.\n  What do we do? Shut down the computers? We said, ``No, let's do \nbetter. We have to develop better standards for protecting the signals, \nprotecting the technology.'' That is what is going on in the private \nsector today. We all have been briefed on what is going on in the \nprivate sector, the kind of standards designed to prevent hackers from \ngetting access.\n  What is the largest growing market today? The direct satellite \ntelevision. Do you think people are putting millions or billions of \ndollars into developing direct satellite television if they are worried \nthat they cannot protect their signals?\n  That is what is going on. The industry will develop the equipment to \nprotect the signals. Why are you going to give cable companies, not \nmom-and-pop cable companies, major cable companies the opportunity to \nrun a monopoly? For the small rural State that may have only one cable \ncompany and no marts where consumers can go to purchase a set-top box, \nthere will be no problem. Consumers will just keep renting that same \nbox.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from South Dakota said that what we really \nhave to do is jawbone the industry. The difficulty is the jawbone is \nnot connected to the hip bone. They are not walking, they are not \nrunning, they are not doing anything.\n  What they are doing is holding on to a monopoly, and they are saying, \n``Take our box or don't get any signal, period.'' What we are saying is \nhere is an opportunity to put competition into the business so that \npeople have a choice with lower prices and the cable company still \nprotects its signal.\n  Mr. President, that is why the Consumer Federation of America and the \nConsumers Union endorse this particular amendment. It is why ITI \nsupports the amendment. They also support it because they see this as \nan opportunity to get more competition in the field that we are \nsupposed to be trying to get competition in--telecommunications.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Kentucky, I represent a small \nState, too. I have small cable companies. They are not particularly \nconcerned they are going to be put out of business. Their signal is \nprotected--maybe not well enough from somebody stealing the boxes. But \nthe private sector will develop a standard to protect the signals.\n  The FCC can adopt the standard, as they have with the telephone jack, \nto allow any individual to go into any store--rural, urban, big mall, \nlittle shop--to buy a telephone, to buy a VCR, to buy a computer, to \nbuy an organizer. A standard ought to apply to the set-top box as well. \nThat is what this amendment is designed to do, to allow the private \nsector to get into the business of lowering the prices for consumers so \nthey do not have the consumer at the mercy of the cable operator \nsaying, ``Take this box or else you get no signal. Rent this box or \nrent this telephone; you can't buy your own.''\n  What we are saying is let us give the consumer a choice to buy a set-\ntop box or rent one, whether you live in an urban or rural State. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we have approximately 15 minutes until \nthe next rollcall vote. I believe all speakers have concluded. I urge \nSenators who wish to make statements on the bill to come to the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Maine \nanswer a question for me, just one?\n  Mr. COHEN. If I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I yield time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota yields time to \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Am I correct in that if the television set is cable ready, \nyou do not need the box?\n  Mr. COHEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. So most television sets are becoming cable ready. They may \nnot go up to 98--they may be 60-some-odd, most of them. So, \ntechnically, the box is not used on a cable-ready television.\n  Mr. COHEN. Right. Many, many homes, as you know, in the rural areas \ndo not necessarily have the cable-ready type of television.\n[[Page S8000]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. As I recall, and the Senator might agree with me, we would \nallow only one charge under the cable bill, no matter how many TV sets \nyou might have in your home. They used to charge you for each one, now \nthey charge for one.\n  Mr. COHEN. I correct myself. You may still need a set-top box, even \nthough you have a cable-ready television set. That is what happened in \nsouthern Maine recently where a major company as a matter of fact, \nsaid, ``This box you have to rent. Even though you are currently \ngetting our signal, this is something we are going to now prepare for \nthe future in terms of interactive television and you must now rent \nthis box, in order to get the signal you were getting previously \nthrough your television sets.''\n  Mr. FORD. I wanted to clear up one thing with my friend from Maine. \nTime Warner withdrew that, and they no longer do that.\n  Mr. COHEN. They withdrew it only after great protest was raised, \nprecisely the problem when you have a company who can come in and say, \n``The signal you are getting now you have to pay more for it. Now it is \nroughly $3 more and you are going to get just precisely the same thing \nyou were getting before.''\n  Mr. FORD. That is no longer being done.\n  Mr. COHEN. It does not prevent any other company in any other State \nfrom doing precisely the same thing.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that, Mr. President, and I say to my friend, \nwith cable ready, I do not believe you need the box. I think he agrees \nwith me that basically that is true.\n  Mr. COHEN. No, because the--\n  Mr. FORD. I am not sure the cable company can still scramble on a \ncable-ready. You cannot get HBO--it is scrambled--unless you pay for it \nand then they release that. The box is almost a moot question in some \nrespects. But I still have the same concern I had earlier about the \nsmall cable operator.\n  You have a rural State; I have a rural State. I remember the \nsatellite dishes we put up, about $3,000 apiece, and then you had to go \nto the cable company and get it turned on. There are a lot of things \ngoing on. But progress has been made.\n  Now FCC is not going to help build anything. They are not going to \nmandate anything, I understand, but you are going to set standards. I \nagree with the chairman, when you set standards, you limit the \ntechnology in a great many places, because as long as they meet the \nstandards, they do not have to be competitive.\n  We have 8 or 9 minutes we can have some debate with.\n   But it is awfully hard for me to agree that the box is a problem, \nexcept in cases where the television set is not cable-ready. I believe \nwhat the Senator from North Carolina said a few minutes ago--it is \nsetting up for a lot of theft as it relates to intellectual property.\n\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated. But better than that, I wish \nthe Senator from Maine would let us study it and convince us and be \nsure when he comes forward with this, that we all understand it. It \ncould be a 3-month study, 6-month study, a 1-year study, or whatever it \nmight be, so that we can come back and that study will be available, \nand then we can go forward with legislation and we can probably give \nbetter instructions to the FCC.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator for raising the issue. It highlights \nthe nature of the problem whereby one company can suddenly come in and \ndecide it wants to give you a different type of service and you must \nrent this box in order to get what you are already paying for. Sure, \nthere was an outcry, an outrage expressed by consumers. They were told \nto relax, this is for the future. We are preparing you for interactive \ntelevision. They got interactive alright with the consuming public, and \nthey were forced to take it down.\n  The FCC is not in the business to try and stifle developments. As a \nmatter of fact, can we argue today that as a result of the standards \ndeveloped by the private sector and incorporated by the FCC, that \ntechnology has been stifled in the telephone industry? I do not think \nso.\n  We are seeing tremendous progress being made. I point out to the \nSenator from Kentucky that while some people might get hurt, a whole \nlot of people get helped when you make progress. We are trying to help \nmillions of people in this country acquire the technology cheaper and \nwith greater choice, and hopefully with greater quality. That is the \npurpose of the amendment. So the telephone industry is a good example \nof what can take place with the set-top box market.\n  I might point out that on page three of the amendment, it indicates, \n``Such regulations shall take into account the needs of owners and \ndistributors of video programming and information services to ensure \nsystem and signal security and prevent theft of the programming or \nservices; and, secondly, the need to ensure the further deployment of \nnew technology relating to converter boxes.''\n  I say to those who are arguing that this is being raised to stifle \ntechnology, it is just the opposite. Those against this amendment want \nto stifle competition. Those who vote for this amendment will vote for \nthe Consumer Federation of America and the Consumers Union.\n  When the vote comes at 7:30, those people here that are concerned \nabout getting more choice to the public, getting better quality, and \ngetting more competition will vote to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, just before our time expires, I want to \nindicate that this amendment certainly is not a partisan issue, as you \ncan see from the debate that has taken place, with the Senator from \nNebraska joining the Senator from Maine, and others who have expressed \nsupport for this amendment.\n  I also point out that in the other body, Congressman Bliley, the \nchairman of the House Commerce Committee, and also Congressman Markey, \nthe ranking member on the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, have \nendorsed the legislation and, in fact, have reported it out of the \ncommittee. So the legislation is bipartisan in the House. I hope the \nbipartisan support for this amendment will be reflected in the vote \nhere this evening.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, an up or down vote has been agreed to.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is there a time agreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not yet, no.\n  Mr. DOLE. Would there be a possibility of having a time agreement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would not agree to a time agreement at this point. This \nis one of these major issues on this bill. I think that we have an \namendment in the second degree. I think this will have to be explored \nat some length.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Could we agree to debate it tonight and vote first \nthing tomorrow?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would not agree to that time agreement.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my colleague will yield, if we could debate all this \nevening, and have a vote at 9 in the morning, would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point is, I do not want to agree to a time agreement \non these issues. We have two amendments on the Department of Justice's \nrole here. This is I think one of the central issues in this bill. If \nyou are suggesting that we ought to now, in the next few hours, debate \nwhen a number of Members will probably not be here and have a vote in \nthe morning, I do not think that there is an urgency on this bill to \nmove to a vote on one of the central issues in this bill by 9 o'clock \nin the morning. So I would not agree to a time agreement at this point.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my colleague will yield, we could debate until \nmidnight or beyond, and Members who wish to speak could speak tonight \nand vote at 9 in the morning. Everybody could speak who wants to speak \nthis evening.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would respond that I do not at this point propose to \naccept a time agreement. I think what we ought to do is have the debate \nand see [[Page S8002]] which of our colleagues wish to weigh in on \nthese issues. This is, as I said, one of the central issues in this \nbill. I think at least from my observations there are many Members on \nboth sides who will want to be heard, and many of them want to be heard \nat some length on these two amendments. I think it is premature to be \nseeking a time agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield? But we are prepared to debate it at \nsome length tonight; is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. There will be no more votes tonight. We will try to see \nwhat happens in the next couple of hours. It is a very important \namendment, and it is central to the debate. I do not have any quarrel \nwith the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota nor the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I am not trying to crowd anyone. I want my other \ncolleagues to know what they can expect.\n  So I think it is safe to say, if it is all right with the Democratic \nleader, there will be no more votes tonight. We will take another look \nat it at 10 o'clock, 11, whatever, whoever is still here.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as Members know, I offered the amendment \nand the amendment has been second-degreed by an amendment offered by \nSenator Thurmond, and we will, I expect, debate the merits of both \namendments at this point.\n  As I indicated to the majority leader, this is, I think, one of the \ncentral issues in the telecommunications bill that the Senate must \nconsider.\n  When I spoke this afternoon on this legislation, I talked about the \nbreathtaking changes in our country especially in the area of \ntelecommunications, technology, the building of the information \nsuperhighway. I also talked about what telecommunications technology \nmeans to the people in this country and our future.\n  I must say that the people in the private sector in our country have \nbeen investing money, and taking risks. I commend them for that. The \nrisk-taking entrepreneurs, I think have brought enormous fruits of \naccomplishment to our country. Their advances in technology will \nimprove life in our country in many, many ways. It creates jobs; it \nprovides entertainment. It does many, many things that are important \nfor our country.\n  The question of how we develop the information superhighway, who \nbenefits from it and what are the rules in a competitive economy we are \nnow confronting.\n  The industry, dealing with 1930's laws that were originally \nestablished in telecommunications, has been out developing its own \ncourse largely because there have not been guidelines established by \nCongress. The Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from South \nCarolina now bring to the floor a piece of legislation that says let us \nupdate the 1930's laws and let us talk about the guidelines, what are \nthe conditions of competition. And this legislation, I think, has a lot \nto commend it to the Members of the Senate.\n  So I have supported the legislation out of the Commerce Committee but \nhave indicated that I feel there are some problems with the \nlegislation, one of which is the role of the Justice Department in \nestablishing the criteria for when competition exists with respect to \nlocal service carriers and when those local service carriers, namely, \nthe regional Bells, can go out and engage in long distance competition.\n  The Commerce Committee passed a telecommunications bill last year, \nand a bill was passed by the entire House of Representatives, that \nincluded provisions with respect to the tests that should be met before \nthe Bell systems should go out and begin to compete in long distance.\n  That test was very simple. It's called the VIII(c) test. VIII(c) \nprovides a test for the Department of Justice to perform its assigned \nand accustomed role to determine when there is competition in local \nservice and when then the Bell systems will be allowed to go out and \ncompete in long distance service.\n  VIII(c) existed last year in the telecommunications bill that was \npassed in the House and the Senate Commerce Committee. All of a sudden \nthis year that test vanishes. That's why I propose in my amendment to \nestablish the VII(c) test.\n  Some say, gee, that is a radical requirement, an VIII(c) test for the \nJustice Department. So radical, it is exactly what the House passed \nlast year, so radical it is exactly what the Senate Commerce Committee \npassed last year. It is not radical at all. It is exactly what the \nJustice Department role should be in evaluating when sufficient \ncompetition exists in the local exchanges so that the Bell systems will \nbe free to engage in long distance services.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of the experience we have had with \nairline deregulation. When we deregulated the airlines we said that the \nrole of determining when sufficient competition existed and whether \nmergers should be allowed will be assumed by the Department of \nTransportation. The Department of Justice shall have a consultative \nrole.\n  What has happened as a result of that? Well, you have all seen what \nhas happened. We have seen the large airlines in this country grow \nlarger through acquisition and merger. They have bought up the regional \ncarriers. So now we have fewer airlines and bigger airlines; in other \nwords, less competition.\n  It is interesting to me that when we have seen some of these mergers \nproposed, the Department of Transportation consults with the Department \nof Justice, and the Department of Justice says, well, we do not think \nthis merger would be in the country's interest from a competitive \nstandpoint; we think it would diminish competition. And then the \nDepartment of Transportation says, we do not care about that; we are \ngoing to allow the merger to occur anyway.\n  That is a sample of what happens when you take the Justice Department \nout of the decision making in these areas.\n  Now, we have, over a long period of time in this country, established \nthe Justice Department as the referee in the issue of where and when \nsufficient competition exists with respect to questions like this. But \nthis bill comes to the floor and says well, now, let us see if we can \ndo something different. Let us take the Justice Department; let us clip \ntheir wings. Let us defang the Justice Department with respect to its \nability to make judgments about what is in the public interest and what \nis not in the public interest in this particular area.\n  I listened intently about the subject of competition. Members of the \nSenate have come to the floor of the Senate and talked about the market \nsystem and competition. I think the market system is a wonderful thing, \nand it has brought this country enormous benefits. It is the way this \ncountry has become as strong as it is--market system, free and open \ncompetition.\n  But if you believe in the market system and competition, then you \nhave to, in my judgment, stand up for these kinds of issues. You have \nto stand up for the role of the Justice Department to investigate and \nevaluate what represents antitrust, what kinds of conditions must we \ninsist upon to ensure competition, because if you are not standing up \nfor those kinds of things that ensure competition, in my judgment you \nare no friend of the marketplace. You are no friend of free markets. \nThat is the reason I offer this amendment to the Senate tonight.\n  This amendment utilizes the standard that is found in section VIII(c) \nof the modified final judgment with which most of us are familiar. This \namendment requires the Bell systems to show there is no substantial \npossibility that it could use its monopoly power to impede competition \nin the long distance market.\n  The standard I propose is well understood. It has been applied by the \nDepartment of Justice and the courts since 1982. The standard protects \ncompetition in long distance services by limiting the entry to cases \nwhere local monopolies have ceased to exist or the potential for abuse \nof power in local markets is absent.\n  Now, under the bill as reported, as I have indicated, the Bell \nsystems need only apply to the FCC to enter long distance services, and \nthe FCC would use what is called a public interest standard and \ndetermine that the Bell systems have completed the competitive \nchecklist. They might ask the Justice Department in a consultative role \n[[Page S8003]] but it will not matter, because the FCC will make the \njudgment.\n  Well, the problem with that is this. The FCC is a regulatory agency \nand the Department of Justice is the agency that has had over time and \ndoes have the capability of evaluating the issue of competition.\n  The Department of Justice is the agency with the expertise in \nprotecting and promoting competition in telecommunications markets. It \nwas the Department of Justice that investigated and sued to break up \nthe Bell system monopoly, which resulted in making the long distance \nand manufacturing markets competitive.\n  All of us understand what has resulted from that. Those areas of the \ntelecommunications system that are competitive, namely, now long \ndistance and manufacturing--and let me say, especially long distance--\nthose areas have produced enormous rewards for the consumers: lower \nprices and substantial changes in opportunity for choice. You can go to \nany one of hundreds of long distance carriers these days and find a \nwide variety of choices at competitive prices, prices much, much lower \nthan consumers paid when the old monopoly system existed.\n  I have indicated that we have seen what has happened with respect to \nanother deregulation model, airlines. When the airline deregulation \noccurred and the opportunity to judge the competitiveness of certain \nfuture structures was given not to the Department of Justice, but \ninstead to the Department of Transportation, we understand what \nhappened. The consumer, in my judgment, has been shortchanged. Mergers \nthat should not have been allowed which the Department of Justice said \nwere anti-competitive were allowed by the Department of Transportation.\n  If we do not change this bill, if we do not impose this VIII(c) test, \nin my judgment, we will be left in the same position with respect to \ntelecommunications as we have been with the airlines, and it will not \nbe a friendly position for the American consumer.\n  The fact is the Department of Justice has promoted competition in the \ntelecommunications industry under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. The AT investigation began under the Nixon \nadministration. The suit was filed under the Ford administration. It \nwas pursued through the Carter administration, and it was settled \nduring the Reagan administration. On a bipartisan basis, the Department \nof Justice, I think, has stood up for the interests of the American \nconsumer, attempting to require and impose a competitive test.\n  You have heard in discussion on the floor of the Senate that the \nbreakup of the Bell system meant that long distance telephone rates \nhave dropped 66 percent and the long distance competitors have \nconstructed four nationwide fiber optic networks in this country, which \nis now the backbone of the information superhighway.\n  If we do not include in the telecommunications legislation the kind \nof amendment I am proposing, the role that would traditionally have \nbeen the role for the Department of Justice will become the burden of \nenforcement for the FCC. The FCC, I think, clearly is ill-equipped to \nadequately serve that function.\n  In 1987, the GAO reported that at its existing staff level, the FCC \nwould be able to audit carrier cost allocations in order to protect \nratepayers from cross-subsidization only once every 16 years, and then \nonly on the major carriers.\n  A 1993 GAO report found that as of 1992, the FCC staff of 14 auditors \ncould, on average, cover the highest priority audit areas once every 11 \nyears and all audit areas once every 18 years. The GAO concluded in \nthat February 1993 report that at the current staffing level, the FCC \ncannot, in the GAO's words, ``provide positive assurance that \nratepayers are protected from cross-subsidization.''\n  The only way, in my judgment, to assure that true competition is \nexisting at the local level--and when that exists we free the Bell \nsystems to compete in the long distance area--but the only way to \nassure that true competition exists is to look at the actual \nmarketplace facts, and the place to do that, the proper place to do \nthat is in the Department of Justice.\n  I mentioned earlier that last year the very test that I am proposing \ntoday for this legislation was in the bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. That bill passed in the U.S. House with 420 votes. The \nSenate Commerce Committee passed legislation by an 18-to-2 vote, and it \nincluded what I now propose we add to this legislation. So it will be \ninteresting to hear the cries of those who come to the floor and say, \n``Gee, this is way out of bounds, this is really radical stuff you are \nproposing.'' I want to hear the wailing of those who oppose this and \nask them if what the House of Representatives did with 420 votes last \nyear or what the Senate Commerce Committee did by an 18-to-2 vote last \nyear was truly radical, or has somehow the public interest standard \nchanged in 12 months? And if so, what is that change? Did the election \nlast year tell us that the Department of Justice had to have its wings \nclipped with the question of whether or not there is competition before \nwe decide to change the circumstances under which the Bell systems can \ncompete for long distance? I do not think so.\n  I think the American people expect and the American people would \nrequire us to believe that competition is fair competition and that \ntrue competition exists before we decide to allow the Bell systems to \nget involved in long distance and potentially create monopolistic \nconditions in a segment of the industry that is now highly competitive.\n  I want to read some comments about last year's test, which I now \npropose in this year's bill. James Cullen, the president of Bell \nAtlantic, March 8, 1994, wrote a letter to Senator Hollings, and he \nsaid this about the standard I am now proposing:\n\n       The section VIII(c) standard is the correct test for \n     whether a Bell company should be allowed to provide \n     interstate long distance services. Under this test, the \n     restrictions imposed on a Bell company shall be removed upon \n     a showing by the petitioning BOC that there is no substantial \n     possibility that it could use its monopoly power to impede \n     competition in the market it seeks to enter.\n\n  Cullen also confirmed that the VIII(c) test was the appropriate test \nwhen he testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on May 12, 1994.\n  The CEO of Pacific Telesis, Sam Guinn, wrote to Senator Hollings on \nMarch 16, 1994, stating this:\n\n       The VIII(c) test--the ability to impede competition in the \n     market we're entering, the long distance market--is the \n     appropriate test. A test based on local competition just \n     won't work.\n\n  William Weiss, then chairman and CEO of Ameritech, wrote to Senator \nDanforth saying:\n\n       An entry test, based on antitrust principles, must focus on \n     conditions in the market one is seeking to enter. The \n     modified final judgment (MFJ) provides just such a test. * * \n     * The MFJ provides that the line of business restrictions, \n     including the long distance prohibition, shall be removed \n     when there is no substantial possibility that a regional \n     company could use its monopoly power to impede competition in \n     the market it seeks to enter.\n\n  Again, that is from William Weiss, then chairman and CEO of \nAmeritech.\n  In fact, Ameritech recently reached an agreement with the Justice \nDepartment to conduct a trial to offer long distance service from Grand \nRapids, MI, and Chicago, IL. Under that trial, the Department of \nJustice would have to evaluate competitive conditions in the \nmarketplace to determine that those conditions ensure there is ``no \nsubstantial possibility that commencement of the experiment could \nimpede competition in interLATA service.''\n  That trial not only uses the VIII(c) standard, but it also requires \nthat actual competition exists prior to Ameritech offering long \ndistance services.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with Anne Bingaman at the Justice \nDepartment, who is in charge of the Antitrust Division, about this very \nagreement. It is interesting that this agreement uses the VIII(c) test.\n  There are plenty of claims and there is a great deal of discussion on \nthe floor about this issue, largely because it is an issue that is very \ncontroversial at this point.\n  We have a bill before us that deals with literally hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of revenue to very important segments of our \neconomy, and the industry's breakdown between the long distance \nindustry, the local service carriers. I understand why they would \n[[Page S8004]] use some of these things in their own self-interest. I \nam not interested in their self-interest at this point. I want the \ntelecommunications industry to do well, and I want them to do well \nespecially for our country.\n  My interest, however, on the floor of the Senate is the public \ninterest. The question is not what benefits them. The question is what \nbenefits the American citizens in the longrun? What benefits our \ncountry? What advances our country's economic interests, our public \ninterests?\n  I think if we evaluate that, we will understand that imposing a \nrequirement that competition exist at the local level before we \nunharness in the modified final judgment the Bell systems to go compete \nin the long distance system is in the best public interest. I know some \nmake the case that is not necessary; the FCC can do it. Some make the \ncase that the Justice Department role should not be such a strong role. \nBut they do that, in my judgment, because they represent--or they argue \nthe interests of an $80 to $100 billion enterprise out there, the \nenterprise of local service carriers who want to do something and are \nprevented from doing it now and who want to be able to unharness \nthemselves with the least possible difficulties. I do not want to put \nup roadblocks. If they want to compete in long distance, they have \nevery right to do it, as long as they are allowing competition in the \nlocal exchanges.\n  The question is, how can you demonstrate that? All of us understand \nthat it is easy to decide to say you are now allowing local \ncompetition. It is easy to create conditions in which you try to \ndemonstrate that is the case, but even as you create conditions to \ndemonstrate that is the case, you can suddenly create other conditions \nto make it more difficult. Everyone understands that. That is the \ndanger and the dilemma.\n  We are interested in this 8(c) test, in true competition. We are not \ninterested in theory. We are interested in when true competition exists \nin the local exchanges, because when it exists, then there is no \ndisagreement on the floor of the Senate about whether the Bells ought \nto be able to involve themselves in long distance service. Of course, \nthey should.\n  But the question is when it exists, and who should be the arbiter of \nthat? Those who argue for a weaker standard in the Department of \nJustice, in my judgment, are making a very serious mistake. It is a \nmistake that was not made in the last session by the House of \nRepresentatives or by the Commerce Department. But something has \nchanged. I do not think it is the facts. I think the political dynamic \nhas changed in some way, and I hope that the public interest need \nprevails on this issue.\n  The public interest need, in my judgment, is to have the U.S. Justice \nDepartment play the role they have always played on behalf of the \nAmerican citizens--to make sure there is robust, healthy competition. \nWhen it exists, then we unleash the opportunities for those who now \nhave monopolistic power to get involved in the long distance service. \nBut until it exists, they should not be allowed to do so. Until the \nJustice Department--the Department with the experience, background and \nknowledge to make that judgment--is given full opportunity to do so by \namending this portion of the bill, I think the American people will be \nshortchanged. I hope that we will, at this point, reject the second-\ndegree amendment when we get around to voting and that we will adopt \nthe 8(c) standard. I expect there will be a lot of discussion between \nus in the intervening hours today, tomorrow, Monday, or whenever we \nvote on these issues. I think this will be one of the most important \nissues that we resolve on the floor of the Senate as we seek to advance \nlegislation establishing new rules for the 1990's and into the next \ncentury in the telecommunications industry.\n  Let me finish with one additional statement about this issue, and \nthen I want to speak to other areas at some point later in the debate. \nThere is ample discussion on the floor of the Senate about the fruits \nof competition in these areas. I come from a part of the country where \nI swear that there will not be much competition. A county of roughly \n3,000 people is not going to attract a lot of competitors. A hometown \nof 300 people is not going to be the cause of fierce competition \nbetween eight carriers who want to serve these 800 people. That is not \nthe way competition works. Competition exists in a free market to \nmaximize profits in areas where you yield maximum returns. That is in \nthe affluent neighborhoods of America, in the population centers of \nAmerica. That was true under deregulation of the airlines, and it will \nbe true under deregulation of the telecommunications industry.\n  That is why another part of this bill that I care very much about are \nthe protections in this bill for rural America--not protections against \ncompetition, but protections to make sure we have the same benefits and \nopportunities in rural America for the build-out of the infrastructure \nof this telecommunications revolution, as we will see in Chicago, Los \nAngeles, New York, and elsewhere. Our citizens are no less worthy of \nthe opportunities that are brought to them by this industry than \ncitizens who live in the biggest cities of our country.\n  I think once we establish the public interest tests of this \nlegislation, we must do it not only with respect to the role of the \nDepartment of Justice, which is important, but also with respect to the \nissue of universal service and with respect to the issue of \nconcentration of ownership in broadcast facilities. I think if we \naddress those properly, and if we do our jobs the way I think people \nexpect us to, I think we will have produced a good bill--good for this \ncountry, good for all citizens of this country regardless of where they \nlive.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators D'Amato and \nDeWine to offer an amendment to ensure that fundamental antitrust \nprinciples will be applied by the Antitrust Division of the Department \nof Justice to determine when the Bell Operating Companies should be \nallowed into the long distance and manufacturing markets. My amendment \nestablishes a legal standard to be applied by the Justice Department \nbased on section 7 of the Clayton Act, which the Congress passed in \n1914. Under this standard, the Bell companies would be permitted to \nenter into long distance and manufacturing unless the effect of entry \nwould ``substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a \nmonopoly.''\n  Section 7 of the Clayton Act is the well-established and well-known \nstandard used nationwide to determine whether mergers and joint \nventures--which affect the economic course of our country--are pro-\ncompetitive or not. Indeed, we rely on this Clayton section 7 standard \neven in areas of national security, as in the recent merger of defense \ngiants Lockheed and Martin Marietta. In the same way, this antitrust \nstandard should be used to determine whether competition and consumers \nwill be served by Bell company entry into new markets.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust, Business Rights, \nand Competition Subcommittee, I firmly believe that we must rely on the \nlongstanding bipartisan principles of antitrust law in order to move as \nquickly as possible toward competition in all segments of the \ntelecommunications industry, and away from regulation. Applying \nantitrust concepts is vital to ensure that free market principles will \nwork to spur competition and reduce government involvement in the \nindustry.\n  The standard for permitting Bell company expansion from their local \nexchange markets into long distance and manufacturing may well be the \nmost important antitrust question in this legislation. This issue \nresults from the 1982 antitrust settlement which divided the single \nBell system monopoly into the seven regional Bell companies, and \nlimited the lines of business they could pursue. The debate centers on \nwhether those seven Bell companies should be allowed into long distance \nand manufacturing markets while maintaining their current market \nposition in local telephone service. The concern is that despite \ndetailed rules, the Bell companies may be able to use their market \npower in local telephone service to harm competition in the long \ndistance [[Page S8005]] and manufacturing markets where competition \nalready exists.\n  It is generally desirable to have as many competitors as possible in \neach market. I want to make clear that the Bell companies certainly \nshould be allowed to enter long distance and manufacturing under \nappropriate circumstances. The question is merely when. But the Bell \ncompanies should not be allowed to enter without consideration of \nwhether their entry will harm competition. S. 652 does not require \nantitrust analysis on this point and provides only a minimal consulting \nrole for the Department of Justice.\n  As drafted, S. 652 allows the Bell companies to get into the long \ndistance and manufacturing markets if they meet a checklist and the FCC \nfinds that entry is in the public interest. The checklist is intended \nto permit other companies to enter the Bell companies' local exchange \nmarkets and compete with the Bells. But the checklist does not require \nthat anyone actually compete\n with the local exchange monopoly. Moreover, S. 652 appears to require \nonly a single interconnection agreement between a Bell company and a \npotential competitor--no matter how small--before the Bell company can \nseek to enter long distance.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not confident that this checklist will be \nadequate to take the place of thorough antitrust analysis. It would be \nunwise to ignore antitrust analysis. It would be unwise to ignore \nantitrust principles and risk harm to the substantial competition which \nhas developed in telecommunications markets over the last dozen years \nthrough the application of antitrust principles.\n  The Clayton section 7 standard in my amendment is much more moderate \nthan the so-called ``8-C'' test from the Modification of Final Judgment \nwhich broke up the Bell system monopoly. It is my belief, as one long \ninterested in competition and our antitrust laws, that the language \nfrom Clayton section 7 is the best standard to employ. This standard \npermits the flexible analysis needed to determine when the Bell \ncompanies should be allowed to enter into long distance and \nmanufacturing markets.\n  The Clayton section 7 test would permit Bell company entry into long \ndistance and manufacturing unless entry would substantially lessen \ncompetition. Clearly, we should not permit entry which would not only \nlessen competition, but would substantially lessen competition. The \nClayton section 7 standard is well understood and can be fairly applied \nto ensure ongoing competition in telecommunication markets. The Clayton \nstandard has been applied in each merger in the telecommunication \nindustry, including several large recent ones. This standard provides \nthe proper incentives to the Bell companies to encourage them to open \nlocal monopolies to competition, rather than meeting the minimal \nrequirements of a checklist.\n  Let me make very clear that this Clayton section 7 standard does not \nnecessarily require the Bell companies to lose any market share or even \nface actual competition in their local exchange markets. The Bell \ncompanies often assert that their entry into long distance and \nmanufacturing would benefit competition. If this is true, they could \nenter those markets promptly under a Clayton section 7 standard, \nbecause competition would not be substantially lessened.\n  Although the Bell companies may not support this standard, it is \nnoteworthy that in the past Bell companies were less critical of the \nmore stringent 8-C test. In fact, there was agreement among Bell \ncompanies concerning the 8-C test in the last Congress when negotiating \nover telecommunications legislation. If the higher standard of the 8-C \ntest was acceptable last year, the familiar Clayton section 7 standard \nshould be considered far more reasonable.\n  If this antitrust analysis is to be undertaken, as I and many other \nMembers believe it should, the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice has the necessary background and expertise to conduct the \nanalysis. The Justice Department has some 50 attorneys and other \nprofessionals with antitrust expertise in the telecommunications area. \nThe Justice Department was responsible for the breakup of the Bell \nsystem monopoly which has resulted in significantly greater \ncompetition, and has been continually involved in the industry since \nthat time.\n  It would be redundant and inefficient to ignore the proven track \nrecord and expertise of the Justice Department and begin to develop \nsuch know-how in another agency. The Federal Communications Commission \ndoes not have expertise in antitrust law, and history shows that it is \nnot desirable to attempt to develop antitrust expertise across a range \nof Federal agencies. For example, it is now recognized that the \nDepartment of\n Transportation did not give adequate weight to antitrust principles \nwhen it conducted its own antitrust analysis of airline mergers. \nAlthough the Justice Department had a consulting role, the \nTransportation Department disregarded the important antitrust expertise \nof the Justice Department, and approved deals which have resulted in \nexcessive concentration in the airline industry, and higher prices for \nconsumers. It is vital that we avoid this mistake here.\n\n  Mr. President, these antitrust issues in the telecommunications \nlegislation affect a huge sector of our economy, and impact every \nconsumer and business in our Nation. The hearing by the Antitrust, \nBusiness Rights, and Competition Subcommittee, which I chaired last \nmonth, confirmed the importance of ensuring that S.  652 embraces \nantitrust principles which are adequate to encourage competition and \nbenefit consumers. These principles have been tested and refined by \nmore than 100 years of antitrust analysis and experience in our Nation.\n  The purpose of the antitrust laws is not to favor one group over \nanother, but to apply objective principles to encourage competition for \nthe benefit of consumers. When antitrust principles are observed, \ncompetition is maximized resulting in lower prices, better services and \nproducts, and more innovation for the benefit of consumers and our \nNation. If antitrust principles are ignored, however, competition is \nlikely to suffer and concentration of market power in a few companies \nmay lead to harm to consumers, less innovation, and the end of our \ncountry's leadership in telecommunications.\n  Finally, I would note that despite the current claims by some, this \nimportant issue of Bell company entry generally has not been partisan \nin the past. In addition to the concerns of Democratic Members and the \ncurrent Administration, Republicans have long been champions of \napplying our antitrust laws in the telecommunications field. In fact, \nthe break up of the Bell system monopoly resulted from the antitrust \ninvestigation by the Justice Department begun during the Nixon \nAdministration, from antitrust litigation brought by the Justice \nDepartment during the Ford Administration, and from the settlement by \nAssistant Attorney General William Baxter during the Reagan \nAdministration. In fact, Mr. Baxter wrote to me last month on this \nsubject, encouraging an ongoing role for the Department of Justice in \ndetermining when the Bell companies should get into other lines of \nbusiness, which I included in my Antitrust Subcommittee hearing record. \nThe current antitrust head at the Department of Justice asserts that \nsame position.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I think we have come to a key part of \nthis debate. As I see it, we are trying to decide whether or not the \nDepartment of Justice should have a regulatory role in this whole \nmatter.\n  Under the bill brought to the floor by Senator Hollings and me and \nothers, and by the Commerce Committee, there is a checklist test at the \nFCC and there is a public interest test at the FCC. There is also \nrequired that the Attorney General be consulted. And he might make a \nrecommendation based on the 8(c) test, or he might make a \nrecommendation based on the Clayton Act, or he might make a \nrecommendation on public interest standards.\n  The Justice Department is not supposed to be a regulatory agency. Its \nduties are in the antitrust area. If we adopt either of these \namendments, we are basically continuing to employ about 200 people over \nat Justice who are regulators and not people who interpret antitrust \nlaw. We are making the Department of Justice into a regulatory agency \nwhen it is supposed to be [[Page S8006]] dealing with interpretations \nof antitrust law.\n  What has happened under Judge Greene's order, partially out of \nnecessity, is that the Justice Department began hiring whole legions of \npeople over there to administer the consent decree. For example, the \nAmeritech waiver has been cited. The Ameritech company in the Chicago \narea has been, quite rightly, allowed to do some things by the \nDepartment of Justice under Judge Greene's consent decree. And quite \nappropriately, because Congress has not acted.\n  That is one thing about this bill. We are at least trying to get \nCongress to do this instead of the courts. But if we allow the Justice \nDepartment to begin regulating, it will be like in the Ameritech \ndecision. I am not saying the Ameritech decision is wrong, but it shows \nhow the Justice Department likes to use its people as regulators.\n  That Ameritech waiver, the proposed waiver, creates a highly \nregulatory process under which Ameritech may be able to obtain \ntemporary interLATA authority, but only on a resale basis and only for \ncalls originating from the Illinois portion of the Chicago LATA and the \nGrand Rapids LATA in Michigan, areas that serve only 1.2 percent of the \narea's population.\n  But the point is, the chief regulator in this process is the \nDepartment of Justice, the same Department that has frequently taken \nfrom 3 to 5 years to process waivers under the existing decree. So this \nmeans we are probably adding 3 to 5 years of regulation if we adopt the \namendment by my friend from North Dakota. This is more Government \nregulation. This is supposed to be a deregulatory bill. We are supposed \nto be deregulating here, but we are adding another formal layer of \nregulation.\n  We have already pointed out that the Ameritech decision is \nillustrative of the regulatory function of the Department of Justice. \nAnd they want to keep these people employed over there. They want to \nkeep on being regulators. They want to be something other than what \nthey are constitutionally created to be. After this bill passes, the \nDepartment of Justice will not have to carry out that role. That will \nsave the taxpayers a lot of money; moreover, it will lessen regulation. \nIndeed, I would like someday to see the FCC substantially reduced.\n  But under this amendment we are not only keeping the FCC using both \nthe checklist and the public interest standard, we are also going a \nstep further and saying after they get through we are going to send it \nover to Justice and do the same thing all over again with another set \nof regulators. That will take 3 to 5 years, I do not care how you slice \nit, because that is the way it has been in the past and that is the way \nthe Department of Justice functions. Anything that goes over there, it \nwill take 3 to 5 years to get a decision out and there is ample \nevidence to illustrate that.\n  The point I made about Ameritech is that it shows the Department of \nJustice likes even to write telephone books over there. That is not the \nbusiness they are supposed to be in. They are in the business of \nantitrust and the big picture of law.\n  The Dorgan amendment would give the Department a separate, \nindependent clearance in addition to the FCC's clearance for \ndetermining whether the Bell operating companies have complied with the \nchecklist for opening their networks to their new competitors.\n  Providing this authority to the Justice Department is unprecedented. \nThe Antitrust Division of the Justice Department has never had \ndecisionmaking authority over regulated industries or any industry. \nJustice was given a role under the modified final judgment, the consent \ndecree which governed the breakup of AT One of the key reasons for \npassing telecommunications legislation is once and for all to establish \nnational policy, thus phasing out the MFJ.\n  How is the modified final judgment administered today? The U.S. \ndistrict court retains jurisdiction over those companies that were \nparty to the MFJ. The court then asked the Justice Department Antitrust \nDivision to assume postdecree duties. The Antitrust Division provides \nJudge Harold Greene of the district court with recommendations \nregarding waivers and other matters regarding the administration of the \nMFJ.\n  Does the Antitrust Division have decision authority over the MFJ? No. \nThe U.S. district court, in the person of Judge Greene, has sole \ndecisionmaking authority over the administration of the MFJ. The \nAntitrust Division at Justice essentially acts as Judge Greene's staff \nattorneys. Obviously, those several hundred attorneys in Justice want \nto keep their jobs, and the Justice Department wants to keep that \nbureaucracy going.\n  Let us review the kind of job that has been done there by those \nregulators in the Justice Department. First of all, the Justice \nDepartment has not conducted triennial reviews effectively, or every 3 \nyears, as it is supposed to. When the MFJ was instituted, Justice said \nit would conduct reviews every 3 years, known as the Triennial Review, \nto make recommendations to the court regarding the continued need for \nrestrictions implemented under the MFJ. The Triennial Reviews were to \nprovide parties to the MFJ with a ``benchmark'' by which to gain \nrelief.\n  Since 1982, only one Triennial Review has been conducted.\n  Waiver requests: Justice is slow--very, very slow. Bell operating \ncompanies are required under the MFJ to obtain DOJ review of waiver \nrequests before filing with the district court.\n  In 1984, Justice disposed of 23 waiver requests with the average age \nof waivers pending at Justice being 2 months. In 1994, Justice disposed \nof 10 waiver requests with the average age of the 30 waivers pending at \nDOJ at the end of the year being approximately 30 months. That is, \npeople had to wait 30 months for a decision.\n  Justice review of the waiver requests takes almost as much time for \neach waiver as the time that was intended to elapse between the \nTriennial Reviews, which have not been done. One may think that many of \nthese waiver requests must be controversial because they take so long \nfor Justice to make a decision. This is not the case. In fact, the \ndistrict court has approved about 96 percent of the waiver requests \nfiled before it.\n  So I say we should say no to a coequal Justice role in regulation.\n  The Justice track record in fulfilling its obligations under the MFJ \nis poor. Why would Congress wish to give the Department an \nunprecedented role that they do not have under the existing MFJ?\n  S. 652 gives Justice a role but instead of reporting to Judge Greene \nwith its recommendations, the Justice Department would make its \nrecommendations to the FCC, the proper authority.\n  There is no reason why two federal entities should have independent \nauthority over determining whether the very clear congressional policy \nhas been met.\n\n\n the u.s. department of justice should not control bell co. entry into \n                           new long distance\n\n  The U.S. Department of Justice is asking that it be given a \n``decisionmaking'' role in the process of reviewing applications for \nBell Co. entry into long distance telephone service. A grant of such \nauthority to Justice is unprecedented. It goes far beyond the \nhistorical responsibility of Justice, is a significant expansion of the \nDepartment's current authority under the MFJ; and raises constitutional \nquestions of due process and separation of powers.\n  First, assigning a decisionmaking role to Justice is unprecedented.\n  The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has one \nduty: to enforce the antitrust laws, primarily the Sherman and the \nClayton Acts.\n  It has never had a decisionmaking role in connection with regulated \nindustries. The Department has always been required to initiate a \nlawsuit in the event it concluded that the antitrust laws had been \nviolated. It has no power to disapprove transactions or issue orders on \nits own. While the U.S. district court has used the Department of \nJustice to review requests for waivers of the MFJ, the Department has \nno independent decisionmaking authority. That authority remains with \nthe courts.\n  Second, decisionmaking authority should reside in the agency of \nexpertise. [[Page S8007]] \n  In transportation, energy, financial services, and other regulated \nbusinesses, Congress has delegated decisionmaking authority for \napproval of transactions that could have competitive implications with \nthe agency of expertise, and typically has directed the agency to \nconsider factors broader than simply the impact upon competition in \nmaking its determinations. This approach has worked well. It contrasts \nwith the role Justice seeks with regard to telephony.\n  Third, assigning a decisionmaking role to Justice establishes a \ndangerous precedent that could be expanded to other industries.\n  Telecommunications is not the only industrial sector to have a \nspecific group of Justice Department Antitrust Division lawyers devoted \nto examination of its discrete competitive issues and market structure. \nThe Antitrust Division has a Transportation, Energy and Agriculture \nSection, a Computers and Finance Section, a Foreign Commerce Section, \nand a Professions and Intellectual Property Section. The size of the \nstaff devoted to some of these sections is roughly equivalent to that \ndevoted to telecommunications.\n  If the Department has special expertise in telecommunications such \nthat it should be given a decisionmaking role in the regulatory \nprocess, does it not also have special expertise in other fields as \nwell? Today's computer, financial services, transportation, energy and \ntelecommunications industries are far too complex, and too important to \nour nation's economy, to elevate antitrust policy above all other \nconsiderations in regulatory decisions.\n  Fourth, the Justice Department proposal raises constitutional \nquestions of due process and separation of powers by failing to define \nan appeals process or an appropriate standard of review for agency \ndeterminations.\n  The Justice Department, in requesting a decisionmaking role in \nreviewing Bell Co. applications for entry into long distance telephone \nservice, seeks to assume for itself the role currently performed by \nU.S. District Judge Harold Greene.\n They want to keep on doing things the way they are but they are going \nto replace Judge Greene with themselves, unnecessarily so. It does so \nwithout defining by whom or under what standards its actions should be \nreviewed. Typically, as a prosecutorial law enforcement agency, actions \nby the Department of Justice have largely been free of judicial review. \nIn this case, the Department also seeks a decisionmaking role. As a \ndecisionmaker, would the Antitrust Division's determinations be subject \nto the procedural protections and administrative due process safeguards \nof the Administrative Procedure Act? What does this do to the \nDepartment's ability to function as a prosecutorial agency? Should one \nagency be both prosecutor and tribunal?\n\n  Congress should reject the idea of giving the Justice Department a \ndecisionmaking role in reviewing Bell Co. applications to enter the \nlong distance telephone business. It is bad policy, bad procedure, and \nbad precedent.\n\n\n       doj is the problem, not the entry standard for the rboc's\n\n  The Sherman and Clayton Acts give the Justice Department ample \nauthority to assure the RBOC's comply with the antitrust laws as they \nenter the long-distance business.\n  I think those two acts, the Sherman and Clayton standards, have come \nto be known as very good standards. They are under the Justice \nDepartment's legitimate role.\n  The Justice Department has never had a decisionmaking role in \nconnection with regulated industries, or any other industry. The \ndecisionmaking role should reside in the FCC: the agency with the \nregulatory expertise.\n  The issue centers around the way the Justice Department administers \nits current responsibility under the MFJ and the length of time the \nDepartment takes to reach its decisions, not what, if any, standard \nshould be applied to RBOC entry into the long distance business.\n  The Department has consistently interpreted section VIII C of the MFJ \nto mean there must be actual and demonstrable competition, when in fact \nthe section only requires that the entity entering a market not have \nthe ``substantial possibility that it could use its monopoly power to \nimpede competition.''\n  The Justice Department has been unable to loosen its grip on the \nreins of regulation, nor handle issues in a timely fashion. In 1984 the \naverage age of pending waivers was two months. In 1993, the average age \nof pending waivers was 3 years.\n  The Department of Justice has one duty: to enforce the antitrust \nlaws. It should not be allowed to become the police officer, judge, and \njury for the telecommunications industry.\n  So, Mr. President, in summary and in conclusion, let me say to my \ncolleagues that we have worked out a bipartisan bill in the Commerce \nCommittee. All Democrats voted for it and two Republicans voted \nagainst, and all the other Republicans voted for it in the committee. \nIt is a carefully crafted bill that would be deregulatory yet would \nprotect the public interest and the taxpayers. In that bill we set the \nstandard. We are trying to get everybody into everybody else's \nbusiness. We are trying to break up the economic apartheid. We are \ntrying to encourage small business entry.\n  If we can pass this bill, it will be like the gun going off in the \nOklahoma land rush because investors and consumers and entrepreneurs \nwill have a road map to take us into the wireless age.\n  This is a transitional bill, as I see it. If we add another layer of \nregulation on this bill, if we add the Department of Justice doing the \nsame thing the FCC is doing, then we are merely adding another 3 to 5 \nyears to any decisions. The Justice Department just does not move very \nfast. We would be giving to the Justice Department, which is supposed \nto interpret the Sherman and Clayton Acts, a regulatory role. I know \nthere are about 200 lawyers over there in Justice who have been \ncarrying out Judge Greene's orders. They are Judge Greene's attorneys. \nThat is because Congress failed to act.\n  I am not criticizing Judge Greene. I am not criticizing those \nattorneys. But in S. 652 we have set up a system and a process that is \nvery fair. There is the competitive checklist, and the FCC can use the \npublic interest standard. The public interest issue was voted on today \nin this body. We have tried to work these things out.\n  I know there is a great nervousness between the long distance \ncompanies and the regional Bells. But we have reached a balance. These \namendments would throw that balance off. But worse, they would disserve \nthe public because the public wants lower cost telephones and lower \ncost cable rates. They are getting, in this amendment, more \nregulations, more delays. There would be more delays in developing new \ndevices.\n  The cellular phone was invented in the late fifties. But because of \nGovernment regulation, we did not really see much of them until about \n1985. Then the cellular phones came onto the market without much \nregulation. Now the price is coming down, and more and more people are \nbuying them. Still, it took 40 years because of Government regulation.\n  That is what this amendment is about. This amendment is for more \nGovernment regulation. We need to be deregulators. We need to be \nprocompetitive.\n  This is a very important amendment. I urge that we vote this \namendment down, the underlying amendment, and any second-degree \namendment, because this goes to the very heart of the debate in the \nSenate tonight. It is deregulation. We go on and on with layers of \npeople to approve things going from one agency to another to another to \nanother. We go on and on asking people to wait 3 to 5 years. We have \npeople in the Justice Department who want to oversee the writing of \nyellow pages in telephone books. They are supposed to be interpreting \nthe Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts. That is what the Justice \nDepartment is for. The FCC has another role.\n  I urge when we come to this that we vote it down. It is a very \nregulatory amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Could I just yield momentarily? I think the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has an amendment of clarification to his amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1264, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment to \nthe [[Page S8008]] desk, and I might tell the Senate the modification \nis to form only, not to substance. And I ask the modification be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am probably a good witness to settle \nthis case because much of what has been referred to is what we did last \nyear and the year before.\n  As the Clinton administration came to office, we had the original \nhearing. I remember it well. Secretary Brown of Commerce appeared. He \nasked for the Department of Justice. I cross-examined him very \nthoroughly on that because what we were trying to do was deregulate, \nwhat we were trying to do is sort of give us the term in the market, \none-stop shopping. And if there were any inadequacies in the \nadministrative body, namely the Federal Communications Commission, it \nwas incumbent on me, I felt, as a Senator to make sure those \ninadequacies were considered. I felt the administration felt very, very \nstrongly about this. And what you do in Government in the art of the \npossible is you get a bill.\n  So while I really wanted to have the one-stop shopping, I went along \nwith the majority vote overwhelmingly as has been referred to. We had \nan 18 to 2 vote, and that kind of thing.\n  We had the Bell companies, the Senator from North Dakota is quite \ncorrect, reading the 8(c) test that is a part of his amendment, and the \namendment, of course, of the distinguished senior colleague of mine \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, is whether or not it will \nsubstantially lessen competition. One is the no substantial possibility \nto use monopoly power to impede competition. That is once competition \nhas already ensued. The Dorgan amendment.\n  The Thurmond amendment is to the effect of reviewing ahead of time a \nmerger, for example, to see whether it would substantially lessen \ncompetition.\n  We begin with the fundamental that to monopolize trade is a felony, \nand these communications people are not criminals--not yet, in any \nevent, and they do not belong in the Justice Department unless they \nviolate the law.\n  So looking at the majority vote in the art of the possible in getting \na good communications bill passed, I was very careful.\n  Number one, if all the colleagues would turn to page 8, I think it \nis, of S. 652, and you look down starting at line 20, section 7, \n``Effect on other law,'' I read this simple line:\n\n       Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c)--\n\n  which have to do with the MFJ and the GTE consent decrees--\n\n       Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), nothing in \n     this act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede \n     the applicability of any antitrust law.\n\n  So let us clear the air. S. 652 says antitrust, keep all your \nexperts; do all your reviews; study all your studies; make all your \nmotions.\n  How many years does it take? They are so proud: Well, the Justice \nDepartment is the one that broke up the AT Well, if they wait for \nthem to break up the next monopoly in a similar fashion, we will all be \nterm limited. Even the senior Senator might not be here. I do not know. \nIt will be long enough, I can tell you that.\n  So let us get right down to it. The Antitrust Division has its \nresponsibilities under Section 7 of Clayton. It has its responsibility \nwith respect to the Sherman Act, whether any violations are there \nbecause that is how they moved with respect to AT\n  The thrust here is by the long distance crowd to get some more \nbureaucracy.\n  That stated it in a line.\n  Just like my friends, the Bell crowd, wanted to do away with the \npublic trust, this long distance crowd wants to bureaucratize the \nentire thing like the end of the world is going to happen if you do not \nhave the Justice Department bureaucracy and minions studying, moving, \nmotioning, hearing, and everything else.\n  I graduated from law school. I had a colleague I think who joined the \nLouisiana land case down there. Like the Georgia Pacific, they had the \nLouisiana pulp and paper case. It was a long --well, 13 years later, \nunder the fees he got, he was retired down in Florida. And I always \nregretted that I went to trying cases in my hometown and did not get \nconnected up with one of those rich antitrust motions.\n  We are all spoiled. You have a wonderful Assistant Attorney General \nin charge of the Antitrust Division, Ms. Anne Bingaman, who has done an \noutstanding job with respect, for example, to the Microsoft case and \nengineering the Ameritech consent decree. You have a wonderful set of \nfacts there where they were all petitioning and joining in. They were \nnot enjoining. They were not motioning to estop. They were not \nappealing. And they were not getting clarifications and everything \nelse, all these other motions that can be made under antitrust with \nfindings and what have you.\n  This was already under the Department of Justice consent decree, the \nMFJ consent decree whereby they could come in and motion the judge and \nagree on a limited market that was outlined, and you did not have to go \ninto the regular antitrust bureaucracy and ritual that takes years on \nend, which they have already put in the Record, fortunately, for me.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talked about starting with President \nNixon, President Ford, President Carter, and then finally under \nPresident Reagan. So there is a strong feeling here that we tried to \nsimplify as much as possible this proceeding.\n  And under the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota about the \n8(c) test, no one knows it better than I because I did cite those \nletters and understanding and everything else of that kind. Because of \nthe way 1822 was drafted year before last, it had actual and \ndemonstrable competition. That just threw everything into the fan, and \nbefore I could get around and explain anything to the colleagues and \neverything else what we were trying to do, they just had a mindset that \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee was off on a toot and a little \nmixed up and it was not going to go anywhere. I had to agree with them; \nI was not going to go anywhere. So we sat down and over a 2-year \nperiod, meeting every Friday with all the Bell companies, and meeting \nevery Tuesday morning with all of the long distance companies and the \nother long distance competitors in there, we then started spelling out \nas best we could that checklist of what actual and demonstrable \ncompetition would encompass. So we spell this out dutifully.\n  I wish to read that to you because I wish to show you what actual and \ndemonstrable, what 8(c) is. The idea is that we have disregarded the \nadmonition that there be no substantial possibility of using monopoly \npower to impede competition.\n  Well, how do you determine that? You determine that best by making a \nchecklist of the unbundling, of the local exchange, the interconnection \nafter it is unbundled.\n You get the dial parity. You set up a separate subsidiary and all the \nother particular items listed.\n\n  I have a wonderful group here that is very familiar with the bill. \nThey know how exactly to turn to the page and section so I can read it \nto you. But while they search for it, which is very difficult to find, \nwhat we did is we dutifully spelled out the 8(c) test, which is the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota, and thereupon put in the \nbill itself, which, again I think, is on page 89. Understand, we had \nnot disregarded actual and demonstrable competition. On page 16, line \n10:\n\n       (b) Minimum Standards.--An interconnection agreement \n     entered into under this section shall, if requested by a \n     telecommunications carrier requesting interconnection, \n     provide for--\n       (1) nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis to the \n     network functions and services of the local exchange \n     carrier's telecommunications network software to the extent \n     defined in the implementing regulations by the Commission.\n       (2) nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis to any \n     of the local exchange carrier's telecommunications facilities \n     and information, including databases and signaling, necessary \n     to the transmission and routing of any telephone exchange \n     service or exchange access service and the interoperability \n     of both carrier's networks;\n       (3) interconnection to the local exchange carrier's \n     telecommunications facilities and services at any technically \n     feasible point within the carrier's network;\n       (4) interconnection that is at least equal in type and \n     quality to and offered at a price no higher than that \n     provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any \n     subsidiary, [[Page S8010]] affiliate, or any other party to \n     which the carrier provides interconnection;\n       (5) nondiscriminatory access to the poles, ducts, conduits \n     and rights-of-way owned or controlled by the local exchange \n     carrier at just and reasonable rates;\n       (6) the local exchange carrier to take whatever action \n     under its control is necessary, as soon as is technically \n     feasible, to provide telecommunications number portability \n     and local dialing parity in a manner that.\n       (A) Permits consumers to be able to dial the same number of \n     digits when using any telecommunications carrier providing \n     telephone exchange service or exchange access service in the \n     market served by the local exchange carrier;\n       (B) permits all such carriers to have nondiscriminatory \n     access to telephone numbers, operator services, directory \n     assistance, and directory listing with no unreasonable \n     dialing delays; and\n       (C) provides for a reasonable allocation of costs among the \n     parties to the agreement.\n       (7) telecommunications services and network functions of \n     the local exchange carrier to be available--\n\n                    Amendment No. 1265, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n       (7) telecommunications services and network functions of \n     the local exchange carrier to be available to the \n     telecommunications carrier without any unreasonable \n     conditions on the resale or sharing of those services or \n     functions, including the origination, transport, and \n     termination of such telecommunications services, other than \n     reasonable conditions required by a State; and for the \n     purposes of this paragraph, it is not an unreasonable \n     condition for a State to limit the resale--\n       (A) of services included--\n\n  I could keep on reading. I hope the colleagues will refer right on \npast page 19.\n  How this was developed is powerfully interesting, Mr. President, \nbecause we had the lawyers. I said earlier today 60,000 lawyers are \nlicensed to practice before the District of Columbia bar; 59,000 of \nthem are communications lawyers, and they have all been meeting here \nfor the last 2 years. They know every little motion, every little \ntwist, every little word, every little turn.\n  This is nothing about the Department of Justice. All of this has to \nbe done by the Federal Communications Commission. Talk about expertise. \nHow high and mighty and what a great aura of austerity and other things \nwe have to have here for the Department of Justice. The Department of \nJustice looks out at the market and finds out if there is any \nunreasonable monopolistic practices in restraint of trade. They have a \nvery broad thing. They do not look at any of these things. They would \nnot be equipped to and would not know.\n  When you get through having done all of this, which really ends up \ninto actual and demonstrable competition, which ends up actually being \nthe 8(c) test under the modified final judgment, when you have done all \nof that, there is one other catchall, and that was referred to earlier \ntoday in an overwhelming vote of the public interest standard. That is \nwhy you had it, Mr. President. For everybody's understanding, if you \nwanted to know why they were fighting to get rid of the public interest \nstandard, we had the catchall in there that the public interest \nstandard had to be adhered to, and that was measured by the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  Here is how that reads:\n\n       If the commission determines the requested authorization is \n     consistent with the public interest convenience and \n     necessity. . .\n\n  Now that is a tremendous body of law under the present and continuing \nto be 1934 Communications Act. Oh, it would be great to come and have \nthe Pressler Act, the Hollings Act. We could go down in history.\n  But there is a tremendous body of law under the 1934 Communications \nAct, and if we started anew with an entirely new communications act for \nour own egos around here, then we would have really messed up 60 years \nof law and decisions, res adjudicata, understandings, and we would have \ncaused tremendous mischief. We would not have deregulated anybody. We \nwould have thrown the information superhighway into the ditch.\n  So what we did is refer back to that where it is referred as a public \ninterest matter 73 times under the original 1934 act.\n  The Commission, after doing all of that, has at its hand a duty \naffirmatively--you are talking about affirmative action in Washington \nthese days. The affirmative action imposed upon the Federal \nCommunications Commission is found on page 89 where the ``Commission \nshall consult with the Attorney General regarding the application. In \nconsulting with the Commission under this subparagraph, the Attorney \nGeneral may apply any appropriate standard.''\n  Then if the colleagues would turn to page 43 of the committee report:\n\n       Within 90 days of receiving an application, the FCC must \n     issue a written determination, after notice and opportunity \n     for a hearing on the record, granting or denying the \n     application in whole or in part. The FCC is required to \n     consult with the Attorney General regarding the application \n     during that 90-day period. The Attorney General may analyze a \n     Bell operating company application under any legal standard \n     (including the Clayton Act, Sherman Act, other antitrust \n     laws, section 8(c) of the modified final judgment, Robinson-\n     Patman Act or any other antitrust standard).\n\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, that you cannot do a better job than \nthat. I have no misgivings for the wonderful vote on the good bill, \n1822. We were ready, willing and able to pass it as it was.\n I was passing it the best way we could. But on second thought, looking \nat the votes, the support, the determination of the colleagues--and \nthat is what we all said in the very beginning, that this is a good \nbalance, we do not disregard the public on a fundamental here. What we \ndo--and it is well to be argued--is that we consider the public. If you \ngo down all the particular things required, plus the public interest \nstandard, if you go into the Attorney General coming in, you know that \nis going to raise a question if the Attorney General sees any \nsubstantial possibility of monopoly power being used to impede \ncompetition or the other Clayton 7 act substantially lessening \ncompetition.\n\n  Either way, or any other way, under the Sherman Act, the Attorney \nGeneral has an affirmative duty to advise, and that is right quick \nlike, because they have to do it under a stated time here in our act. I \ndo not know how to more deliberately go about the particular granting \nof licensing and opening up of markets, allowing the Bell operating \ncompanies into long distance and the long distance into the Bell \noperating companies and to let competition ensue.\n  So both of these amendments--the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina to the second degree under the Clayton 7 \ntest is cared for under this S. 652. The 8(c) test of no substantial \npossibility, of impeding competition, is taken care of here. And over \nand above it all, it is stated clear on page 8 of the particular bill \nthat all standards can be used by the Attorney General. The Attorney \nGeneral has its duties. They are generally criminal duties, and we \nshould not have our wonderful carriers, whether they be Bell operating \ncompanies, long distance companies, or any other telecommunications \ncarriers, even calling over there and trying to find a Justice \ndepartment lawyer, rather than a Federal Communication Commission \nlawyer. It is like ailments physically, when you have to get a special \ndoctor. Well, you need a special lawyer for that. Once he gets into \nthat and they get the billable hours and the motions and clarifications \nand everything else, you can forget about your communications company. \nIt has gone down the tubes financially. We put it in there to make sure \nthat the Antitrust Division of the United States Justice Department is \nnot impeded in any fashion.\n  ``Nothing in this act shall be construed to modify, impair, or \nsupersede [[Page S8012]] the applicability of any add antitrust law.''\n  Now, why do we have these amendments? The long distance crowd are \nwonderful people. I have been working with them, and I have been \nworking with the Bell companies. We all say that everybody has to get \ntogether and we have to get this bill passed. We have to do it in a \nbipartisan fashion. It is incumbent on this Senator's judgment here at \nthis particular time that this is far and away the best approach.\n  So I support our distinguished chairman here in his S. 652, to \neliminate the direct hearing process, and everything else, of going \nfirst to one department of Government and after you get through with \nthat department of Government, come down over to the next department of \nGovernment, and then go through all of that list of things that I have \nlisted down there and expect to get anything done.\n  We are trying to get one-stop shopping here. There is no reason other \nthan, yes, if you get a violator, and if you get a violator with all of \nthis klieg light of attention being given to communications and the \nresponsibilities to the FCC and the experts they are going to have to \nhire. They have already made $7 billion for us this year with auctions. \nSo there is no shortage of money at the FCC.\n  We have to make sure we have the Federal Communications Commission's \nappropriations in our subcommittee of appropriations, and we are going \nto provide a very outstanding staff, because we want to facilitate. We \ndo not want the FCC coming back and saying we are overwhelmed and we \ncannot possibly get it out and we cannot do this and that. Temporarily, \nfor 2, 3 years, sitting down and promulgating all of the rules, \nentertaining all of the petitions and what have you, there is going to \nbe a plethora of legal proceedings looking at both the 8(c) tests and \nsection 7 of the Clayton Act, and all other measures with respect to \ntrying to open up and make sure that on the one hand there is \ncompetition, and on the other hand that any present monopoly power is \nnot used to impede that competition. I do not know how you can get it \ndone any better than that.\n  This amendment would really just formalize both things constituting a \nrequirement to get the lawyers and go up and go through one and go \nthrough the other, where these two can really communicate, not only by \nphone--communications, that is--but they can send a letter and give a \nformal opinion, and everything else like that, and you can bet your \nboots that the Federal Communications Commission is not going to \ndisregard the advice of that Attorney General if it is a strong showing \nin its opinion that there is some substantial possibility of impeding \ncompetition, or that it lessens substantially competition.\n  No FCC is going to get by with that. That appeal will go up, and the \norder would not go anywhere before it would be appealed up and probably \nset aside, because then it would have one division of the Government \nagainst the other division.\n  We have smoothed it out and streamlined it. We have cut out the \nbureaucracy, and yet, we have had every particular safeguard that you \ncan imagine, that the lawyers could think of that is in here, to make \nsure that it works and works properly for the public interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Well, I must say, Mr. President, I rise with some \ntrepidation. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina has made a \nvery impressive legal case as to why the language in the bill, as it is \nwritten, is satisfactory and the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota, prior to him, laid out a number of reasons why the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota is wrong.\n  I say to my colleagues that I do not come here representing the long \ndistance companies or any other companies. I come here representing the \nconsumers, first of Nebraska, and then of the United States of America. \nAnd I hear in the arguments offered here that, first of all, this would \nbe an unprecedented thing for the Justice Department to do. Well, if it \nis our fear of breaking precedent that is the problem with this \namendment, then we should not enact this legislation. This legislation \nis unprecedented, is it not?\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, is this \nlegislation not itself unprecedented? Has the Congress of the United \nStates of America ever considered a law that would take such a \nsubstantially regulated monopoly with such size and move it into a \ncompetitive environment? When have we done this before, of this size \nand magnitude?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield. AT\n  Mr. KERREY. The AT divestiture was done by the Department of \nJustice, not the Congress.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It took 10 years. We do not want to do that.\n  Mr. KERREY. My point here is, to say that what we are asking for with \nthis amendment is unprecedented leads me to the question, is this \nlegislation itself not unprecedented? Is not what Congress is \nconsidering with S. 652 unprecedented? I do not come to the floor and \nsay let us not do S. 652 because it is unprecedented. I understand it \nis unprecedented.\n We are in unchartered waters. We have not done this before.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We are in unchartered waters in the sense that already \nthe Department of Justice is running an industry, so to speak. That is \nwithout precedent in terms of Judge Greene's order, which I think was \nnecessary, because Congress did not do its duty. Congress is now doing \nits duty or trying to in this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is saying that the Congress, the fact that we \nhad divestiture of AT in 1985 was the failure of the U.S. Congress?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. In part, yes. The Congress should have acted.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota what \nwould he propose Congress do?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Congress has been paralyzed and unable to make \ntelecommunications policy because there are so many people in \ntelecommunications who can checkmate the decision. So as \ntelecommunications was modernizing, the Congress was not reacting, and \nthe pressure built up to the point that Judge Greene made the decision \nthat he did.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. Pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We had 10 years of hearings, John Pastore of Rhode \nIsland was chairman of the subcommittee, and in the late 1960's and all \nthe way through the entire 1970's we had hearings.\n  I got a nice compliment from Judge Greene. Minority opinions that we \nput in the committee reports, after all of our hearings, trying to \nbreak up AT Congress was trying to do it because there were 12 \norders that were made by the Federal Communications Commission, but \nthey, AT, was so legally powerful that they had each of the 12 orders \ninto some legal snarl of one kind or another, whereby none of the \norders were enforceable. They could not get anything done, and we could \nnot deregulate.\n  That is why they were accelerating the particular antitrust \nproceedings. Congress was unable to act. I am a witness to that because \nI served on that subcommittee and went to hearings ad nauseam, trying \nto do it, and we make up the reports and everything else. Finally, it \nhad to be done by the Justice Department.\n  It is just like the Senate passing different bills. We tried during \nthe 1980's to take this from Judge Greene and put it back into the FCC \nand got nowhere. We had the manufacturing bill pass by 74 votes--\nbipartisan in the Senate. It got blocked over on the House side.\n  Every time we turned and tried at the congressional level we failed. \nNow we are about to succeed, I think, and I am confident we have the \nsupport of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will stipulate that I agree that Congress failed in not \nbeing able to resolve the various conflicts and pass legislation to \nbreak up AT in the 1980's and come up with a legislative solution.\n  A failure of the Reagan administration, as well, not to be able to \nexercise sufficient leadership. I stipulate here on the floor tonight \nthat it was a failure of the Reagan administration, a failure of the \nU.S. Senate in the 1980's, and a failure of the United States House of \nRepresentatives to be able to get this job done. [[Page S8013]] \n  Is that a fair stipulation? Am I expressing something with which the \nSenator from South Dakota would disagree?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Would my friend yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am not trying to score debate points, but in part, it \nwas a failure of everyone and previous Congresses and administrations \nto tackle the difficult problem we were trying to tackle.\n  I am not putting anybody down. This bill has been worked on by many \nSenators, and the Senator from South Carolina has shown great courage. \nHis speech was one of the great speeches that I have heard in the \nSenate.\n  I would say to my good friend from Nebraska, may I ask a question: Is \nthere any other precedent, is there any other industry that has been \ntaken over by the Justice Department and regulated and run as Judge \nGreene's decree did? Is not that unprecedented?\n  Mr. KERREY. Absolutely is.\n  Is there any situation, Senator, where governmental entity has \nproduced so much good? Is there? Tell me the bad things that have \nhappened since the consent decree was filed.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Well, I would have supported the concept of a consent \ndecree.\n  I think we have reached a point where Congress should take back its \nrightful role. I think that Judge Greene probably would say that. I \nhave not met him. I would love to meet him some day, because he is one \nof the great people in American history in terms of what he has done. \nAn industrial reconstruction that is bigger than any in history.\n  I always tell students when I give speeches in my State of South \nDakota, if they want to influence public policy, they should become a \njournalist or Federal judge first, if they really want to have sweeping \naffects. I cite Judge Greene as an example.\n  But if I may say so, we are sort of debating the chicken and the egg.\n  Mr. KERREY. It is not the chicken and the egg.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We have a situation that I think we have the \nresponsibility to act.\n  Mr. KERREY. If Congress did it in 1985, they could not have done it \nas well as the Department of Justice. The regional Bell companies at \nthe time of the filing of the consent decree object to restrictions \nplaced on them on manufacturing, on services, and they objected because \nthey wanted to get into all the things.\n  The consent decree said we will have competition. It said we will \nmove from a monopoly to competition.\n  This is the agency of the government that has enabled us to do that. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice has done it. That is what I see. I see \nthem as an agency that has produced competition, in an unprecedented \ntime, once before, and now in another unprecedented time.\n  In my judgment, we need them not to produce duplication, not to \nproduce a duplicative process. It is a parallel process. Do you not go \nto one agency and then to another. I tend to walk through, as I see, \nthe process.\n  I feel odd arguing, because in S. 1822 last year, we had all this \npretty well settled. Last year's legislation came out with a 18-2 \nmargin. I believe, basically, that did what the Dorgan amendment is now \nasking for.\n  I point out, as well, one of the statements that was made here that \nthis thing could drag on a long, long time.\n  Well, the amendment tends to deal with that. I point out to my \ncolleagues that there is a determination, a process, that says that the \nAttorney General, not later than 30 days after receiving an \napplication, shall issue a written determination. There is a time \ncertain in here of the 90 days.\n  Now, maybe 90 days is too long. Maybe it ought to be somewhat \nshorter. There is an attempt made here not to lengthen the process. \nIndeed, I believe very strongly that the law as it is written without \nthis amendment is an invitation for lengthy litigation.\n  But most importantly, Mr. President, my fear with this, and it is a \nsincerely based fear, I do not come here pulling for the long distance \ncompanies, or represent one interest or another.\n  I come many times in this debate to say this: We are going to vote on \nthis in final passage some time in the next year. We will have a vote \non final passage.\n  Members need to understand that they will be held accountable for \nthat vote. Who will hold them accountable? Who will say, ``You cast the \nright vote.'' In the early difficult days, it will be the companies who \nhave taken an interest. It will be the corporations that have been in \ntown talking to Senators, day in and day out since the committee began \nits work in the early part of this year, and since the committee \nstarted its work last year. The companies that have been in town saying \n``We like this provision, we don't like this provision,'' all the \ndelicate balance that has been referenced. Either get a pat on the \nback, or a wave, or some smaller number of fingers directed in your \ndirection.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that the much more important test \nof whether or not this piece of legislation is going to be something \nSenators are either proud of, or for the rest of your political \ncareer--perhaps shortened by this vote--Senators are explaining why \nthey thought it would do something else.\n  This piece of legislation either produces lower prices and higher \nquality to 100 million residential users of information services from 9 \nbasic industries, or anybody that votes ``aye'' on this thing has a lot \nof trouble.\n  I do not care what AT says. I do not care what the RBOC says. I do \nnot care what the cable companies say or the broadcast people say, or \nanybody else says. Out in that hallway or in your office or through the \nmailbox or through E mail or any other kind of communication, they may \ntell Senators they are doing the right thing, but the real test is \ngoing to come a year from now, 2 years from now, 3 years from now when \nthis rubber begins to meet the road.\n  The question then will be, what do the consumers say? What do the \ncitizens say? Dare I mention it, what do the voters say, who have not \nasked for this piece of legislation?\n  I say now for the 8th or 9th or 10th time, this is not something that \nhas been driven by town hall meetings. This is not on talk radio. This \nis not something that is coming as a part of the Contract With America. \nNo one has polled this. No one has reached out and said, we will do \nfocus groups and find out what is going on here. This is being driven \nby legitimate corporations with a sincere desire to do something that \ncurrent law says they cannot do.\n  So we are trying to do something that is unprecedented-- \nunprecedented to take a large sector of our economy and move it from a \nmonopoly status into a competitive environment.\n  And if we only worry about whether or not the existing corporations \nare going to be able to get what they want, in my judgment, not only \nwould the consumers be unhappy, because they do not get the competitive \nchoice they need. In my judgment, as well, all the promises of jobs we \nare talking about all the time, are not going to be fulfilled.\n Because, rest assured, when jobs are created they are going to be \ncreated by companies that do not even exist today. New entries, like we \nsaw with Microsoft, new entries like we saw with Intel--we are going to \nsee new entries that are going to be creating the jobs of tomorrow. \nAnd, unless this legislation permits, with no reservations, competition \nat the local level, it is unlikely that either the consumers of the \nUnited States of America, or those people in America who are trying to \nfind jobs, are going to be terribly happy with the product.\n\n  I am going to go down a few things I have heard said here this \nevening. I do not know how much longer I will talk. I will talk a \nwhile. We are going to come back in tomorrow and have plenty of time to \ngo through some additional matters. Let me go through some of the \nthings that were referenced.\n  I have heard it said this is more regulation and more delay. I am \nprepared to argue and present it is not. I am prepared to argue in fact \nthat the existing legislation, unless it is changed by the Dorgan \namendment, is going to be more regulation and more delay.\n  I have heard it said the Department of Justice is going to take on \nlegions of new employees. It is not true. Indeed, the much more likely \npossibility is it will be the FCC that has to take on legions of new \nemployees because they are not used to doing this kind of work. \n[[Page S8014]] It is much more likely that the plethora of applications \nthat come the FCC's way is going to produce an increase in that \nbureaucracy and not an increase in the Department of Justice.\n  I have heard it said, and I referenced it earlier, this is going to \ncreate duplication. It is not. It is a concurrent process, a \nsimultaneous process of application. The FCC does the work it is \nsupposed to do. The Department of Justice does the work it is supposed \nto do. There is not an overlapping of permit requirement here. One \nagency has one responsibility; another has another responsibility. \nThere is a time certain, as I indicated already in the amendment.\n  In my judgment we have made an effort with this amendment to try to \ntake into account the concerns that people have. Are we going to have \nmore regulation? Is this going to create duplication? Is this going to \nmean more paperwork and delay? It will not mean more of any of those \nthings. It will mean less.\n  I have heard it said, as I indicated earlier, that this is an \nunprecedented intrusion by the Department of Justice into an industry. \nMr. President, this whole venture is unprecedented. I hope colleagues \nunderstand that. It is an unprecedented action. It is an unprecedented \nbipartisan action, and I trust and hope this amendment will become an \nunprecedented bipartisan action as well, because, unless we improve \nthis legislation with this change, those who vote ``yes'' on this bill, \nI believe sincerely and genuinely, will regret having done so.\n  Mr. President, I hear that this is a dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am sorry. I have the example, if the Senator will \nyield, that he asked for earlier.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, what we have, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator, is the minority leader's amendment. When we \ncalled up the bill we put in the majority leader's amendment. We did \nnot have a opportunity to put in the minority leader's, and we wanted \nto print it in the Record so the Members could read it.\n  Will Senator temporarily yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I may send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1266\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the requirements a Bell operating company must \nsatisfy before being permitted to offer long distance services, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for himself \n     and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1266.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 53, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 107.

Mr. President, let me go through a few more things here. \nI appreciate that. I have only a few things.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield? This is a fascinating dialog for \nme. I am not in any way trying to one-up or anything. But in the early \n1980's both AT and IBM were in the Justice Department with big \nlawsuits against them. And on the same day, January 8, 1982, the \nFederal Government chose two different destinies for those mammoth \ncompanies.\n  It is my contention that, had we done with AT then what we are \ntrying to do now, that is broken up the monopoly by requiring them to \nunbundle and interconnect and allow competition--in any event the \ncomputer industry went the other way. The computer industry--it is true \nthere are winners and losers. It is true IBM has had problems and had \nspinoffs. But the computer industry, in terms of service to the \nAmerican people, and dropping costs, moved forward much faster. In \nfact, there is a chart here that, had the telecommunications industry \nmoved forward in competition as much as IBM in the computer area, the \ncost of telephones today would be about a fifth what they are, because \nthe innovation and the competition, reduction in costs was much greater \nin the computer industry.\n  So the Justice Department on the same day in 1982 sent the two \nindustries on two different paths. They did that with AT because \nCongress had failed to act. We failed to do then what we are trying to \ndo now, that is open up access, provide interconnection and unbundling \nto provide competition. And we would have had much more innovation in \nthe telecommunications area, if you compare the two industries.\n  Mr. KERREY. I say to the Senator from South Dakota, had we done that, \nhad we tried to follow the model of IBM, we would have had to do a \nnumber of other things. We would have had to say there is no public \npurpose in having universal service to all Americans.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am not talking about IBM, I am talking about the \ncomputer industry. I am talking about the computer industry.\n  Mr. KERREY. But AT and IBM are wholly different cases. IBM is a \ncompany that manufactured hardware and software for the consumer and \nbusiness industry. There is no public purpose there, in saying we have \nto make sure every single American household has a computer. Whereas \nAT was a monopoly created with the 1934 Communications Act, with a \nfranchise and a specific instructions to achieve universal service for \nall Americans.\n  So, in the one case----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield, I am talking about the \ncomputer industry, the competitiveness that is in it. It has been far \nmore innovative than the telecommunications areas. I know the two \ncompanies are different. I am not just talking about IBM. It has been \nreplaced--there have been all those things that have happened; Intel, \nApple, and all sorts of things. I could go through them.\n  But a comparison of the two technologies, how they have progressed--\ncompare the computer area to telecommunications, you would find that \ntoday a telephone call would be only a few cents, if it had advanced as \nmuch as the reduction in cost of personal computers. My friend asked \nfor an example. That is an example.\n  But, in 1982, what the Congress should have been doing----\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask my friend from South Dakota, does he think it would \nhave cost a couple of cents in Rapid City, SD?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Personal computers cost much, much less in Rapid City.\n  Mr. KERREY. If we had taken the IBM track in 1984, does the Senator \nthink it would have cost a couple of cents for phone service in South \nDakota? I do not think so.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Personal computers cost much less in South Dakota than \nthey would otherwise. You can argue this thing circuitously. You might \nhave innovations. In the computer area there are so many innovations. \nWe may have had telecommunications innovations that we have not had. \nYou cannot argue this perfectly.\n  But there is probably no part of American industry that has had more \ninnovation and competition than the computer industry, and people in \nRapid City, SD, can buy personal computers at a fraction of the cost, \nand they are much more advanced than they would have been had the \nJustice Department gone the other way.\n  Mr. KERREY. The point in fact is the Justice Department put the \npressure on IBM, caused IBM to spin off two relatively insignificant, \nat the time, inventions. One was----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am talking about the computer.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Department of Justice had a very constructive impact \non IBM and on the U.S. economy. They had them spin off a couple of \nlittle things. One was an operating system called MS-DOS. And a couple \nof guys, high school or college dropouts up in Seattle, they built \nMicrosoft. And Intel was the second company that got spun off, because \nthe Department of Justice said we have a monopoly here. It is \nunacceptable.\n  You are going to control too much of the economy. We are going to \nrequire some action. I understand you are using an example. I find the \nexample difficult frankly on two grounds: One, in the case of IBM, you \nare dealing with a company that is different than AT AT is a \nlicensed monopoly by law created as a monopoly. The question is how do \nyou go from that monopoly to something you now want to become a \ncompetitive industry?\n  That is what I find most remarkable about the objection to this \namendment--that if you are looking for a Federal agency with experience \ntaking a monopoly situation to a competitive situation, why in heaven's \nname would we not go to the Department of Justice that has the most \nexperience doing it and the most successful experience doing it? They \nhave the track record. They have the personnel. Tell me where the FCC \nwas in all of this. Describe to me the FCC's role either in IBM or in \nAT in a transition from monopoly to competition.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my colleague will yield again, I am talking not \nspecifically about IBM. But I am talking about the direction the \ncomputer industry took. AT was a Government monopoly. But my argument \nis that if we had done what we are trying to do in this bill--that is, \nrequire them to unbundle and interconnect, to allow for local \ncompetition, allow people to have access locally as this bill does, the \nwhole telephone communication industry might be much more innovative \ntoday than it is.\n  Mr. KERREY. I hear that. But one of the reasons Congress did not do \nthat was when you get right down to it, it is difficult for us to say \nto a company you have to be competitive.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota that when the Cohen amendment \ncame up earlier we were on the opposite sides of that issue. The Cohen \namendment said we are going to take the set-top box industry and allow \nit to develop in a competitive fashion. There were concerns from \nsmaller cable operators that it could result in some hardship to them. \nIt could result in some problems for them. I understand. I think it is \nvery difficult for the U.S. Congress to take a position to say to any \nindustry that we are going to require you to go from a situation where \nyou are not competitive, where you have been given Government \nprotection of some kind, and in this particular case it is the \ntelephone industry, given a franchise, given protective status, \nprotected from competition, we are trying to figure out how to protect \nthem from that protected status to a competitive environment, and the \nonly Federal agency in town, in the people's capital in Washington, DC \nwith the experience of having done it is the U.S. Department of Justice \nis given a consultative role. ``Oh, what do you think of this \ntransition, Mr. Department of Justice?''\n  It seems to me, odd. I do not understand. I understand why the people \nwho are going from a monopoly to a competitive environment oppose this. \nI understand why they are nervous about it because they saw how \neffective the Department of Justice was the previous time they did it. \nThey saw how rigorous the Department of Justice was in \n[[Page S8016]] making sure that there was competition.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If the Senator will yield, it is not true that if we \nallow the FCC to set the standard for anything, a Government standard, \nthere is very little room for innovation, for new inventions, for the \ntype of things that have happened in the competitive world. There are \nsome winners and some losers.\n  But my point about computers is that every 18 months things become \nvirtually obsolete because there is so much competition. There are so \nmany things going on. The average consumer has benefited from all this \ncompetition. They can own a personal computer, and the prices are going \ndown and capacity has gone up enormously. Had we had the Government \nstandards we would not have seen that type of innovation.\n  That is the point I am trying to make.\n  Mr. KERREY. We are not proposing a Government standard with this \namendment, I do not believe. Maybe I misunderstand the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. I do not believe so. I do not believe we are \nproposing that. I do not know if the Senator from South Dakota is \nfamiliar with it. I suspect the Senator is since he has been inundated \nwith all of this stuff involved in this piece of legislation. There is \nan issue of interoperability.\n  I introduced an interoperability bill a month or so ago, and \nimmediately was approached by some people in the private sector who \nsaid that if the Government comes in and sets a legal de jure standard, \nwhat that does is it inhibits the development of the de facto \nstandards, and I yielded to that argument. Indeed, I do not want the \nGovernment to establish in technology with the de jure standard that \nmakes it difficult for the companies to go to the marketplace and say \nwe are going to give what the marketplace wants and after we have given \nyou what you want that becomes the standard, that becomes the new \nstandard. I do not want to inhibit that at all.\n  What I am concerned about, again I say for my colleagues, I am \nconcerned about that the consumer who will not benefit unless there is \ncompetition so rigorous that I can take my business someplace else if I \ndo not like what is being offered either in the way of price or \nservice, not in independent lines of business, not in cable, not in \ndial tone, not in tech. But if they want to come in and sell it to me \nall put together for a lower price than I am currently paying, that is \nwhere I am going to get innovation and reduction in the cost of my \ncurrent household information services. I am not going to get it if you \npreserve out of concern for what the Department of Justice is going to \ndo, if you preserve a line of business differential in some artificial \nfashion. I think that is what this legislation does unless we get the \nDepartment of Justice with a role, an active role.\n  I mean I am willing to consider any suggestions on what to do, to \nreduce any potential duplication, overlap. I am willing to consider any \nsuggestions to make sure we shorten the time. We do not want to stretch \nit out. The idea is do what Justice did in 1984. You go into court. If \nyou get the parties in hand, you write up a memorandum. You get in this \ncase a consent decree. You walk into the judge at a Federal court, and \nyou file it. All parties agree. You do not have litigation afterwards.\n  You do not have any dispute to tie this thing up for a long time and \ntragically prevent the very competition that we are trying to see. I \nhope my colleagues understand that. If this thing is litigated, if I as \nan owner in a monopoly fashion have the right to deliver information \nservices at the local level, and can tie this thing up in court for a \nlong enough time to prevent that innovation from occurring, it is \nprevented permanently for the very reason that the Senator from South \nDakota said, because innovation only lasts a little while and then it \nis obsolete.\n  So I understand this delicate balance. I truly do. The distinguished \nchairman and the ranking Member have worked so hard on it. I understand \nthat maybe it could all come apart if this amendment is agreed to. \nMembers say, ``Oh, my gosh. We settled that in committee. We cannot now \ntake it up again.''\n  I hope that we get some reconsideration of that conclusion. If I am \nwrong, if I have reached a conclusion because I have myself diagnosed \nthe scene and do not understand what is going on, come and tell me. I \nam prepared to admit. If I see that incorrectly I have assessed on \nbehalf of consumers and people making certain this legislation does set \noff some innovation that results in new and higher paying jobs for the \npeople of the United States of America, I do not believe that this is a \nprecedent that we should fear. Indeed, I believe it is a precedent that \nwe should seek based upon the success of having done it once before.\n  I heard one of the comments here this evening. Well, if the Justice \nDepartment has specialized expertise, then maybe we would ask them to \ndo this. It does have specialized expertise. That is precisely the \npoint. It has specialized expertise. Let us define what we want the \nJustice Department to do based upon that specialized expertise and have \nthe FCC do what it does well, based upon its specialized expertise. And \nin that kind of a situation, Mr. President, we must be able to come to \nan agreement on how to make certain that we do not end up with overlap \nand duplication and a long regulatory process that makes it difficult \nnot just for the RBOC's to get into long distance, but far greater \nconcern for all of us who want to make sure that our vote turns out \nright, and that consumers end up with lower prices and higher quality \nservice as a consequence.\n  Mr. President, I really could talk a bit longer. I do not know what \nthe distinguished Senator from South Dakota has in mind for the \nevening. It looks like there is a shortage here of red-blooded American \nmen and women, unfortunately, elected to this great body that want to \ntalk on this wonderful issue.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not see colleagues nor the Chamber filled with \npeople listening to my words.\n  But, in very good spirit, I say to my friend from Nebraska, I have \nworked with him on his interoperability amendment. In fact, we accepted \nit. But only after insisting that a private standard be set. My \nunderstanding is then the Senator's original proposal had a Government \nstandard set.\n  Mr. KERREY. It had a voluntary Government standard, and I was willing \nto make changes and make certain that it did not become a rigid \nGovernment standard, this is true.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not care to debate it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Network and network interoperability.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I welcome it and pleased to accept it, and it \ndemonstrates that we are working together.\n  I have said about all I am going to say today, but I do have some \nremarks for the leader at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will just take a few minutes and conclude for this \nevening.\n  The distinguished ranking member went through the 14 part checklist \nand said that among other things this checklist--for my colleagues who \nare wondering, this is in section 221. It actually becomes section 255 \nof the communications act.\n  This checklist says this is what a Bell operating company, your local \ntelephone company from whom you purchase your telephone service, this \nis what they have to do in order to be able to provide long distance. \nThat is, they have to do all these things and present that to the FCC. \nAnd when they do that and meet one higher test, one additional test, \npublic interest test, then they are allowed to get into long distance.\n  Now, the idea here is that that 14 part checklist substitutes for \nmeeting a test called no substantial possibility of interfering with \ndemonstrable competition, or some such thing as that. The idea is that \nthis 14 part checklist is all we need to have in order to make certain \nthat we have competition.\n  Now, the phone companies in their defense are a bit frustrated with \nall this because they say oh, my gosh, I have this 14 part checklist \nand now you want me to satisfy the Department of Justice. I want them \nto have a role in this thing as well. That is too much.\n  Mr. President, I actually think that in these negotiations we \nsometimes sort of seize onto something and begin to feel as if it has \nto be this way and there is no better way. I say to the phone \ncompanies, you would be far better off if your interest is getting \ncompetition without litigating it, you [[Page S8017]] would be far \nbetter off with both of these things. You have a checklist. I know \nexactly what it is you have to do. We have gone through that exercise. \nWe have said that is what you have to do to get into long distance. You \npresent that to the FCC. You go through the process as Justice \nsimultaneous with that and then there is no dispute. There is nobody \nthat can say to you you have not satisfied what is required to make \nsure there is local competition, and for us in the Congress no risk \nthat we will not have that competition, and it is the biggest risk in \nthis whole deal. Fail to get that competition at the local level and \nmost assuredly regret will come to your mind sometime in the not too \ndistant future.\n  I am going to just make one last comment and then wrap this up. One \nlast thing that was said was there is a lot of money over at FCC from \nthe auctions. As I understand it, in fact I know it to be the case, \nthat auction money is hardly available if you are going to add staff \nover at the FCC in order to be able to handle the increased caseload, \nand there is going to be increased caseload. There is going to be \nincreased pressure upon the FCC. They are going to have to hire new \npeople. They do not have this expertise over there right now. They are \ngoing to have to hire at the FCC in order to be able to handle these \napplications, in order to be able to make those determinations. We are \ngoing to have to build what does not exist today in a Federal agency \nthat previously has not had this kind of responsibility. And you are \ngoing to have to find an offset in some fashion in order to be able to \nget the job done, whereas, as I see it anyway, at the Department of \nJustice we already have those folks on the job.\n  Mr. President, once again I say I hope that in the process of \ndebating this, this will in the end lead to a piece of legislation I am \nable to enthusiastically support based upon my confidence that this is \ngoing to be good for the American consumer, this is going to be good \nfor American workers that are hoping that this country will create more \nhigh paying jobs, that this will be good for American citizens who \nincreasingly are dependent upon information in order to do a good job \nin their schools, to do a good job in their businesses, to do a good \njob in their operating rooms and various other places where Americans \neither work or play.\n  I appreciate the tolerance and the assistance of the distinguished \nchairman of this committee and the ranking member who has already left.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if I may commend my friend from Nebraska \nbecause I think our discussion has stimulated at least me to think a \nbit about where we are historically as we conclude this debate this \nevening.\n  First of all, it is stimulating in the sense to think if we can find \na way to help people have more products available at a lower cost that \nare useful to them in their lives, we are doing more for them than if \nwe were to give them Government aid. There is a proper role for \nGovernment in our society. But it is my strongest feeling that if we \ncan find ways through competition in the free enterprise system that \npeople can have products at a lower price in abundance and innovations \nwe are actually doing more for them frequently than if we give them \ngrants or aid.\n  For example, let us talk about senior citizens. I am a champion of \nsenior citizens. We deregulated natural gas prices in the 1970's, and I \nremember I was over in the House of Representatives, and we were \nstruggling with that issue. And people said, if you deregulate natural \ngas the prices are going to skyrocket and companies are going to gouge \neverybody. In fact, the prices came down and they have stayed down. If \nyou want to do a senior citizen a favor, you can help the cost of \nheating their home stay low. You can help the cost of their goods to be \nlower through competition.\n  Usually we think of helping senior citizens by giving them more money \nor spending taxpayers' money, and in some cases that is accurate. But \nyou can also help senior citizens by providing them low cost fuel and \nlow cost natural gas. And that has been done through deregulated \nnatural gas prices.\n  And I also say that to a lot of people in the United States the \ninnovations that have occurred in the computer industry--true, there \nhave been some winners and losers among the companies, but the fact is \nthat people have lower cost personal computers available today through \ncompetition. And we never could have achieved that through Government \nregulations or Government standards. Indeed, every 18 months there is a \ncomplete turnover.\n  I also serve on the Finance Committee, and the people in the computer \narea in Silicon Valley would like an 18-month depreciation schedule \nbecause their products are obsolete after 18 months. That is because \nthere is so much competition and there is not a Government standard \nholding them back. The American free enterprise system allows that type \nof innovation. Every 18 months the old computer is obsolete, and we are \nmoving forward and people are able to buy personal computers at a low \ncost. That is a service to people much more so than if we had a huge \nGovernment agency regulating and setting standards.\n  I would say that through this bill if we can increase competition and \nif through this bill we can bring innovation, we will see the same kind \nof explosion of new devices and investment and services for \ntelecommunications at a lower cost to consumers, just as we have seen \nin other areas of competition. But we do not have that so long as we \nhave the Justice Department and the FCC running things with Government \nregulation and Government standards.\n  Now, also let me say what will happen if we do not pass this bill.\n  It is tough to pass this bill because different groups have \ncheckmates and the White House has been opposing this bill--though they \nwill not say they will veto it. But I am very sad about this \nopposition, because if we do not pass this bill, we will be failing \nagain as a Congress to do what we are supposed to do.\n  Had Congress, before 1982, required AT to unbundle and interconnect \nso they could have competition in the local markets, we would not be \nhere today. We would have had an explosion of new devices in \ntelecommunications, more than we have had. We would have lower costs. \nThere is no reason the cost of long distance calls needs to cost what \nthey do. Consumers should be paying a fourth of what they are paying \nfor local and long distance service, based on what has happened to \nprices in the computer area.\n  We are trying to do what we were supposed to do in 1982 in this bill, \nand we are trying to get this thing together. Yet people come to the \nfloor with more regulatory amendments. This amendment that is before us \nnow to put on the Department of Justice another layer of regulation is \ngoing to delay, delay, delay. What if computers and innovation in \ncomputers had to go through the Department of Justice? It takes 3 to 5 \nyears for them to respond even to petitions that are routine. Why do we \nwant more regulations?\n  If we do not pass this bill, we will be failing again. People say, \n``Well, if we don't pass this bill, we'll get another bill.'' No, we \nwill not. We are coming into a Presidential election, and it will be \nover to 1997 and that is 2 more years of innovation and lower prices \nfor the American people lost.\n  I say to the White House, I find it very odd that the White House is \nopposing this bill, because they will not say they will veto it. I went \nover three times to see Al Gore, to get him to lead this movement, \nbecause it is everything he says he believes in. It is reinventing, \nprivatizing, all of those things; it is the information highway.\n  I have been amazed that the White House has not supported this. They \nwill not say they are going to veto it.\n  Every Democrat on the Commerce Committee voted for this bill. The \nDemocrats in the Senate have been at the forefront of helping us to \nderegulate and move forward in telecommunications.\n  I know there have not been very many bipartisan bills that have \npassed this Senate, and I will not put this on a partisan basis. I \nwould give as much credit to Senator Hollings as to some of the \nRepublican people and Democratic people that have served for years. But \nhere we have a chance to deregulate an industry, to get everybody into \neverybody else's business. If we slip and fail, this thing will go over \nto 1997, and then we will start again, I suppose, because we are not \ngoing to [[Page S8018]] have a major telecommunications reform bill in \na Presidential election year.\n  I have also said that I hope that this bill passes both Houses by the \nFourth of July. I hoped it would be signed by the President by the \nFourth of July. That was my original goal.\n  The Senate has moved on a bipartisan basis in an amazingly \ncoordinated way. We had meeting after meeting every night with \nDemocrats and Republicans. We met Saturdays and Sundays, Democrats and \nRepublicans, shoulder to shoulder, to finally get a telecommunications \nbill. We passed it through the Senate Commerce Committee when people \nsaid it could not be passed. It is on the Senate floor.\n  This is early June. This is one of the most complicated bills here, \nand it will affect a third of the American economy. It affects every \nhome in America. And I think it is time for the White House to join us. \nThey are opposing this bill. I think it is time for the Consumer \nFederation of America to join us. I hope Newt Gingrich gives this bill \nan early slot over there because it is very important. It is a \nbipartisan bill that will create jobs, and it will create the kind of \njobs we want in this country.\n  Right now, a lot of our telecommunications industry is forced to \ninvest overseas because they are prohibited from doing certain things \nhere. Our regional Bells cannot manufacture, they cannot do this, and \nthey cannot do that. So one of my friends in my life, Dick Callahan, \nfor example, president of U.S. West International, is over in London. \nHe is originally from Sioux Falls. He is not in Denver and Sioux Falls \ninvesting, he is over in London investing U.S. money in things that the \ntelecommunications companies can do there that they cannot do here. I \nwould rather have the Dick Callahans of this world creating jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  Also, this bill is a modernizing bill. We are losing jobs in some of \nour aging industries, very frankly. We read every day about how a \ncertain mature industry is laying off people. I recently toured the \nCaterpillar plants in Peoria, IL, and I saw the difference in the \nassembly line where the modernized part is, where they turn out 51 \nengines a day, versus the old part, where they turn out 13 engines a \nday. They make 51 engines with fewer people.\n  But those people will need new jobs in new industries, and this bill \ndoes that. Everybody should understand that. This is a jobs bill, but \nit is not a jobs bill through Government, it is a jobs bill through \nfree enterprise. If we are going to do something for people, we provide \nthem more services at a cheaper level, just as with deregulating \nnatural gas. We helped every senior citizen, probably more than we did \nwith the COLA on Social Security, by providing them with a cheap form \nof fuel to heat their home. And that is what this bill is.\n  I could go on at great length. But I would like to conclude the \ndebate today by saying I think we have made good progress on this bill. \nThis is a bill that some of the private newsletters said only had a 10 \npercent chance in January. They said it had a 30 percent chance in \nApril. But I think we are right on the cusp. We have to make progress \nwith this bill. If we do not, we will be failing the American people \nand we will be failing the creation of a lot of jobs, new kinds of \njobs, and we will be having our brightest people going overseas \ninvesting our telecommunications capital, as is happening.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995--S. 652.\n  S. 652 will open telecommunications markets to competition which will \nbenefit consumers and the American economy. It will give America the \nfreedom we need to remain the world's leader in telecommunications, \ninformation and computer technology in the 21st century. Keeping this \nedge will enhance our competitiveness, spur domestic economic growth \nand job creation, and, most importantly, provide a better quality of \nlife for our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure that these same benefits flow into \nthe educational system and into our classrooms, libraries and \nhospitals.\n  The communications revolution is leaving our schools behind. As \naccess to telecommunications technology and information increases \nacross the country, our classrooms are cut off from the information \nrevolution. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that \noverall, 35 percent of public schools have access to the Internet but \nonly 3 percent of classrooms in public schools are networked. Smaller \nschools in rural areas are even less likely to be on the Internet than \nschools with larger enrollment sizes.\n  Mr. President, I live in a small rural town in Colorado where many \nschools lack even basic phone lines. I have seen, first-hand, how many \nrural areas were left unserved and were dependent on the Federal \nGovernment to finance cooperatives to bring basic telephone service to \nrural communities. Schools and libraries in rural Colorado and in rural \nAmerica cannot afford to be left unserved and kept out of the \ninformation revolution.\n  The Snowe-Rockefeller provision in S. 652 ensures that rural \ncommunities and high cost areas have access to communications and \ninformation technology. This provision builds on the overall universal \nservice provision in S. 652 and adds the important component of \nproviding schools, libraries and hospitals with affordable access to \nthe Information Superhighway. In my view, it is essential to rural \ncommunities to keep this provision in the bill. Otherwise, rural areas \nwill not benefit from technological advances in communications.\n  There is a growing understanding that technology can have a \nsignificant positive impact on teaching and learning and can serve as a \nmeans for achieving educations excellence. For example, a computer \nnetwork connected to the classroom means that every teacher and student \nhas access to the world's greatest libraries. New technologies and \ntools such as e-mail and the World Wide Web will give schools greater \naccess to text, audio and video-on-demand. Through telecommunications, \nstudents and teachers will gain access to significantly greater amounts \nof information than would otherwise be available.\n  Teachers could be far more productive and innovative if they had \naccess to new ideas and technologies through computer networks. Studies \nshow productivity increases of as much as 30 percent when teachers are \nconnected to the Information Superhighway. In essence, teachers would \nbe able to exchange lesson plans, get tips from their colleagues, or \nobtain access to the Library of Congress or the National Archives for \nteaching materials. In rural areas, students can access information \nthrough distance learning programs where information and instruction is \nexchanged by two-way videos.\n  There are many exciting technological opportunities available for our \nschools and libraries across the country. Yet, teachers simply do not \nhave adequate tools to use the resources of the information revolution. \nMost teachers have not had adequate training to prepare them to use \ntechnology effectively in teaching. According to survey data from the \nNational Education Association, an estimated 56 percent of all public \nschool teachers feel they need training to use personal computers \nadequately in their classes and 72 percent need training in the use of \non-line databases.\n  Technology can even draw parents into the education process. Many \nparents do not understand how technology filters into the education \nprocess, and they do not understand its significance in their \nchildren's schooling. However, parents can have access to simple voice-\nmail technology and can call into a mailbox to find out the homework \nassignment or information about a class trip. In the future, classroom \nnetworks could eventually extend to the home and thereby fulfill what \neducators say is their biggest unmet need: lengthening the learning day \nand involving the parents.\n  Mr. President, all of the Nation's children deserve to be exposed to \nthe best possible education, not just those who live in affluent areas. \nBut, without a national commitment to providing affordable access to \nthese emerging technologies in schools and libraries in rural areas, \nour Nation will fall far short in preparing all its citizens for the \n21st century.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S7972-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8019-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE MUSIC PERFORMANCE TRUST FUNDS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once said that \nmusic is the universal language of mankind. If so, recording industries \nmusic performance trust funds enable that language to be heard and \nenjoyed by all.\n  Since its creation in 1948 by the Recording Companies of America and \nthe American Federation of Musicians, MPTF has raised over $500 \nmillion, and has sponsored more than a million free instrumental \nperformances throughout the United States and Canada. MPTF can truly be \ndescribed as the largest single sponsor of live music in the entire \nworld.\n  Indeed, the effect of MPTF is enormous. It provides young musicians \nwith opportunities to learn from experienced professionals. It permits \nindividuals to hear excellent artistic selections, and to broaden their \nmusical tastes. It functions as an educational tool enabling students \nto acquire a better appreciation and understanding of music. It serves \nas an outstanding example of industry and employees working together \nfor a greater future, in which the arts are widely accessible to people \nin their own communities.\n  It is often said that few things in life are free. When MPTF was \nfirst envisioned, it was designed to be an exception to that rule. Its \noriginal goal was to present free musical performances for community \neducation and outreach, with emphasis on reaching the largest possible \naudiences. For half a century, in reaching for that goal, MPTF has \nhelped to develop, strengthen, and enrich our national culture and \nheritage, especially the appreciation and enjoyment of live music.\n  Because of these admirable achievements, it is a privilege to take \nthis opportunity to commend the recording industry and MPTF for their \nleadership. Through their efforts, music is fulfilling its potential as \na magnificent unifying and humanizing experience that can be shared and \nunderstood by all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8019-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WILLIAM W. WILKENS, SR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life of a \ngood friend of mine, and one of our State's leading citizens--William \nWalter Wilkins, Sr.--who passed away recently.\n  Born in the South Carolina ``Upstate'', Mr. Wilkins became one of the \nmost prominent and well liked citizens of the region. A gifted athlete, \n``WW'' was active in a number of sporting activities, including playing \n4 years of varsity basketball, before his cum laude graduation from \nFurman University. Soon after he earned his law degree from that \nprestigious institution in 1929, William began to establish a well \ndeserved reputation as a capable and dedicated attorney whose integrity \nwas unimpeachable. Mr. Wilkins was forced to put his law practice aside \nto serve in the Navy during World War II, but upon his return to the \nUnited States, he founded the Wilkins Law Firm and remained its senior \npartner until his retirement in 1992.\n  A civic minded individual, Walter was actively involved in many \ncommunity activities and was recognized as an important regional \nleader. In addition to being a member of the Greenville County and \nSouth Carolina Bar Associations, he belonged to a number of other civic \ngroups and organizations. He was the Past Commander of the James F. \nDaniel, Jr. American Legion Post; a past Master of\n the Walden Masonic Lodge; and, Chairman of the Board of Directors of \nthe Greenville County American Legion Fair Association, where he served \nas chairman for 44 years and helped to raise many thousands of dollars \nto support the Legion. His commitment to civic service earned him many \nrecognitions and awards from groups as diverse as the American Legion, \nthe City of Greenville, and the Governor of South Carolina who \npresented him with our State's highest award, ``The Order of the \nPalmetto''.\n\n  Perhaps the one thing that Walter Wilkins loved more than practicing \nlaw was his family. He was very devoted to his lovely wife, Evelyn, and \ntheir three children: Nancy Wilkins Lydon; Judge William W. Wilkins, \nJr.; attorney and Speaker of the South Carolina House of \nRepresentatives, David H. Wilkins; and Dr. Robert T. Wilkins of Denver, \nColorado.\n  As a class project, one of Walter's grandchildren wrote a short essay \nabout him, and I would like to share an excerpt of it with you:\n\n       My grandfather, Walter Wilkins or ``Papa'', has had a great \n     influence on my life. Thanks in large part to ``Papa'', our \n     family name is well respected in the community. Having a \n     family tradition of which I am very proud means a great deal \n     to me. I was not really aware that ``Papa'' did more for us \n     than simply give us a little money at Christmastime until my \n     entire family gathered for a ceremony in ``Papa's'' honor by \n     a well-known organization in Greenville County. The speaker \n     talked a great deal about ``Papa's'' many contributions to \n     the community. It was then I realized how much we owe \n     ``Papa'' for our good name and reputation. ``Papa'' is not as \n     strong and healthy as he used to be, and I'm afraid he won't \n     be with us for too many more years. But his contributions to \n     our family will live on. He has given us a legacy of \n     integrity and honor, and taught us to always do our very \n     best. I know that's why he tried so hard to make clear to his \n     children and grandchildren when he would stress hard work in \n     our schoolwork and athletics. I can still picture in my mind \n     playing football and other sports in his backyard and looking \n     up at the window and making eye contact with him sitting \n     there watching me play, pulling for me to always do my best.\n\n  Certainly a moving and fitting tribute to a unique man. All those who \nknew Walter Wilkins, Sr. share the sense of loss his family must feel \nand they have our deepest sympathies on the passing of their father and \ngrandfather.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8019-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8019-S8020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE LATE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, LES ASPIN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, providing for the adequate defense of \nour Nation is a concern that members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the House Committee on National Security take quite \nseriously. Political differences are pushed aside in order to ensure \nthat our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen are well provided for, \nboth in the equipment they require to do their jobs and in being \ncompensated for their sacrifices in service to the United States. Over \nthe years, I have had the pleasure of working with a number of men and \nwomen on these committees who have demonstrated their commitment to our \npersonnel in uniform and for the security of the United States. One of \nthe most serious-minded and analytical of this group was the former \nchairman of the House Armed Services Committee and Secretary of \nDefense, Les Aspin, who unexpectedly passed away recently after \nsuffering a massive stroke.\n  A graduate of Yale, Oxford, and the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, Les was a man who dedicated almost his whole adult life to \nthe national security field. Les entered government service with Robert \nMcNamara and served in the Pentagon during the Vietnam War. After \ndeciding to leave the Department of Defense, Les turned to academia and \ntaught economics at Marquette for a year before running for, and being \nelected to, Congress where he served from 1971 until 1993. It was \nduring those years that I came to know Les well, especially as he \nclimbed the leadership ladder of the House Armed Services Committee. As \nits Chairman, he surprised, and even angered, a number of people with \nhis stands in favor of the MX missile, aid to the Contras, and for his \nsupport in our military efforts against Saddam Hussein. He assumed \nthese positions because he studied the issues, weighed their costs and \nbenefits, and acted in a manner that was in the best interests of the \nUnited States.\n  In 1992, his role as an advocate for the armed services brought him \nto the attention of then newly elected President Clinton, who decided \nthat Les would make an ideal Secretary of Defense. Resigning from his \npowerful seat in the House, Les again heeded the cry of service and \nassumed the Secretary's job, a position that some said he coveted and \nmany thought him ideal to hold. Unfortunately, his tenure in this post \nis not remembered with as much admiration as was his service in the \nCongress. [[Page S8020]] \n  The truth of the matter is that being the Secretary of Defense for \nBill Clinton was no easy task, especially in the first days of his \nadministration. President Clinton wanted to end the ban on gays in the \nmilitary, envisioned turning American troops over to the United \nNations, cutting defense, and committing U.S. forces to various \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping operation. As the man charged with \nimplementing these policy objectives, Les had an uphill struggle from \nthe time he stepped foot in the Pentagon. Given all the obstacles \nplaced before him, Les did a commendable job of working for the defense \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, Les Aspin was a man who was pleased to be able to \nserve his Nation and he worked hard in each endeavor he undertook. Some \nsay his zeal for work is what killed him, but I prefer to think that he \ngave his heart for his Nation. We all appreciate the sacrifices and \ncontributions that he made during his life and he will be missed by all \nthose who knew him.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8019-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, earlier today, President Vaclav Havel of \nthe Czech Republic received an honorary degree from Harvard and \ndelivered the commencement address.\n  President Havel's address is an eloquent analysis of the human \ncondition in our diverse, interdependent and increasingly technological \nworld, where the greatest achievements of humanity can also lead to the \ngreatest destruction. He speaks especially of the responsibility of \npoliticians and the mass media to enhance respect for individuals and \nfor other peoples, other nations, and other cultures, so that the \ndiscoveries of the modern age will be able to serve humanity, no \ndestroy it. As he states, ``Our conscience must catch up to our reason, \notherwise we are lost.''\n  I believe that President Havel's eloquent and thoughtful address will \nbe of interest to all of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the prepared text of the address may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the address was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Address by Vaclav Havel\n\n       Mr. President, Mr. Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen. \n     One evening not long ago I was sitting in an outdoor \n     restaurant by the water. My chair was almost identical to the \n     chairs they have in restaurants by the Vltava River in \n     Prague. They were playing the same rock music they play in \n     most Czech restaurants. I saw advertisements I'm familiar \n     with back home. Above all, I was surrounded by young people \n     who were similarly dressed, who drank familiar-looking \n     drinks, and who behaved as casually as their contemporaries \n     in Prague. Only their complexion and their facial features \n     were different--for I was in Singapore.\n       I sat there thinking about this and again--for the \n     umpteenth time--I realized an almost banal truth: that we now \n     live in a single global civilization. The identity of this \n     civilization does not lie merely in similar forms of dress, \n     or similar drinks, or in the constant buzz of the same \n     commercial music all around the world, or even in \n     international advertising. It lies in something deeper: \n     thanks to the modern idea of constant progress, with its \n     inherent expansionism, and to the rapid evolution of science \n     that comes directly from it, our planet has, for the first \n     time in the long history of the human race, been covered in \n     the space of a very few decades by a single civilization--one \n     that is essentially technological. The world is now enmeshed \n     in webs of telecommunication networks consisting of millions \n     of tiny threads or capillaries that not only transmit \n     information of all kinds at lightning speed, but also convey \n     integrated models of social, political and economic behavior. \n     They are conduits for legal norms, as well as for billions \n     and billions of dollars, crisscrossing the world while \n     remaining invisible even to those who deal directly with \n     them. The life of the human race is completely interconnected \n     not only in the informational sense, but in the causal sense \n     as well. Anecdotically, I could illustrate this by reminding \n     you--since I've already mentioned Singapore--that today all \n     it takes is a single shady transaction initiated by a single \n     devious bank clerk in Singapore to bring down a bank on the \n     other side of the world. Thanks to the accomplishments of \n     this civilization, practically all of us know what cheques, \n     bonds, bills of exchange, and stocks are. We are familiar \n     with CNN and Chernobyl, and we know who the Rolling Stones, \n     or Nelson Mandela, or Salman Rushdie are. More than that, the \n     capillaries that have so radically integrated this \n     civilization also convey information about certain modes of\n      human co-existence that have proven their worth, like \n     democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, the \n     laws of the market-place. Such information flows around \n     the world and, in varying degrees, takes root in different \n     places.\n       In modern times this global civilization emerged in the \n     territory occupied by European and ultimately by Euro-\n     American culture. Historically, it evolved from a combination \n     of traditions--classical, Judaic and Christian. In theory, at \n     least, it gives people not only the capacity for worldwide \n     communication, but also a coordinated means of defending \n     themselves against many common dangers. It can also, in an \n     unprecedented way, make our life on this earth easier and \n     open up to us hitherto unexplored horizons in our knowledge \n     of ourselves and the world we live in.\n       And yet there is something not quite right about it.\n       Allow me to use this ceremonial gathering for a brief \n     meditation on a subject which I have dwelt upon a great deal, \n     and which I often bring up on occasions resembling this one. \n     I want to focus today on the source of the dangers that \n     threaten humanity in spite of this global civilization, and \n     often directly because of it. Above all, I would like to \n     speak about the ways in which these dangers can be \n     confronted.\n       Many of the great problems we face today, as far as I \n     understand them, have their origin in the fact that this \n     global civilization, though in evidence everywhere, is no \n     more than a thin veneer over the sum total of human \n     awareness, if I may put it that way. This civilization is \n     immensely fresh, young, new, and fragile, and the human \n     spirit has accepted it with dizzying alacrity, without itself \n     changing in any essential way. Humanity has evolved over long \n     millennia in all manner of civilizations and cultures that \n     gradually, and in very diverse ways, shaped our habits of \n     mind, our relationship to the world, our models of behaviour \n     and the values we accept and recognize. In essence, this new, \n     single epidermis of world civilization merely covers or \n     conceals the immense variety of cultures, of peoples, of \n     religious worlds, of historical traditions and historically \n     formed attitudes, all of which in a sense lie ``beneath'' it. \n     At the same time, even as the veneer of world civilization \n     expands, this ``underside'' of humanity, this hidden \n     dimension of it, demands more and more clearly to be heard \n     and to be granted a right to life.\n       And thus, while the world as a whole increasingly accepts \n     the new habits of global civilization, another contradictory \n     process is taking place: ancient traditions are reviving, \n     different religions and cultures are awakening to new ways of \n     being, seeking new room to exist, and struggling with growing \n     fervour to realize what is unique to them and what makes them \n     different from others. Ultimately they seek to give their \n     individuality a political expression.\n       It is often said that in our time, every valley cries out \n     for its own independence or will even fight for it. Many \n     nations, or parts of them at least, are struggling against \n     modern civilization or its main proponents for the right to \n     worship their ancient gods and obey the ancient divine \n     injunctions. They carry on their struggle using weapons \n     provided by the very civilization they oppose. They employ \n     radar, computers, lasers, nerve gases, and perhaps, in the \n     future, even nuclear weapons--all products of the world they \n     challenge--to help defend their ancient heritage against the \n     erosions of modern civilization. In contrast with these \n     technological inventions, other products of this \n     civilization--like democracy or the idea of human rights--are \n     not accepted in many places in the world because they are \n     deemed to be hostile to local traditions.\n       In other words: the Euro-American world has equipped other \n     parts of the globe with [[Page S8021]] instruments that not \n     only could effectively destroy the enlightened values which, \n     among other things, made possible the invention of precisely \n     these instruments, but which could well cripple the capacity \n     of people to live together on this earth.\n       What follows from all of this?\n       It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a clear \n     challenge not only to the Euro-American world but to our \n     present-day civilization as a whole. It is a challenge to \n     this civilization to start understanding itself as a \n     multicultural and a multipolar civilization, whose meaning \n     lies not in undermining the individuality of different \n     spheres of culture and civilization but in allowing them to \n     be more completely themselves. This will only be possible, \n     even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code of mutual co-\n     existence, a kind of common minimum we can all share, one \n     that will enable us to go on living side by side. Yet such a \n     code won't stand a chance\n      if it is merely the product of a few who then proceed to \n     force it on the rest. It must be an expression of the \n     authentic will of everyone, growing out of the genuine \n     spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our common, \n     global civilization. If it is merely disseminated through \n     the capillaries of this skin, the way Coca-cola ads are--\n     as a commodity offered by some to others--such a code can \n     hardly be expected to take hold in any profound or \n     universal way.\n       But is humanity capable of such an undertaking? Is it not a \n     hopelessly utopian idea? Haven't we so lost control of our \n     destiny that we are condemned to gradual extinction in ever \n     harsher high-tech clashes between cultures, because of our \n     fatal inability to co-operate in the face of impending \n     catastrophes, be they ecological, social, or demographic, or \n     of dangers generated by the state of our civilization as \n     such?\n       I don't know.\n       But I have not lost hope.\n       I have not lost hope because I am persuaded again and again \n     that, lying dormant in the deepest roots of most, if not all, \n     cultures there is an essential similarity, something that \n     could be made--if the will to do so existed--a genuinely \n     unifying starting point for that new code of human co-\n     existence that would be firmly anchored in the great \n     diversity of human traditions.\n       Don't we find somewhere in the foundations of most \n     religions and cultures, though they may take a thousand and \n     one distinct forms, common elements such as respect for what \n     transcends us, whether we mean the mystery of Being, or a \n     moral order that stands above us; certain imperatives that \n     come to us from heaven, or from nature, or from our own \n     hearts; a belief that our deeds will live after us; respect \n     for our neighbours, for our families, for certain natural \n     authorities; respect for human dignity and for nature: a \n     sense of solidarity and benevolence towards guests who come \n     with good intentions?\n       Isn't the common, ancient origin or human roots of our \n     diverse spiritualities, each of which is merely another kind \n     of human understanding of the same reality, the thing that \n     can genuinely bring people of different cultures together?\n       And aren't the basic commandments of this archetypal \n     spirituality in harmony with what even an unreligious \n     person--without knowing exactly why--may consider proper and \n     meaningful?\n       Naturally, I am not suggesting that modern people be \n     compelled to worship ancient deities and accept rituals they \n     have long since abandoned. I am suggesting something quite \n     different: we must come to understand the deep mutual \n     connection or kinship between the various forms of our \n     spirituality. We must recollect our original spiritual and \n     moral substance, which grew out of the same essential \n     experience of humanity. I believe that this is the only way \n     to achieve a genuine renewal of our sense of responsibility \n     for ourselves and for the world. And at the same time, it is \n     the only way to achieve a deeper understanding among cultures \n     that will enable them to work together in a truly ecumenical \n     way to create a new order for the world.\n       The veneer of global civilization that envelops the modern \n     world and the consciousness of humanity, as we all know, has \n     a dual nature, bringing into question, at every step of the \n     way, the very values it is based upon, or which it \n     propagates. The thousands of marvelous achievements of this \n     civilization that work for us so well and enrich us can \n     equally impoverish, diminish, and destroy our lives, and \n     frequently do. Instead of serving people, many of these \n     creations enslave them. Instead of helping people to develop \n     their identities, they take them away. Almost every invention \n     or discovery--from the splitting of the atom and the \n     discovery of DNA to television and the computer--can be \n     turned against us and used to our detriment. How much easier \n     it is today than it was during the First World War to destroy \n     an entire metropolis in a single air-raid. And how much \n     easier would it be today, in the era of television, for a \n     madman like Hitler or Stalin to pervert the spirit of a whole \n     nation. When have people ever had the power we now possess to \n     alter the climate of the planet or deplete its mineral \n     resources or the wealth of its fauna and flora in the space \n     of a few short decades? And how much more destructive \n     potential do terrorists have at their disposal today than at \n     the beginning of this century?\n       In our era, it would seem that one part of the human brain, \n     the rational part which has made all these morally neutral \n     discoveries, has undergone exceptional development, while the \n     other part, which should be alert to ensure that these \n     discoveries really serve humanity and will not destroy it, \n     has lagged behind catastrophically.\n       Yes, regardless of where I begin my think- ing about the \n     problems facing our civilization, I always return to the \n     theme of human responsibility, which seems incapable of \n     keeping pace with civilization and preventing it from turning \n     against the human race. It's as though the world has simply \n     become too much for us to deal with.\n       There is no way back. Only a dreamer can believe that the \n     solution lies in curtailing the progress of civilization in \n     some way or other. The main task in the coming era is \n     something else: a radical renewal of our sense of \n     responsibility. Our conscience must catch up to our reason, \n     otherwise we are lost.\n       It is my profound belief that there is only one way to \n     achieve this: we must divest ourselves of our egotistical \n     anthropocentrism, our habit of seeing ourselves as masters of \n     the universe who can do whatever occurs to us. We must \n     discover a new respect for what transcends us: for the \n     universe, for the earth, for nature, for life, and for \n     reality. Our respect for other people, for other nations, and \n     for other cultures, can only grow from a humble respect for \n     the cosmic order and from an awareness that we are a part of \n     it, that we share in it and that nothing of what we do is \n     lost, but rather becomes part of the eternal memory of Being, \n     where it is judged.\n       A better alternative for the future of humanity, therefore, \n     clearly lies in imbuing our civilization with a spiritual \n     dimension. It's not just a matter of understanding its \n     multicultural nature and finding inspiration for the creation \n     of a new world order in the common roots of all cultures. It \n     is also essential that the Euro-American cultural sphere--the \n     one which created this civilization and taught humanity its \n     destructive pride--now return to its own spiritual roots and \n     become an example to the rest of the world in the search for \n     a new humility.\n       General observations of this type are certainly not \n     difficult to make, nor are they new or revolutionary. Modern \n     people are masters at describing the crises and the misery of \n     the world which we shape, and for which we are responsible. \n     We are much less adept at putting things right.\n       So what specifically is to be done?\n       I do not believe in some universal key or panacea. I am not \n     an advocate of what Karl Popper called ``holistic social \n     engineering'', particularly because I had to live most of my \n     adult life in circumstances that resulted from an attempt to \n     create a holistic Marxist utopia. I know more than enough, \n     therefore, about efforts of this kind.\n       This does not relieve me, however, of the responsibility to \n     think of ways to make the world better.\n       It will certainly not be easy to awaken in people a new \n     sense of responsibility for the world, an ability to conduct \n     themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever, and \n     to be held answerable for its condition one day. Who knows \n     how many horrific cataclysms humanity may have to go through \n     before such a sense of responsibility is generally accepted. \n     But this does not mean that those who wish to work for it \n     cannot begin at once. It is a great task for teachers, \n     educators, intellectuals, the clergy, artists, entrepreneurs, \n     journalists, people active in all forms of public life.\n       Above all it is a task for politicians.\n       Even in the most democratic of conditions, politicians have \n     immense influence, perhaps more than they themselves realize. \n     This influence does not lie in their actual mandates, which \n     in any case are considerably limited. It lies in something \n     else: in the spontaneous impact their charisma has on the \n     public.\n       The main task of the present generation of politicians is \n     not, I think, to ingratiate themselves with the public \n     through the decisions they take or their smiles on \n     television. It is not to go on winning elections and ensuring \n     themselves a place in the sun till the end of their days. \n     Their role is, something quite different: to assume their \n     share of responsibility for the long-range prospects of our \n     world and thus to set an example for the public in whose \n     sight they work. Their responsibility is to think ahead \n     boldly, not to fear the disfavor of the crowd, to imbue their \n     actions with a spiritual dimension (which of course is not \n     the same thing as ostentatious attendance at religious \n     services), to explain again and again--both to the public and \n     to\n      their colleagues--that politics must do far more than \n     reflect the interests of particular groups or lobbies. \n     After all, politics is a matter of serving the community, \n     which means that it is morality in practice. And how \n     better to serve the community and practice morality than \n     by seeking in the midst of the global (and globally \n     threatened) civilization their own global political \n     responsibility: that is, their responsibility for the very \n     survival of the human race?\n       I don't believe that a politician who sets out on this \n     risky path will inevitably jeopardize his or her political \n     survival. This is a wrongheaded notion which assumes that the \n     citizen is a fool and that political success depends on \n     playing to this folly. That is not the way it is. A \n     conscience slumbers in every human being, something divine. \n     And that is what we have to put our trust in.\n       Ladies and gentlemen,\n       I find myself at perhaps the most famous university in the \n     most powerful country in the world. With your permission, I \n     will say a few words on the subject of the politics of a \n     great power. [[Page S8022]] \n       It is obvious that those who have the greatest power and \n     influence also bear the greatest responsibility. Like it or \n     not, the United States of America now bears probably the \n     greatest responsibility for the direction our world will \n     take. The United States, therefore, should reflect most \n     deeply on their responsibility.\n       Isolationism has never paid off for the United States. Had \n     it entered the First World War earlier, perhaps it would not \n     have had to pay with anything like the casualties it actually \n     incurred.\n       The same is true of the Second World War. When Hitler was \n     getting ready to invade Czechoslovakia, and in so doing \n     finally expose the lack of courage on the part of the western \n     democracies, your President wrote a letter to the \n     Czechoslovak President imploring him to come to some \n     agreement with Hitler. Had he not deceived himself and the \n     whole world into believing that an agreement could be made \n     with this madman, had he instead shown a few teeth, perhaps \n     the Second World War need not have happened, and tens of \n     thousands of young Americans need not have died fighting in \n     it.\n       Likewise, just before the end of that war, had your \n     President, who was otherwise an outstanding man, said a clear \n     ``no'' to Stalin's decision to divide the world, perhaps the \n     Cold War, which cost the United States hundreds of billions \n     of dollars, need not have happened either.\n       I beg you: do not repeat these mistakes! You yourselves \n     have always paid a heavy price for them! There is simply no \n     escaping the responsibility you have as the most powerful \n     country in the world.\n       There is far more at stake here than simply standing up to \n     those who would like once again to divide the world into \n     spheres of interest, or subjugate others who are different \n     from them, and weaker. What is now at stake is saving the \n     human race. In other words, it's a question of what I've \n     already talked about: of understanding modern civilization as \n     a multicultural and multipolar civilization, of turning our \n     attention to the original spiritual sources of human culture \n     and above all, of our own culture, of drawing from these \n     sources the strength for a courageous and magnanimous \n     creation of a new order for the world.\n       Not long ago I was at a gala dinner to mark an important \n     anniversary. There were fifty Heads of State present, perhaps \n     more, who came to honor the heroes and victims of the \n     greatest war in human history. This was not a political \n     conference, but the kind of social event that is meant \n     principally to show hospitality and respect to the invited \n     guests. When the seating plan was given out, I discovered to \n     my surprise that those sitting at the table next to mine were \n     not identified simply as representatives of a particular \n     state, as was the case with all the other tables; they were \n     referred to as ``permanent members of the UN Security Council \n     and the G7'' I had mixed feelings about this. On the one \n     hand, I thought how marvelous that the richest and most \n     powerful of this world see each other often and even at this \n     dinner, can talk informally and get to know each other \n     better. On the other hand, a slight chill went down my spine, \n     for I could not help observing that one table had been \n     singled out as being special and particularly important. It \n     was a table for the big powers. Somewhat perversely, I began \n     to imagine that the people sitting at it were, along with \n     their Russian caviar, dividing the rest of us up among \n     themselves, without asking our opinion. Perhaps all this is \n     merely the whimsy of a former and perhaps future playwright. \n     But I wanted to express it here. For one simple reason: to \n     emphazise the terrible gap that exists between the \n     responsibility of the great powers and their hubirs. The \n     architect of that seating arrangement--I\n      should think it was none of the attending Presidents--was \n     not guided by a sense of responsibility for the world, but \n     by the banal pride of the powerful.\n       But pride is precisely what will lead the world to hell. I \n     am suggesting an alternative: humbly accepting our \n     responsibility for the world.\n       There is one great opportunity in the matter of co-\n     existence between nations and spheres of civilization, \n     culture and religion that should be grasped and exploited to \n     the limit. This is the appearance of supranational or \n     regional communities. By now, there are many such communities \n     in the world, with diverse characteristics and differing \n     degrees of integration. I believe in this approach. I believe \n     in the importance of organisms that lie somewhere between \n     nation states and a world community, organisms that can be an \n     important medium of global communication and co-operation. I \n     believe that this trend towards integration in a world \n     where--as I've said--every valley longs for independence, \n     must be given the greatest possible support. These organisms, \n     however, must not be an expression of integration merely for \n     the sake of integration. They must be one of the many \n     instruments enabling each region, each nation, to be both \n     itself and capable of co-operation with others. That is, they \n     must be one of the instruments enabling countries and peoples \n     who are close to each other geographically, ethnically, \n     culturally and economically and who have common security \n     interests, to form associations and better communicate with \n     each other and with the rest of the world. At the same time, \n     all such regional communities must rid themselves of fear \n     that other like communities are directed against them. \n     Regional groupings in areas that have common traditions and a \n     common political culture ought to be a natural part of the \n     complex political architecture of the world. Co-operation \n     between such regions ought to be a natural component of co-\n     operation on a world-wide scale. As long as the broadening of \n     NATO membership to include countries who feel culturally and \n     politically a part of the region the Alliance was created to \n     defend is seen by Russia, for example, as an anti-Russian \n     undertaking, it will be a sign that Russia has not yet \n     understood the challenge of this era.\n       The most important world organization is the United \n     Nations. I think that the fiftieth anniversary of its birth \n     could be an occasion to reflect on how to infuse it with a \n     new ethos, a new strength, and a new meaning, and make it the \n     truly most important arena of good co-operation among all \n     cultures that make up our planetary civilization.\n       But neither the strengthening of regional structures nor \n     the strengthening of the UN will save the world if both \n     processes are not informed by that renewed spiritual charge \n     which I see as the only hope that the human race will survive \n     another millennium.\n       I have touched on what I think politicians should do.\n       There is, however, one more force that has at least as \n     much, if not more, influence on the general state of mind as \n     politicians do.\n       That force is the mass media.\n       Only when fate sent me into the realm of high politics did \n     I become fully aware of the media's double-edged power. Their \n     dual impact is not a specialty of the media. It is merely a \n     part, or an expression of the dual nature of today's \n     civilization of which I have already spoken.\n       Thanks to television the whole world discovered, in the \n     course of an evening, that there is a country called Rwanda \n     where people are suffering beyond belief. Thanks to \n     television it is possible to do at least a little to help \n     those who are suffering. Thanks to television the whole \n     world, in the course of a few seconds, was shocked and \n     horrified about what happened in Oklahoma City and, at the \n     same time, understood it as a great warning for all. Thanks \n     to television the whole world knows that there exists an \n     internationally recognized country called Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina and that from the moment it recognized this \n     country, the international community has tried unsuccessfully \n     to divide it into grotesque mini-states according to the \n     wishes of warlords who have never been recognized by anyone \n     as anyone's legitimate representatives.\n       That is the wonderful side of today's mass media, or \n     rather, of those who gather the news. Humanity's thanks \n     belong to all those courageous reporters who voluntarily risk \n     their lives wherever something evil is happening, in order to \n     arouse the conscience of the world.\n       There is, however, another, less wonderful, aspect of \n     television, one that merely revels in the horrors of the \n     world or, unforgivably, makes them commonplace, or compels \n     politicians to become first of all television stars.\n      But where is it written that someone who is good on \n     television is necessarily also a good politician? I never \n     fail to be astonished at how much I am at the mercy of \n     television directors and editors, at hoe my public image \n     depends far more on them than it does on myself, at how \n     important it is to smile appropriately on television, or \n     choose the right tie, at how television forces me to \n     express my thoughts as sparely as possible, in witticisms, \n     slogans or sound bites, at how easily my television image \n     can be made to seem different from the real me. I am \n     astonished by this and at the same time, I fear it serves \n     no good purpose. I know politicians who have learned to \n     see themselves only as the television camera does. \n     Television has thus expropriated their personalities, and \n     made them into something like television shadows of their \n     former selves. I sometimes wonder whether they even sleep \n     in a way that will look good on television.\n       I am not outraged with television or the press for \n     distorting what I say, or ignoring it, or editing me to \n     appear like some strange monster. I am not angry with the \n     media when I see that a politician's rise or fall often \n     depends more on them than on the politician concerned. What \n     interests me is something else: the responsibility of those \n     who have the mass media in their hands. They too bear \n     responsibility for the world, and for the future of humanity. \n     Just as the splitting of the atom can immensely enrich \n     humanity in a thousand and one ways and, at the same time, \n     can also threaten it with destruction, so television can have \n     both good and evil consequences. Quickly, suggestively, and \n     to an unprecedented degree, it can disseminate the spirit of \n     understanding, humanity, human solidarity and spirituality, \n     or it can stupefy whole nations and continents. And just as \n     our use of atomic energy depends solely on our sense of \n     responsibility, so the proper use of television's power to \n     enter practically every household and every human mind \n     depends on our sense of responsibility as well.\n       Whether our world is to be saved from everything that \n     threatens it today depends above all on whether human beings \n     come to their senses, whether they understand the degree of \n     their responsibility and discover a new relationship to the \n     very miracle of Being. The world is in the hands of us all. \n     And yet some have a greater influence on its fate than \n     others. The more influence a person has--be they politician \n     or television announcer--the greater the demands placed on \n     their sense of responsibility and the less \n     [[Page S8023]] they should think merely about personal \n     interests.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, allow me a brief \n     personal remark. I was born in Prague and I lived there for \n     decades without being allowed to study properly or visit \n     other countries. Nevertheless, my mother never abandoned one \n     of her secret and quite extravagant dreams: that one day I \n     would study at Harvard. Fate did not permit me to fulfill her \n     dream. But something else happened, something that would \n     never have occurred even to my mother. I have received a \n     doctoral degree at Harvard without even having to study here.\n       More than that, I have been given to see Singapore, and \n     countless other exotic places. I have been given to \n     understand how small this world is and how it torments itself \n     with countless things it need not torment itself with if \n     people could find within themselves a little more courage, a \n     little more hope, a little more responsibility, a little more \n     mutual understanding and love.\n       I don't know whether my mother is looking down at me from \n     heaven, but if she is I can guess what she's probably \n     thinking: she's thinking that I'm sticking my nose into \n     matters that only people who have properly studied political \n     science at Harvard have the right to stick their noses into.\n       I hope that you don't think so.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8020-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 535.

A bill to establish a California ocean protection zone, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the california ocean protection act of 1995\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nCalifornia Ocean Protection Act of 1995. This act will provide \npermanent protection for California's Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] \nfrom the adverse effects of new offshore oil and gas development, deep-\nsea mining, at-sea incineration of toxic wastes, and harmful ocean \ndumping. This act will make management of the Federal OCS consistent \nwith State-mandated protection of State waters.\n  This act recognizes that the resources of the lands offshore \nCalifornia, and of the Pacific Ocean itself, are priceless. This act \nrecognizes that the real costs of offshore fossil fuel development, \nmining and toxic waste disposal far outweigh any benefits that might \naccrue from those activities. Finally, this act recognizes that \nrenewable uses of the ocean and OCS lands are irreplaceable elements of \na healthy, growing, California economy.\n  California's coast, from San Diego to Crescent City, is a natural \nmarvel. From the white sand beaches and secluded coves of southern \nCalifornia, to the grandeur of Big Sur, to the wild, rocky north, this \ncoast is one of the Earth's great wonders--enjoyed by Californians and \nvisitors from around the globe alike. But the California coast is much \nmore than a scenic treasure; it is a dynamic convergence of land and \nsea--a grand yet fragile system that ultimately depends on the health \nof the Pacific Ocean for its continued viability.\n  The cold, clear waters of the Pacific give life to a wealth of plant, \nfish, bird and marine mammal species. Some of those species in turn \nsupport California's multibillion-dollar fishing industry--an industry \nfounded on renewable resource management. Clean Pacific waters also \nform the basis for California's coastal tourism industry--valued at \nover $27 billion annually and creator of tens of thousands of jobs in \nCalifornia's economy.\n  Fishing and tourism are just two of the industries that we must weigh \nin the balance against non-sustainable, polluting uses of the ocean. \nThe other values supported by an unpolluted Pacific are less easily \nquantified, but every bit as important. These values are economic, \nscientific and, indeed, spiritual. These are the values that have \nsomehow gotten lost in the shuffle, as the Congress and past \nadministrations have debated the issue of developing California's \noffshore resources.\n  When those values are added to the scales and weighed against the \nbenefits to be obtained from non-sustainable exploitation, permanent \nprotection becomes the only viable choice. Consider that if all the \nunleased areas of the California coast were suddenly opened to oil and \ngas development,\n we would produce less than 60 days of oil for the nation at current \nrates of consumption. Such production would come at the certain cost of \noil spills, contamination by the toxic wastes and air emissions \ngenerated by offshore rigs and the increased risk of tanker accidents.\n\n  The Nation's interest in future energy security does not require that \nwe pay those costs. Conservation measures are now available that will \nachieve far greater oil savings than the California OCS can produce, \nwithout the environmental risks brought by development. For example, \nraising CAFE standards to a readily achievable 40 miles per gallon \nwould save 20 billion barrels of oil by 2020--over 18 times the \nestimated total California OCS reserves in unleased areas. And \nCalifornia is leading the nation in adopting an energy strategy that \nlessens our dependence on fossil fuels. Conservation programs already \nput in place by the State of California will save two billion barrels \nof oil over the next 20 years--almost twice the oil thought to lie in \nthe State's frontier offshore areas.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would bring the Federal OCS \nprogram for California into line with protection now in place for State \nwaters. The State legislature, working cooperatively with Gov. Pete \nWilson, has acted to protect most areas of the State tidelands that had \nnot already been protected from oil and gas development. The danger is \nthat unless we act Federal development will render protection of State \nwaters practically meaningless. To State the obvious: water flows. An \noilspill in Federal waters offshore California can rapidly foul State \nbeaches, contaminate nutrient-rich ocean upwellings upon which \nCalifornia's fishing industry depends [[Page S8035]] and destroy \nendangered species habitat in State tidelands.\n  In the same way it is misleading to believe that we can limit the \nhazards of offshore drilling by identifying and protecting \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. The ocean is a dynamic system--it is \nimpossible to protect one area--even if there were scientifically sound \ncriteria by which we could identify particularly sensitive areas--\nwithout also protecting adjacent areas. Permanent protection for as \nmuch of the system as possible again emerges as the only viable option.\n  This act does contain an exception for existing drilling operations. \nIn recognition of the economic importance of current offshore \ndevelopment in southern California, the act would only prohibit new \ndevelopment. Thus drilling now underway offshore Orange and Santa \nBarbara counties would be allowed to continue. New drilling in those \nareas would be stopped.\n  The act would also prohibit ocean mining, at-sea incineration of \ntoxic wastes and harmful ocean dumping. Each of these activities \nrepresents a threat to the marine environment and the coastal economy. \nEcologically and economically sound alternatives exist to each of these \nactivities. The prohibitions\n contained in this act recognized that the optimum value of the ocean \nis maintained only when it remains free of marine pollution caused by \nunnecessary exploitation.\n  I don't have to remind this body of the battles that have been fought \nover developing oil and gas offshore California. Interior Secretaries \nWatt and Hodel lined up with the oil industry to push for massive new \nleasing along the coast. That action was met by an opposite and more-\nthan-equal reaction from the Congress. Thirteen of the past fourteen \nInterior appropriations bills have contained 1-year leasing moratoria \non the lands offshore California. While the unreasonable approach of \npast administrations has necessitated such moratoria, I think everyone \nagrees that a more certain, long-term policy is called for. This year \nwith a Republican majority in Congress, we face a real threat that the \nmoratoria will not be extended.\n  This Act constitutes the long term policy and provides the certainty \nthat California needs. We now have a better understanding of the costs \nassociated with the activities this bill prohibits than we did when \nSecretary Watt fired his first salvo in the long battle over offshore \ndrilling. We have come to understand that the greenhouse effect, and \nthe global disaster it threatens, is a long-term effect of fossil fuel \nuse. We know that the U.S. has only 4 percent of the world's remaining \npetroleum reserves and that much of the remainder is in the volatile \nMiddle East--making the development of alternative forms of energy the \nonly true source of energy security.\n  America has the opportunity and the creativity to lead the way in \ndeveloping renewable resources and energy efficient innovations. We \nmust commit ourselves to those goals which will enable us to face the \nfuture with confidence and hope. Offshore drilling, dumping, \nincineration and mining offer only short-term benefits at extremely \nhigh long-term costs. These activities should not be part of our \nnational strategy for the future.\n  We have wasted far too much time fighting over a relatively \ninsignificant energy resource. That time could have been far more \nproductively spent devising real solutions to our energy needs. It is \ntime to put the debate over California OCS development behinds us so \nthat we can focus on developing the strategies and technologies that \nwill help us compete and win in the global economy of the 21st century. \nThe only way to achieve that goal is to permanently protect this \nresource.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to reduce the level of \nparticipation by the Small Business Administration in certain loans \nguaranteed by the Administration, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n\n\n           THE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as our Nation rushes toward the 21st \ncentury, we are living in a critical time for small business men and \nwomen. For over 40 years, it has been our Government's policy to \nencourage the growth of small business and entrepreneurship. With all \nthe discussion today about reinventing or reorganizing Government, I am \nconcerned that too much emphasis has shifted away from our Government's \nrole in promoting small business. We must be committed to deficit \nreduction, but we also must remain committed to the vital small \nbusiness sector of our economy.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I believe it is time \nto reassure America's small business owners and entrepreneurs that \ntheir Government is behind them 100 percent. During the past 10 years, \nas large businesses have restructured, laying off thousands of very \nable workers, small businesses have filled this void, creating up to \nfive new jobs for each person laid off as the result of a corporate \nrestructuring. During these years, economic growth has been fueled by \nsmall business. Fifty-four percent of America's work force now is \nemployed by small businesses which generate 50 percent of the gross \ndomestic product.\n  As we experience this period of restructuring and significant change \nin our business community, many small businesses have flourished. And \ntheir success has added to our Federal tax revenue base.\n  As small businesses are confronted with the uncertainties of a \nchanging Government, I believe we should provide them with positive \nassurance that their Government will continue to support them in the \nfuture. Therefore, I have developed the following five fundamental \nprinciples for reform, that define the critical role that the Small \nBusiness Administration should play as we prepare for the next fiscal \nyear and the next century.\n  First, consolidate and redesign small business loan guarantee \nprograms: Abolish all SBA direct loan programs except for Disaster \nAssistance. Implement a simpler and safer credit support role for SBA \nto encourage private sector loans to small business.\n  Second, make SBA an effective small business advocate: Change SBA's \nstructure and refocus SBA's resources to make it an effective advocate \nand ombudsman for small business on Federal governmental policy issues. \nSBA field offices and Small Business Development Centers should work \ntogether to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small \nbusinesses and act as a watchdog for excessive Federal regulatory \nbehavior.\n  Third, refocus SBA's role in small business Government contracting: \nRetain SBA's role to encourage Federal Government contracting \nopportunities available to all small businesses. Discontinue the \npractice of having SBA act as a contracting party with the Federal \nGovernment and then subcontracting with small businesses. Consider a \nnew Federal contracting preference for small business located in, and \nhiring employees from, high unemployment and low income areas.\n  Fourth, redesign SBA's role in small business venture capital: \nIncrease private sector responsibilities in funding SBA's Small \nBusiness Investment Company Program. Investigate authorizing a \nGovernment sponsored enterprise to issue pooled securities to fund \nventure capital investments made by SBIC's.\n  Fifth, shift small business counseling and management assistance to \nthe private sector: Phase out SBA's direct delivery of small business \nmanagement assistance and business counseling, and shift the cost of \nSBA sponsored management assistance increasingly to colleges, \nuniversities, and to the States. Encourage the lending community to \noffer business counseling to applicants for SBA guaranteed loans.\n  I am setting forth these five fundamentals for reform as a positive \nstatement to our Nation's small business community to assure them that \nGovernment reform does not mean they suddenly have been forgotten. And \nas a demonstration of my strong belief that we need to implement the \nreforms spelled out in the five fundamentals, today I am introducing \nthe Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995.\n  This legislation will increase the supply of loans available under \nthe Small Business Administration's 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan \nProgram. The direct beneficiaries of this bill are America's small \nbusiness men and women who otherwise would not be able to obtain \naffordable financing for their companies. The formula I have chosen for \nthis bill authorizes a combination of lower guarantee levels and higher \nlender fees to increase loan capacity and reduce the taxpayer subsidy \nof these loans.\n  The impact of these changes dramatically decreases the amount of the \nloan loss reserve that must be funded out of annual congressional \nappropriations. In fiscal year 1995, SBA's 7(a) loan program needed \n$215 million in appropriated funds to support a $7.8 billion guaranteed \nloan program. Under my bill, in fiscal year 1996, the 7(a) program can \ngrow to $11 billion but will only require $119 million in \nappropriations. While the loan program size increases by 41 percent, \nthere is a 44 percent decrease in taxpayer cost to fund the program.\n  This bill is structured to balance the demands of the popular 7(a) \nGuaranteed Business Loan Program with prudent fiscal management. While \nI am committed to balancing the Federal budget, I will work to retain \nand improve effective programs, like 7(a). I believe the dual avenue I \nam advocating--combining increased fees from lenders with a decreased \nappropriations level--creates the correct balance in these times of \nfiscal restraint.\n  Small business owners need access to capital, and the Small Business \nLending Enhancement Act of 1995 is the first step toward meeting the \nfinancing demands of small businesses. My bill is just a beginning. I \nwill continue to study additional enhancements for the 7(a) program, as \nwell as other ways to streamline and improve the manner in which we \ncarry out our Federal policy of encouraging our small business \ncommunity to continue its growth into the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and certain \nadditional materials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 895\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Consolidate and Redesign Small Business Loan Guarantee \n     Programs.\n       Abolish all SBA direct loan programs except for Disaster \n     Assistance. Implement a simpler and safer credit support role \n     for SBA to encourage private sector loans to small \n     businesses. Reduce the federal government's guarantee \n     exposure and shift more of the costs of this credit support \n     from the taxpayer to the private sector. Create an enhanced \n     role for secondary market transactions to compensate SBA for \n     the value of its guarantee. Change SBA's role in the program \n     from approving individual loans to one of carefully \n     regulating and overseeing increased responsibilities for \n     private sector program participants.\n       2. Make SBA an Effective Small Business Advocate.\n       Change SBA's structure and refocus SBA's resources to make \n     it an effective advocate and ombudsman for small business on \n     federal governmental policy issues. SBA field offices will \n     have a Small Business and Agriculture Ombudsman to work \n     together with Small Business Development Centers to offer \n     small business regulatory compliance assistance and act as a \n     watchdog for excessive or inappropriate regulatory \n     enforcement against small businesses by federal agencies. SBA \n     should receive citizen input in these activities from small \n     business volunteers appointed to newly-created Small Business \n     Regulatory Fairness Boards throughout the country.\n       3. Refocus SBA's Role in Small Business Government \n     Contracting.\n       Retain SBA's fundamental monitoring and informational role \n     to encourage the federal government to make government \n     contracting opportunities available to all small businesses \n     to the maximum extent possible. Discontinue the practice of \n     having SBA act as a contracting party with the federal \n     government and then subcontracting with small businesses. \n     Investigate the possibility of establishing a federal \n     contracting preference for small businesses located in, and \n     hiring a significant number of employees from, geographic \n     areas with high unemployment and low average incomes.\n       4. Redesign SBA's Role in Small Business Venture Capital.\n       Increase private sector responsibilities in the funding of \n     SBA's Small Business Investment Company program for small \n     business venture capital. Continue SBA's role in the \n     licensing and supervision of SBIC's. Investigate the \n     possibility of reducing federal funding of the SBIC program \n     and limiting guarantee exposure for individual company \n     investments by authorizing a government sponsored enterprise \n     to issue pooled securities to fund venture capital \n     investments made by SBIC's.\n       5. Shift Small Business Counseling and Management Assistant \n     to the Private Sector.\n       Phase out SBA's direct delivery of small business \n     management assistance and business counseling. Gradually \n     reduce SBA's subsidization of private sector business \n     assistance and counseling, shifting these costs increasingly \n     to colleges and universities, and to the states. Encourage \n     lenders participating in SBA's small business credit support \n     program to offer small business counseling to applicants for \n     SBA supported loans.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           The Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995\n\n\n                   participation in guaranteed loans\n\n       Reduces the maximum level of participation in guaranteed \n     loans as follows:\n       1. 75% guarantee rate\\1\\ on any loan participation \n     exceeding $100,000; or,\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       2. 80% guarantee rate\\2\\ on loan participation of less than \n     $100,000 (i.e., LowDoc loans).\n\n\n                             guarantee fees\n\n       A.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to make \ncertain technical corrections relating to physicians' services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          medicaid legislation\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich makes a technical correction to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1990 [OBRA 90]. These changes would allow pregnant women and \nchildren enrolled in the Medicaid Program to continue receiving \nservices from osteopathic physicians.\n  The 1990 provisions were meant to prevent unqualified physicians from \ncaring for Medicaid patients. Strict guidelines were enacted, requiring \nphysicians working with these populations to be certified in family \npractice, pediatrics, or obstetrics, by the applicable medical \nspecialty board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties \n[ABMS].\n  While the 1990 budget legislation recognizes the importance of the \nABMS in \n[[Page S8038]] certifying physicians trained in allopathics, it does \nnot recognize the authority of the American Osteopathic Association \n[AOA] in certifying osteopathic physicians. As one out of every four \nMedicaid recipients receives health care from an osteopath, this policy \nonly makes life more difficult for those on Medicaid.\n  It is important that we rectify this situation. Osteopaths have been \nan integral and vital part of our Nation's medical community for over a \ncentury. This important change ensures that our health care system \ncontinues to grow more accessible and reliable for those who depend \nupon it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and look forward to \nworking with them toward the bill's enactment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 897. A bill to provide for a nationally coordinated program of \nresearch, promotion, and consumer information regarding kiwifruit for \nthe purpose of expanding domestic and foreign markets for kiwifruit; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n the national kiwifruit research, promotion, and consumer information \n                                  act\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.\n Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to provide for a \nnationally coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer \ninformation regarding kiwifruit for the purpose of expanding domestic \nand foreign markets for kiwifruit.\n\n  This bill is identical to H.R. 1486 introduced in the House by \nCongressman Wally Herger, Congressman Vic Fazio, and others.\n  The kiwifruit industry is an important and growing sector in American \nagriculture, with tremendous potential to expand sales both at home and \nabroad through increased promotion and consumer education.\n  California presently represents 99 percent of the U.S. kiwifruit \nproduction.\n  Kiwifruit are commercially grown in Kern, Tulare, Fresno, San \nJoaquin, Yolo, Sutter, Butte, Yuba, and Colusa Counties.\n  Altogether, there are about 700 kiwifruit growers in my State.\n  In 1993, U.S. consumption of kiwifruit was 59 percent California \ngrown, 33 percent Chilean imports, and 8 percent New Zealand imports.\n  It is my understanding that Chilean exporters have expressed interest \nin participating with California growers in promoting kiwifruit to \nencourage increased domestic consumption and expand opportunities in \nforeign markets.\n  The self-help program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, \nwould be funded almost entirely by industry user fees. The industry \nwould assess benefiting domestic growers and importers to equitably \nshare in the costs.\n  Currently there are 18 similar federally authorized commodity \nresearch and promotion programs.\n  Once Congress approved the authorizing legislation, the promotion \nprogram must be approved by a majority of the handlers of kiwifruit, \nincluding the handlers of imported kiwifruit.\n  Specifically, this bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture \nto issue a federal order for kiwifruit research, promotion, and \nconsumer information; establish an eleven member kiwifruit board \ncomposed of six growers, four importers, and one member of the general \npublic to run the promotion program; authorize the kiwifruit board to \ncollect assessments, at no more than $0.10 per seven pound tray of \nkiwifruit, to pay for research, promotion, and consumer information and \nfor administrative expenses incurred by the kiwifruit board; authorize \nuse of the assessments not only for domestic generic promotion, but \nalso for promotion activities outside the United States; and require \nthe kiwifruit order to be approved by a majority of the producers and \nimporters and by a majority of those producing and importing more than \n50 percent of the total volume of kiwifruit produced and imported.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to allow \nfor prepayment of repayment contracts between the United States and the \nCentral Utah Water Conservancy District dated December 28, 1965, and \nNovember 26, 1985, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n[[Page S8041]]\n\n       the central utah project prepayment amendment act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I am introducing along with my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, a bill to extend the authority of \nthe Secretary of the Interior to accept prepayment of portions of the \nCentral Utah Project [CUP]. In 1992, Congress enacted Public Law 102-\n575 which contained the Central Utah Project Completion Act of CUPCA. \nSection 210 of CUPCA authorized the Secretary to negotiate and accept \nearly payment from the waterusers for the Jordan Aqueduct component of \nCUP. This prepayment ultimately proved to be a win/win deal for both \nthe Federal Government and for the waterusers. Shortly after the \nagreement was signed on October 18, 1993, which concluded the terms of \nthe prepayment, the Federal Government received a check from the local \nwaterusers totaling $35.2 million. The local water districts have also \nsaved money through the refinancing by shortening the total number of \npayments they must make.\n  The legislation we introduce today amends section 210 of the CUPCA \nbroadens the Secretary's ability to accept prepayment from the Central \nUtah Water Conservancy District for the rest of the District's debt to \nthe Federal\n government on the same terms and conditions that were negotiated for \nthe Jordan Aqueduct. According to estimates provided by the district's \nbonding counsel, it is expected that prepayment of the district's \nremaining debt could yield the Federal Treasury between $145 to $200 \nmillion over the next 4 to 5 years. Mr. President, this is a \nsignificant amount of money which we are in certain need of as we move \nto balance the Federal budget over the next 7 years. I want to say that \nthis bill does nothing with respect to title to the water project \nfeatures. They will remain in the name of the United States. This bill \nis a simple prepayment which will save the Central Utah Water \nConservancy District money by shortening its repayment term and will \nprovide the Federal Government a significant amount of revenue at a \nmost critical time. It is my understanding that the extension of this \nprepayment authority has been reviewed by the district with the \nSecretary's official representative to the CUP and that the Department \nof the Interior will support this legislation. I want to thank the \ndistrict and the Department of the Interior for working together to \nbring about this win-win scenario.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \nAdjustment Act of 1992 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of certain water \nreclamation and reuse projects and desalination research and \ndevelopment projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  THE RECLAMATION PROJECTS AUTHORIZATION AND ADJUSTMENT ACT AMENDMENTS \n                                OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Reclamation \nProjects Authorization and Adjustment Act Amendments of 1995. This \nlegislation amends title XVI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization \nand Adjustment Act of 1992 to expand participation of public water \nproviders in water reuse and recycling projects. This bill provides a \nsensible and lasting solution to the growing problem of dwindling \nmunicipal, industrial, and agricultural water supplies in many areas of \nthe country. This bill will also help protect and preserve \nenvironmentally sensitive watershed environments by reducing demand for \nfreshwater supplies.\n  In my home State, Utah, water is a precious commodity and this \nlegislation will allow for the better use and management of our limited \nwater supply. In particular, both Salt Lake City and St. George will \ngreatly benefit from this legislation.\n  Economically and environmentally, the next step to guaranteeing more \ndependable and cheaper supplies of water is water reuse and recycling. \nRecycling programs treat wastewater so that it can be safely used to \nirrigate land, golf courses, crops, and freeway medians, and replenish \ngroundwater basins. Recycled water is also increasingly being used by \nindustry.\n  In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation has ended their chapter of \nbuilding large western dams. Their mission now is to assist in the \nwater management of existing water supplies. From a public policy point \nof view, it is far cheaper to help our local western communities \nrecycle their water than it is to construct new reservoirs and water \ndelivery facilities. This legislation accomplishes this goal.\n  Past Federal legislation such as the Endangered Species Act and the \nCentral Valley Improvement Act have placed tremendous stress on fresh \nwater reserves by mandating that large portions of water sources be \ndiverted from use by municipal water suppliers to be dedicated to \ngeneral fish and wildlife and habitat purposes.\n  As a result, public water agencies have begun to search for \nalternative sources of water to meet the demands of rising populations \nand the limiting effects of regulatory burdens. The costs of importing \nwater over great distances or storing vast reserves of water have begun \nto make other sources of water more economically feasible. The added \nenvironmental benefits also make these sources increasingly desirable.\n  Title XVI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment \nAct of 1992 provides for water recycling projects and has been a major \nsuccess. It should be considered a model for other infrastructure \nfunding efforts. Compared to other Federal programs it is ``user \nfriendly'' and virtually free of red tape, and because the program is \nhighly leveraged, meaning 75 percent local cost sharing, it is not \nsubject to criticism for subsidizing unworthy projects. As a result the \nwater recycling program has enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Congress \nand from both the Bush and Clinton administrations. It is also backed \nby national and local environmental organizations.\n  Because of the success of Title XVI, communities from around the \ncountry are beginning to look at water recycling as not only an \nattractive new way to serve their customers but also the environment.\n  This is a unique, win-win program which goes a long way toward \npreparing for the future, preserving fresh water reserves protecting \nthe Nation's environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 901\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough June 7, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. \n218), show that current level spending is below the budget resolution \nby $5.6 billion in budget authority and $1.4 billion in outlays. \nCurrent level is $0.5 billion over the revenue floor in 1995 and below \nby $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$238.0 billion, $3.1 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 \nof $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated May 22, 1995, Congress cleared for the \nPresident's signature the 1995 emergency supplemental and rescissions \nbill (H.R. 1158). The President vetoed H.R. 1158; therefore, since my \nlast report there has been no action that affects the current level of \nbudget authority outlays or revenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, Oceans Day is celebrated annually to \ndraw attention to the critical need to cross national and political \nboundaries to protect and preserve the oceans which are among our vital \nresources. This year it is celebrated today, June 8, 1995.\n  Oceans, coastal waters, and estuaries cover over 70 percent of the \nEarth's surface and contain over 90 percent of the world's plants and \nanimals. The world's oceans provide ceaseless beauty and recreational \npleasure, but very importantly, they are an essential economic resource \nfor transportation and tourism, a reservoir of biological diversity, \nand a vital source of food, raw materials, and even new medicines. Yet \ntragically, our oceans are in peril from pollution, over-use of coastal \nand marine resources and habitat destruction.\n  As the president of the U.S. chapter of Global Legislators' \nOrganization for a Balanced Environment [GLOBE], a coalition of \ninternational legislators dedicated to creating an international \nenvironmental agenda, I recently co-chaired a bipartisan conference in \nWashington, DC on the state of our oceans. The conference brought \ntogether leading ocean researchers, advocates, and government officials \nto examine pressing environmental challenges related to the health of \nour planet's oceans. This was the first effort in the 104th Congress to \nseriously examine an environmental issue of international significance \nin a nonpartisan, nonconfrontational setting, and I believe it was a \ngreat success.\n  This year, on the fourth annual Oceans Day, a national conservation \ncollaborative, including the New England Aquarium, is launching a \ncampaign to preserve and restore the populations of large ocean fish \nsuch as tuna, sharks, and swordfish, and marlin. Over the past two \ndecades, as demand has increased, the populations of these fish have \nplummeted due to overfishing, poor management, and the killing of \nimmature fish and nontarget species. This is devastating news for the \nestimated one billion people, mostly in developing countries, who \ndepend on fish as their sole protein source. Developing sustainable \ninternational fisheries as a shared goal of GLOBE and the conservation \ncollaborative because the survival of our world's growing population \nmay depend on success in that endeavor.\n  I wholeheartedly agree with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution \nscientist Robert Ballard's assessment that, today, the oceans are more \nimportant to our survival than ever before. I hope that Oceans Day can \nraise the Nation's awareness of our dependence on the health of our \nworld's oceans, the current state of the oceans and the imperative to \nact rapidly and effectively to ensure their preservation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8046-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8046-S8047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n Mr. President, in accordance with rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby submit for publication in \nthe Congressional Record, the Rules of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, as amended.\n     Rules of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n\n                             general rules\n\n       Rule 1.

John is stepping \ndown from his post as gateway district manager for customer service and \nsales at the U.S. Postal Service.\n  A 39-year veteran of the Postal Service, John was appointed as \ngateway district manager in September 1992. In making this appointment, \nPostmaster General Marvin Runyon said at the time, ``We are pleased to \nhave John Goodman serving our customers.'' John's outstanding record of \nservice has made Mr. Runyon's 1992 observation even more meaningful and \naccurate.\n  John began his postal career as Postmaster in O'Fallon, IL after \nwhich he was elected secretary/treasurer of the National Association of \nPostmasters of the United States [NAPUS]. He was then elected NAPUS \npresident, serving at the Organization's Washington, DC headquarters. \nHaving completed his term, John returned to the Midwest in 1978 and was \nassigned to positions in Granite City, IL and later in Columbia, MO.\n  John also served as acting manager of the Grand Rapids Post Office as \npart of the Executive Exchange Program, and was the executive assistant \nfor customer relations in St. Louis, MO where he was appointed St. \nLouis Field Division General Manager/Postmaster in 1986.\n  John's extensive management and operational expertise has yielded an \nimpressive array of honors and citations. Under John Goodman's \nsupervision, the St. Louis Division won the prestigious Regional \nPostmaster General's Quality Award. John also won the Postmaster \nGeneral's Award for Excellence for the Union/Management Pairs [UMPS] \nprogram, as well as the National Postal Forum's Partnership for \nProgress Award for his dedication to customer service.\n  A native of O'Fallon, IL, John served in the Air Force and attended \nboth the University of Denver and Southern Illinois University in \nEdwardsville, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in business \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I join John Goodman's family and many friends in \ncongratulating him on an exemplary career, and wishing him all the best \nfor the future. Illinois, Missouri and the country have benefited \ngreatly from his superb service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8047-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8047-S8048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO NOKOMIS REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL, NEWPORT, ME\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President I would like to recognize the \noutstanding work being done by both students and faculty at Nokomis \nRegional High School in Newport, ME.\n  What is happening at Nokomis is truly exciting. Students and faculty, \nin their commitment to educational excellence, are making vital links \nbetween the classroom and the world around them. Whether in clubs that \nfoster an appreciation for wildlife, testifying before legislative \ncommittees, conducting research for State agencies, or helping to save \nthe black tern, Nokomis students are already making a positive \ndifference in the world while at the same time gaining valuable skills \nand knowledge.\n  Nothing mankind does occurs in a vacuum--neither should our \neducation. It is important that students and educators alike have a \nstrong feel for how knowledge gained today can have a direct impact on \nthe world of tomorrow. It is not simply enough to memorize \ninformation--you must also know why the information is important, and \nhow it can be used for the betterment of our world.\n  It is clear that the students and faculty at Nokomis High School have \npositioned themselves at the forefront of this philosophy. Educators at \nNokomis should be acclaimed for nurturing a love for learning; students \ndeserve credit for opening themselves to the opportunities presented to \nthem. All are to be commended for innovative and pro-active approaches \nto education. They are giving all of us perhaps the greatest gift of \nall--the chance for a brighter future, and a better world for \ngenerations to come.\n  The importance of what is happening at Nokomis cannot be overstated, \nparticularly in an age which will increasingly require skilled and \nknowledgeable professionals in a wide variety of fields. In particular, \nscientists with an environmental background will be in great demand as \nthe strain on the world's resources increases with global population. \nIndeed, efforts at Nokomis are an ideal model for others to follow, and \nI would encourage anyone in the field of education to look closely at \nwhat is being done at Nokomis.\n  Education is a top priority to me as a United States Senator, and I \nwant to thank the students and faculty of [[Page S8048]] Nokomis High \nSchool for setting the standard by which educational initiatives should \nbe judged. I believe that as the Nation charts a course for education, \nwe need look no further than Nokomis Regional High School in Newport, \nME as a shining example of our goals.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8047-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8048-S8049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     MASSACHUSETT'S CRANBERRY GROWERS CLARK AND GERALDINE GRIFFITH\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my home State of Massachusetts is \nthe leading producer, year in and year out, of cranberries in America \nand in the world. The economic contribution cranberries make to \nMassachusetts is impressive, with more than $200 million in payroll to \nMassachusetts workers and about 5,500 jobs for Massachusetts citizens. \nI am also proud that Ocean Spray's corporate headquarters are located \nin Middleboro, MA.\n  I invite the attention of my colleagues to the article which follows \nfrom the November 1994 edition of Yankee magazine. It tells a poignant \nand all-American story of one cranberry growing family, that of Clark \nand Geraldine Griffith. Mr. Griffith's family goes back to the 1700's \nlike many multigenerational cranberry families around our Nation. The \narticle tells an impressive story of the mechanization and \nmodernization of what remains, after all, a small family farming \noperation. It also reminds us of the vulnerability to weather and \ngovernmental actions of an important crop that is not subsidized by the \nFederal Government. And, most of all, it captures the spirit and the \nhard work of Massachusetts cranberry growers.\n  Both Clark and Geraldine Griffith are fine citizens of my State, and \nI commend this article to your reading. I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From Yankee magazine, November 1994]\n\n                Waiting for the Frost in Cranberry Land\n\n       Clark Griffith works one row of cranberry vines at a time, \n     driving his water-reel tractor back and forth in a decreasing \n     spiral. The ride is rough and swaying, and he has to brace \n     his legs and keep a secure grip on the wheel so as not to \n     fall. The water reflects the light up into his eyes, and \n     Griffith squints to see the long stake that marks the \n     submerged row just combed and the red and yellow flags that \n     indicate the location of irrigation ditches. At the end of a \n     row he bends forward, pulls out the stake with one hand, \n     quickly turns the wheel with the other, and hurls the stake \n     back into the bog. Water mists the air as the metal rods of \n     the cylindrical beater comb the vines, and berries bob \n     through the white foam to the surface. Amorphous, blood-red \n     trails foam in the wake.\n       Griffith, who owns 90 acres of bog, flooded this three-acre \n     section two days earlier and is now harvesting his cranberry \n     crop. A strapping man of 62 with peppery hair and a squarish \n     face, he runs the Griffith Cranberry Company in the town of \n     Carver, Massachusetts. Located about an hour's drive \n     southeast of Boston and just inland from historic Plymouth \n     Bay, the three precincts comprising the town--North, Center, \n     and South Carver--have more than 3,500 acres of active bogs: \n     Nearly half of the taxable land is directly or indirectly \n     cranberry related, and almost all of Carver's 121 growers are \n     members of the huge Ocean Spray cooperative. It is a town \n     where police cars sport the logo ``Cranberry Land USA'' and \n     cranberry vines are stenciled on the walls of the post \n     office.\n       Carver is justifiably called the Cranberry capital of the \n     world. From Labor Day through Halloween, the town's farmers \n     bring in their crop, flooding fields late at night and \n     working bleary-eyed days. In the late fall of 1993 Griffith \n     knows the harvest will be disappointing. He frowns as he \n     reaches into a bin and scoops up glistening berries. The \n     weather has made for a year of small berries. ``It takes a \n     lot of small fruit to fill a box,'' Griffith says. He drops \n     the berries and watches as they bounce in the bin.\n       Cranberries have always been a part of Carver. Up through \n     the 19th century, when Carver was a community of lumber \n     mills, gristmills, and iron furnaces, people gathered wild \n     cranberries solely for personal consumption. Griffith's \n     family moved here from Rochester, Massachusetts, around the \n     time in 1790 that the 847 souls who lived in Plympton's South \n     Precinct decided to secede from that community and form \n     Carver. His ancestors forged stoves, heaters, pans, and sinks \n     from the bog iron excavated from nearby Sampson Pond. But in \n     the late 19th century, as the iron industry began to wane, \n     his grandfather Alton and his great-uncle Lloyd decided to \n     start farming cranberries. Alton and Lloyd's first bog was \n     inconspicuously christened Bog One in 1902, and it still \n     produces good berries behind Griffith's house.\n       Griffith started serious work in the fields when he was 13 \n     and labored along with the 40 to 50 workers the family hired \n     at harvest time from the nearby mills in New Bedford. Pickers \n     then used hand scoopers, small wooden boxes with metal or \n     wooden teeth that were combed through the vines. ``When your \n     back got tired, you kneeled,'' recalls longtime Carver grower \n     Albertina Fernandes, ``and when your knees got tired, you \n     stood up.'' But for Griffith, the work was exciting. ``I \n     always considered harvest season to be fun,'' he says. ``I \n     grew up with it, and there was always a gang around laughing \n     and joking.''\n       Mechanization in the mid-1950s revolutionized the industry. \n     ``It used to take 60 days to do 60 acres. We can now do four \n     to six acres in a day,'' says Griffith, who employs only four \n     fulltime workers. Most equipment is handmade, much of it \n     cannibalized from old cars and trucks. ``When someone \n     discards a piece of equipment, that is what we use,'' says \n     Wayne Hannula, a grower who constructs sanders from old Dodge \n     pickups. ``We all built our own equipment because we all know \n     what we want.''\n       If the temperature drops too low, it can kill the berries, \n     so there are now daily frost reports. Many farmers have a \n     Chatterbox, an electronic monitoring device that calls them \n     on the phone if it gets too cold. If that happens, the grower \n     has to flood the bogs so that the berries will not freeze. \n     ``The frost can come anytime,'' says Griffith. ``Sometimes it \n     is 4:30 in the morning, and you dash out. Fortunately, I have \n     all electric sprinklers, so all I have to do is snap \n     switches.'' Yet even with the innovations, the work still has \n     its hardships. ``If you have worked all day and the frost \n     comes early, you don't get any sleep,'' says Griffith. ``By \n     three o'clock in the morning, you are pretty tired. You try \n     not to stumble over things and fall in the water while \n     jumping ditches.''\n       Even with machinery there are losses. ``I had an evening \n     when I got caught flat-footed,'' Griffith recalls of a night \n     in the early 1970s. ``The frost came early in the\n      evening, and I didn't have sprinkler systems on all the \n     acreage. I had to flood a lot of it. We did everything we \n     could, but we lost a lot of cranberries that night.'' One \n     of the area's smaller growers lost part of his crop when a \n     neighbor--a newcomer to town--shut off his sprinklers and \n     left a note: ``Water your crops in the daytime; the noise \n     of the engines keeps us awake.''\n       Griffith has experienced all the unexpected calamities that \n     have racked cranberry farmers. The worst event to befall the \n     industry, though, was not a natural calamity but a simple \n     government pronouncement. On November 9, 1959, the Secretary \n     of Health, Education, and Welfare announced that an \n     experimental weed killer, Aminotriazole, that was used by \n     some cranberry growers, had caused cancer in laboratory \n     animals. The market immediately dried up.\n       ``We were done picking,'' recalls Griffith, ``and we had a \n     nice crop of berries sitting in the screen house. Of course \n     no one knew what was going to happen to them until the \n     decision was made by Ocean Spray and the government to dump \n     the berries. They came to us and counted the boxes. Then the \n     berries were just poured into dump trucks and taken away.''\n       Aminotriazole is no longer sprayed on crops, and growers \n     are required to keep detailed records on the chemicals they \n     use. Griffith has files in his office dating back decades. \n     The office is located just up the street from his home. There \n     are maps of the bogs on the wall, a computer linkup to Ocean \n     Spray, and a stained-glass window of a cranberry scooper. He \n     stops by in order to retrieve from his computer information \n     on the previous day's delivery to the Ocean Spray processing \n     plant. He then picks up a stack of papers and drives to the \n     town hall in center Carver. He hitches himself out of his \n     pickup, and bog soil flecks off his shoes as he lumbers \n     toward the building. A gray-haired man greets him in the \n     hall.\n       ``Clark, how is your crop?'' he nervously inquires.\n       ``Terrible,'' Griffith frowns as he shakes his head. ``How \n     about you?''\n       ``I got about three-quarters of what I got last year.''\n       ``Everyone says that it is going to be down,'' Griffith \n     shrugs his shoulders. ``It's not what Ocean Spray estimated. \n     It can't be a bumper crop every year.''\n       When Griffith finishes at the town hall, he heads back to \n     his bogs. Around noon Griffith's wife, Geraldine, brings \n     coffee and brownies to Bog 20. The men and women emerge from \n     the water and enjoy a few moments of rest. After the break \n     Angel Vasquez mounts the water reel and starts harvesting the \n     rows. Workers smooth the floating fruit carpet with shiny \n     aluminum pushers while others corral the berries with a \n     series of long, white wooden booms. Water presses against the \n     sides of their chest-high rubber waders as firm cranberries \n     bob against their calves. Swarms of small black spiders \n     scamper over the thickening red mass toward the shore. \n     Swallows flock to the water to gather the unexpected bounty.\n       Griffith drives the winding series of bumpy one-lane dirt \n     roads, checking on his other crews, tending the levels of his \n     various bogs, flooding some and draining others. Before he \n     eats dinner with Geraldine, Griffith checks on the latest \n     frost report and plans for the evening vigil. He talks of \n     slowing down, of doing less work. His house is backed by the \n     moss-covered pines that surround the land. It has a beautiful \n     view of the bog, of the dark green vines that his family has \n     spent generations tending and harvesting. One day it will \n     make for a tranquil retirement spot. But now, after dinner, \n     Griffith drives over to a [[Page S8049]] pump house and draws \n     water from Sampson Pond to flood Bog 22 for the morning pick. \n     When he returns home, he checks the weather and \n     waits.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8048-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8048-S8049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     MASSACHUSETT'S CRANBERRY GROWERS CLARK AND GERALDINE GRIFFITH\n Mr. KERRY.

The ride is rough and swaying, and he has to brace \n     his legs and keep a secure grip on the wheel so as not to \n     fall. The water reflects the light up into his eyes, and \n     Griffith squints to see the long stake that marks the \n     submerged row just combed and the red and yellow flags that \n     indicate the location of irrigation ditches. At the end of a \n     row he bends forward, pulls out the stake with one hand, \n     quickly turns the wheel with the other, and hurls the stake \n     back into the bog. Water mists the air as the metal rods of \n     the cylindrical beater comb the vines, and berries bob \n     through the white foam to the surface. Amorphous, blood-red \n     trails foam in the wake.\n       Griffith, who owns 90 acres of bog, flooded this three-acre \n     section two days earlier and is now harvesting his cranberry \n     crop. A strapping man of 62 with peppery hair and a squarish \n     face, he runs the Griffith Cranberry Company in the town of \n     Carver, Massachusetts. Located about an hour's drive \n     southeast of Boston and just inland from historic Plymouth \n     Bay, the three precincts comprising the town--North, Center, \n     and South Carver--have more than 3,500 acres of active bogs: \n     Nearly half of the taxable land is directly or indirectly \n     cranberry related, and almost all of Carver's 121 growers are \n     members of the huge Ocean Spray cooperative. It is a town \n     where police cars sport the logo ``Cranberry Land USA'' and \n     cranberry vines are stenciled on the walls of the post \n     office.\n       Carver is justifiably called the Cranberry capital of the \n     world. From Labor Day through Halloween, the town's farmers \n     bring in their crop, flooding fields late at night and \n     working bleary-eyed days. In the late fall of 1993 Griffith \n     knows the harvest will be disappointing. He frowns as he \n     reaches into a bin and scoops up glistening berries. The \n     weather has made for a year of small berries. ``It takes a \n     lot of small fruit to fill a box,'' Griffith says. He drops \n     the berries and watches as they bounce in the bin.\n       Cranberries have always been a part of Carver. Up through \n     the 19th century, when Carver was a community of lumber \n     mills, gristmills, and iron furnaces, people gathered wild \n     cranberries solely for personal consumption. Griffith's \n     family moved here from Rochester, Massachusetts, around the \n     time in 1790 that the 847 souls who lived in Plympton's South \n     Precinct decided to secede from that community and form \n     Carver. His ancestors forged stoves, heaters, pans, and sinks \n     from the bog iron excavated from nearby Sampson Pond. But in \n     the late 19th century, as the iron industry began to wane, \n     his grandfather Alton and his great-uncle Lloyd decided to \n     start farming cranberries. Alton and Lloyd's first bog was \n     inconspicuously christened Bog One in 1902, and it still \n     produces good berries behind Griffith's house.\n       Griffith started serious work in the fields when he was 13 \n     and labored along with the 40 to 50 workers the family hired \n     at harvest time from the nearby mills in New Bedford. Pickers \n     then used hand scoopers, small wooden boxes with metal or \n     wooden teeth that were combed through the vines. ``When your \n     back got tired, you kneeled,'' recalls longtime Carver grower \n     Albertina Fernandes, ``and when your knees got tired, you \n     stood up.'' But for Griffith, the work was exciting. ``I \n     always considered harvest season to be fun,'' he says. ``I \n     grew up with it, and there was always a gang around laughing \n     and joking.''\n       Mechanization in the mid-1950s revolutionized the industry. \n     ``It used to take 60 days to do 60 acres. We can now do four \n     to six acres in a day,'' says Griffith, who employs only four \n     fulltime workers. Most equipment is handmade, much of it \n     cannibalized from old cars and trucks. ``When someone \n     discards a piece of equipment, that is what we use,'' says \n     Wayne Hannula, a grower who constructs sanders from old Dodge \n     pickups. ``We all built our own equipment because we all know \n     what we want.''\n       If the temperature drops too low, it can kill the berries, \n     so there are now daily frost reports. Many farmers have a \n     Chatterbox, an electronic monitoring device that calls them \n     on the phone if it gets too cold. If that happens, the grower \n     has to flood the bogs so that the berries will not freeze. \n     ``The frost can come anytime,'' says Griffith. ``Sometimes it \n     is 4:30 in the morning, and you dash out. Fortunately, I have \n     all electric sprinklers, so all I have to do is snap \n     switches.'' Yet even with the innovations, the work still has \n     its hardships. ``If you have worked all day and the frost \n     comes early, you don't get any sleep,'' says Griffith. ``By \n     three o'clock in the morning, you are pretty tired. You try \n     not to stumble over things and fall in the water while \n     jumping ditches.''\n       Even with machinery there are losses. ``I had an evening \n     when I got caught flat-footed,'' Griffith recalls of a night \n     in the early 1970s. ``The frost came early in the\n      evening, and I didn't have sprinkler systems on all the \n     acreage. I had to flood a lot of it. We did everything we \n     could, but we lost a lot of cranberries that night.'' One \n     of the area's smaller growers lost part of his crop when a \n     neighbor--a newcomer to town--shut off his sprinklers and \n     left a note: ``Water your crops in the daytime; the noise \n     of the engines keeps us awake.''\n       Griffith has experienced all the unexpected calamities that \n     have racked cranberry farmers. The worst event to befall the \n     industry, though, was not a natural calamity but a simple \n     government pronouncement. On November 9, 1959, the Secretary \n     of Health, Education, and Welfare announced that an \n     experimental weed killer, Aminotriazole, that was used by \n     some cranberry growers, had caused cancer in laboratory \n     animals. The market immediately dried up.\n       ``We were done picking,'' recalls Griffith, ``and we had a \n     nice crop of berries sitting in the screen house. Of course \n     no one knew what was going to happen to them until the \n     decision was made by Ocean Spray and the government to dump \n     the berries. They came to us and counted the boxes. Then the \n     berries were just poured into dump trucks and taken away.''\n       Aminotriazole is no longer sprayed on crops, and growers \n     are required to keep detailed records on the chemicals they \n     use. Griffith has files in his office dating back decades. \n     The office is located just up the street from his home. There \n     are maps of the bogs on the wall, a computer linkup to Ocean \n     Spray, and a stained-glass window of a cranberry scooper. He \n     stops by in order to retrieve from his computer information \n     on the previous day's delivery to the Ocean Spray processing \n     plant. He then picks up a stack of papers and drives to the \n     town hall in center Carver. He hitches himself out of his \n     pickup, and bog soil flecks off his shoes as he lumbers \n     toward the building. A gray-haired man greets him in the \n     hall.\n       ``Clark, how is your crop?'' he nervously inquires.\n       ``Terrible,'' Griffith frowns as he shakes his head. ``How \n     about you?''\n       ``I got about three-quarters of what I got last year.''\n       ``Everyone says that it is going to be down,'' Griffith \n     shrugs his shoulders. ``It's not what Ocean Spray estimated. \n     It can't be a bumper crop every year.''\n       When Griffith finishes at the town hall, he heads back to \n     his bogs. Around noon Griffith's wife, Geraldine, brings \n     coffee and brownies to Bog 20. The men and women emerge from \n     the water and enjoy a few moments of rest. After the break \n     Angel Vasquez mounts the water reel and starts harvesting the \n     rows. Workers smooth the floating fruit carpet with shiny \n     aluminum pushers while others corral the berries with a \n     series of long, white wooden booms. Water presses against the \n     sides of their chest-high rubber waders as firm cranberries \n     bob against their calves. Swarms of small black spiders \n     scamper over the thickening red mass toward the shore. \n     Swallows flock to the water to gather the unexpected bounty.\n       Griffith drives the winding series of bumpy one-lane dirt \n     roads, checking on his other crews, tending the levels of his \n     various bogs, flooding some and draining others. Before he \n     eats dinner with Geraldine, Griffith checks on the latest \n     frost report and plans for the evening vigil. He talks of \n     slowing down, of doing less work. His house is backed by the \n     moss-covered pines that surround the land. It has a beautiful \n     view of the bog, of the dark green vines that his family has \n     spent generations tending and harvesting. One day it will \n     make for a tranquil retirement spot. But now, after dinner, \n     Griffith drives over to a [[Page S8049]] pump house and draws \n     water from Sampson Pond to flood Bog 22 for the morning pick. \n     When he returns home, he checks the weather and \n     waits.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8048-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8049-S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         PARTNERS OUTDOORS FAIR\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the \nattention of my colleagues a most unusual and informative event which \ntook place in the Senate Energy Committee hearing room on May 8 and 9. \nThe first Partners Outdoors Fair was hosted by the committee and \norganized by six Federal agencies and the Recreation Roundtable, a \ngroup comprised of the chief executives of more than 20 of the leading \nrecreation-oriented companies in America. The fair was a great success, \ncelebrating the imaginative and effective work taking place across the \nnation through partnerships involving Federal, State and local \nagencies, private corporations and others.\n  The idea for the Partners Outdoors Fair was conceived in early 1995 \nat the Partners Outdoors conference in Florida, an annual meeting of \npublic and private organization leaders committed to the protection of \nAmerica's wonderful outdoors resources and the enhancement of the \nrecreational experiences of visitors to federally-managed areas. \nCandidates for programs to be showcased at the fair were submitted by \nall six Federal agencies taking part in the conference: the Forest \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau \nof Reclamation. From the dozens of submissions, 20 displays were \nselected to represent diversity in focus, partners and size.\n  As chairman for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nI was very enthusiastic upon learning of the plans for the fair and was \npleased to offer the use of our hearing room for this important 2-day \nevent. As you might guess, Mr. President, I was particularly \nenthusiastic about those displays that showcased successful programs in \nmy State of Alaska. One of these, an eye-catching display describing \nfishing restoration efforts and the Wallop-Breaux Fund, prominently \nfeatured the creation of a new sportfishing opportunity at Homer Spit \nin Alaska. Thanks to the determined efforts of the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service and several State agencies--as well as to the millions \nof Americans whose purchases of fishing equipment and motorboat fuels \nmake the Wallop-Breaux fund viable--Homer Spit has seen a steady return \nof large chinook salmon and has been made more accessible to children, \nthe elderly and those with physical disabilities.\n  Another display featured a successful partnership including ARCO, the \nAnchorage School District, the National Audabon Society, Alaska Pacific \nUniversity, and the BLM. The diverse collection of entities polled its \nresources to design the Campbell Creek Environmental Education Center, \na 10,000-square foot facility that will be built by the BLM on Campbell \nTract in Anchorage. Targeted for completion in 1996, the Campbell Creek \nfacility will provide children and others with the opportunity to \nexperience the outdoors, learn about wildlife and understand the role \npeople play in the local and global environments. The center will also \npromote behaviors, practices and lifestyles that have minimal impact on \nthe environment. Still another display described the interpretive \nprograms used aboard cruise ships that ferry visitors to Alaska's \nmajestic Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. These programs greatly \nenhance the cruise experience and are the result of a collaborative \neffort between companies such as Holland America and the National Park \nService.\n  The fair features many other outstanding displays about partnerships \nin operation around the country, and those who stopped by saw that the \nnumber of partners involved was breathtakingly large and diverse. For \nexample, a program entitled ``WOW--Wonderful Outdoor World,'' which \naims at introducing city kids to the pleasures of camping and other \noutdoor recreational activities, was established with contributions \nfrom the Walt Disney Co., the city of Los Angeles, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Coleman Co., Chevy/Geo, California State University at \nLong Beach, and the U.S. Forest Service, among others. Another good \nexample was Tread Lightly, a program to help protect public and private \nlands through the responsible use of off-highway vehicles. Tread \nLightly involves the Forest Service, Four Wheeler Magazine, the Izaak \nWalton League, Goodyear, Jeep, Honda, Toyota, Ranger Rover, the Perlman \nGroup, and Warn Industries. There were many others worthy of mention. \nMr. President, I would ask that a complete list and description of the \nfeatured displays appear in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, there have long been, and continue to be, debates in \nthis country over whether the private or public sector can accomplish \ncertain tasks more effectively. And today, perhaps more than at any \nother time since the drafting of the Constitution, there is much \ndiscussion about whether State and local governments are better \nequipped for certain tasks than the Federal Government. I do not expect \nthat a relatively small, 2-day event in the Senate Energy Committee \nhearing room will by itself lay these contentions debates to rest. \nHowever, I do believe the Partners Outdoors Fair made great strides in \ncalling our attention to the fact that it does not always have to be \none or the other. The public sector can work with the private sector, \nand the Federal Government can work with State and local governments. \nIn fact, when the particular resources and expertise of each come \ntogether in a collaborative effort, the results are precisely what we \nsaw on display on May 8 and 9. In addition, the projects displayed at \nthe fair made clear that\n progress can be made even without large increases in Federal budgets \nand even without specific legislative direction.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to mention an important event that \ntook place on the afternoon of May 9, as the Partners Outdoors Fair was \nwinding to a close. At that time, I joined with Francis Pandolfi, the \npresident and CEO of Times Mirror Magazines and chairman of the \nRecreation Roundtable, in a news conference at which the Recreation \nRoundtable released the results of its latest national survey of public \nattitudes regarding outdoor recreation. Joining us was Edward Keller, \nexecutive vice president of Roper Starch Worldwide, the organization \nthat performed the study for the roundtable. One of the most \ninteresting aspects of this event was the presentation of a new \nnational index--the Recreation Quality Index [RQI]--which reflects \npublic perceptions regarding changes in recreation opportunities, \nquality of experience and personal participation. Regarding the \nsignificance of this development, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. \nPandolfi, who called the RQI ``a new, important expression of public \nopinion which can help guide and measure the impact of policy decisions \nin Washington and decisions by companies providing recreation goods and \nservices. The RQI provides the first comprehensive reflection of \nsatisfaction with outdoor recreation in America--not just a specific \nservice provided or a specific recreational product.''\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to heed these words \nand to carefully study the recreational needs of the American people \nwhen considering legislation that affects our public lands and other \nissues that affect the $300 billion plus recreation industry in \nAmerica.\n  The material follows:\n\n                        Partners Outdoors--1995\n\n\n          fisheries restoration: successes from coast to coast\n\n       America's anglers and boaters pay special federal taxes and \n     fees totaling more than $300 million annually--most of which \n     is deposited into the Wallop-Breaux Fund. A sizeable portion \n     of that money is then provided as grants to state fisheries \n     agencies for fisheries research, habitat improvements, \n     fisheries management activities and for expanded access to \n     public waters by anglers and boaters. The monies have had \n     direct and very successful consequences for fisheries from \n     coast to coast. In Alaska, Wallop-Breaux funding was used to \n     create a new sportfishing opportunity at Homer Spit, close to \n     the homes of many Alaskans and accessible by children, \n     persons with physical challenges and the elderly. Research \n     into sensory impregnation has brought a steady return of \n     large Chinook salmon to an area previously without any \n     sizable run.\n       Similarly, federal assistance has been used on the east \n     coast by Maryland and other states to arrest the precipitous \n     decline in striped bass populations. Research efforts \n     [[Page S8050]] and fisheries management activities qualified \n     for 75% federal funding. As in many cases, the decline in the \n     fishery was attributable to a combination of pollution and \n     over-fishing. States along the east coast responded with an \n     ambitious recovery plan, limiting fishing and undertaking \n     some mitigation projects. The result is a strong return of \n     this popular sportfish in the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding \n     areas and a reopening of fishing for this species.\n       Partners in this effort include the millions of Americans \n     purchasing fishing tackle and motorboat fuels, the fishing \n     tackle industry which ``fronts'' the tax monies, the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service and state fish and wildlife \n     agencies across the nation.\n\n\n                  aquatic resources education efforts\n\n       Aquatic Resources Education Programs are underway across \n     the nation, thanks to Wallop-Breaux partners. Focusing \n     chiefly on youth, the programs teach subjects as diverse as \n     science and safety, fishing techniques and ethics. Up to 10% \n     of each state's Wallop-Breaux Fund allocation can be used for \n     these programs; overall, about 5% of the total funding to \n     states is being spent on these efforts. In ten years, some \n     two million young people have participated in state aquatic \n     resources education projects, and the programs are growing in \n     size and sophistication.\n       One of the imaginative partnerships which has evolved in \n     aquatic resources education has been Pathway to Fishing. \n     Initiated by Outdoor Technologies Group and expanded to \n     include federal agencies ranging from the Forest Service and \n     the Bureau of Land Management to the Bureau of Reclamation as \n     well as Wal-Mart and other companies, Pathway events have \n     occurred at hundreds of sites across the nation. Pathway can \n     be conducted by a lake, river or pond--or even in a parking \n     lot or open field. Kids learn and have fun, regardless. \n     Volunteers from organizations such as B.A.S.S. and Trout \n     Unlimited as well as federal and state agencies act as \n     instructors in this 12-learning station effort.\n       Another major focus of aquatic resources education is \n     National Fishing Week, which began on June 5. Hundreds of \n     events will be held across the nation. Partners in this \n     effort include the American Sportfishing Association, fishing \n     tackle companies, federal and state agencies, recreational \n     fishing organizations and the media.\n\n\n    wallop/breaux: making our waters better for boating and fishing\n\n       Although relatively new, the Wallop/Breaux program is \n     already causing tremendous positive changes in fishing and \n     boating--as well as in the health of our nation's surface \n     waters. Using a 10% federal excise tax at the manufacturer/\n     importer level imposed with the support of industry plus the \n     federal motorfuel excise tax collected on gas used in \n     recreational boating, Wallop/Breaux provides grants to states \n     for fisheries management, for improved boating and fishing \n     access, for aquatic resources education programs, for \n     wetlands restoration, for construction of marine waste \n     disposal sites and for boating safety efforts by the U.S. \n     Coast Guard and state and local agencies.\n       Using 3:1 matching federal grants, Wallop/Breaux program \n     partners accomplished the following between 1986 and 1993: \n     built 1600 new public boat launching ramps and related \n     facilities, including parking areas and restrooms; improved \n     9,700 public boat ramps; built 600 roads to open up access to \n     public waters; installed directional signs for thousands of \n     boating and fishing access sites; developed over 1,500 new \n     fishing access sites; and acquired at least 170 properties \n     and over 50,000 strategic acres to improve access to public \n     waters.\n       In 1992, the Wallop-Breaux program was amended to add a new \n     emphasis on wetlands restoration. A new revenue source--the \n     federal excise tax on fuels used in lawnmowers, chainsaws, \n     snowblowers and other small-engine items--was approved by the \n     Congress. Approximately $50 million per year is now invested \n     in this wetlands effort.\n       Partners in Wallop/Breaux include more than thirty national \n     recreation and conservation organizations which constitute \n     the American League of Anglers and Boaters, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, state fishery and boating agencies, the \n     U.S. Coast Guard and America's anglers and boaters.\n\n\n                      wow--wonderful outdoor world\n\n       On opposite coasts of the nation last year, two groups of \n     individuals addressed the lowered rate of exposure of today's \n     youth to traditional outdoor recreational activities such as \n     camping, fishing, hiking and wildlife viewing. Many factors \n     are behind this drop, from the lure of indoor pastimes to \n     changes in the structure of our families. The conversations \n     joined and a unique national partnership resulted called \n     ``WOW--Wonderful Outdoor World.'' Now operating in a pilot \n     effort in Los Angeles, the program brings tents, lanterns, \n     sleeping bags, fishing poles and other recreational items to \n     the neighborhoods of city kids and offers them camping \n     adventures within blocks of home. The program doesn't end \n     with this first exposure; ``graduates'' are helped to \n     understand the outdoor fun opportunities near-by and the \n     organizations available to make this fun accessible--from \n     city and county agencies to the Boy Scouts. Current partners \n     include the Walt Disney Company, the City of Los Angeles, the \n     Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Recreation \n     Roundtable, the Coleman Company, Chevy/Geo Environmental, \n     Ralphs Grocery Company, California State Parks, Wells Cargo \n     Trailers, California State University at Long Beach and the \n     L.A. Times. Partners hope to learn from the monthly camping \n     adventures for 9-12 year-olds between May 1995 and April 1996 \n     and to expand the program both in Los Angeles and to more \n     cities.\n\n\n               smokey bear balloon floats across america\n\n       In celebration of the 50th anniversary of Smokey Bear, the \n     Forest Service and many friends and partners helped create a \n     new non-profit organization based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, \n     to build and ``campaign'' a new hot air balloon in the shape \n     of Smokey Bear. Towering 85 feet high and 75 feet across, the \n     balloon has already made almost 100 flights. The balloon \n     travels with a specially constructed trailer, donated by \n     Fleetwood Enterprises, which offers an outstanding fire and \n     conservation ethics message. This newest icon for Smokey, one \n     of America's best known and best loved symbols, is totally \n     privately funded but works in close harmony with federal and \n     state forestry\n      organizations. Smokey recently flew in formation with \n     another famed American symbol--Mickey Mouse--at the Walt \n     Disney World Resort, celebrating both the partnerships \n     reflected by the balloon and the origin of the idea for \n     the balloon--at the first Partners Outdoors conference at \n     the Florida site.\n\n\n                       winter sports partnership\n\n       Approximately half of all downhill skiing in the United \n     States occurs at ski areas operating on national forests. \n     Private funding has been used to build the lifts and other \n     facilities, which are then operated under long term permits \n     which return revenues to the government. The ski areas also \n     assist the Forest Service with wildlife management, \n     interpretation and other programs.\n       A partnership was established among the U.S. Disabled Ski \n     Team, Olympic Gold Medalist Sarah Will, Dick Bass of \n     Snowbird, the National Ski Area's Association and the U.S. \n     Forest Service in 1994. At this time, a Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) was signed by Under Secretary Jim Lyons, \n     Forest Service Chief Jack Ward Thomas and the President of \n     the National Ski Area's Association Michael Berry. The MOU \n     supports enhancing public awareness of ecosystems through \n     environmental education at ski areas at National Forest \n     lands, particularly ski areas, increasing partnership \n     recognition, encouraging stewardship of public land and \n     demonstrating the availability of the National Forests to \n     people of all ages, abilities and cultures.\n\n\n                             tread lightly\n\n       This program was started by the Forest Service in 1986 to \n     help protect public and private lands through education about \n     responsible use of off-highway vehicles. To maximize its \n     effectiveness, Tread Lightly, Inc., a non-profit organization \n     funded and managed by the private sector, was incorporated in \n     1990. Tread Lightly unites manufacturers, publishers, \n     environmental groups and individuals who share a basic \n     commitment to recognize and protect our valuable resources. \n     Some of these partners are: Jeep, Honda, Toyota, Range Rover, \n     the Perlman Group, Warn Industries, the Izaak Walton League, \n     Goodyear and Four Wheeler Magazine.\n\n\n                    access america's great outdoors\n\n       The partnership is among the American Recreation Coalition, \n     the Forest Service, MIG Communications, Quickie Designs and \n     Wilderness Inquiry. It involves a comprehensive approach to \n     integrating universal access to outdoor recreation \n     environments and supports the full implementation of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act.\n       Efforts on this program were inspired by the President's \n     Commission on Americans Outdoors. Among the products of this \n     partnership are: a design guidebook offering practical and \n     creative information to public and private recreation \n     facility operators alike; improved facilities across the \n     nation; demonstrations for the Western Governors Association \n     and recreation community leaders and national awareness \n     through media stories.\n\n\n                          back country byways\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management's Back Country Byways program \n     now includes more than 70 routes, showcasing some of the \n     scenic and cultural best of the West. The BLM program has \n     enjoyed the active support of national partners such as the \n     American Recreation Coalition, Farmers Insurance Companies \n     and American Isuzu as well as dozens of local corporate, \n     municipal and civic organizations. Three outstanding byways \n     have been developed recently in the state of Arizona. \n     Historic Route 66 is a part of many family histories dating \n     back to the 1920s. The 42-mile scenic road offers an \n     outstanding side-trip for visitors traveling to Arizona, \n     California and Nevada. The Historic Route 66 Association, \n     Kingman, Oatman and Topack chambers of commerce, Mohave \n     County and Arizona state governmental agencies have worked \n     cooperatively to develop and promote this back country byway.\n       In March 1994, the Black Hills Back Country Byway was \n     dedicated celebrating ``Riches from the Earth.'' This 21-mile \n     road journeys through rough terrain, provides opportunities \n     for rockhounding, viewing wildlife, hiking, rafting the Gila \n     River and many other activities as well as seeing one of the \n     nation's largest copper mining sites. This byway was \n     developed as a partnership with Phelps Dodge and the Graham \n     and Greenlee Counties and chambers of commerce.\n     [[Page S8051]]\n     \n                          blackfoot challenge\n\n       Facing population growth and the consequences of poor land \n     use practices in the past, the large and lovely Blackfoot \n     River valley in Montana was threatened and in need of \n     comprehensive action. The Bureau of Land Management led \n     efforts to develop a common vision for the region and then \n     enlist public and private partners able to turn the vision \n     into reality. The result is both astonishing and encouraging. \n     Major corporations such as Plum Creek Timber\n      and Phelps Dodge Mining have joined federal agencies, \n     environmental organizations, local governments and private \n     citizens to develop a land use strategy for the area, \n     target priority sites for clean-ups and other mitigation \n     and communicate goals to landowners in the area. The \n     effort has been aided by use of GIS and other new \n     technologies. The valley now has a markedly more positive \n     future.\n\n\n                  blm: hidden partnerships in the east\n\n       BLM has developed partnerships with numerous states, oil \n     and gas companies, wild horse and burro adopters, as well as \n     historically black colleges and universities. These \n     organizations have worked together to protect wildlife \n     habitat, introduce non-traditional publics to the outdoors, \n     improve recreation opportunities, protect fragile ecosystems \n     and cultural resources, and improve environmental education \n     programs.\n\n\n                      national river clean-up week\n\n       As the national coordinator, America Outdoors originated \n     this program in 1992 in partnership with federal agencies and \n     the private sector. The organizations participating include: \n     Bureau of Reclamation, Forest Service, Bureau of Land \n     Management, National Park Service, American Canoe \n     Association, American Rivers, American Whitewater \n     Affiliation, North American Paddle Sports Association and The \n     National Association of Canoe Liveries and Outfitters.\n       Since the inception of this partnership, 100,000 volunteers \n     have participated in 1,600 clean-ups covering 30,000 miles of \n     waterways. American Outdoors donates staff time for \n     promotion, coordination, fund raising, distribution of trash \n     bags and development of educational materials. The federal \n     agencies provide logistical support to volunteers for clean-\n     ups on public land, assist with the acquisition of trash bags \n     and coordinate clean-ups. The private sector promotes clean-\n     ups among their membership and provides educational material \n     on the value of maintaining healthy riparian zones and \n     waterways.\n\n\n         campbell creek (alaska) environmental education center\n\n       A partnership, including ARCO, Anchorage School District, \n     National Audubon Society and Alaska Pacific University along \n     with BLM, designed the Campbell Creek Environmental Education \n     Center that will be located in a residential facility and \n     will be built by the BLM on the Campbell Tract in Anchorage. \n     The facility will be completed in 1996 and will include a \n     10,000 square-foot education center, two dormitories, outdoor \n     amphitheater and interpretive trails. The center will provide \n     children and others with the opportunity to experience the \n     outdoors, learn about wildlife and understand the role people \n     play in the local and global environment. The center will \n     also promote behaviors, practices and lifestyles that have \n     minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\n                      public land appreciation day\n\n       PLAD was initiated by Times Mirror Magazines (TMM) in 1994 \n     and encourages conservation-oriented volunteers to help \n     diminish the huge back-log of restoration projects on our \n     nation's public lands.\n       Through TMM, reaching 30 million readers, a call to action \n     was given that mobilized forces to public land sites across \n     the country. Five federal government agencies--the Bureau of \n     Land Management, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest \n     Service, the Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service \n     are partners with TMM. At each site, agency staff oversee the \n     PLAD volunteers who work on restoration projects. All the \n     tools needed to accomplish the work are donated by the PLAD \n     corporate sponsors.\n       PLAD started with two pilot sites in 1994 and has expanded \n     to 15 sites in 1995. By the end of the century, there will be \n     hundreds of PLAD sites throughout the country and people will \n     know that on the last Saturday in September they can go to a \n     local site to do their part.\n\n\n          lake havasu (arizona) fisheries improvement program\n\n       This program partnership includes the Bureau of Land \n     Management, Anglers United, Arizona Game and Fish Department, \n     Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Fish and \n     Game, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and \n     the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the largest and \n     most comprehensive warm water fisheries project ever \n     undertaken in the United States. The $28.5 million program \n     meets the needs of a host of anglers, revitalizes the \n     fishery, and restores populations of native fish in Lake \n     Havasu.\n       This program will increase access for all shoreline anglers \n     by construction of foot trails, fishing docks, access roads \n     and parking areas. Other facilities such as fish cleaning \n     stations, ramadas with picnic tables, interpretive areas and \n     restrooms will be added in eight access areas. Over 150 \n     artificial habitat\n      structures will be placed in the lake to provide spawning \n     sites, feeding locations and escape cover for the \n     declining populations of sport fish. Volunteers are a \n     major factor in the construction and placement of \n     artificial habitat structures in the lake. Hundreds of \n     volunteers contribute thousands of hours each year at work \n     sites on the lake. Community involvement complements the \n     partner contributions to implement this program. The Lake \n     Havasu Fisheries improvement program provides exhibits and \n     a habitat construction station for participants and their \n     families so that they actually help make structures on \n     site.\n\n\n                         CONSERVATION GOOD TURN\n\n       Conquistador Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the \n     Roswell District of the BLM brought 300 scouts and scouters \n     to the dunes in southeast New Mexico. They learned the eight \n     principles of Leave No Trace camping from BLM staff and \n     scouters that were trained by a BLM specialist. An afternoon \n     was devoted to conservation projects in the area. Fences were \n     built and repaired; boundary signs were hung on those fences; \n     concrete was mixed and poured to set poles for other signs; \n     picnic tables were painted; and over one and one-half tons of \n     litter was removed from the area and the adjacent highway. At \n     the end of the project, BLM and the BSA signed a Memorandum \n     of Understanding to make Conservation Good Turn an annual \n     event.\n\n\n                   LAKE LANIER AND THE 1996 OLYMPICS\n\n       In December 1993, Lake Lanier was selected as the venue for \n     the 1996 Olympic rowing and sprint and canoe/kayak events. \n     Immediately following the announcement, the city of \n     Gainsville, Hall County and the Mobile and Savannah Districts \n     of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a cooperative \n     effort to prepare the site for the July 1996 competition. \n     Through this partnership, leases, reviews, permit approval \n     processes, cultural resources surveys and environmental \n     clearances were all expedited. Construction is currently \n     underway and the project is on schedule. After the Olympic \n     games, the site will be used for local, state and national \n     rowing and/or sprint and canoe/kayaking events.\n\n\n    SPECIAL HANDICAPPED HUNTING AND FISHING OPPORTUNITIES IN GEORGIA\n\n       The Augusta and Atlanta areas are regional centers for \n     spinal cord injury patients. The Savannah District U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers formed a partnership with the Georgia \n     Handicapped Association, the Southeastern Paralyzed Veterans \n     Association, local bass clubs and the Georgia Department of \n     Natural Resources to provide improved hunting and fishing \n     opportunities for physically challenged sportsmen. The first \n     special hunt was for Eastern wild turkeys and took place on \n     April 1, 1991, on J. Strom Thurmond Lake for 11 sportsmen \n     confined to wheelchairs. It was the first hunt of its kind on \n     public lands and resulted in nationwide publicity. In the \n     second series of hunts, 65 physically challenged sportsmen \n     participated in a deer hunt at Richard B. Russell Lake and \n     harvested 62 deer during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. For the \n     past 3 years, bass tournaments were sponsored in the Georgia \n     and South Carolina areas. Bass club fisherman provided the \n     boats and were paired with a physically challenged sportsman. \n     Additional hunts and fishing tournaments are scheduled for \n     this season.\n\n\n              FISHERIES HABITAT ENHANCEMENT IN MISSISSIPPI\n\n       This program is a project of Enid and Sardis Lakes in the \n     Vicksburg, Mississippi District of the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers. Members of the Sardis, Batesville, Oxford and \n     Yalobusha County bass clubs and the Otoucalfa Sportsman's \n     Club collect Christmas trees, donated by the public, and \n     place them in the Enid and Sardis Lakes as fish shelters. The \n     partnership included the Mississippi Highway Department and \n     South Central Bell who donated anchoring material and excess \n     wire for the project.\n\n\n                           CHATFIELD WETLANDS\n\n       A 20-acre wetland serving as a wildlife sanctuary and \n     environmental education center was created and is now being \n     sustained by a unique partnership of federal and state \n     government agencies, Martin Marietta Astronautics and local \n     conservation enthusiasts. The area is located within \n     Chatfield State Park, Colorado's most visited park, located \n     just minutes from Denver. Already an example of a \n     partnership, since Chatfield is a Corps of Engineers area \n     being operated by the state, Chatfield became even more \n     ``cutting edge'' when innovative state and industry leaders \n     devised an innovative way to reuse 350,000 gallons of \n     treated, high quality waste water from a Martin Marietta \n     plant. Rather than a long-distance pumping operation to \n     discharge the water into a high volume water body, as \n     required by federal and state regulation, the waste water is \n     instead deposited into a new wetland area close to the plant \n     site. Volunteers planted grasses and other vegetation and the \n     site was in use by waterfowl within days of initial \n     discharges. Martin Marietta has also paid for the \n     construction of a viewing site at the wetland area, which is \n     immediately adjacent to a planned trail hub center and an \n     existing major environmental education center. The site is \n     readily accessible for school trips and has become a real \n     asset for the Denver area.\n\n\n                       PARTNERS IN INTERPRETATION\n\n       More than a billion visits are made each year to America's \n     parks, forests and other public lands. In many cases, little \n     or no contact occurs between the visitors and the federal \n     officials managing the areas because of \n     [[Page S8052]] manpower limits, inadequate visitor facilities \n     and the pattern of visitation. Yet recently, the Forest \n     Service and the National Park Service have launched \n     imaginative programs to reach more visitors with \n     interpretation programs which add substantially to the \n     quality of the experience. In both cases, the agencies work \n     in partnership with private businesses serving visitors in \n     the areas: resorts and campgrounds, AMTRAK, motorcoach tour \n     operators and cruise lines serving Alaska. The results are \n     exciting--and appreciated by the visitors.\n       More than 150,000 people each year are now treated to the \n     majesty of Glacier Bay aboard cruise ships. Most of these \n     visitors have the added advantage of special interpretive \n     programs about the land and the bay and the diverse wildlife \n     found here. Companies such as Holland American have entered \n     into agreements with the National Park Service which provide \n     for two NPS interpreters to be on-board the ships, holding \n     regular seminars and answering questions. The cruise lines \n     pay for this service and provide the facilities needed by the \n     NPS, even helping to sell guidebooks and other items. The \n     cruise ships allow hundreds of thousands of people to see \n     areas like Glacier Bay without construction of the on-land \n     facilities which would be required for normal visits. \n     Everyone benefits!\n       The Forest Service has developed similar cooperative \n     arrangements with hotels and resorts in the Pacific Northwest \n     and with AMTRAK, putting a trained Forest Service interpreter \n     on key trains in the West, for example. Again, private sector \n     contributions offset the cost of the interpreter to the \n     agency, and the private sector also provides the \n     interpretation site eliminating the needed for federal \n     outlays for construction.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8049-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          GREEK FOLK FESTIVAL\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to call to the \nattention of our colleagues the Greek Folk Festival sponsored by St. \nNicholas' Greek Orthodox Church this upcoming weekend. While this \ncelebration is obviously enjoyed by parishioners of St. Nicholas, the \nentire community also relishes this wonderful festival. St. Nicholas is \nled by Father Manuel J. Burdusi, a man whom many applaud as a pastor \nwho has developed a strong community within St. Nicholas, including a \ndynamic youth fellowship.\n  I would also like to bring to the attention of my colleagues that \nthis festival contributes greatly to the preservation and enhancement \nof the historic culture of the Greek-American community. The Greek Folk \nFestival includes educational and cultural activities, live music and \ndancing, authentic Greek food and pastries, and most importantly, \nwholesome family entertainment. I would like to highlight an excellent \narticle in today's Evening Sun newspaper by Jacques Kelly, highlighting \nthe magnificent people that make this festival a superb event that is \nacclaimed year after year. Mr. President, I ask that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Baltimore Evening Sun, June 8, 1995]\n\n                Priest helps Highlandtown keep the faith\n\n                           (By Jacques Kelly)\n\n       It seems that everybody in this part of East Baltimore \n     knows ``the priest.''\n       He is the Rev. Manual J. Burdusi, the 33-year-old pastor of \n     St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox church, the spiritual home of \n     many Highlandtown families.\n       Father Manual, as he is called, is the former altar boy who \n     came back to his home parish wearing a cleric's black robes. \n     He grew, up on Bonsal Street near Francis Scott Key Medical \n     Center. His church is in the 500 block of S. Ponca St. He is \n     one of the pivotal personalities here.\n       Part of the reason so many East Baltimore Greeks know \n     Father Manual is that they watched him grow up.\n       As a 10-year-old, he assisted at the Divine Liturgy. Then \n     he joined the choir. After his studies at Hellenic College \n     and the Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., he \n     returned to Baltimore. He was ordained in 1989 and named the \n     church's pastor four years ago.\n       ``I have always felt comfortable on the path that led me to \n     the priesthood. It felt like home'' Father Manuel said.\n       He also kept things in the family by marrying a woman named \n     Malama (Molly), who also sang in the choir. They have a son \n     named Nicholas, the saint's name commemorated in the church.\n       One of the hardest things is to bury a person you've known \n     so well in this neighborhood,'' he said one day this week.\n       The loss of a family member in this close-knit community is \n     strictly observed. Many widows wear black after a husband \n     dies. Families have memorial prayer services in the church 40 \n     days after a death. This is often repeated six months later, \n     then after a year, and on the third anniversary.\n       At funerals, the custom is to have the deceased in an open \n     casket. Close family members kiss the corpse on the cheek. \n     Others may kiss the hand or forehead or a religious icon.\n       ``The formal process of mourning is therapeutic. It helps \n     with dealing with grief. It forces the family back into the \n     life of the church,'' Father Manuel said.\n       The life of the church is often the life of this \n     neighborhood. Witness the tremendous activity for this \n     weekend's Greek Folk Festival sponsored by the church. From \n     tomorrow through Sunday, Ponca Street will explode with \n     people, music, food and dancing. It has become one of the \n     city's most popular summer events.\n       Family ties, church and tradition all mix within this tight \n     community.\n       Blocks of rowhouses branch off Eastern Avenue in this part \n     of Highlandtown known to some as The Hill, to others Greek \n     Town. Many immigrants from the Greek islands settled here in \n     the 1960s and 1970s. With them came their own grocery stores, \n     bakeries, places to sip strong coffee and talk, and \n     restaurants.\n       Father Manuel's family, for example, came from an island \n     that was controlled by Italy for some years. His surname, \n     Burdusi, reflects this.\n       His parish has its origins in a little school established \n     here in the late 1940s. It was torn down and the present \n     church built in 1956. Today, it has 1,200 families on its \n     mailing list. Of these, some 700 are active.\n       ``At times it is so busy, it feels like more,'' the pastor \n     said. ``When it gets very rushed I have to ask my wife, ``Did \n     we pay the bills this month?''\n       Father Manuel wears a beeper and is on call at all times.\n       ``I don't want anybody to say they couldn't get a call into \n     a priest,'' he said.\n       It is not uncommon for his parishioners to walk to Sunday \n     services. Some 575 of his families reside in the 21224 Zip \n     Code. Another 120 live in Rosedale and 100 more in Dundalk. \n     The parish has a large and vigorous youth organization that \n     its pastor feels is the cornerstone of the community.\n       Throughout the festival, Father Manuel will be giving \n     church tours--4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Friday, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. \n     on Saturday and Sunday--during which he will explain the rich \n     collection of Christian art here. Just this past Easter, the \n     church unveiled a vibrant mural of Mary, the mother of Jesus, \n     the Christ child and saints Basil, Gregory, Nicholas and John \n     Chrysostom.\n       Father Manuel also answers questions about the elaborate \n     religious ceremonies here.\n       When recently asked, for example, how much incense is used \n     on a typical Sunday, the priest thought for a moment and \n     quietly replied, ``Ten tablespoons.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8052-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          GREEK FOLK FESTIVAL\n Mr. SARBANES.

It forces the family back into the \n     life of the church,'' Father Manuel said.\n       The life of the church is often the life of this \n     neighborhood. Witness the tremendous activity for this \n     weekend's Greek Folk Festival sponsored by the church. From \n     tomorrow through Sunday, Ponca Street will explode with \n     people, music, food and dancing. It has become one of the \n     city's most popular summer events.\n       Family ties, church and tradition all mix within this tight \n     community.\n       Blocks of rowhouses branch off Eastern Avenue in this part \n     of Highlandtown known to some as The Hill, to others Greek \n     Town. Many immigrants from the Greek islands settled here in \n     the 1960s and 1970s. With them came their own grocery stores, \n     bakeries, places to sip strong coffee and talk, and \n     restaurants.\n       Father Manuel's family, for example, came from an island \n     that was controlled by Italy for some years. His surname, \n     Burdusi, reflects this.\n       His parish has its origins in a little school established \n     here in the late 1940s. It was torn down and the present \n     church built in 1956. Today, it has 1,200 families on its \n     mailing list. Of these, some 700 are active.\n       ``At times it is so busy, it feels like more,'' the pastor \n     said. ``When it gets very rushed I have to ask my wife, ``Did \n     we pay the bills this month?''\n       Father Manuel wears a beeper and is on call at all times.\n       ``I don't want anybody to say they couldn't get a call into \n     a priest,'' he said.\n       It is not uncommon for his parishioners to walk to Sunday \n     services. Some 575 of his families reside in the 21224 Zip \n     Code. Another 120 live in Rosedale and 100 more in Dundalk. \n     The parish has a large and vigorous youth organization that \n     its pastor feels is the cornerstone of the community.\n       Throughout the festival, Father Manuel will be giving \n     church tours--4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Friday, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. \n     on Saturday and Sunday--during which he will explain the rich \n     collection of Christian art here. Just this past Easter, the \n     church unveiled a vibrant mural of Mary, the mother of Jesus, \n     the Christ child and saints Basil, Gregory, Nicholas and John \n     Chrysostom.\n       Father Manuel also answers questions about the elaborate \n     religious ceremonies here.\n       When recently asked, for example, how much incense is used \n     on a typical Sunday, the priest thought for a moment and \n     quietly replied, ``Ten tablespoons.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8052-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8052-S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           AMMUNITION CONTROL\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as some Senators may know, I had \nintended to offer an amendment to the antiterrorism legislation to \nupdate the existing statute prohibiting the manufacture, sale, and \nimportation of armor-piercing ammunition. My amendment would have \nsimply revised current law to cover new projectiles capable of \npenetrating the soft body armor worn by most law enforcement officers. \nHowever, as part of the agreement negotiated by the managers to permit \ncompletion of the bill yesterday, all amendments relating to firearms \nwere dropped.\n  Senator Bradley and I planned to offer a separate amendment requiring \ndevelopment by the Department of the Treasury of uniform standards for \nthe testing of armor-piercing ammunition. This is an important effort \nwhich I fully support, and I regret that we were not able to offer this \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey failed to \naddress the more immediate danger presented by the presence today in \nstores nationwide of certain bullets capable of penetrating police body \narmor. I learned of this ammunition only last week from the FBI. It \nobviously poses a serious threat to law enforcement.\n  It has been well over a decade since I first introduced legislation \nto eliminate the armor-piercing bullets. I first became aware of \nproblem in 1982, and with the help of the Patrolman's Benevolent \nAssociation of New York City, as well as other law enforcement groups, \nhelped secure enactment in 1986 of the original statute banning so-\ncalled cop-killer bullets. In 1993, I secured passage of a provision in \nthe crime bill, which became law in September 1994, to include in the \ndefinition of armor-piercing ammunition the Swedish-made M39B round. \nWhen I learned last week that other armor-piercing rounds exist which \nelude the ban, I immediately began work on an amendment to update the \nstatute once again.\n  Unfortunately, I was not in a position to offer this amendment to S. \n735. As I have said, amendments on this subject were not permitted \nunder the unanimous consent agreement. Even if \n[[Page S8053]] such amendments had been permitted, however, we could \nnot have proceeded without the cooperation of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I had \ngone to some lengths to solicit support for this amendment from both \nthe FBI and the BATF. I had sought to draft language that would ban the \nnew armor-piercing rounds without affecting nonarmor-piercing or other \nlegitimate sporting rounds that pose no threat to law enforcement. \nDespite repeated inquiries to the FBI and BATF, however, I had no \nresponse. The administration took the position on Monday that all \namendments should be resisted, and that was that.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we were unable to proceed on the \nantiterrorism bill with my amendment to update the ban on armor-\npiercing ammunition. It is of great importance to the Nation's law \nenforcement officers. I hope we will be able to more forward on this \nmatter in the near future.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8052-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         THE DEAN OF STATE PLANNERS DAN VARIN WILL SOON RETIRE\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, Daniel W. Varin today announced his \nown plans for retirement, in one of the quietest, most unobtrusive ways \nimaginable, after more than 30 years of service directing the State of \nRhode Island's planning effort.\n  Dan Varin, who has been acknowledged nationally a dean of State \nplanning officials, announced his own plans quietly at the end of an \notherwise ordinary State Planning Council meeting in Rhode Island, \nunder the agenda item of ``other business.''\n  Throughout his 30 years, he has brought an unusual ability to his \nposition. He perceives the implications of numbers, statistics, and \ntrends, in a word, he has foresight. He has remained committed to a \nlarger view of things, exercising his gift of seeing the interrelation \nof issues.\n  He has been a wonderful, dedicated proponent of comprehensive, \nareawide planning. He has looked to the future, and worked long hours. \nHe has been available in crises, and brought a great knowledge of how \ngovernmental systems work to resolving vexing problems for State and \nlocal government.\n  In the winds of change, and squalls of politics, Dan Varin has been a \nsteadying sail of calm reason. He has been a navigator of great value \non a stormy sea.\n  He has an awesome knowledge of State and Federal programs, and those \nof us in the Federal Government are indebted to him. Much of what we do \nrelies on State action to secure its realization. With Dan Varin's \nguidance, many things were done well in Rhode Island.\n  To say that my office and I will miss him deeply is an \nunderstatement. All that really can be said is, ``Thank you, and best \nwishes for a truly well-earned retirement.''\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/08/senate-section/article/S8053-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
