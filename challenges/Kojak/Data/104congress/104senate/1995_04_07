Hope through us, O God of hope. Flow \nthrough us patiently until we hope for one another what You have hoped \nfor us. Then Lord, give us the vision and courage to confront those \nproblems that have made life seem hopeless for some people. Make us \ncommunicators of hope. We trust our lives, the work of the Senate, and \nthe future of our Nation into Your all-powerful hands. In the name of \nthe Hope of the World.

Mr. President, it's been 40 years since a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress had the opportunity to mark any milestones. But \nwhen Republicans became the majority party after all those years, we \nwasted no time in making history.\n  As we approach the end of the first 100 days of the Republican \nCongress, I want to take a moment to offer my congratulations to House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich and the House Republican majority for their \nspectacular success with the Contract With America. In his 1992 \ncampaign, Bill Clinton promised to start his administration with ``an \nexplosive 100-day action period.'' Obviously, he had not met Newt \nGingrich or a Republican Congress.\n  Last November, the American people sent a powerful message to \nWashington. They told us they wanted a Government defined by its limit, \nnot by its reach. They demanded a return to freedom and a renewal of \nopportunity. And they told us they were tired of Government promising \ntoo much, and\n delivering too little.\n\n  From day one, the new Republican Congress demonstrated its commitment \nto something all too rare in this town--keeping our promises to the \nAmerican people. On January 4, we rolled up our sleeves, and started \nturning the message from the people into action.\n  They gave us the message on last November 8, and now we are turning \nit into action.\n  Action is precisely what House Republicans provided with the Contract \nWith America. They can be proud that they did what they said they would \ndo--all ten initiatives were put to a vote, with dramatic, and often \nbipartisan, results.\n  If people didn't already know that the Senate is a far different \ninstitution with different rules, they know now. At times, it seemed \nlike the Democrat minority wanted to spend 100 days on every bill. But, \ndespite all the filibusters and delays, the Senate also achieved what I \nbelieve will be seen as remarkable success.\n  Instead of taking most of January off, we got right down to business. \nLike the House, we acted immediately to lead by example, forcing \nCongress to live under the same laws we apply to everyone else. \nPresident Clinton quickly signed this long overdue initiative. With a \nstrong bipartisan majority, we approved S. 1, to stop Congress from \npassing unfunded mandates on to States and local governments, unless we \nsend the money to pay for them. I'm proud to say that the unfunded \nmandates bill is now the law of the land, and has been signed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Again, leading by example, Senate and House Republicans put our \nbudget cutting zeal to the test right here on Capitol Hill. Senate \nRepublicans cut staff and overhead, reducing committee budgets by 15 \npercent.\n  We voted to give the President the line-item veto, a long overdue \ntool in our efforts to rein in Government. To bring real discipline to \nFederal spending, the House approved the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. Regrettably, the Senate fell one vote short. But, \nwe're not giving up,\n and we hope one of our colleagues, \n [[Page S5528]] somebody out there, wherever, who may have voted ``no'' \nwill understand, if we are going to have the discipline and force the \nCongress to make these tough decisions, the balanced budget amendment \nis very, very important.\n  And I must say I welcome anyone who wanted to be converted on that \nissue because I think it is critical. To me it is sort of the \ncenterpiece of all the efforts we are making on both sides of the \naisle. It is not a partisan issue. There is a new poll out today \nindicating that 78 percent of the American people support the balanced \nbudget amendment. I believe they understand probably better than we do \nthat we need the discipline. We need to be able to say to people, Oh, \nwe cannot do that. It is a great idea, but we have a constitutional \namendment now for a balanced budget and we cannot start a lot of new \nprograms, which start low and end up in the millions and billions of \ndollars.\n  So it is my hope that, before this Congress ends, the balanced budget \namendment will be before the States for ratification. It seems to me \nthat is very, very important.\n  Then just last night, we made a very important downpayment on deficit \nreduction by cutting $16 billion in unnecessary Government spending--\nnot over 5 years. The President advocated $16 billion over 5 years. \nThis year it is $16 billion in the Senate bill and $17 billion in the \nHouse version. They will go to conference when we return after the \nrecess. My view is that we will have a very tough but a very fair \nspending reduction proposal to send to the President. I hope that he \nwill see fit to sign it.\n  We acted swiftly to ease burdens on working Americans, and those who \ncreate jobs and opportunities. We restored the tax deduction for more \nthan 3 million self-employed Americans for the cost of health insurance \npremiums. We eased burdens on job-created businesses by approving the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. And we took an important first step in \nregulatory reform by approving a 45-day congressional review of \nexcessive regulations which cost America money and jobs.\n  The Republican Congress' first 100 days stand in stark contrast to \nthe first 100 days of the Clinton administration. Instead of an \nexplosive action period, President Clinton's first 100 days in office \nwill be remembered for big Government policy bombs, such as the biggest \ntax increase in American history, including retroactive tax increases \nand tax hikes on Social Security recipients, and a misguided, unpaid-\nfor stimulus package that would have added billions to the deficit \nAmericans are demanding we control.\n  And in 1995, while Republicans were reining in Government during our \nfirst 100 days, the Clinton administration was at it again, producing a \nbudget that gave up on trying to ever balance the Nation's books. And \nthe President protected Washington's chronic wild spending by fighting \nthe balanced budget amendment, and the will of the American people.\n  The good news is, during the next 100 days, the Republican Congress \nis determined to protect our children, grandchildren, and future \ngenerations of Americans by producing a budget plan that will lead to \nbalance budget by 2002. It would be a lot easier if we had that one \nmore vote on the Democratic side, and I do not think anyone in this \nChamber would think that it would make it much easier for us to do that \nif we had that discipline. I really believe that someone will see the \nlight, I hope.\n  Mr. President, while the focus during the past 100 days has been on \nthe House--and rightfully so--I believe the next 100 days will belong \nto the Senate,\n probably maybe the next 100 nights, too. There will be fewer recesses \non the Senate side. The House is going out for 3 weeks. We are going \nout for 2 weeks. We have to catch up.\n\n  I do not quarrel with that because the Founding Fathers realized that \nthey needed one body that could move very quickly. They wanted another \nChamber where they would be more deliberate and certainly nobody can \nargue the point that we are very deliberate.\n  In fact, we deliberate and deliberate and deliberate sometimes. We \nare not setting any deadlines. And no one expects the Senate to be a \nrubberstamp for the House. But we will continue to be guided by the \ncommon principles of reining in Government, returning power to the \npeople and expanding opportunity.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will address many of the following \nissues, putting the budget on a path to balance: welfare reform. That \nis a big issue, not partisan. It is bipartisan, as it should be. The \nPresident says he supports welfare reform; cutting taxes for families. \nThere will be a tax cut, a substantial tax cut measure passed in the \nSenate; reforming our legal system, regulatory reform, tough anticrime \nmeasures, voting on term limits and protecting U.S. interests in U.N. \npeacekeeping.\n  Mr. President, on January 4, I walked across the Capitol to the floor \nof the House because I had never had the privilege of seeing a \nRepublican Speaker. Now I have, and I know I speak for all of my \nRepublican colleagues when I say I like the change. Tonight, Speaker \nGingrich will report to the Nation on the historic first 100 days of \nthe Republican Congress. I look forward to watching, and I look forward \nto tackling the important work that remains ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5527-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, this week does mark the final action in \nthe House of Representatives on the so-called Contract With America. \nThis week, there will be all kinds of analysis of what the Contract \nWith America has meant, and I wanted the chance to take stock and share \nmy view as people comment on the first 100 days of the so-called \nContract With America.\n  Let me say, as I said in a speech in January, there are some parts of \nthe contract that are good, some parts of the contract that I strongly \nsupport. In fact, we already have two parts of it that have become \nlaw--the Congressional Accountability Act that will apply to Members of \nCongress the laws that apply to everyone else. I support it. We tried \nto get it passed last year. It is now the law of the land. That is \npositive; and the unfunded mandates bill, which will make it more \ndifficult for the Federal Government to send orders out to the States \nto fund something that we deem necessary and appropriate. That had gone \ntoo far. We have reined it in through legislation that is now also the \nlaw of the land. Those are both positive things, in my view.\n  When we turn to the fiscal side of the House, when we look at how the \nContract With America impacts the long-term economic health of America, \nquite a different picture emerges. Very frankly, the numbers just do \nnot add up.\n  The proponents of the contract have said they are going to balance \nthe budget; they are going to cut taxes; they are going to increase \ndefense spending, and it is all going to work.\n  Mr. President, we heard that same old song back in the 1980's, when \nthe Republicans captured control of the Senate, they had the White \nHouse, and they told us they could cut taxes dramatically, increase \ndefense spending, and balance the budget.\n  What happened? Well, they cut taxes. They increased defense spending, \nbut the deficit and the debt of this country exploded. And now, Mr. \nPresident, we are seeing a repeat of that tragic, tragic economic \npolicy for this country. Now we are seeing a repeat, deja voodoo. We \nsaw the economic policy of the 1980's referred to as voodoo economics, \nand indeed it was because it told the American people, when we already \nhad a deficit, that we could cut taxes, raise defense spending and \nsomehow it would all add up. It did not add up then, it is not going to \nadd up now, and we ought not to repeat that experience.\n   [[Page S5529]] That dug a deep hole for America--quadrupled the \nnational debt in this country. Now we are faced with a circumstance in \nwhich we see the same sold economic nostrums peddled to us once again.\n  Mr. President, I think it helps if we look at what is our current \ncircumstance. This chart shows what it would take to balance the budget \nover the next 7 years. What are the cuts necessary to balance the \nbudget if we do nothing to make the problem worse before we begin to \nsolve it? This chart shows it would take $1.2 trillion of cuts over the \nnext 7 years to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, our friends in the Contract With \nAmerica, before beginning to solve this problem, have taken the first \nsteps which are to make it worse. It makes no sense. Just this week, \nthey passed in the House tax cuts of $345 over the next 7 years. So \ninstead of starting by reducing the deficit, they have started by \ndigging the hole deeper instead of starting by filling in the hole.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows on top of the $1.2 trillion of cuts \nnecessary to balance the budget over the next 7 years, our colleagues \nin the House have added $345 billion of tax cuts over that period, so \nnow we have a hole that is $1.555 billion.\n  Mr. President, one might ask: Where are the spending cuts from our \nfriends in the House of Representatives, from those who are advocates \nof the Contract With America, where are the spending cuts to match the \nproblem that we have of balancing the budget over the next 7 years?\n  Mr. President, here is what they have come up with so far, $485 \nbillion--$485 billion of cuts matched up against the need of $1.54 \ntrillion necessary to balance the budget over the next 7 years.\n  Unfortunately, the full picture is even more serious. Let us just go \nto the next chart because the charts I have shown before this one \nassume we are going to take Social Security trust fund surpluses to \nreduce the size of the deficit over this next 7 years.\n  If instead we were to balance the budget honestly and not be raiding \nSocial Security trust funds to balance the budget, what we find is \ninstead of a $1.5 trillion hole to fill, we have a $2.2 trillion hole \nto fill. We have the $1.2 trillion of spending cuts necessary to \nbalance the budget over the next 7 years, we have $636 billion of \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses that will be generated over that \nperiod, and now because of House action we have the $345 billion of tax \ncuts that they have passed. To balance the budget honestly over the \nnext 7 years we would need a whopping total of $2.191 trillion.\n  Mr. President, again, let us see what they have done with the \nContract With America in terms of meeting that need. We need nearly \n$2.2 trillion of cuts. They have come up with $485 billion so far. That \nlooks to me like a $1.6 trillion gap.\n  Our friends with the Contract With America have a $1.6 trillion--not \nmillion, not billion--$1.6 trillion credibility gap with the people of \nAmerica, because if we are going to honestly balance the budget, we are \ngoing to close the gap between spending and revenue over the next 7 \nyears, that takes $1.2 trillion. If we are not going to use Social \nSecurity surpluses, that is another $636 billion, and now they have \nstacked on top of that $345 billion in additional tax cuts--nearly $2.2 \ntrillion necessary to balance the budget over the next 7 years and they \nhave come up with a measly $485 billion of cuts.\n  Mr. President, they are not getting the job done.\n  Now, if we look at the spending over the next 7 years, the projection \nis that we will spend $13.2 trillion over the next 7 years.\n  Remember, we need now, based on the action they have taken over in \nthe House, to save $2.2 trillion. We are intending to spend $13.2 \ntrillion over that period of time.\n  Well, that looks like a manageable thing to do. Look at where the \nmoney is going. Interest on the debt, over $2 trillion. In fact, we are \ngoing to spend more on interest on the debt over the next 7 years than \nwe are going to spend on the national defense. We are going to spend \n$2.072 trillion on defense. We are going to spend $2.082 trillion on \nthe interest on the debt.\n  What are the other big areas of spending? Well, Social Security is \nthe biggest--$2.894 trillion on Social Security. We have Medicare, \n$1.847 trillion over the next 7 years; Medicaid, $962 billion. So those \nare real, the big pots of money. And domestic discretionary spending, \njust over $2 trillion. Those are the big pots--Social Security, \ninterest on the debt, defense, Medicaid, Medicare, and domestic \ndiscretionary spending.\n  In fact, one of the interesting things you find is in just five areas \non the budget, we are spending 75 percent of the money--Social \nSecurity, interest on the debt, defense, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  But our friends have said, well, there are parts of this that we \ncannot touch. Obviously, you cannot cut interest on the debt. That is \nowed. We have to pay that. That is $2 trillion over the next 7 years. \nSo that is off the table.\n  In addition, our friends have said Social Security is off the table. \nWe are not going to touch that, because that is the most fundamental \ncontract with America. We have taken taxes from people in order to \nassure that they receive the benefits they have been promised. That is \n$2.9 trillion over the next 7 years. That is off the table.\n  In addition, in the Contract With America, they have said we are not \ngoing to touch defense. It is off the table. That is over $2 trillion \nover the next 7 years. In fact, they say we ought to increase defense \nspending.\n  Well, when you take Social Security, interest on the debt, and \ndefense off the table, you have to achieve those $2 trillion of savings \nout of about $6.2 trillion of spending, because we have taken half of \nthe budget off the table.\n  Mr. President, that means we would have to cut everything that is \nleft by a third in order to achieve the savings. Everything else would \nhave to be cut by a third.\n  I do not think that makes much sense--cut the highway program in this \ncountry by a third; cut veterans benefits by a third, after we made a \nsolemn promise and pledge to them; cut education by a third; cut every \nnutrition program; every program to make this country a better place, \ncut them all by a third.\n  Mr. President, there has to be a better way of going about this. The \nContract With America so far is certainly not delivering on its promise \nto make the economic lives of Americans better. One of the most \ndisturbing aspects of what has been done is to look at how they have \ntargeted the tax benefits.\n  Because, let us be frank, they have targeted the tax benefits right \nat the richest, wealthiest people in this country. They have said to \nthose who are at the top, ``You get the lion's share of benefits.'' And \nthey have said to everybody else, ``You get the scraps.''\n  Mr. President, let me just make this clear. We have had 100 days of \nthe Contract With America, and the tax plan that they have passed gives \n100 times the benefits to somebody earning over $200,000 as it gives to \na family earning $30,000. If you are earning over $200,000 in America \ntoday, you get an $11,200 tax cut under what they have done in the \nother House under the Contract With America.\n  If you earn over $200,000, you get an $11,200 tax cut. If you are a \nfamily earning $30,000, you get a $124 tax cut. That is nearly 100 \ntimes as much going to those earning $200,000 as to those earning \n$30,000.\n  This is their idea of tax equity. This is their idea of fairness. \nThis is their idea of somehow making America better.\n  Mr. President, this is the same old trickle-down economics that we \nhave seen before. It is great if you make a lot of money, but it does \nnot do much for you if you are in the middle income in this country.\n  Frankly, the middle-income taxpayer will really pick up the tab, \nbecause we know what happened in the 1980's with this economic theory. \nThe debt exploded, the deficits exploded, and interest rates exploded \nand, as a result, the things that cost middle Americans money--home \nmortgage, college tuition--all of those things skyrocketed. So they get \na $124 tax reduction. They will get many times that in increased \nexpenses because of increased interest rates.\n  Mr. President, this shows the Republican contract. Fifty-two percent \nof the proposed tax cuts go to the top 12 percent of our population. \nTaxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000, 48 percent \n [[Page S5530]] of the proposed Republican tax cut goes to taxpayers \nwith incomes of less than $100,000. The 12 percent at the top, those \nearning more than $100,000, they get 52 percent of the benefits.\n  Again, I think a lot of people wonder: Gee, how is it? I read that in \nthis Contract With America, they had a $500 tax credit for children. \nHow could it be that a family earning $30,000 a year only gets $124 of \nbenefit?\n  Well, you know why that is true, Mr. President? Because they have \nplayed a little trick. They played a little trick in this tax plan. \nThey did not make that credit refundable. And so if you look at what \npeople are paying now and the tax relief they will get, you find that \nit is a big hoax; it is a big trick.\n  A family earning $30,000 gets $124 of benefits. Those with $200,000 \nof income get $11,000 of benefit. That is fair? I do not think so. I do \nnot think that is what the American people had in mind when they were \ntold there was this Contract With America. I do not think they had in \nmind, when they talk about a 50-percent cut in the capital gains tax, \nthat 75 percent of the benefit goes to the top 12 percent in this \ncountry; and that the other 88 percent of the people in this country \nget 25 percent of the benefit. I do not think that is what they had in \nmind.\n  Mr. President, this last chart shows what is happening to the \ndeficit. I thought under the Contract With America, they were going to \nbalance the budget. But let us look at, after the enactment of the \nContract With America, what is happening with the deficit.\n  Do you know what one finds? The deficit is going up. The deficit is \nnot going down. The deficit is going up.\n  I thought with this Contract With America, they were going to be \nreducing the deficit. I thought they were going to be moving toward a \nbalanced budget.\n  They have now passed the whole Contract With America and the deficit \nis going up. What happened? What happened? They said in this Contract \nWith America that they were going to reduce the deficits, reduce the \ndebt, and balance the budget.\n  But after the Contract With America is passed, the deficit is not \ngoing down, the deficit is going up. It is because the same old voodoo \neconomics does not add up. It does not add up.\n  Mr. President, this is going to be pretty sobering for the American \npeople to find out that they put their trust in something and, once \nagain, they are disappointed. It is time for us to honor the most basic \nContract With America, the pledge we took to uphold and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  That is the real Contract With America that every Member of the House \nand the Senate have. And we have a duty and an obligation to secure the \neconomic future of this country--a duty and an obligation. We ought to \nmove immediately upon our return to balance the budget of this country, \nto do it in an honest way without raiding Social Security trust funds \nand to secure a future for our children that is as full of promise and \nhope as what was turned over to us by previous generations.\n  Mr. President, I think the Contract With America has some good \npoints--congressional accountability, the notion that we are no longer \ngoing to put off responsibilities on States that are beyond their \nability to pay for. But this economic game plan is bankrupt. It does \nnot add up. It is not fair, and it must be rejected. Then we must turn \nin a bipartisan way to doing what we all know must be done: to get our \nfiscal house in order, to get America back on track and to create \neconomic opportunity for the people that we all represent.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Madam President, I have been presiding, as you are, \nover the Senate for the last couple of days, and I would like to make \nsome remarks about what I have heard from the other side, not the least \nof which we just heard from the good Senator from North Dakota.\n  First, I will say that the charts that he has described do one thing. \nThey very clearly paint a picture of the enormous financial crisis that \nour country faces. It was just the other morning that I spoke before \nthe Senate and I pointed out that within 10 years, Madam President--and \nthat puts virtually every American I have spoken with at the table--all \nU.S. revenues will be consumed by just five things: Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and the interest on our debt. \nEvery dime of U.S. revenue will have been expended by those five \noutlays in just 10 years. So it is going to be this generation that has \nto come to grips with this issue.\n  We cannot pass the baton to anybody else. It is going to happen on \nour watch. The clock has run out. It will be this generation of \nAmericans that come to grips with this.\n  But as I listened to the Senator from North Dakota as he was \nanalyzing what our side of the aisle is coming with, he left out a \ncouple salient facts.\n  The first is that the new majority's budget has yet to be presented. \nHe was talking about the tax cut provisions that have come from the \nHouse, but we do not yet have the budget that has been presented from \nthe House or Senate Budget Committees.\n  I am comfortable that both those committees are going to come with \nbudgets that move toward balance and do not add to the deficit. After \nall, it was the new majority that had to fight through this body the \nrescission cuts from the House which were $17 billion and, as the \nmajority leader noted this morning, on the Senate side late last night, \n$16 billion. I might add, that is a stark contrast from what the \nPresident came to Washington to do, which was to add $16 to $19 billion \njust 2 years ago straight to the deficit if it had not been defeated by \nour side of the aisle. So he failed to address the fact that the new \nbudgets have yet to be seen.\n  The second point he left out is that the only budget that has been \ngiven that we have seen has been given to us by the President of the \nUnited States. We do have that budget. That budget adds $200 billion to \nthe deficit for as far as the eye can see. If he had put the \nPresident's proposal on his chart, it would have had to have reached \nclear to the top of the ceiling. The President has totally ignored the \ndeficit--totally ignored it.\n  The President was in Atlanta just this past week, and the President \nand the Secretary of the Treasury both said--this is an unbelievable \nstatement--but they both said that the United States is actually \noperating in an operational surplus. That is a stunning statement from \nthe President, the Chief Executive of the United States of America, \nthat we are actually operating--he told a group of 2,000 students that \nwe are actually operating with a surplus.\n  He went on to say--asterisk--``that is, if you do not count the \ninterest on the debt.''\n  Of course, most people I go to work with every day and who live in my \nhometown and my State recognize that if they go to the bank and they \nask for a loan and the loan officer says, ``Your financial statement \njust won't allow the loan,'' they would say to the loan officer, \n``Yeah, but if you don't add all the interest I am paying on my \nmortgage, I'd be in great shape,'' you would either be laughed out of \nthe loan office or thrown out of the loan office.\n  Madam President, I am just going to leave two points: One, the \nSenator from North Dakota completely overlooked that the budget they \npresented is $200 billion in debt for as far as the eye can see; that \nthis administration, through the budgets that they have offered and the \nactions they have taken, are doing the equivalent of adding $2.2 \ntrillion to the debt--$2.2 trillion to the debt. He left that \ncompletely out of his remarks.\n  And the second point I want to make is you cannot talk about what the \nnew \n [[Page S5531]] majority planned until the new majority puts its \nbudgets on the table. They will be here soon, and they will move to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002.\n  I might also add, if the Senator from North Dakota had voted for a \nbalanced budget amendment, we might be on a near course to getting this \njob done. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5530-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. INTELLIGENCE AND MEDICAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I rise to issue a challenge that I hope \nwill be answered with the creation of a stimulating partnership between \nbusiness, medicine, and the Government, in this case the Federal \nGovernment. An important relationship is developing today between U.S. \nintelligence and the medical communities.\n  Technology to support intelligence analysis is being adapted to \nimprove significantly a doctor's ability to detect breast cancer in its \nearliest stages. Over 46,000 women die each year. The early estimates \nare, with this technology, that up to one-third of these women could be \nsaved as a consequence of this technology conversion.\n  The technology being developed is simple to describe but very \ndifficult to achieve. Daily, intelligence analysts deal with the \nproblem of detecting changes in photographic images they are reviewing. \nAs they watch foreign airfields, they want to know arrivals, bed-down, \nand departures of aircraft. As they watch foreign seaports, they want \nto know the arrivals, unloading, and departures of ships carrying cargo \nof interest. Computer software can be of great assistance in \nautomatically detecting these sorts of changes at airfields and at \nseaports. It is this intelligence technology that is being adapted for \nthe medical community.\n  Early detection of breast cancer currently relies heavily on the \njudgment and professional experience of doctors who review mammograms \nand magnetic resonance images. A significant part of their judgment is \nbased on comparing previous images with the current image of a woman's \nbreast. As in the intelligence world, detecting change is fundamental \nto understanding what is going on.\n  Through some exciting developments managed by the National \nInformation Display Lab at the David Sarnoff Labs in Princeton, NJ, \ncomputer analytical techniques are being developed for the medical \ncommunity. Relying on the technology developed for intelligence, they \nare adapting the technology to combat a dreaded disease that attacks 1 \nin 8 women in America today.\n  Madam President, I want to emphasize that the tens of thousands of \nlives that already have been saved as a result of intelligence \ntechnology by providing more effective national defense will be \ncomplemented by the thousands of lives that will be saved through the \nearlier detection of breast cancer.\n  This is an excellent example of the sound investment of taxpayers' \ndollars being paid off by saving thousands of lives in both national \ndefense and medicine.\n  The National Information Display Lab, or NIDL, is an inspiring \narrangement that needs to be duplicated by other Government/private-\nsector relationships. NIDL provides the bridge between Government/\ncivilian-sector requirements and Government/civilian-sector technology. \nBy understanding both requirements and technologies, NIDL is able to \nhelp close the gap between the Government and the private sector. \nPerhaps the most significant part of NIDL's story is their funding. \nNIDL relies on Government funding to begin to develop technology, which \nis then spun off to the commercial world for civilian and Government \napplications.\n  On Tuesday of this week, Madam President, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Arlen Specter, and I announced \nintelligence community funding to begin the technology transfer for \nbreast cancer research. The community is providing $375,000 to the NIDL \nto push the technology ahead. We are all aware of the intelligence \ncommunity's keen sense of urgency, great technical expertise, and \nexcellent planning skills which will ensure that the push forward has \nan effective start.\n  I also want to personally thank President Clinton for making all of \nthis happen. His commitment to breaking down the walls between defense \ntechnology and commercial technology, and his passion to attack the \nNation's health problems with every weapon in our arsenal are the \nreasons this project is going forward. Once he knew that intelligence \nsystems could bring earlier detection of breast cancer, this Government \nacted with determination and dispatch.\n  I began, Madam President, by saying that I was issuing a challenge. \nThe challenge is this: Will all the interested parties--Government, \nmedical, and commercial--now pick up the ball that has been put into \nplay and carry it forward so that within 12 to 24 months--I emphasize \nthis, Madam President, because this start will not come to completion \nunless we set a deadline and say that within 12 to 24 months, we are \ngoing to carry this technology forward into the clinical labs and \nclinics of this country, so that within this period of time, more \nwomen's lives will be saved through the earlier detection of breast \ncancer. The National Information Display Lab must be put on a sound \nfinancial basis, and everyone must help. I hope the challenge will be \nmet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have several matters I would like to \ncall to the attention of the Senate.\n  First, in this morning's Wall Street Journal, we have ``A \nBureaucrat's Guide to Smaller Government.''\n\n       The following was sent in by a Federal employee who asked \n     to remain anonymous so she can keep her cushy Government job.\n\n  She describes the way in which she talked to her other Federal \nemployees or fellow Federal employees, asking them, ``How will you know \nthat the Government is truly shrinking?'' They came up with their top \n10 list.\n  These are the top 10 ways we can know that the Government is truly \nshrinking:\n\n       (10) When the Equal Employment Opportunity [EEO] office has \n     a layoff.\n\n  She says:\n\n       Our EEO chief gets paid more than $70,000 a year to \n     coordinate ``diversity'' events and spout aphorisms at \n     meetings. When that sacred cow gets a real job, I'll know the \n     change has come. Which brings me to * * *\n       (9) No more paid time off for diversity or charity events.\n\n  She says employees can get away with murder because of the Federal \nculture. It lacks an urgency to produce.\n  A lazy but savvy employee can spend most of his or her workweek \nattending such vital events as Earth Week, Women's Equality Day, AIDS \nAwareness Day, or helping in the annual United Way shakedown.\n  She says:\n\n       I'll know the cuts have had an impact when agencies like \n     mine no longer can afford to have an $80,000-a-year employee \n     take ``a few months off'' to work on the United Way fund \n     drive.\n       (8) When upper management is replaced for not making cuts \n     fast enough.\n       (7) When the entourage for agency heads disappears.\n\n  She says:\n\n       My agency has about 600 people--small by Federal standards. \n     Even so, the guy who runs the place has a scheduler who's \n     paid $70,000 a year, a public relations staff to write his \n     speeches and press releases, and a clutch of assistants and \n     advisers * * *. A Congressman or Senator can get by with \n     fewer helpers. Why not a bureaucrat?\n       (6) When the newspaper subscriptions stop. Scientific or \n     trade journals are one thing, but why does the Federal \n     Government need to buy thousands of subscriptions to The \n     Washington Post or the New York Times?\n       (5) When somebody gets canned--and quickly--for running a \n     business from his desk.\n\n  This one struck me, interestingly. She says:\n\n       I saw my first answering machine in 1979 on the desk of a \n     Federal employee who was running a real estate business ``on \n     the side.'' Moonlighting on the job is still lucrative, as \n     the chance of being punished, let alone fired, is very small. \n     If the White House caves in to union pressure and won't push \n     for streamlined firing procedures, then the Hill should do it \n     and get these thieves off the payroll.\n        [[Page S5532]] (4) When top management takes cuts, too.\n\n  She talks about the hiring freezes at lower levels, but not at the \ntop.\n\n       (3) When nobody says ``because we've always published this \n     report.''\n\n  ``Hundreds of Federal documents,'' she says, ``are published out of \nhabit, not need.''\n  No. 2, Madam President, as to how we will know the Government is \nbeing cut back:\n\n       When they take ``solitaire'' off the computer.\n       And (drum roll) the No. 1 way Federal workers will be able \n     to tell when big Government is being cut: When there's nobody \n     in the cafeteria at 2 p.m.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I believe the Federal culture can change. But does the GOP \n     Congress have the guts to give the Federal bureaucracy a \n     long-overdue kick in the pants? Some of us will be watching \n     for the signs.\n\n  I found that amusing, and having served in the executive branch \nmyself, somewhat familiar, Madam President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire article printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               A Bureaucrat's Guide to Smaller Government\n\n       The following was sent in by a federal employee who asked \n     to remain anonymous so she can keep her cushy government job:\n       Does tough, bureaucracy-busting talk from the new Congress \n     and the White House scare the average federal worker? I'm a \n     federal employee and have yet to see any signs of fear among \n     my colleagues. Perhaps that's because I have yet to see any \n     signs of real change in the federal government.\n       Yes, there are some grumblings about pensions. But we've \n     seen administrations and Congresses come and go, with their \n     blue-ribbon commissions on cutting budgets, pay and jobs. \n     Yet, budgets always continue to grow, hiring expands, and \n     people get paid more for doing less.\n       I recently asked a few of my federal-worker friends, ``How \n     will you know that the government is truly shrinking?'' \n     Here's our top 10 list:\n       (10) When the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office has \n     a layoff. Our EEO chief gets paid more than $70,000 a year to \n     coordinate ``diversity'' events and spout aphorisms at \n     meetings. When that sacred cow gets a real job. I'll know the \n     change has come. Which brings me to . . .\n       (9) No more paid time of for diversity or charity events. \n     Today, the lazy but savvy employee can spend most of his or \n     her workweek attending such vital events as Earth Week, \n     Women's Equality Day, AIDS Awareness Day, or helping in the \n     annual United Way shakedown.\n       Employees can get away with this because the federal \n     culture, in general, lacks an urgency to produce, I'll know \n     the cuts have had an impact when agencies like mine no longer \n     can afford to have an $80,000-a-year employee take ``a few \n     months off'' to work on the United Way fund drive.\n       (8) When upper management is replaced for not making cuts \n     fast enough. Politically appointed managers serve at the \n     pleasure of the president. If he's displeased by an \n     appointee's not being willing to cut, the appointee should \n     go. Likewise, the appointee should threaten transfers or \n     demotions to senior civil servants who don't or won't hustle.\n       (7) When the entourage for agency heads disappears. My \n     agency has about 600 people--small by federal standards. Even \n     so, the guy who runs the place has a scheduler who's paid \n     $70,000 a year, a public-relations staff to write his \n     speeches and press releases, and a clutch of assistants and \n     advisers. These people are mostly civil servants, and they \n     represent a bloat at the top as they pamper and package\n      their boss. A congressman or senator can get by with fewer \n     helpers. Why not a bureaucrat?\n       (6) When the newspaper subscriptions stop. Scientific or \n     trade journals are one thing, but why does the federal \n     government need to buy thousands of subscriptions to the \n     Washington Post or the New York Times?\n       (5) When somebody gets canned--and quickly--for running a \n     business from his desk. I saw my first answering machine in \n     1979 on the desk of a federal employee who was running a real \n     estate business ``on the side.'' Moonlighting on the job is \n     still lucrative, as the chance of being punished, let alone \n     fired, is very small. If the White House caves in to union \n     pressure and won't push for streamlined firing procedures, \n     then the Hill should do it and get these thieves off the \n     payroll.\n       (4) When top management takes cuts too. Hiring freezes and \n     ``reductions-in-force'' are two tricks politicians and upper-\n     level civil servants use, probably because lower-level \n     employees get shuffled around while the top-heavy structure \n     remains intact. Corporate America has known for years that a \n     flatter management structure is more efficient. A smaller \n     budget coupled with a results-oriented Congress might do the \n     trick for the federal sector.\n       (3) When nobody says ``because we've always published this \n     report.'' I heard Mike Espy did something right at the \n     Agriculture Department. He stopped publishing the agency's \n     yearbook because nobody read it. Hundreds of federal \n     documents are published out of habit, not need.\n       The original need for all this paper came from the days \n     when the federal government was one of the few reliable \n     sources of information--and when the kind of information it \n     provided was difficult to get otherwise. Economists call that \n     ``market failure,'' since the market couldn't give the \n     service. Today, there is no market failure in information, \n     thanks to modems and the Internet. Except for the Census \n     (which is constitutionally mandated), the feds should stop \n     handing out information for free, cut the staffs, and let the \n     market take over.\n       (2) When they take ``solitaire'' off the computer. Gov. \n     George Allen of Virginia did it to his state's computers, and \n     he was right. He didn't think Virginia could afford to have \n     such addictive time-wasters on people's desks, and the same \n     goes for the federal government.\n       And (drum roll) the No. 1 way federal workers will be able \n     to tell when big government is being cut: When there's nobody \n     in the cafeteria at 2 p.m.\n       There's a story that now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence \n     Thomas was hated when he was a commissioner at the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity commission, because he would scour the \n     coffee shops in the afternoons and order people back to work. \n     Someday, I hope a manager will find an empty cafeteria at 2 \n     p.m. because his employees can't afford to goof off.\n       I believe the federal culture can change. But does the GOP \n     Congress have the guts to give the federal bureaucracy a \n     long-overdue kick in the pants? Some of us will be watching \n     for the signs.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5531-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5532-S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SENATE VOTES $16 BILLION IN CUTS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Now, Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about \nwhat happened in this Chamber last night.\n  I am interested in the fact that neither the Washington Post nor the \nNew York Times--the paper that considers itself the paper of record in \nthe United States--took proper notice of what happened here last night.\n  I would like to correct that and talk about it for just a minute. I \nhave here a copy of the Washington Times, the upstart newspaper, and it \nsays in the headline ``Senate Votes 99 to 0 for $16 Billion in Cuts.''\n  Now, Madam President, we were here 2 years ago, when the Senate was \nfighting about $16 billion--interesting symmetry in numbers--for a \nstimulus package which we were told was absolutely essential to get the \neconomy on its feet. Indeed, we were told on this floor that if we did \nnot pass this stimulus package of $16 billion in increased spending, \nthe economy would collapse, people would be out of work, everything \nwould fall apart.\n  We Republicans opposed the stimulus package. We did not have enough \nvotes to defeat it, but we had enough votes to prevent cloture, and we \nkept talking about it and ultimately it was taken down.\n  That is, for those who do not understand the language of this place, \n``taken down'' means that the majority leader removed it from the floor \nand it was left for dead.\n  We were told at that time, we have dealt the economy a serious blow. \nIndeed, that stimulus package was an appropriations bill referred to as \n``an emergency.'' It was an emergency appropriations bill, the \nadvantage of that being that it did not have to come under the budget \nrequirements.\n  You see, we have budget caps here and they say this is what is \nrequired. But if you have an emergency appropriation, that goes above \nthe budget caps. We had this $16 billion stimulus emergency before us \nand promises of all kinds of dire disastrous events that would occur if \nwe did not pass it. We did not pass it. The disastrous events did not \ncome to pass. And then, in this Congress, to show the difference, we \nhad a bill on the floor, a rescission bill--meaning we were cutting out \nof the present fiscal year's activities $16 billion. In business terms \nthis is a $32 billion turnaround.\n  While we were debating these $16 billion in rescissions, in cuts, we \nwere told, again on this floor: Disaster. If you make those cuts you \nwill be throwing children out into the snow. If you make those cuts you \nwill be trying to balance the budget on the backs of those people least \nequipped to handle it. We were told how terrible that would be. And we \npersisted. We stood firm.\n  When I came on the floor last night to vote I expected the vote on \nthis bill \n [[Page S5533]] to be as close, if you will, as the vote on the \nstimulus package was, because we had heard all these terrible things. \nThen, when the vote started to come in, I was stunned to hear the \npeople who were voting for these $16 billion in cuts. I thought maybe I \nam on the wrong side. Maybe this is a motion to table, because I am \ngoing to vote for this. But the other kinds of Senators, who are voting \nfor it, are not the ones I expected to be for these cuts, having heard \nall this rhetoric. But I looked around--no, everybody was voting for \nit. As the headline says in this morning's paper, ``Senate Votes 99 to \nZero for $16 Billion in Cuts.''\n  That demonstrates the change that has occurred in just 2 years. We \nhave gone from $16 billion in a stimulus package that we had to have or \nthe economy would collapse, bitterly fought over, highly partisan, \nnarrow vote--to a unanimous vote in the Senate that says $16 billion \ncan come out of the current fiscal year's activities without hurting \nthe economy. Indeed, I would suggest, it would help the economy.\n  So I am delighted to have been 1 of the 99 that voted for those cuts. \nI am delighted to welcome the new converts to the side of those of us \nwho believe that the Government can survive, that we can downsize the \nbureaucracy, that we can get some progress toward bringing our fiscal \naffairs in order, regardless of the rhetoric that has gone around.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5532-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5533-S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. There is another point I want to make, Madam President. \nDuring the debates 2 years ago there was a lot of conversation about \nsmall business. Everyone loves small business. Everyone recognizes that \nsmall business is the engine that drives the economy, because all of \nthe new job growth comes not in the big businesses but in small \nbusiness. The new job growth comes from the entrepreneurial effort, the \nyoung man or young woman who starts his or her own business, hires a \ncouple of neighbors, then takes on a few more and pretty soon you have \n8, 10, 12 employees where you had none before.\n  If you multiply that by the thousands, tens or hundreds of thousands \nof opportunities around the country, you realize that is where the new \njobs come from. As the big businesses are downsizing, the small \nbusinesses are providing the new job engine and opportunity.\n  In the debate that went on with respect to the economy 2 years ago, \neveryone said kind things about small business. But when it came to \ntalking about the realities of small business I, as a former small \nbusinessman, found an enormous amount of misunderstanding or, frankly, \nplain ignorance about the way small businesses work. Two areas \nconcerned me the most and I am hoping that this vote that occurred last \nnight signals as big a change in understanding of these two areas as it \ndoes with respect to how we are going to handle our fiscal affairs.\n  The first area that upsets small business people the most, as I go \naround and talk to them, is the area of regulation, overregulation, but \nperhaps even more frustrating, simply stupid regulation--lack of common \nsense. It has been my experience that we in the Congress write \nlegislation and we have a relatively focused attitude as to what will \nbe regulated--about the distance between my two hands. We legislate to \nthis regard.\n  Then, when the people in the executive branch receive that piece of \nlegislation they move the hands out and they start writing regulations \nwithin these parameters--like the fish that got away, when it is being \ndiscussed later on around the campfire. Then, after these regulations \nare sent out the enforcers get ahold of them and they enforce them as \nif there are no parameters, and the hands spread even wider. So the \nsmall business person comes to us in Congress and says, ``What are you \ndoing to us?\"\n  We say, ``This is the legislation that we wrote''--back to the \noriginal distance between the hands.\n  And they say, ``But we are faced with inspectors who are regulating \nas if there are no parameters at all.''\n  We have, within this Congress, a proposal that would say after we \nlegislate, and then the regulations are written, the regulations have \nto come back before the Congress and for 45 days we get an opportunity \nto cut them back to the level that we had in mind when we passed the \nlaw. If we can make that stick we will make a significant contribution \nto the health and welfare of every small business in this country and, \nindeed, back to my comments about the anonymous Federal bureaucrat, we \nmight even see some signs that Government is being brought under \ncontrol, and not so many people are in the cafeteria after 2 p.m.\n  The second area that was discussed last year with respect to small \nbusiness that frustrated me as a small businessman coming to the Senate \nhad to do with tax policy. It was very clear to me, with all of the \nwonderful things people were saying about small business, that most of \nthe Members of this body did not understand how small businesses really \noperate, and did not understand the impact of our tax changes on small \nbusinesses. We were told, for example, that the tax increase would fall \nonly on the rich. I remember clearly the chart which President Clinton \nreferred to in his address to the Nation, where he had a series of bar \ngraphs and the bar graphs at this end were very small. He said these \nare the people in this income bracket who will pay more taxes and these \nare the people in this income bracket who will pay more taxes. These \nare the people in this income bracket.\n  Now look at the people in this income bracket. These are the people \nwho earn over $250,000 a year. They are going to pay all the increased \ntaxes and that is what we want. It is for the rich people to pay the \ntaxes. As if only Michael Jordan was going to have to pay more taxes; \nnobody else was going to have to pay any more taxes.\n  Now, $250,000 a year is a lot of money for an individual, but it is \nnot a lot of money for a small business that is growing. Many times, \n$250,000 a year is a problem. Why? Because the business is growing and \nit needs money for inventory, it needs money for receivables, it needs \nmoney for additional facilities. Where is the money going to come from? \nIt is going to come from the profits being generated. And the business, \nfor tax reasons, is being taxed as an individual.\n  I said in this body before, has anyone here ever heard of a K-1? That \nis the tax form that a small businessman or small businesswoman uses to \nreport that income on his or her individual tax return. I pointed out \nin that bar graph that the President pointed to, 77 percent of the tax \nreturns filed by people who were represented in that bar graph \ncontained K-1 income.\n They were people who were reporting business income as if it were \npersonal income in order to avoid double taxation. Yet, in this body, \nwe were saying they were the rich and they had to have the tax increase \nput on them.\n\n  I hope that on the basis of last night's vote, we will recognize that \nthe way to balance the budget is not to say let us soak the rich, let \nus soak those who show this kind of income on their personal tax \nreturns, ignoring the fact that in many, many instances, it is not \npersonal income, it is business income that is being reported. And the \nbusiness needs that money desperately to continue the job creation \npattern.\n  We would say, on the basis of last night's vote, the way to balance \nthe budget is the way we did it last night, with a 99-0 vote in favor \nof spending cuts rather than the siren song of tax increases.\n  I conclude with this comment, Madam President, with respect to this \nquestion of tax increases and spending cuts.\n  In a business, you know what your costs are. And I look at what would \nhappen if you were to cut your costs, cut your overhead. You can \nproject that with some degree of accuracy. The thing you cannot project \nin a business with any degree of accuracy--well, maybe some degree, but \nit is pretty dicey--is how your sales are going to go, how your revenue \nis going to go up.\n  So if you were facing a shortfall in your business, you can cross \nyour fingers and hope that the sales will go up to cover that \nshortfall. I assure you, I have done that many times in my career, \nhoping against hope that the sales will go up. But the one thing you \ncan be sure of is that if you cut your overhead, those savings will be \nthere in the \n [[Page S5534]] following month even if the increased profits that you \nare hoping for, the increased revenues that you are hoping for are not \nthere in the following month.\n  Last night, we cut the overhead in ways that are predictable. When we \nraise taxes we are doing the same thing a business does when it raises \nprices and then hopes that the customers will not react negatively, \nhopes that it can raise prices and still continue to sell the same \nnumber of units it sold before the price increase. We in the Federal \nGovernment have a miserable track record of projecting how those price \nincreases are going to work.\n  I will give you two quick examples. Back as a result of the 1990 \nbudget summit, we raised prices--``we,'' the Government--raised prices \non two items, luxury boats and luxury cars. We projected that we would \nget more revenue out of both of these. To show what wonderful \nforecasters we are, on the luxury boat side, we took an industry that \nhad over capacity, that desperately needed a price cut to survive, and \nmandated a price increase that destroyed the industry, caused massive \nlayoffs and huge unemployment compensation bills. We missed that \nforecast terribly.\n  But before we say, ``Oh, is that not awful that we missed that \nforecast,'' let us look at the forecast for the price increase on \nluxury cars. We missed that one just as bad, Madam President. But \nfortunately, for the Treasury, we missed that one on the other side. \nThe revenue that came in from the increase in tax on luxury cars was \nthree times what we forecast it would be.\n  What is the lesson to be drawn from that? To me, it is very simple; \nit is that the Federal Government, regardless of how much we have \ninvested in computers and economists and experts, does a lousy job of \nforecasting what will happen as a result of its changes in tax policy. \nBut we can do a better job of forecasting what will happen as a result \nof changes in spending policy.\n  So I think the lesson that comes out of last night's action and our \nexamination of the contrast between this year and 2 years ago is this: \nWe can get our fiscal affairs under control. We can cut through all of \nthe rhetoric and the crying wolf and the horror stories and produce \nbipartisan support for spending cuts. Let us put the primary emphasis, \nlike good business people would, on controlling the spending rather \nthan crossing our fingers and hoping for the increased sales.\n  If we do that, we are on the right course. And I, for one, take great \ncomfort out of what happened here last evening and hope it will be the \nharbinger for many more headlines that say that the Senate votes \nunanimously for substantial spending cuts.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in her capacity as a Senator from \nTexas, suggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I think it is a phenomenal thing that \nhappened in America. In the last 3 months, the people asked for \nsomething different. And in the last 3 months, we have done exactly \nwhat the people asked.\n  If you ask a person to bring down to one or two words what the last 3 \nmonths mean, I would say ``promises kept.'' I think the people of \nAmerica were despairing that ever again, a politician would promise \nsomething and deliver.\n  That is what is happening right now in the Congress of the United \nStates. I commend the House of Representatives for giving themselves a \nvery heavy load and then succeeding in doing what they said they would \ndo.\n  There are those who disagree with what the House did. Probably no one \nagrees totally with what the House did. But if you look at the spirit \nand the intent and the strain of what they did, I think the people of \nAmerica agree that they did what they said they were going to do, and I \nthink the Senate of the United States will agree with many of the \nconcepts that the House has put forward.\n  If we are going to let the people of this country know that in fact \ntheir voices did make a difference in 1994, that the signal was \nreceived in Washington, DC, that the people want a different Congress \nand a different Government, then I think we are going to have to \ncontinue into the second and third 100 days going in the same direction \nthat we are now going.\n  What does that mean? First and foremost, Mr. President, it is what \nyou just talked about on the floor of the Senate a minute ago, a \nbalanced budget. First and foremost, we have to start showing that we \nare serious about balancing the budget. Last night, we started on that \nroad. We took some very serious and tough steps right in this 1995 \nbudget, and we cut almost $16 billion that will not be able to be spent \nbetween now and October 1 of this year.\n  So that is a beginning. It is a very small beginning when you look at \nwhat we really must do. We must get on a track that says between now \nand the year 2002 we are going to go toward a balanced budget, that the \n$5 trillion debt that is sitting out there will not be increased but in \nfact we will start whittling away at the deficit so that in the year \n2002 we can start looking at the long-term solutions to bringing down \nthe actual debt.\n  A lot of people do not realize that when we get to the balanced \nbudget in 2002, we still have the massive debt that we have to decide \nexactly how much of which we are going to pay down. But that is for the \nsecond phase. The first phase is to come to a balanced budget every \nyear, and that is our first commitment.\n  The second commitment is a reform of Congress. If we are going to \nlook at the long term, if we are going to look at the future, we are \ngoing to have to look at the reforms of Congress that will keep from \nhappening what we have seen over the last 30 years, which is a buildup \nof this massive intrusion of the Federal Government on our States, on \nour local governments, and on the lives of our people, especially our \nsmall business people. If we are going to do that, it is going to be \nnot only bringing down the bigness and vastness of Government, not only \nbringing down the arrogance of Washington, DC, but it is bringing down \nthe power base of Congress.\n  I think the most important first step that was made by the House of \nRepresentatives was on the first day--hardly any press about it, but \nthe reform of their leadership when they voluntarily voted themselves \nterm limitations on chairmanships and the Speaker of the House himself. \nThat began the process of bringing down the vast power that has \naccumulated in these Halls and really caused the massive increases in \nspending in the Federal bureaucracy. So when the Speaker says \nvoluntarily I am not going to serve more than 8 years, and when \ncommittee chairs say I am not going to serve more than 6 years, you \nhave really taken away a lot of the incentive to do things that build \npower bases and instead have given the incentive to do what is right \nfrom the public policy standpoint.\n  The Senate is now looking at just such changes, and I think it is \ngoing to be healthy for us to also in this body look at ways that we \ncan pass the leadership around. It is a very important reform. It is \ninternal. It will not be that well known outside the beltway. But it is \na very important internal reform that will have far-reaching \nconsequences.\n  The third area that I think is most important to get our country back \non track is regulatory reform. If we are going to free our businesses \nto compete in this new global marketplace, we must have the harassment \nof Federal regulatory excesses stopped now. Stop right now. By every \nstandard, the cost of complying with Federal regulations is holding \ndown our small business and our large business from growing and \nexpanding and creating the new jobs that will get this economy going \nagain.\n   [[Page S5535]] By conservative estimates, they say that business \ncosts of regulatory compliance are about $430 billion a year. If you \nadd the cost of regulatory compliance of States and local governments, \nit is about $900 billion a year.\n  To put that in perspective, Mr. President, the income tax brings in \njust under $800 billion a year. So as you are getting ready on April 15 \nto send your tax bill in, when you sign that tax bill, you should \nremember that what you are giving to the Federal Government is less \nthan the stealth tax of regulatory compliance. That is the cost that is \nholding our business down, from growing and creating the new jobs. So \nif we are going to free our business to compete, we must take off those \nregulatory excesses.\n  Does that mean we are going to stop striving for clean air, clean \nwater, protection of endangered species, safety in the workplace? \nHeavens no. Of course, not. What we must put in the equation is common \nsense. We are getting horror stories every day about some silly, stupid \nthing a regulator does that is unnecessary, that does not help the \nGovernment and most certainly hurts business. And it is the business \nthat is the economic engine of America. So if we can stop that \nregulatory excess, that will be the most important thing we can do to \nget this economy going once again.\n  So these are the areas that I think we must address in the second 100 \ndays. These are the areas that I think are going to be very difficult \nas we go forward. I have heard Democrats in the Chamber here, I have \nheard Democrats on radio programs talk about starving the children. The \npeople of America are smarter than that. The people of America \nunderstand that we are not starving children when we give the States \nthe responsibility for school lunch programs instead of running it from \nthe Federal Government. The people of America are tired of silly, \nridiculous statements like that that underestimate their intelligence, \nbecause I think the people of America who are raising our children \nunderstand that if our children are going to have a future at all, it \nis only if we begin to act responsibly in getting this huge Federal \ndebt off the backs of those very children.\n  If they are going to have jobs in their future, if they are going to \nhave education in their future, it is going to be only if we get this \neconomy going again. We cannot do it if we have a program of spend now \nand pay later. That is what our program has been for the last 30 years \nin this country, save 1 or 2 years of responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I think the people of America need to listen very \ncarefully. As we are going home for the next 2 weeks in the Senate, 3 \nweeks in the House, I hope that the people of America will listen \ncarefully to what their elected representatives are saying because the \nmessages could not be more different. Our message is one of providing \nfor the future, of trying to make sure that there is a healthy America \nfor our children, of trying to get the 10th amendment back in place, \nwhich says the powers not specifically given to the Federal Government \nwill be left to the States and to the people. We must return the 10th \namendment and we must let the States do what they know best, which is \nthe needs of their people, rather than somebody in Washington sitting \nin an office who may not have ever been to Iowa or New Hampshire or \nTexas or California or Utah deciding what the priorities in that State \nshould be.\n  My Governor, a Yale graduate, said, ``You know, I'm beginning to be a \nlittle offended by those people up in Washington. Do they think I'm \ngoing to serve potato chips to the children of Texas? Come on. I think \nthe people are smarter than that.''\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have had a very exciting beginning. I \nthink the people of America can say one thing right now and that is: \nthings are changing in Washington. Their voices are being heard.\n  Is it easy? No. It is going to be very tough. But is it a commitment \non our part to do what is right, not necessarily for tomorrow but for \nthe long-term, for 3 years, for 5 years, for 10 years? That is the \ncommitment that the people of America must see and that is what we must \ntalk about as we go home and get the input from our constituents.\n  I hope that every one of us will take this opportunity to do that, \nbecause I think we have had a great beginning. I think the people of \nAmerica should be assured that things are changing inside the beltway. \nAnd, with their support, we are going to keep right on plugging and try \nto make sure that the small business people of this country are able to \ngrow and create the jobs that will let every American family see a \nbetter future for their children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair).\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5534-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5535-S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                POLICY PROLONGS BOSNIAN HERZEGOVINA WAR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.\n   Mr. President, this week marks the third anniversary of the war \nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also marks the third anniversary of \nthe international community's failure in Bosnia--a failure the United \nStates, under both the Bush and Clinton administrations, has \nparticipated in.\n\n  The biggest mistake made by world leaders was extending, in practice, \nthe arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia to the Government of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina--which is an internationally recognized state and \nmember of the United Nations. In addition to violating Bosnia's \nfundamental right of self-defense--a right which is recognized in \narticle 51 of the U.N. Charter--this policy has had the effect of \nprolonging the war. It has prolonged the war by ensuring that the Serbs \nmaintain such a superiority in weapons that they are not compelled to \nsign any deal--even one which rewards them with half of Bosnia as \nenvisioned by the so-called contact group.\n  Now, the administration says that this European-designed policy has \nmanaged to contain the war and prevented further humanitarian \ndisasters. We should not rush to pat ourselves on the back for our \ngreat humanitarianism until we look at the facts.\n  The facts are that over 200,000 people have been killed over the past \n3 years, 17,000 of them children. Hundreds of thousands of civilians \nhave been expelled from their homes because of their ethnicity and \nreligion. Concentration camps, rape, and mass graves have become the \ntolls of ethnic cleansing--which is just another word for genocide. \nHomes, churches, and monuments have been reduced to rubble. Putting \naside the human factor, from an international legal perspective, the \nworld has watched as a U.N. member state has been attacked and \noccupied. And, now international leaders want to reward those attackers \nand occupiers, ostensibly in the pursuit of peace.\n  Yes, we must give credit to those brave aid workers and U.N. soldiers \nwho have sacrificed and risked their lives to bring food and medicine \nto those in need. The policy is not their fault; they do not make \npolicy--policymakers in Washington and European capitals do. \nNevertheless, we should not fool ourselves, feeding people who are \ntrapped in U.N. safe havens that are anything but safe, while denying \nthem the means to defend themselves is bad policy.\n  Yesterday, the Bosnian Prime Minister said in an interview that the \nBosnians should prepare for a decade of war. It may sound pessimistic \nto some, but in my view it's pretty realistic if the present policy \ncontinues. Why should Bosnian Serb leaders agree to a settlement? Why \nshould Bosnian Serb forces give up any of the 70 percent of the \nterritory they occupy? Because U.N. forces on the ground? Because of \nNATO planes that fly overhead but do not bomb?\n  It is clear that the international community does not have the will \nto live up to its commitment to protect the Bosnians, so why can't we \nallow them to protect themselves? The present policy of keeping the \nU.N. forces in Bosnia indefinitely amounts to occupation. UNPROFOR \nshould be withdrawn and the arms embargo should be lifted. That is the \nonly policy \n [[Page S5536]] that makes legal, political, and moral sense. And, it \nis the only policy that offers any hope of bringing this war to and end \nby creating a military balance on the ground.\n  Mr. President, if the cease-fire due to expire on May 1 is not \nextended and a peace settlement has not been agreed to by the Serbs, I \nintend to take up the Dole-Lieberman legislation on the Senate floor \nshortly after the April recess. Three years of monitored genocide is \nenough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5535-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5536-S5538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXTENDING THE APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE OF THE U.S. SENATE TO SENATOR \n                             ROBERT C.

I would just say I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nletting me be a cosponsor. Senator Byrd is certainly a unique figure in \nthe history of this country, let alone the Senate. I extend my \ncongratulations for his continued commitment to the institution as \nreflected in the four volumes. I certainly congratulate him for his \neffort.\n                       the senate and its history\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 206 years ago yesterday--April 6, 1789, \nU.S. Senate achieved a quorum and got down to business for the first \ntime. This is a fitting occasion to commemorate both the history of the \nSenate and the Senator who has become the Senate's foremost historian. \nAll of us have heard Robert C. Byrd expound upon the history of this \ninstitution, about the Constitutional Convention that created it, and \nabout its antecedents, the British Parliament and Roman Senate. In \naddition, he has regularly applied his historical knowledge to current \nfloor debates. If anyone questions the need for studying history, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia has offered living proof of its \nworth.\n  Those Members new to the Senate and those viewers recently addicted \nto C-SPAN-II might understandably assume that Senator Byrd spent his \nearly years in the Nation's finest schools pursuing a rich classical \neducation. Robert C. Byrd enjoyed none of those early advantages. On \nArmistice Day, November 11, 1918, shortly before his first birthday, \nhis mother fell victim to that year's devastating influenza epidemic. \nUnable to cope alone, his father gave the child to an aunt and uncle \nwho raised him in the hardscrabble coal fields of southern West \nVirginia. Although he graduated at the head of his high school class, \nthe hardships and poverty of those Depression-era years in the early \n1930's made college a luxury about which he could only dream. His early \nlife was one of unremitting labor, as a grocery clerk, a butcher, and a \nshipyard welder. In 1946, he won a seat in the West Virginia \nLegislature, the first step toward a rich and productive career of \npublic service.\n  Sixteen years after graduating from high school, Robert Byrd enrolled \nin college while serving in the State legislature. Driving great \ndistances between campus and capitol, he managed to complete 70 credit \nhours of straight-A course work while building an impressive \nlegislative record. In 1952, he won a seat in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. Although without a college degree, he was admitted to \nlaw school with the understanding that he maintain at least a B \naverage. In 1963, at age 45, and nearly 5 years into his Senate career, \nRobert Byrd became the first and only person to earn a law degree while \nserving as a U.S. Senator. Not surprisingly, he earned that degree cum \nlaude.\n  As he worked his way up the Senate leadership ladder--party \nsecretary, party whip, party floor leader, President pro tempore, \nAppropriations Committee chairman--he systematically pursued his study \nof the Senate's rules, precedents, and history; of the American \nConstitution; of the history of England and of ancient Rome. Blessed \nwith a keen intelligence, a photographic memory, and seemingly \nlimitless energy, he devoured countless volumes by such authors as \nPlutarch, Tacitus, Montesquieu, Gibbon, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson, \nand many more.\n  Consequently, it should have come as no surprise to his colleagues in \nthe Senate Chamber on a quiet Friday afternoon in March 1980, when he \ndelivered the first in what would become a series of 100 richly \ntextured addresses on the Senate's history and traditions. His speeches \nappeared serially in the Congressional Record and were later combined \ninto a magnificent four-volume series published by the Government \nPrinting Office. I urge all who hear or read what I say here today to \nexplore these volumes, as I have. Today I would like to take a few \nminutes to outline their rewarding content.\n  Senator Byrd's first volume takes the form of a chronological history \nof the United States from the point of view of the Senate. In it, he \ndescribes the events, personalities, and issues that affected the \nSenate from 1789 to 1989. Here are just a few examples:\n  He outlines the remarkable achievements of the First Congress, which \nfleshed out the form of our Federal Government by establishing the \nFederal judiciary, adopting the Bill of Rights, and providing sources \nof revenue.\n  He demonstrates that conflict between the President and Congress did \nnot begin in the 20th century by recounting the dramatic tale of Andrew \nJackson's struggles with the Senate over the Second Bank of the United \nStates. For the only time in its history, the Senate in 1834 actually \npassed a resolution censuring a Chief Executive, although 3 years later \nThomas Hart Benton succeeded in persuading the Senate to expunge that \naction, thus vindicating the aging Jackson before his presidential term \nexpired.\n  Senator Byrd relates the story of how Senators came to be elected by \ndirect popular vote after more than a century of being selected by the \nState legislatures. He traces the flaws in the original process and the \nefforts made to improve it before a constitutional amendment finally \nentrusted the citizens of each State with the choice of their Senators. \nHe also describes the later reforms included in the Legislative \nReorganization Act of 1946 that set the stage for the operation of the \nSenate we know today.\n  Unlike most histories of the United States, Senator Byrd views the \nNation's great landmark events, like the Civil War, World War I, the \nProgressive Era, the Great Depression, and World War II, through the \neyes of the Senate. He describes the way the body responded to each, \nshowing how the Civil War, for example, stimulated such civilian \nlegislation as the Pacific Railroad Act and the Land-Grant College Act.\n  Senator Byrd's second volume takes a topical approach to the Senate's \nhistory, discussing the way the institution has used its powers to \napprove treaties, confirm nominations, and conduct impeachment trials. \nMade up of individual chapters on such topics as Senate leadership, \norganization, and officers, this book provides essential background on \nmany matters that we still debate today. A chapter on congressional \nsalaries, for example, tells us that the subject has been controversial \nthroughout the Nation's history, with a public outcry forcing Congress \nto rescind a salary increase on more than one occasion.\n  The four chapters on extended debate that discuss the development of \nfilibusters and the evolution of the cloture rule offer perspective on \nthe way delaying tactics have been used in Senate debates and the \ntechniques that have been gradually developed to counteract them.\n  A chapter describing the history of the Senate Chaplain helped us \nearlier this year when questions arose regarding whether the House and \nSenate needed their own chaplains. The chapter not only explained the \norigin of the office but related that in the 1850's the House and the \nSenate for a time stopped electing official Chaplains and \n [[Page S5537]] instead used local clergymen, who took turns offering \nthe opening prayer. The Senate's experiment lasted only 2 years, as the \npractice became a burden on the Washington ministers who participated. \nThe House, too, soon returned to electing an official Chaplain.\n  Because of his interest in preserving the quality of senatorial \noratory, Senator Byrd pored over countless speeches delivered by \nSenators since the 1830's to select a sampling of more than 40 for the \nthird volume of his history, ``Classic Speeches.'' This collection \ngives a flavor of the best of 19th-century rhetoric, combined with \nexamples of addresses from this century that have been carefully \ncrafted by the speaker to be affecting and persuasive. Samples range \nfrom old favorites like Daniel Webster's ``Seventh of March'' 1850 \naddress on ``The Constitution and the Union'' and moments of high drama \nlike Jefferson Davis' emotional 1861 farewell to the Senate after \nMississippi seceded from the Union, to an example of campaign oratory \nby Stephen A. Douglas from the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates. From this \ncentury, Senator Byrd's, varied choices include Robert M. LaFollette's \nimpassioned 1917 plea for ``Free Speech in Wartime,'' Richard Nixon's \ntelevised ``Checkers'' speech during his 1952 Vice-Presidential \ncampaign, and Everett M. Dirksen's moving exhortation to his party \ncolleagues to vote for cloture on the 1964 civil rights bill.\n  An introductory note preceding each speech provides biographical \ninformation about the speaker and places the event in historical \ncontext. While some of these addresses deal with topics like slavery \nthat are no longer current, many of the broader themes, like the \nrelative roles of the State and Federal governments, remain lively \ntopics of debate even now.\n  The fourth volume of the history is a statistical appendix that not \nonly offers a collection of fascinating facts about the Senate but is \nconstantly useful in helping us to place events in historical context. \nHow many former Senators have ever served as Secretary of the Treasury? \nTwenty-five. Who was the oldest Senator ever to serve? Theodore Francis \nGreen at 93 years and 3 months. One Member today is close to reaching \nor exceeding that record. How many incumbent Senators have been \nnominated for President? I suspect quite a few of our current Members \nmight be disappointed to learn that the total is only 14, of whom only \n2 won election. How often have Vice Presidents cast the tie-breaking \nvote in the Senate? No one has yet matched the record 29 such votes \ncast by the first Vice President, John Adams. And in these days of \nbudget cutting, how has the number of Senate employees fluctuated over \nthe years? It has not always increased, as some may believe. Has the \nnumber of cloture votes taken by the Senate in each Congress increased \nin recent years?\n  The philosopher George Santayana said that ``those who cannot \nremember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' By this he means that a \nknowledge of history can keep people from making the same mistakes over \nagain, and from reinventing the wheel. That is a legitimate concern for \nMembers of the U.S. Senate entrusted as we are with enacting the laws \nof the Nation. But Senator Byrd has demonstrated that there are many \nother compelling reasons for Senators to know their history. He has \nreminded us that we are driven by a document that was written in the \n18th century and that has been amended only 27 times--most recently by \nan amendment drafted more than 200 years ago by the principal author of \nthe Constitution, James Madison.\n  Senator Byrd's history has shown that the Senate's original \nconstitutional powers and missions remain remarkably intact. It retains \nits original influence over the enactment of legislation, the \nconfirmation of nominations, and the ratification of treaties. The \nformal rules of the Senate are few in number and have undergone only \nseven general revisions in their more than two centuries of operation. \nThe precedents of the Senate are more voluminous, representing the \npractical application of those rules, and the strategies and tactics \nemployed by generations of legislators to achieve their objectives.\n  The precedents are simply another form of history: what was done in \nthe past, why it was done, and how it affects what we do today and \ntomorrow. As Senator Byrd's speeches have illuminated, some of these \nprecedents date back to an era when Senators wore powdered wigs and \nknee breeches. Others from the days when the Nation was divided in \nCivil War. Others from the great Depression, the World Wars, and the \ncold war. Although these epochs are receding in time, the precedents \nset by Senators who served in those earlier eras still guide our daily \nbusiness, just as what we do today will guide the future. The Senate, \nas Robert C. Byrd has repeatedly pointed out, is a continuing body, \nwith at least two-thirds of its Members continuing through each \nelection, and with its rules and procedures continuing uninterrupted \nfrom one Congress to the next.\n  As an institution, we value our traditions--from the 19th century \nfurnishings to the spittoons and snuff boxes here in the Chamber that \nlink us to our past.\n  Great Senators also left a legacy for their successors. We sit at \ntheir desks in the Chamber, pass their portraits and statues in the \nHalls. As part of his four-volume history, Senator Byrd has provided us \nwith a collection of their most memorable speeches. He has helped us \nrecall their examples, as we defend and amend their past legislative \nhandiwork.\n  Those of us who serve today wish to leave our own imprints on this \ninstitution for those who follow us in the next century. We want to be \nremembered for solving the problems that confronted us, and for leaving \nthe United States as strong or stronger than when we entered it. The \nSenator from West Virginia has amply accomplished that in his many \nlegislative roles and as the chronicler of the Senate's rich history. \nThere could be no more fitting way to commemorate this singular \nanniversary date than to reflect for a moment on our indebtedness to \nthis wise, learned, and deeply respected colleague.\n  On the occasion of the Senate's bicentennial in 1989, Robert C. Byrd \noffered the following historical assessment. His words should be \ninscribed over the entrance to this Chamber. Each of us should commit \nthem to memory. He said:\n\n       After two hundred years, [the Senate] is still the anchor \n     of the Republic, the morning and evening star in the American \n     constitutional constellation. * * * It has weathered the \n     storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and the \n     attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength to \n     the Nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, \n     panics and depressions. In war and peace, it has been the \n     sure refuge and protector of the rights of a political \n     minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--the great \n     forum of constitutional American liberty!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 109) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with the preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas Senator Robert C. Byrd on Friday, March 21, 1980, \n     delivered on the floor of the Senate, an extemporaneous \n     address on the history, customs, and traditions of the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas on the following Friday, March 28, 1980, the \n     Senator delivered a second, and once more spontaneous, \n     installment of his chronicle on the Senate;\n       Whereas the first 2 speeches generated such intense \n     interest that several Senators and others asked Senator Byrd \n     to continue the speeches, particularly in anticipation of the \n     forthcoming bicentennial of the Senate in 1989;\n       Whereas over the following decade Senator Byrd delivered \n     100 additional addresses on various aspects of the political \n     and institutional history of the Senate;\n       Whereas in anticipation of commemorating the 200th \n     anniversary of the Senate, Congress in 1987 authorized \n     publication of the addresses in suitable illustrated book-\n     length editions;\n       Whereas between 1988 and 1994, Senator Byrd meticulously \n     supervised preparation of 4 volumes, including a 39 chapter \n     chronological history, a 28 chapter topical history, a \n     compilation of 46 classic Senate speeches, and a 700 page \n     volume of historical statistics;\n       Whereas volumes in this series have received national \n     awards for distinction from organizations such as the \n     American Library Association and the Society for History in \n     the Federal Government;\n       Whereas the 4 volume work, entitled ``The History of the \n     United States Senate'', is the most comprehensive history of \n     the Senate that has been written and published;\n       [[Page S5538]] Whereas Senator Byrd has devoted tireless \n     energy and tremendous effort to the preparation and \n     publication of the historical books, enabling citizens of the \n     United States to better understand the history, traditions, \n     and uniqueness of the Senate; and\n       Whereas a better understanding by people of the Senate and \n     the role of the Senate in our constitutional system of \n     government will foster respect and appreciation for the \n     democratic traditions of the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate extends \n     congratulations and appreciation to Senator Robert C.

Duffy, of \nPennsylvania, to be an Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the nomination appear at the appropriate place \nin the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and that the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination was considered and confirmed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the chairman \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson], in bringing the nomination of Dennis Duffy to be VA Assistant \nSecretary for Policy and planning before the Senate and urging his \nconfirmation.\n  Dennis is a career VA employee who began working for VA in the \nPittsburgh regional office in 1974, 2 years after he returned from \nVietnam, where he served with the American division. For most of his \ncareer, he worked on benefits matters, both in the field and in VA \ncentral office. Most recently, Dennis has been working in Congressional \nAffairs, where he is now the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nCongressional Liaison.\n  The White House first indicated its intention last year to nominate \nDennis for this position, but his nomination was not received until \nafter adjournment, so we were unable to take it up. I was delighted \nwhen the President again submitted this nomination early in this \nCongress.\n  I think the job for which Dennis has been nominated--the VA Assistant \nSecretary for Policy and Planning--is terribly important. This vital \nposition has been vacant for nearly a year, and it is important that \nthe Senate act on this nomination quickly so as to restore leadership \nto the office.\n  I had a very strong interest in the role VA's Office of Policy and \nPlanning played in health care reform during the last Congress, and I \nanticipate that there is an important ongoing role in that area as the \nCongress seeks to address eligibility reform and other health care \nmatters. I am also very interested in many other exciting issues that \nthe office undertakes, which I look forward to working on with Dennis \nin the weeks and months ahead.\n  I am very excited that Dennis will join another VA Assistant \nSecretary, Mark Catlett, as the second career VA employee nominated to \nan advice and consent position within VA. Dennis' nomination to this \nposition--a key position within VA--is a very positive message for \ncareer employees throughout VA.\n  Mr. President, Dennis Duffy has a wonderful opportunity to serve the \nveterans of the Nation in this new office. President Clinton has shown \ngreat confidence in him, his work, and his commitment to veterans by \nnominating him to serve in this important position. I urge my \ncolleagues to give their unanimous support to this nomination.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5538-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  MALIGNMENT OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE NATION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I would like to address a certain letter \nthat is being passed around in the House to be sent to the President. I \nunderstand that the President may have already received it. The letter \nurges the President to veto H.R. 831, Permanent Deduction of Health \nCare Insurance Costs of Self-Employed Individuals. The letter has over \n139 House Democrats' signatures.\n  The conference report to H.R. 831 passed the House last week, and we \npassed it in the Senate on Monday. The President received the bill on \nTuesday, April 4, and it lies there waiting for the President to sign \nit into public law.\n  It is critical to 3.2 million tax filers that this bill be enacted \nprior to April 17--tax day. If it is not, then 11 days from now, less \nthan 2 weeks, 3.2 million filers will find that they cannot use a \ndeduction that they have had since 1986. Mr. President, 3.2 million \nfilers will find that they will have to pay more taxes than they did \nlast year. And Mr. President, these 3.2 million filers are farmers, and \nsmall business owners all across America.\n\n\n                               the letter\n\n  Now, this letter alludes that Republicans somehow carved out a \nspecial \n [[Page S5539]] exception for one pending deal. I want to set the \nrecord straight.\n  The conference report simply clarifies the definition of a binding \ncontract, and let me add that this clarification was raised by a \nDemocrat Member, not a Republican.\n  Second, the letter insinuates that during conference, Republicans \ntook out a provision imposing a tax on U.S. citizens who renounce \ncitizenship.\n  Mr. President, we have already been through this. We explained \nearlier this week, that in the Senate we agreed to impose taxation on \nU.S. citizens who renounce citizenship. But, this measure was adopted \nwithout the benefit of hearings. Subsequently, the Finance Committee's \noversight subcommittee held a preliminary hearing. This proposal raises \nimportant questions, and the hearings exposed some serious concerns. We \nsimply decided to not delay action on H.R. 831 while we continued to \nconsider alternatives to this expatriate provision. That is right, let \nme set the record straight once again--we are not opposing this in any \nway. Just the opposite, we want to get this done.\n  The conferees asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to study this \nprovision and other alternatives and get back to us by June 1, 1995. It \nis also clear that this provision will be effective as of February 6.\n  But while concerns remained with the provision, we did not include it \nin H.R. 831.\n  Also, Mr. President, during floor debate in the House on the tax \nbill, one of the signatories of the letter, Congressman Gephardt, tried \nto put a similar expatriate tax provision in the tax bill--with an \neffective date of October 1, 1996, much later than the Finance \nCommittee provision.\n  The letter to the President claims that House Democrat Members want \nto close an important tax loophole for millionaires, but it seems like \nthey want to close it very slowly.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  It is my sincere hope that the President gets the record straight. \nBecause if he does not, and he decides to play politics as usual, then \n3.2 million farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and taxpayers will \nsuffer for it.\n  It has been 3 days since the President received H.R. 831, and I urge \nthe President to sign it into law. There is no reason to delay any \nlonger. It should be signed as soon as possible so that taxpayers can \nfinish preparing their tax returns in time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5538-7", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NELLE M.

Mr. President, I join the President, Members of \nCongress, and the American people in welcoming the Prime Minister of \nPakistan, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, to the United States. I wish her well \nduring her visit. I had the opportunity to meet with her in Pakistan \njust a few months after her re-election as Prime Minister in October \n1993. I enjoyed visiting her beautiful country. The opportunity for \nlasting peace and economic growth both within Pakistan and throughout \nSouth Asia should be a top priority for the United States and all the \ncountries of that region.\n  I suspect that it is largely due to the visit of Prime Minister \nBhutto that the Clinton administration once again is publicly \nquestioning the effectiveness of the so-called Pressler amendment, the \nlaw that prohibits direct United States aid to Pakistan.\n  As my colleagues know, it was 10 years ago that I successfully \noffered an amendment in the Foreign Relations Committee to cut off aid \nand military sales to Pakistan if the President could not certify that \nPakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. The Reagan \nadministration supported the amendment. In fact, they helped write it. \nEven the Government of Pakistan did not object to the amendment because \nthey claimed they were not pursuing a nuclear option.\n  In fact, my amendment was considered a compromise. Our former \ncolleague from California, Senator Alan Cranston, had another amendment \nthat immediately would have cut off aid to Pakistan, without \nPresidential certification, because he believed Pakistan already \npossessed the materials needed to assemble a nuclear bomb.\n  In October of 1990, nearly 5 years after the Pressler amendment \nbecame law, the Bush administration was unable to certify that Pakistan \nwas not in possession of a nuclear explosive device. As a result, all \nU.S. direct aid and military sales were terminated. At the time of the \naid cutoff, Pakistan was attempting to purchase a fleet of F-16's from \nthe United States. Because of the enforcement of the Pressler \namendment, delivery of the aircraft never took place.\n  Despite claiming to have a strong policy on nuclear nonproliferation, \nthe Clinton administration consistently has shown hostility toward the \nPressler amendment--the only nuclear nonproliferation law with teeth. \nIn the fall of 1993, the Clinton administration called for the repeal \nof the Pressler amendment, but backed off after pressure from Members \nof Congress.\n  The Clinton administration last year began to float a new proposal to \ngrant a one-time waiver of the Pressler amendment to allow for the \ndelivery of at least 22 of the F-16 aircraft sought by Pakistan--\naircraft that can carry and drop a nuclear bomb. The administration's \nproposal was originally unconditional, but was later modified with a \ncondition that Pakistan promise to cap its nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  In recent weeks, the Clinton administration has been at it again, \nproposing a $1 billion package of military equipment, consisting mainly \nof the F-16's. Frankly, Mr. President, I find simply preposterous any \nproposal that would transfer even one F-16 to Pakistan without first \nsecuring that nation's compliance with the Pressler amendment and its \nsignature on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty [NPT].\n  The latest Clinton F-16 transfer plan--like the first--is \nunacceptable. I am astounded that an administration that pays so much \nlip service to the cause of nuclear nonproliferation would consider \nproviding Pakistan with aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear weapon.\n  Never before in history has a nation sought to transfer nuclear \ndelivery vehicles to a country that has nuclear weapons and say it is \ndoing so in the interest of nuclear nonproliferation. The Clinton plan \ndefies basic common sense.\n  Indeed, President Clinton's proposed military aid package to Pakistan \nwould have the worst of consequences: \n [[Page S5540]] It would strike a serious blow against regional peace \nand worldwide nuclear nonproliferation; undermine the tremendous \neconomic progress that has occurred in South Asia; launch a nuclear \narms buildup in South Asia; and perhaps most frightening, increase the \nlikelihood of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. \nIndeed, any individual who has an interest in the future economic \ndevelopment of South Asia should have serious concerns with the Clinton \nadministration's proposal.\n  I recognize that a number of U.S. aerospace firms have a strong \ninterest in this issue. The transfer of F-16's would mean new business, \nnew contracts, and new jobs here at home. I suspect these firms are \nputting tremendous pressure on the Clinton administration to push for \nmilitary aid to Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, the aid package may mean more jobs at home, but it \nwould come at a heavy price on a global scale. I do not believe any \nissue is more important to the security of all free people than nuclear \nnonproliferation, particularly in potential hot spots such as South \nAsia. I am concerned that the transfer of F-16's would spark a nuclear \narms race in South Asia.\n  The Clinton administration has traveled this same road before. The \ncatalyst for the nuclear tightrope walk that occurred in North Korea \nwas the perception by officials in Pyongyang that the United States was \nnot serious about nuclear nonproliferation. I would have thought that \nafter North Korea, the Clinton administration would have learned an \nimportant lesson. It does not appear they have learned.\n  Once again, the administration is willing to be the catalyst for \ndestabilization. The wrong signals are there. I fear India will be \nforced to rethink its current military force structure if Pakistan \ntakes delivery of the F-16's, including resumption of their nuclear \nprogram, deployment of short-range weapons, and even development of \nlong-range options.\n  Further, Mr. President, we must consider not just the instability \nbetween India and Pakistan, but instability within Pakistan itself. \nWith all due respect to Prime Minister Bhutto, I have very serious \nconcerns about the ability of her civilian government to hold its \nmilitary leaders accountable to civilian-based policies. I urge my \ncolleagues to examine closely this military-civilian chain-of-command \nissue.\n  We also must examine the inability of Mrs. Bhutto's government to \nrespond effectively to the shocking wave of violence sweeping her \ncountry. Terrorist groups, such as the Harkatul Ansar--the Movement of \nFriends--are based in Pakistan, but have links to similar groups in \nIran. The New York Times recently reported that a massive worldwide \nnetwork of Islamic terrorism was traced to a university in Peshawar--\nthe University of Dawat and Jihad. This is not a run-of-the-mill \ninstitution of higher learning. Students go there to seek advanced \ndegrees in worldwide terrorism. Graduates of this university have \napplied their lessons of death in North Africa, the Middle East, and \nAsia.\n  Terrorist violence is a mortal plague within Pakistan, leaving more \nthan 1,000 people dead since the beginning of last year. This wave of \nterror recently claimed the lives of two American diplomats, who were \ntracked down and killed in cold blood. Even Prime Minister Bhutto \nquestioned whether or not she had the resources necessary to crack down \non the militant organizations operating within her country. Others \nquestion whether or not Prime Minister Bhutto has enough political \ncapital to take the tough action needed to restore stability.\n  Therefore, I shudder at the thought of a nuclear capable government \nin South Asia that is incapable of controling its own military command \nor restoring order at home. This internal instability increases the \npossibility that nuclear weapons could fall into the hands of a \nterrorist state or organization. It boggles my mind that President \nClinton would propose an aid package that would add both to the \nGovernment's nuclear capability and to the region's instability.\n  This fact raises yet another problem, which gets to the very essence \nof the Pressler amendment. Mr. President, the Pressler amendment was \nmeant to be a strong warning to an ally: If you go nuclear, it will \ncome at the expense of U.S. aid. The United States cannot condone--\nthrough taxpayer assistance--the Government of Pakistan becoming a \nnuclear power.\n  This policy has worked to a large degree. Pakistan has at least \nfrozen the development of its nuclear program. A number of states that \npursued active nuclear weapons research programs in the 1980's have \nabandoned them, including Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, and \nSouth Africa. They responded to American diplomacy and their own good \ncommon sense. It is worth noting that both South Korea and Taiwan have \nantidemocratic neighbors and the temptation to hide behind a nuclear \nshield is undoubtedly high.\n  In one of the worst ways imaginable, the Clinton administration's \nproposed military aid package would be seen as a certification and \nacceptance of Pakistan as a full-fledged nuclear power--a signal that \nruns counter to our own support and insistence for the ratification of \nthe NPT. Pakistan is not a signatory of the NPT. It does not allow \ninspections. Yet, these facts do not seem to be important to the \nClinton administration. Just as ominous, the proposed military aid \npackage tells other countries that there are no long-term penalties for \ngoing nuclear.\n  Mr. President, I have made this point: The administration's proposal \nto change the Pressler Amendment is a bad policy. I urge my colleagues \nto review it carefully, but skeptically. Let me reiterate: I want to \nsee Pakistan succeed economically. I want to see peace achieved both \nwithin and beyond Pakistan's borders. I want to see our nuclear \nnonproliferation goals achieved. The administration can achieve all \nthose policies by withdrawing its proposed aid package and standing \nfirmly behind the Pressler amendment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5539-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5540-S5542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE REAL MEANING OF THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for almost 100 days now, we have been \nhearing about the Contract With America--here in Washington and in my \nhome State of South Dakota.\n  This week we get their contact with America. Every time you open a \nnewspaper or turn on your TV or your radio--or even your computer--some \nRepublican is speaking in superlatives about what is happening in \nCongress. Not everyone shares that enthusiasm.\n  One of the most astute assessments I have heard of the Republicans' \n100 days was offered last week by a Capitol tour guide. When someone \nasked him what had passed so far in this Congress, he said, ``About 12 \nweeks.''\n  I can tell you a lot more has happened in South Dakota during those \n12 weeks. Farmers and ranchers, who have been gearing up for the spring \nplanting and helping their livestock through the calving season, are \ngrappling with the harsh realities of low commodity and livestock \nprices, hoping there will be enough to support their families.\n  On Main Streets in cities and towns across South Dakota, small \nbusiness owners and employees are working longer and harder just to \nmaintain their incomes.\n  In other words, life is going on in South Dakota, and people are \ntrying to move forward, looking toward change in Washington to help \nthem realize their dreams.\n  The tradition of scrutinizing the first 100 days really began, as you \nknow, with President Franklin Roosevelt. Most students of government \nstill consider the first 100 days of the New Deal to be the most \nsuccessful in the history of the Federal Government. And no wonder. By \nthe end of President Roosevelt's first 100 days, Congress had passed an \nextraordinary package of 15 bills that fundamentally changed the \nrelationship between business and Government, and individuals and \nGovernment.\n  It was an agenda that was firmly rooted in FDR's belief, as he said, \nthat ``the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize \nthat the great public is interested more in good government than in \npolitics.'' That is a sentiment you won't find in the Republicans' \nContract With America. For it was politics pure and simple--the 1994 \nelection and a mountain of polling data--that gave us the so-called \ncontract.\n  [[Page S5541]] Franklin Roosevelt knew to be skeptical of people, \nlike so many in this new Republican majority, who promise easy \nsolutions to hard problems. He could easily be speaking of today's \nRepublican majority when he commented on their predecessors more than \n60 years ago.\n  ``Let me warn you and let me warn the Nation,'' he said, ``against \nthe smooth evasions of those who say, `Of course we agree with all \nthese things.\n  ```We believe in Social Security. We believe in work for the \nunemployed. We believe in saving homes. Cross our hearts and hope to \ndie, we believe in all these things. But we do not like the way the \npresent administration is doing them. Just turn them over to us. We \nwill do all of them. We will do more of them. We will do them better. \nAnd most of all, the doing of them will not cost anybody anything.'''\n  Does this sound familiar? It should. That is the Big Lie on which the \ncontract is constructed: ``We can balance the budget. We can increase \nmilitary spending. We can give more tax breaks to the rich. And it will \nnot cost anybody anything. In fact, you and your family are going to \nget money back.''\n  Clearly, the promise to fundamentally change the Federal Government \nsounded very good to some people last November. But were they voting \nfor the Republican contract? The fact is, they were not. Less than 5 \npercent of Americans had even heard of the contract on Election Day. \nEven now, polls show that the more people hear about the contract, the \nmore nervous they get. And with good reason. To paraphrase Pogo, we \nhave met the enemy in the Republicans' contract, and it is us.\n  It is not big-money special interests the Contract targets--\nRepublicans have invited the lobbyists into their offices to rewrite \nthe laws. The enemy in the Republican contract is not even the infamous \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  It is working families and their children in South Dakota and across \nthe Nation.\n  They can wrap it up in new spinmeister packaging, but the struggle at \nthe center of the contract is the same struggle that has defined the \ndifference between the Republican and Democratic Parties for \ngenerations.\n  It is the struggle between the rich and the rest of us.\n  We do not have any billionaires in South Dakota who will benefit from \nthe tax loophole Republicans are fighting to protect that allow \nbillionaires to renounce their citizenship to avoid paying taxes on the \nfortunes they have made in our country.\n  We do not have a lot of powerful corporate lobbyists who have gained \nunprecedented access to the Congress.\n  What we do have in South Dakota are hard-working families who wamt \nchange, who want more opportunities for themselves, and a better future \nfor their children.\n  Republicans were on the wrong side of this struggle before, and they \nare on the wrong side now. We have heard a lot about the casualties of \nthe contract, but the biggest casualty is not a person or a group. It \nis Americans' sense of values--our sense of fairness. Most of all, it \nis our fragile but essential belief that if we work hard, we can make a \nbetter life for ourselves and our kids.\n  This ethic, this belief, was ingrained in all South Dakotans. This \nbelief, this value, is essential to our survival as a democracy.\n  De Tocqueville wrote that it is our values, even more than our laws, \nthat enable Americans to maintain this democracy, and that fundamental \ninsight into our character remains true to this day.\n  If people do not know the difference between right and wrong, all the \nprisons in the world will not keep us safe. If children come to school \nwith no sense of discipline, no respect for authority, the best \nteachers and, the best computers in the world will not make a \ndifference. And if young people grow up in a society that does not \nreward honest work, no welfare reform plan in the world will work.\n  We cannot solve our problems with a law or a check--or even the \nthreat of no check. If we want to restore the American dream, we have \ngot to restore American values. And that means\n strengthening America's families. Families are where values are taught \nand learned. But teaching values takes time. It takes time.\n\n  And time is something that most families have less of every year. I \nhear this every time I go home.\n  One story this year that didn't get perhaps quite as much attention \nas it deserved was a series of strikes by autoworkers who were \nprotesting mandatory 50- and 60-hour workweeks.\n  The workers said the extra pay just wasn't worth the price they were \npaying in burnout and in time spent away from their families.\n  The conflict many workers feel between trying to be both good \nproviders and good parents was best summed up by a single mother at a \nGM factory in Michigan who had just put her son in counseling and just \nlearned that her 18-year-old daughter was pregnant.\n  You know what she said? She said, ``I keep thinking that maybe if I'd \nbeen able to spend more time with them this wouldn't have happened.''\n  That is a conflict more parents live with each year. From the late \n1960's to the late 1980's, the average workyear for American workers \nincreased by 163 hours. You know what that is? That's an extra month \neach year.\n  Today, fewer than one-third of American families have time to eat \neven one meal a day together. And nearly 7 million children--including \nhalf a million pre-school kids--spend at least part of each day all \nalone.\n  Why are parents spending less time with their kids? The answer is \nsimple: In spite of an unprecedented effort by the Clinton \nadministration to create more than 6 million new jobs, the real income \nof most Americans is declining.\n  Each year, it takes more people working more hours in a family just \nto afford the basic. Eighty percent of America's families have not seen \ntheir incomes rise since the 1970's. Eighty percent. And this is true \ndespite huge increases in two-income and even three-income families.\n  Even in the 1990's, the richest one-third of Americans are getting \nricher, while incomes for everyone else keep falling. And let me tell \nyou, that is fundamentally wrong. And Democrats must fight it.\n  Not long ago I had a young father tell me, ``Either I can spend time \nwith my family or support them--but not both.'' Those are not \nconditions for teaching moral values. They are an invitation to moral \nanarchy. And the extreme agenda of the new majority--despite all its \npious and populist rhetoric--is almost certain to make matters worse.\n  Because it is designed to reward the rich and the well-connected at \nthe expense of America's middle-class families. That is wrong and \nDemocrats must fight it, make no mistake: The new Republican agenda is \nworse than indifferent to the needs of working families. It is \ndownright hostile to them. It is trickle-down economics with a \nvengeance. And if it is enacted, it will destroy much of the middle \nclass.\n  If you doubt it, just look at some of the tax changes Republicans are \nproposing:\n  One of the more moderate members of the Republican party is proposing \nthat we repeal income taxes on stock profits. In other words, let's tax \nonly wages. And some Republicans want to protect the tax loophole that \nallows billionaires to renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying \ntaxes on the fortunes they have made in this country.\n  You know, when George Washington found out that Benedict Arnold was a \ntraitor he probably thought about a lot of things. He probably thought \nabout flogging him. He probably thought about hanging him. He probably \nthought about taking everything he owned. But I guarantee you one thing \nhe never thought about was giving him a tax break.\n  What kind of contract is that?\n  Of course, many of us feel that the contract is more noteworthy for \nwhat it leaves out than for what little it actually does. The contract \noffers no blueprint to create more jobs or better-paying jobs. And, it \noffers no plan to fix any of the other problems that are undermining \nAmericans' economic security.\n  Quite the opposite, the Republican agenda makes it harder for people \nto climb the economic ladder by gutting worker training programs and \ncollege loans.\n  Under the Republican contract, 27,165 South Dakota college students \nwill pay \n [[Page S5542]] more for their student loans. Who knows how many who \ncannot afford the higher priced loans will simply drop out.\n  It makes it harder for poor families to escape welfare by blocking \nany increase in the minimum wage.\n  The Republican agenda leaves virtually every American family at risk \nof financial ruin by refusing to reform health care. For some, the past \n100 days simply means that more people are without health insurance in \nSouth Dakota and a lot of people--and hoping they do not end up like \nsome of their neighbors--the 1,200 retirees of the Morrell meatpacking \ncompany in Sioux Falls, who suddenly lost their health benefits 2 \nmonths ago.\n  And, the contract undermines our effort to enforce laws protecting \nAmericans from polluted air and water, from spoiled meat and killer \ntoys and a whole host of other dangers.\n  The big winners in the contract are the lobbyists and special \ninterests, who Republicans have invited--quite literally--into \ncommittee rooms to write the laws as they choose.\n  The big losers, of course, are working families, who are going to end \nup picking up the tab for the special interests--the same as they did \nin the 1980's. That is wrong, too, and Democrats will fight it.\n  The biggest problem with the contract is not simply that it threatens \nto bankrupt working families economically. It is also morally bankrupt. \nDemocrats have a responsibility to challenge not just the details of \nthe contract, but the underlying values as well. We need to raise our \nvoices, particularly in the face of the extreme new agenda of the \nRepublican Party.\n  We need to find new ways, new technologies, to communicate our basic \nbeliefs, and, we need to expand the debate to include values that \nmatter to working families. Values like fairness and tolerance, genuine \nopportunity, and generational progress.\n  More important, we need to make sure that our values shape our public \npolicy. Too often, government policies do not reflect our nation's \nvalues. Sometimes they have actually exacerbate the conditions they \nwere created to eliminate.\n  No matter how noble their original purpose, when we try to protect \nfailed programs, we undermine the credibility of government and thus \nthe ability of government to help the people who deserve help.\n  So, making sure our values shape our public policies mean, first of \nall, acknowledging when something is not working. Making sure our \nvalues shape our public policies also means reforming our welfare \nsystem so that it rewards work. It means encouraging families to be \nstrong and to stay strong. Making sure our values shape our public \npolicies means we need truth-in-sentencing laws. We need to hold people \nresponsible for their actions. And we need to protect people from crime \nin the first place.\n  President Clinton and a Democratic Congress last year passed a tough \nnew crime bill that puts 100,000 more police on the street, including \n77 in my home State. Now Republicans want to gut that bill. That is \ndead wrong. And Democrats will fight it.\n  Making sure our values shape our public policies means we need to \nlisten to average people, not campaign contributors. In Washington and \nin every State capitol in this country, holy wars are being waged with \nunholy amounts of money. People don't know where the buck stops \nanymore. They only know it stops the debate.\n  And this is wrong. And Democrats will fight it--by pushing for real \ncampaign finance reform--in this session of Congress.\n  Making sure our values shape our public policies means helping \nworkers learn new skills so they can keep their job or get a new one. \nNot long ago, Speaker Gingrich called unemployment insurance ``vacation \npay for freeloaders.'' Republicans may think that makes a good sound \nbite, but it's small and insensitive. If we value work, then let us \ntreat workers with dignity. Give them the tools and training they need \nto earn their own way, and they will not need unemployment insurance or \nanything else from government.\n  Finally, making sure our values shape our public policies means \nhelping middle-class pay for college with affordable loans or the sweat \nequity that comes from national service.\n  In asking Congress to do these things, Democrats are only asking the \nRepublican majority to do what the American people expect them to do: \nto lead. Their refusal to even discuss our proposals makes it clear \nthat Republicans do not oppose the way we Democrats have done the job \nof fighting for working families and children. They are fundamentally \nopposed to the job being done at all.\n  I said at the beginning of my remarks that the American people did \nnot vote for the Republican contract because most had not even heard of \nit. Instead, they were voting to continue the original Contract With \nAmerica. They voted to make America a place, once again, where people \nstill believe in values like tolerance and fairness, and parents still \nhave the time to teach those values to their children.\n  America can be what America was, a place where you can get ahead if \nyou work hard. We can make America that kind of place again. But it's \ngoing to take more than angry demagoguery and more than the mad dash of \n100 days.\n  Americans understand that. Because leaders like Franklin Roosevelt \ntaught us. President Roosevelt led this Nation through a depression and \na world war. He knew that good government is government which unites \nthis country, not divides it. It is government that offers hope, not \nfear--that proposes real solutions where there are real problems. He \nled, so others were willing to follow.\n  As a former history professor, Newt Gingrich should remember the \nwords of his favorite President who said that ``the only limit to our \nrealization will be our doubts of today.''\n  While Democrats do not advocate going back to the programs of the New \nDeal, we believe that the values that shaped that agenda are as valid \ntoday as they have ever been. The realization of tomorrow must be built \nfrom the realization of strong national leadership today, the kind of \nleadership the American people have turned to throughout our history, \nand to which future generations must turn, not just for 100 days, but \nfor that many years, and more.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5540-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5542-S5545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SCHOOL-TO-WORK: A LARGER VISION\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, in November of last year, Mr. Sam Halperin \nof the American youth policy forum addressed a statewide conference in \nRhode Island on implementation of the new School-to-Work Opportunities \nAct of 1994. His thoughts bear careful consideration not only as we \nmove this act from legislative provision to program but also as we \napproach reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act.\n  Mr. Halperin is a distinguished educator whose views merit careful \nconsideration. He has served as Deputy Commissioner in the old Office \nof Education, Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare, and the director and first president of the \nInstitute for Educational Leadership.\n  I would ask that the full text of Mr. Halperin's remarks be placed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    School-to-Work: A Larger Vision\n\n                        (By Dr. Samuel Halperin)\n\n       Thank you for your invitation to help develop Rhode \n     Island's plans for implementation of the School-to-Work \n     Opportunities Act of 1994 (hereafter STWOA). I have no doubt \n     that you will soon win one of the federal implementation \n     grants, grants already awarded to eight other states.\n       My only doubt is whether your vision will be as large-\n     spirited and as bold as the federal Act itself. Will you \n     seize the opportunity to rethink the essential nature of \n     schooling at the dawn of the 21st Century? Will you construct \n     a total quality system in which each of the parts supports \n     and advances the welfare of all the other parts? That is the \n     challenge. That is the opportunity.\n\n\n  School-to-Work Opportunities Act: ``Historic, Landmark'' Legislation\n\n       Five features of the new Act qualify it for designation as \n     ``historic,'' even ``landmark,'' legislation:\n       One, previous federal legislation focussed mostly on the \n     disadvantaged (Job Training Partnership Act, JOb Corps, ESEA \n     Title I). STWOA is the most universal, non-means-tested \n     effort to date. It is intended to help all students who have \n     not yet completed \n      [[Page S5543]] high school, regardless of their economic \n     status.\n       Two, STWOA is the first federal education legislation to \n     declare that preparation for earning a living is one of the \n     legitimate and important roles of schooling for all students, \n     including the college-bound.\n       Three, previous federal legislation implied that learning \n     is the near-exclusive province of the schools. STWOA affirms \n     that learning takes place in families, communities, schools \n     and workplaces. Employers and worksite learning are central \n     in the new legislation. So are parents and community-based \n     organizations. All of these agencies are specifically \n     recognized as major stakeholders and partners in every local \n     STW partnership.\n       Four, previous federal legislation (with the exception of \n     Vocational Education) largely bypassed the high schools. \n     (Title I compensatory education funds, the largest program, \n     are concentrated largely in the early grades.) STWOA focusses \n     on high school and the transition to postsecondary education. \n     While it addresses the needs of all students, it \n     ``remembers'' the needs of ``The Forgotten Half'' who are not \n     going to four-year colleges immediately after high school \n     graduation.\n       Five, previous federal legislation provided annual funding \n     over many years. STWOA, accommodating to harsh federal fiscal \n     realities, seeks to leverage change through limited financial \n     incentives. Federal ``venture capital'' over a seven-to-ten-\n     year period is intended to help you form voluntary \n     partnerships and consortia of all the stakeholders. STWOA \n     also encourages you to re-assess how you are using other \n     federal, state and and local funding streams and, possibly, \n     combine them for greater impact.\n       Overall, the hope is that the new ways of doing business \n     that you will develop will produce greater student \n     achievement and far greater satisfaction with the graduates \n     of your community's total educational enterprise.\n\n\n                       What School-to-Work Is Not\n\n       Now, having told you why I think the new Act presents such \n     a large historic challenge, I'd like to emphasize what the \n     Act is not.\n       First, it's not another one of those small federal programs \n     that soon becomes overlaid with reams of federal and state \n     guidelines and regulations. The last thing in the world you \n     need is another categorical program, another ``flavor of the \n     month!''\n       STWOA is not a fancy euphemism for existing programs like \n     vocational education or career exploration, although each of \n     these endeavors has a vital role to play in School to Work.\n       It's not a way for America to beat the Japanese and Germans \n     in international economic competition.\n       It's not another tracking device to separate winners and \n     losers in the education race or to offer second-class \n     schooling to students who may not see themselves as college-\n     bound.\n\n\n                      What School-to-Work Could Be\n\n       Now let me tell you what I think STW could be here in Rhode \n     Island and around the country.\n       Ideally, STW is a systematic, comprehensive, community-wide \n     effort to help all young people (1) prepare for high-skill \n     and high-wage careers, (2) receive top quality academic \n     instruction, and (3) gain the foundation skills to pursue \n     post-secondary education and lifelong learning. I stress all \n     young people, including those with disabilities and those who \n     are headed for a four-year degree at our finest colleges and \n     universities.\n       When carried out effectively, STW offers a high school \n     experience that challenges and motivates our youth to develop \n     the skills, knowledge and behaviors they need to achieve \n     economic earning power and, in turn, achieve the American \n     dream.\n       STW will also help to provide American employers with the \n     qualified workers they need. Through new or expanded local \n     partnerships, employers will work with teachers to develop \n     and implement curricula that span both the school and work \n     sites, setting high standards for student performance and \n     credentialing youth for good careers.\n       To the architects of STWOA, the Act is a way to rethink \n     what we adults are doing to prepare our young people for \n     success in life. It offers us the opportunity to \n     fundamentally alter the high school experience--which \n     currently is not working well for many, if not most, \n     students. It brings high school into alignment with more \n     effective ways of teaching and learning and promises a \n     brighter future for far more young people. It also gives \n     adults far greater personal and professional satisfaction \n     from their work with young people.\n\n\n                  a critique of American high schools\n\n       STWOA was created out of a widespread belief that most high \n     schools are not working well, particularly for the 75 percent \n     of our young people who are unlikely to earn a baccalaureate \n     degree. Consider these contemporary comments on the American \n     high school:\n       ``Most employers look at the high school diploma as \n     evidence of staying power, not academic achievement. They \n     realized long ago that it is possible to graduate from high \n     school in this country and still be functionally illiterate. \n     As a result, the non-college-bound youth know that their \n     performance in high school is likely to have little or no \n     bearing on the type of employment they manage to find.'' \n     (Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, \n     America's Choice: high skills or low wages!, 1990)\n       ``Most kids think [academic] education methods are torture \n     devices invented by teachers . . . they got that idea because \n     they can see that no one in the workplace is doing these \n     things.'' (Stephen Hamilton, Cornell University Youth and \n     Work Program.)\n       ``It's evident that the vast majority of kids in high \n     school are not motivated. We don't seem to be approaching \n     them in ways that engage them in learning.'' (John f. \n     Jennings, U.S. House of Representatives Committee on \n     Education and Labor.)\n       ``Students not bound for college need the most help, \n     receive the least assistance, are equipped with the most \n     limited information, and experience the greatest risks in the \n     job market.'' (Gary Orfield and Faith Paul, High Hopes, Long \n     Odds, 1994)\n       Over the twenty-year period from 1967-1987, the percentage \n     of jobs held by workers with less than a high school diploma \n     declined from 40 percent to only 15 percent. Over the same \n     period, inflation-adjusted incomes of families headed by high \n     school graduates without any postsecondary education fell \n     fully 30 percent. Only half of the high school graduates \n     under age 20 and not in college are employed fulltime and \n     worse yet, about one-third of young people fail to find \n     stable employment by the time they reach age 30. (Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics and Paul Osterman of MIT.) (For a larger \n     discussion of these points, see Richard Mendel, The American \n     School-to-Career Movement: A Background Paper for \n     Policymakers and Foundation Officers, American Youth Policy \n     Forum, 1994.)\n       Against this dire and worsening background we know that \n     many well-paying careers do not require a baccalaureate \n     degree. We also know from research (e.g., the SCANS reports, \n     1991 and 1992, and the National Assessment of Vocational \n     Education, 1994) that certain things do pay off in the labor \n     market: (1) cognitive skills, (2) broad technical skills \n     (especially computer literacy and its applications), (3) \n     postsecondary education and, (4) human relations and \n     workplace skills, like getting along with colleagues and \n     supervisors, working well in teams and demonstrating \n     reliability, responsibility and initiative.\n\n\n                    Basic Premises of School-to-Work\n\n       Building on this knowledge base, STWOA offers no precise \n     blueprint, no road map or rule book. Rather, the new Act is \n     one of the least prescriptive laws on the statue books. It \n     acts like a compass, pointing to a set of concepts or basic \n     premises. These premises are based on recent research about \n     how people learn best and what employers say young people \n     need in order to cope with a fast-changing world.\n       First, STW is a new way of looking at the development of \n     young people and particularly at their needs in the critical \n     adolescent transition years from high school into further \n     education and the world of work. STW asserts that youth need \n     active, not passive learning--in schools, in worksites, in \n     voluntary service. Therefore, STW views the entire community \n     as one great learning laboratory where young people grow, \n     develop and find networks of support.\n       Second, STW is a systematic effort to change the time-based \n     assumptions on which most high schools are currently based. \n     STW says that young people are expected to exhibit or \n     demonstrate mastery of rigorous academic and behavioral \n     skills, not be judged by how many years they have sat in \n     classrooms or how many written tests they have passed by rote \n     memorization. Actual demonstrations of competence will be the \n     touchstone of STW.\n       Third, STW builds on extensive research that says that one \n     of the most critical ingredients in young people's success is \n     their close attachment to a caring and successful adult, a \n     mentor, a role model, a coach, a youth advocate who \n     supplements what teachers, neighbors and family members \n     provide, particularly when traditional supports are lacking.\n       When a Congressional committee asked Cornell University's \n     Urie Bronfenbrenner to summarize everything he had learned in \n     a long and\n      distinguished career in human development research, \n     Bronfenbrenner replied: ``Some adult has got to be crazy \n     about the kid, and truly be there for that kid, and let \n     that kid know that his life is important and has \n     meaning.''\n       Fourth, STW also builds on powerful recent research finding \n     that most students learn best in context, when they see how \n     knowledge is actually used outside the school, especially in \n     a work setting. Therefore, STW views the employers' workplace \n     as a learning laboratory where young people can experience \n     the relevance of knowledge in the ``real world.'' Young \n     people like to work. They blossom in the workplace if they \n     are treated as respected members of a team that is expected \n     to perform responsibly and productively. Generations of \n     inquiry concerning European adolescents undergird these \n     truths. Young people in Europe report pride in their \n     workplace roles. They look forward to the company and the \n     counsel of their adult supervisors and coworkers. And, to a \n     considerable extent, they avoid the epidemic of pathologies \n     which beset so many American youth.\n       Fifth, because STW is outcome- or performance-centered, \n     young people in their dual roles as learners and as workers \n     can demonstrate their proficiency at the highest standards. \n     That accomplishment is then certified by a credential that is \n     recognized and \n      [[Page S5544]] honored by schools, by employers, by parents \n     and by institutions of higher education.\n       These, then, are five basic premises on which many of the \n     new STW initiatives around the United States are based. To be \n     sure, few existing STW efforts will articulate all of these \n     premises clearly. Nor will these initiatives give equal \n     weight to each of these premises. Let me assert my firm \n     belief, however, that the most successful and the most \n     enduring STW efforts will be those that incorporate all five \n     of these premises. There simply are no short cuts to \n     excellence.\n       Now let us see if we can put these premises together in a \n     comprehensive vision of a high school learning community \n     based on them. I am indebted by my friend in the U.S. \n     Department of Education, Deputy Assistant Secretary Patricia \n     McNeil, for suggesting how a vision of STW in the context of \n     ``systemic school reform'' might be portrayed.\n\n\n                   Anytown High: An Attainable Dream\n\n       Close your eyes for a few moments. Imagine that you are an \n     entering freshman at Anytown High School. It is the first day \n     of school. You are seated in the school auditorium with your \n     new classmates. I am the principal, giving you a preview of \n     what kind of school this is, and the kinds of experiences and \n     opportunities available to you.\n       ``Welcome to Anytown High School! All the adults on the \n     stage with me this morning and around the room--teachers, \n     office staff, counselors, food service and building staff, \n     coaches, community leaders, local employers, labor union \n     representatives, members of our town's workforce development \n     system, alternative schools, city government, parents and \n     volunteers--we all welcome you.\n       Not long ago, I told similar freshmen classes that half of \n     you might not be here to complete your senior year. Today, I \n     want to give you quite a different message. All of us here \n     today pledge that we are here to help each of you get the \n     high level skills and knowledge you will need to become \n     successful citizens, productive workers and lifelong \n     learners. When\n      you complete your experience here or when you finish your \n     secondary schooling at a job training program or community \n     college or alternative school, you will have all you need \n     to enter and complete a two- or four-year college degree \n     program, a registered apprenticeship program, the \n     military, or an entry-level career ladder job. All the \n     adults in this school an din this community are pledged to \n     work together to help you succeed. That is because we \n     accept the wisdom of that old African adage: `It takes a \n     entire village to raise a child.\n       Everything we do here at Anytown High school is based on \n     three simple and important ideas:\n       One, what we expect you to learn here is important in the \n     world outside these walls, important to your future as \n     citizens, neighbors, parents and workers.\n       Two, we on the teaching staff and in school administration \n     know that you can learn. Every single one of you has the \n     ability to master the subject matter in our curriculum. This \n     school is constructed in such a way that it respects your \n     different learning styles. Some of you will need more time \n     and extra help and, here at Anytown High, you will get it. \n     Every one of you can graduate knowing, and being able to do, \n     the things that assure success in the world of work and in \n     life generally.\n       Three, we won't let you fail. When I say `we', I mean the \n     entire community which is mobilized to ensure your success. \n     Together, we will support you and provide many kinds of \n     opportunities for learning, for earning and for fun.\n       Because we in Rhode Island have restructured our entire K-\n     12 school system, most of you have been hearing this message \n     in one way or another from pre-school, through primary and \n     middle school, but it bears repeating today:\n       You are intelligent and capable individuals. No one is born \n     with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in this \n     world. You get smart through effort. Our job as adults is to \n     help you develop your skills and knowledge to a high level. \n     You'll be asked to work hard, and we'll be working equally \n     hard alongside you on your behalf.\n       We have a wide range of opportunities for you at Anytown \n     High. In elementary and middle school you participated in a \n     variety of learning experiences; you learned about possible \n     careers; you planned projects and worked in teams to complete \n     them. You will do more of that active learning in new and \n     different ways. We have a broad range of learning options--\n     all designed to give you the skills and knowledge you need to \n     go on to college and into the workplace. Some of you may \n     choose to do most of your learning in a classroom setting; \n     others may choose more interactive work-based learning \n     options. You will work in small academic and career clusters \n     with a team of teachers who, in some cases, will remain with \n     you during your entire time in our school, All of you will \n     engage in hands-on learning where academic and occupational \n     subjects are integrated. All of you will participate in \n     community and public service learning experiences where you \n     will practice the skills and behaviors which employers highly \n     value. We also have a wide range of courses and information \n     available for independent study via computer and satellite \n     hook-up, opening the entire world to your curiosity.\n       As you begin to think about choosing a career major, you \n     will learn about many aspects of particular industries, and \n     you will see how knowledge and skills are actually used in \n     those industries and occupations. In these choices, you will \n     be supported by our guidance counselors and by job \n     specialists who will open doors to future employers and show \n     you what you need to be able to do in real workplaces.\n       Of course, you can change your career clusters in this \n     school. Since you'll all be learning the same core of \n     essential skills and knowledge, you won't be locked into one \n     cluster or one narrow job, either here or after you graduate.\n       An essential part of your experience in this school is the \n     worksite placements which we offer in your junior and senior \n     years and which in some cases, like Tech Prep, will continue \n     beyond high school. Some of you will choose co-op education \n     and internships with local employers for part of the school \n     year. Some of you, as part of your Tech Prep or youth \n     apprenticeship experience, will be working part-time in \n     industries based on the technologies you will be studying in \n     school. Some of you will be paid for your part-time work with \n     employers after school and in the summers. Some of you will \n     find your work opportunities in hospitals, libraries and \n     other non-profit community services.\n       Others of you will choose to enroll in our Career \n     Academies, the small mini-schools on this campus which \n     specialize in careers with good prospects for future \n     professional employment. For example, we have a Financial \n     Services Academy where you can learn about banking, \n     insurance, real estate, investments and tourism. We have an \n     Environmental and Maritime Academy where you can learn about \n     everything connected with earning a living from the sea and \n     how to protect that fragile resource. We have a Health and \n     Bioscience Acadmeny based on modern health care, hospital and \n     laboratory management and exciting new careers in \n     biotechnology. And we have other academies as well. \n     Regardless of which one you choose, you will receive high \n     quality instruction and be able to form close associations \n     with your fellow students and with employers in your career \n     field.\n       Regardless of the kind of worksite placement you have \n     chosen, you will graduate well prepared to continue your \n     studies in higher education or to win an entry-level position \n     with an employer. Above all, you will have experienced the \n     joy of learning and you will excel, no matter how radically \n     the world may change in the future.\n       Even though your elementary and middle school experience \n     was set up so that you would not fall behind, every year \n     presents different challenges. If you are having trouble \n     keeping up or understanding something, we have extra help \n     available in many forms--after-school, on weekends and in the \n     summer. Team sports, clubs, community service and one-on-one \n     help are after-school options from which you can choose.\n       You will wonder how your teachers are so sharp, how they \n     keep up with rapidly changing knowledge. Well, first of all, \n     your teachers see themselves as lifelong learners, constantly \n     striving to know more\n      and to discover more effective ways to help you learn. This \n     school offers many opportunities for professional \n     development on and off this campus. Most important, we \n     build in ample time for your teachers to meet together, to \n     plan your studies, to learn from each other, from your \n     worksite mentors, and from experts around the country, in \n     person and through interactive television, video and \n     satellite sessions.\n       During the summer and at various times in the school year, \n     some of your teachers and counselors will be working \n     alongside you in the plants and offices of our employer \n     partners. They will be learning about the latest changes in \n     technology and management so that your curricula can be kept \n     relevant and so that they understand what you are learning in \n     the worksite. (Incidentally, your teachers will \n     simultaneously be helping to upgrade the basic academic \n     skills of the adult workers you will be working with in your \n     worksite placements.)\n       If you change schools, the skills and knowledge you have \n     demonstrated here will be transferable electronically to your \n     new school. You will also have your portfolio of work and \n     skills/knowledge inventory to take with you. If you want to \n     find another learning experience, we will help you. We work \n     closely with a wide range of alternative schools, with \n     community colleges, with the Job Corps, with youth service \n     and conservation corps, with the new National Civilian \n     Community Corps and others. We also work closely with the \n     local workforce development system which operates career \n     advancement centers where you can get referrals to further \n     training or qualify for a grant or loan package to help you \n     complete secondary school training on your own\n       Whenever and wherever you complete your secondary \n     experience, you will receive a high school diploma signifying \n     mastery of a high level of skills and knowledge. That diploma \n     will be accepted by two- and four-year colleges, by \n     employers, by the military and the registered apprenticeship \n     system. Depending on your course of study, you may also \n     receive a certificate of mastery in some advanced level \n     academic or occupational skills. Some of you may take advance \n     placement or other studies in this school that will qualify \n     you to receive college credits. Some of you may graduate in \n     less than four years because you have demonstrated mastery of \n     our core curriculum.\n       While we will do everything to support your learning, there \n     may be personal and family problems that come up in your life \n     so \n      [[Page S5545]] that you need some outside help. As a member \n     of the Anytown Partnership for Families, Anytown High's Human \n     Services Mall hosts a broad array of community agencies that \n     will assist you and your families with non-academic problems. \n     Many of these social services were available to you \n     throughout primary and middle school, so you are familiar \n     with them. You can get information about other services from \n     the computer files in your academic cluster, in the library \n     or the cafeteria. Each of you will also have opportunities to \n     have an adult mentor or coach. It may be an employee at your \n     worksite, a community service volunteer or a parent in the \n     community. Here at Anytown High, we have almost as many \n     community partners as students. Each brings their expertise \n     and their caring into the school and the worksite.\n       Your teachers have worked hard to design the curriculum--in \n     school, at the worksite and in your community service \n     experiences--to support your learning in every way we know. \n     Your guidance counselors and job specialists are working with \n     your teachers and employers in the community to make sure you \n     have access to information about postsecondary schools and \n     careers and that you can use it effectively to plan your \n     further education and careers.\n       The basic message I want to leave with you today is this: \n     you are capable and intelligent young people in transition to \n     adulthood and each adult here is on your side. We are \n     committed to helping you get the skills and knowledge you \n     need to be successful learners, workers and citizens. You can \n     do it; we are here to help; and you can count on us. Welcome \n     to Anytown High!''\n       Our opening day assembly is now over. Those of you who \n     haven't been put to sleep by the principal's long oration may \n     open you eyes * * *\n       It's true, of course, that most of the students in the \n     auditorium probably did not absorb the full promise of what \n     awaits them at Anytown High. Yet, I think few of them will \n     fail to grasp the central message: That they are important \n     and that they are going to be successful in life.\n       All of the adults in the community, too, should now clearly \n     understand that this description of a radically different \n     kind of learning community requires their fullest \n     participation. Education at Anytown High is a serious full-\n     time partnership of the entire community. Its objective is \n     simple and straightforward: success in work, success in life \n     for each and every young person who enters our schools.\n       Undoubtedly, some of you are thinking: ``What a nice, \n     Utopian dream. Halperin is just a dreamer.'' Yes, I do have a \n     dream! However, there is not one element in my dream that is \n     not a living reality someplace in this country. Everything in \n     this dream is being practiced somewhere * * * now, today. All \n     that Patricia McNeil and I have done is put it all together \n     to meet our personal vision. I hope you will do the same with \n     your own ideas about education, youth development and the \n     world of work.\n       So, I end where I began. The challenge before the people of \n     Rhode Island is to dream your own dream for the State and for \n     your own communities. Rethink the essential nature of \n     schooling at the dawn of the 21st Century. Construct a total \n     quality system in which all the parts of your dream come \n     together to produce success for all of Rhode Island's young \n     people.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5542-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5545-S5546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            SISTER CAROL McGOVERN--LET'S CELEBRATE HER LIFE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join in celebrating \nthe life of Sister Carol McGovern, RSM. Often we find that life gains \nmeaning through our service to others, and our greatest personal \nambition seems empty and illusory compared to such service.\n  Sister Carol McGovern, who died Wednesday of breast cancer, was \nexecutive director of Amos House, a soup kitchen and social service \ncenter in the poorest neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island's \ncapital city. To this position she brought tremendous energy and great \nvision. Her vision arose from spiritual commitment and was informed by \nan extraordinarily active life.\n  Sister Carol was involved: She served on many boards of directors, \nworking with Sunrise House, the Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center, the \nCampaign To Eliminate Childhood Poverty, and the Rhode Island Right to \nHousing Now.\n  When one first meets a person such as Sister Carol, an initial \nelation often gives way to the question: Where will the energy come \nfrom to sustain such commitment?\n  The problems of humanity, even at a local level, seem so vast, \ncomplex, and intractable that they would quickly consume one entirely. \nYet, year after year, on issue after issue, Sister Carol was there.\n  Her energy never diminished, but grew deeper. Service that one would \nhave thought to be all consuming, revealed itself to be vitalizing. In \nthe end, she was a force. The name Sister Carol McGovern resounds with \nmeaning unattainable by pursuit of individual interest.\n  In 1959, she joined the Sisters of Mercy, in 1967 she took her final \nvows. She earned her bachelor's degree from Salve Regina College and \nher master's degree from St. Michael's College.\n  She was given awards for her work, the John Kiffney Award from the \nProvidence Newspaper Guild, an honorary doctorate from Rhode Island \nCollege, to name two. For anyone this would be a record of outstanding \naccomplishment and well deserved recognition, but this record never \ndefined her.\n  Her essence was her commitment to service, her real presence was to \nbe found among those most in need. Her life was claimed by an illness \nthat afflicts many women, she faced it bravely, and again she set a \nfine example.\n  My office and I were deeply fortunate to be able to work with her \nover the years. Many times she enlightened us and gave us courage to \naddress difficult issues squarely.\n  She didn't ask for answers, only effort. We shall miss her greatly. I \nam truly saddened by her passing. Yet it is her life of service that I \nask this body to celebrate and commemorate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nProvidence Journal of April 6, 1995, entitled ``Sister Carol McGovern, \n53, Champion of the Poor, Dies,'' be inserted into the Congressional \nRecord as if read.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Sister Carol McGovern, 53, Champion of the Poor, Dies\n\n            (By S.

Morgan)\n\n       Pawtucket.--Sister Carol McGovern, RSM, executive director \n     of Amos House in Providence and one of Rhode Island's best \n     known advocates for the poor, died yesterday at her home on \n     Blodgett Avenue.\n       Sister Carol, 53, has been ill with breast cancer for the \n     past year and a half. The disease had seemed to be in \n     remission, but then spread to her liver.\n       Experimental treatment allowed her to resume an active \n     outdoor life and to continue her 12-hour work days until her \n     health failed less than a month ago.\n       Henry Shelton, another longtime activist, said, ``Carol \n     lived her life to the fullest with a smile that signaled joy \n     and love, and faced death with more courage than anyone I \n     ever knew.\n       ``My prayer is that her life and death will inspire in \n     Rhode Island's religious and political leaders a commitment \n     similar to hers to support the effort of Rhode Island's \n     powerless to help each other out of poverty.''\n       ``What does one say about so remarkable a woman?'' said \n     Richard J. Walton, former president of the board of Amos \n     House, a soup kitchen and social service center in South \n     Providence.\n       ``She was a woman who cared very deeply and worked with \n     passion, I guess you could say, and with humor. And I've \n     never seen anyone bear up under what she's borne up under \n     these last few months. She seemed to be more concerned about \n     making people feel okay about her illness. She kept such a \n     brave front that unless you knew she was sick, you couldn't \n     know.''\n       Born in Providence, she was a daughter of Eleanor V. \n     (Peterson) of Cranston and the late James V. McGovern.\n       Sister Carol arrived at Amos House along a curious path.\n       She spent her early years teaching but in the 1970s she \n     joined four other Sisters of Mercy knocking on doors in \n     Woonsocket and meeting struggling residents.\n       The nuns taught residents, particularly women alone with \n     young children, about available resources, and in a few years \n     turned their jobs over to neighborhood people they had \n     trained.\n       So by 1983, Sister Carol was out of a job and decided to \n     take some time to refocus. She got a job as manager of the \n     Yarney, one of the stores in the then-new Davol Square \n     shopping center in Providence.\n       Using skills from her early years, she taught customers how \n     to knit, and often chatted with Sister Eileen Murphy the Amos \n     House founder who regularly strolled through Davol Square.\n       After Sister Eileen died unexpectedly in December 1983, \n     Sister Carol decided to apply as part of a team at Amos \n     House. Eventually she became co-director with Jim Tull. (Tull \n     stepped down earlier this year.)\n       Despite her illness, Sister Carol continued her Amos House \n     work and was showered with love and concern by those who used \n     its services.\n       ``I have a real passion for the people who come here,'' she \n     said. ``They are my family, they truly are my family.''\n       Despite setbacks inherent in fighting for the needy, Sister \n     Carol said, she drew sustenance from the example of her \n     widowed \n      [[Page S5546]] mother and the words of anthropologist \n     Margaret Mead, who said that small groups of truly committed \n     people are the only things that have ever changed the world.\n       She entered the Sisters of Mercy in September 1959 and took \n     her final vows in August 1967.\n       She received a bachelor's degree from Salva Regina College \n     in 1964, and a master's in 1974 from St. Michael's College in \n     Vermont.\n       Sister Carol was a founder of the Rhode Island Coalition \n     for the Homeless, and was president of its board. She was a \n     member of the board of directors of Sunrise House, a member \n     of the board and a counselor-advocate of the Rhode Island \n     Rape Crisis Center, a member of the Campaign to Eliminate \n     Childhood Poverty and the Rhode Island Right to Housing NOW.\n       She was a lobbyist for the Sisters of Mercy for the last \n     four years, dealing with peace, justice and women's issues.\n       In February Sister Carol and Tull received the John Kiffney \n     Award of the Providence Newspaper Guild.\n       She also received the Bronze Key Award fro Substance Abuse. \n     She was to receive an honorary doctorate in May from Rhode \n     Island College.\n       Surviving besides her mother are two brothers, Robert F. \n     McGovern of Cranston and James V. McGovern of Oxford, Mass., \n     and a sister, Marcia E. O'Connor of Providence.\n       A concelebrated Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated \n     Saturday at 10 a.m. in St. Michael Church, Oxford, Street, \n     Providence. Burial will be in Resurrection Cemetery, \n     Cumberland.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5545-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5546-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5546-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed \nthe following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 483.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to authorize \nthe award of fees and expenses to prevailing parties in frivolous civil \nlitigation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    frivolous lawsuit prevention act\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Frivolous \nLawsuit Prevention Act of 1995. This legislation will increase \nsanctions on lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits.\n  Almost daily we hear stories about some individual or business \nsettling a lawsuit which has little merit just to avoid the costs \nassociated with a drawn out case. The manhours and resources that can \nbe drained from a business while it goes through such a process can be \ndevastating.\n  Many of us had hoped that the rules governing the conduct of court \nbehavior would deter frivolous lawsuits. Rule 11 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure authorize judges to impose ``an appropriate \nsanction'' upon an attorney which is ``interposed for any improper \npurpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless \nincrease in the cost of litigation.'' Unfortunately, rule 11 has not \nlived up to our expectations in curbing abusive lawsuits and, in fact, \nhas been recently watered down.\n  This legislation is intended to force judges to punish lawyers or \nlitigants who file or pursue cases which the judge regards as \nfrivolous. Judges would be required to impose sanctions when they find \nfrivolous suits, thereby, taking away their discretion. This step needs \nto be taken because judges have been reluctant to impose sanctions on \nfellow attorneys. It has always been difficult to get any group to \ndiscipline their colleagues, where it is doctors, lawyers or realtors. \nThat is why we must force judges to impose sanctions when frivolous \ncase are filed.\n  Frivolous lawsuits are a terrible drain on the competitiveness of our \nNation. We must provide those who want to fight these frivolous suits \nrather than settle them the power to go after the perpetrators. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD.\n  S. 713. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide that the preemption provisions shall not apply to \ncertain State of Oregon laws applicable to health plans; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              universal access and the oregon health plan\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, during the 1989 and 1991 \nlegislative sessions, Oregon's Legislature passed a comprehensive \nhealth care reform proposal known as the Oregon Health Plan. The Oregon \nHealth Plan consists of four major reform packages. First, the Medicaid \nexpansion which received a Federal waiver and has provided an \nadditional 100,000 Oregonians with basic health care since it was \nimplemented in February 1994. Second, the high-risk insurance pool \nwhich covers Oregonians who are unable to obtain insurance coverage due \nto preexisting conditions or the exhaustion of their current benefits. \nThird, the small employer basic health plan which provides for a low-\ncost insurance plan for small businesses of 25 or fewer employees. And \nfinally, the employer mandate which by 1998 will require all employers \nin Oregon to provide health benefits for their employees or to pay into \na State pool which will then purchase insurance for uninsured \nemployees. When fully implemented the Oregon Health Plan will provide \nnear universal access to health care for all Oregonians.\n  As my colleagues know, I have spoken many times on this floor about \nthe need to allow States to proceed with innovative health care reform \nproposals. That is why I have joined with the Senator from Florida [Mr. \nGraham] in introducing the Health Partnership Act of 1995. The \nCongress' failure to act on comprehensive national health care reform \nshould not prevent innovative States like Oregon, Florida, Washington, \nMinnesota, and others from enacting their own health care reform \nproposals.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has stymied these efforts in \nseveral ways. It took Oregon two administrations and almost 3 years to \nget the approval necessary to move forward with the Oregon Medicaid \nexpansion. The current waiver process at the Health Care Financing \nAdministration is burdensome and at times overregulatory.\n  Another major roadblock to State reform is the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act, otherwise known as ERISA. Due to the broad \ninterpretation courts have given to the so-called ERISA preemption \nclause contained in section 514(a) of the act, which states that ERISA \n``shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or \nhereafter relate to any employee \n [[Page S5548]] benefit plan'', States have been limited in enacting \ncomprehensive reforms that attempt to provide universal access to all \ntheir State's citizens and to control costs throughout the entire \ninsurance market.\n  Mr. President, once again I find myself before this body asking for \nanother waiver of Federal law to permit Oregon to go forward with \nreform that has been advanced by my State. This time it is to allow \nOregon to implement the last part of the Oregon Health Plan--the \nemployer mandate.\n  Oregon's employer mandate is a pay-or-play mandate--in other words, \nthe State will tax employers who choose not to provide health benefits \nwhich will be defined by the State for their employees, and then \nprovide health insurance to those uninsured employees through a State \ninsurance pool. While the U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled that this \nkind of access mechanism violates the ERISA preemption clause, it is \ncertainly subject to an ERISA challenge based on the premise that \nOregon is trying to regulate self-insured plans in a way that relates \nto employee benefit plans.\n  Under the current ERISA statute, only Congress may statutorily grant \nERISA waivers to States. At this time, only one State, Hawaii, has an \nERISA exemption and that is only because Hawaii enacted its law before \nERISA was enacted. Hawaii's waiver has not been updated since it was \ngranted 20 years ago.\n  While Senator Graham and I have proposed a mechanism for broad ERISA \nchanges in our health care reform bill which will begin to address the \nERISA roadblocks States face, I feel it is necessary to introduce \nlegislation which provides for a specific waiver of ERISA for the State \nof Oregon. I introduce it as a separate vehicle to underscore the point \nthat one way or another, Oregon needs a green light from the Federal \nGovernment in order to fully implement the Oregon Health Plan.\n  Of course, I understand the concern multi-State employers have about \nthe prospect of administering fifty different health plans across the \nNation. This is a valid concern which I hope we can accommodate as we \ncontinue to debate the issue of ERISA reform further.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I hope my colleagues will make note of \nthis problem. Oregon is not the only State that is attempting to enact \ncomprehensive health care reform and if the Supreme Court continues its \nbroad application of ERISA, it is likely that the voices of other \nStates will soon be heard. Comprehensive national reform may be dead \nfor now, but let us not give up on the States to help us find the right \nanswers and make health care available to all Americans.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 714. A bill to require the Attorney General to study and report to \nCongress on means of controlling the flow of violent, sexually \nexplicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted material in \ninteractive telecommunications systems; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\nCHILD PROTECTION, USER EMPOWERMENT, AND FREE EXPRESSION IN INTERACTIVE \n                            MEDIA STUDY ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I introduce a bill calling for a \nstudy by the Department of Justice, in consultation with the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce on how we can empower parents and users of \ninteractive telecommunications systems, such as the Internet, to \ncontrol the material transmitted to them over those systems. We must \nfind ways to do this that do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to \ncensorship of private online communications, and undercut important \nconstitutional protections.\n  Before legislating to impose Government regulation on the content of \ncommunications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more \ninformation from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My \nbill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.\n  There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in \ntelecommunications with cheaper, easier to use, and faster ways to \ncommunicate electronically with people within our own homes and \ncommunities, and around the globe.\n  A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our \nchildren takes on a new dimension of responsibility. Very young \nchildren are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in \nfront of a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the \noutside world through the Internet or some other on-line service. Many \nof us are, thus, justifiably concerned about the accessibility of \nobscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to \nmonitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed. \nBut Government regulation of the content of all computer and telephone \ncommunications, even private communications, in violation of the first \namendment is not the answer--it is merely a knee-jerk response.\n  Heavy-handed efforts by the Government to regulate obscenity on \ninteractive information services will only stifle the free flow of \ninformation, discourage the robust development of new information \nservices, and make users avoid using the system.\n  The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many \nimportant issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal \ncopying. We need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents \nprotect their children. Penalties imposed after the harm is done is not \nenough. We need to find technical means from stopping the harm before \nit happens.\n  My bill calls for a study to address the legal and technical issues \nfor empowering users to control the information they receive over \nelectronic interactive services. Instead of rushing to regulate the \ncontent of information services, we should encourage the development of \ntechnology that gives parents and other consumers the ability to \ncontrol the information that can be accessed over a modem.\n  Empowering parents to manage what their kids access over the Internet \nwith technology under their control is far preferable to some of the \nbills pending in Congress that would criminalize users or deputize \ninformation services providers as smut police.\n  Let's see what this study reveals before we start legislating in ways \nthat could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep \naway important constitutional rights, and undercut law enforcement at \nthe same time.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for portability of health insurance, \nguaranteed renewability, high risk pools, medical care savings \naccounts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      health insurance portability and guaranteed renewability act\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Guaranteed Renewability Act of 1995. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators Inhofe and Hatch an introducing \nthis important legislation.\n  President Clinton, in his 1993 joint session address, said that \n``Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their \nhealth insurance, and one serious illness away from losing all their \nsavings.''\n  While the President's statement was right, his prescription for \nreform--as the American people told us in no uncertain terms--was dead \nwrong. We must find a way to give Americans greater health security \nwithout turning the whole system over to the Federal Government, as the \nPresident had proposed. We must address the public's insecurities \nregarding their health insurance while preserving what works in the \nAmerican health care system and allowing the free market to work.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Health Insurance Portability \nand Guaranteed Renewability Act of 1995. This is a bill which I am \nconfident will go a long way toward accomplishing these goals.\n  First, our bill would eliminate job lock by guaranteeing that people \nwho change jobs will be covered by their new employer's plan without \nregard to preexisting medical conditions.\n  It will expand COBRA to provide for continuation of coverage for all \nindividuals employed by firms of two or more employees, and extends \nCOBRA coverage from 18 to 36 months. Therefore, employees losing their \njobs will have the opportunity to continue their health coverage for an \nadditional 18 months under their current plan. Present COBRA law \nbenefits only those employers with more than 20 employees.\n  It will help control health costs by changing the tax law to allow \ntax-free medical savings accounts. Empirical evidence demonstrates that \nmedical saving accounts can control costs and promote wellness without \njeopardizing quality of care. Money saved in such accounts by employees \ncan be used to pay COBRA premiums, if needed.\n  It will provide a safety net for people who cannot qualify for health \ninsurance by giving them access to health insurance through high-risk \npools.\n  Finally, it will prevent insurance companies from singling out any \nindividual or small group for rate increases or cancellation based on \nclaims experience.\n  I believe this bill goes a long way toward giving the American people \nwhat they want--greater health security without a Big Government \ntakeover of our Nation's health care system. The fact that it can be \nimplemented without new taxes, and without adding to the deficit, is \nfurther reason that the Health Insurance Portability and Guaranteed \nRenewability Act of 1995 should be enacted without delay.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 716. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide for \ncriminal penalties for acts involving Medicare or State health care \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     health reform enhancement act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to clarify \nthat States which already use, or which seek to utilize, Medicaid \ndollars to pay private health insurance premiums would be allowed to do \nso.\n  Unfortunately, a recent interpretation of the anti-kickback statute \nby the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human \nServices has placed at risk innovative Government programs that attempt \nto channel Medicaid and Medicare dollars through the private sector \nthrough mechanisms such as the purchase of health insurance policies or \nthe payment for managed care. That interpretation, which could apply \nthe anti-kickback statute to insurance agent commissions, came as part \nof Florida's waiver request for a Medicaid demonstration project. Such \nan interpretation ignores the fact that insurance agents are an \nintegral part of any system relying in whole or in part on private \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  In the State's submission of its Florida Health Security [FHS] waiver \non February 9, 1994, the proposal would--if enacted--provide 1.1 \nmillion additional Floridians with insurance coverage up to 250 percent \nof the poverty level. FHS participants would buy a standard benefit \npackage offered through a community health purchasing alliance and \nreceive, according to their income, a premium discount to make the \npackage affordable.\n  Florida's proposal is innovative but in many ways simple. As the \nState has explained in its proposal,\n\n       Through the managed competition system developed in Florida \n     and improved program management, the [State] expects to \n     reduce the cost of health care, thereby increasing the funds \n     available for subsidizing insurance for Florida's uninsured. \n     The net result of this arrangement will be lower health care \n     costs overall in the State and greater access to health care \n     for a significant portion of Florida's currently uninsured \n     residents.\n\n  Through the community health purchasing alliances established by the \nState, private sector small businesses are already seeing reductions in \ntheir health premiums of between 10 to 50 percent across the State. The \nState would like to see its Medicaid Program and other small businesses \nachieve similar results.\n  On September 14, 1994, after 7 months of negotiations with the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, \nthe Federal Government granted a conditional waiver approval to allow \nFlorida to implement the State's proposed reforms. By granting this \nimportant request, Florida would be allowed to use Medicaid funds to \nprovide insurance premium discounts to working, uninsured Floridians \ntraditionally ineligible for Medicaid.\n  As a result, despite the Federal Government's failure to move toward \nthe goals of health reform such as increased access, cost containment \nand quality, Florida could do so through Florida health security.\n  First and foremost, let me reemphasize that this waiver program would \nallow an additional 1.1 million Floridians obtain health insurance \ncoverage--thereby reducing the State's uninsured rate by over 40 \npercent. Moreover, of the 2.7 million Floridians presently without \nhealth insurance, 1 million are children. With the plan's requirement \nthat 80 percent of the enrollment spaces be reserved for lower-income, \nuninsured families, children will disproportionately benefit from this \ninitiative.\n  In addition, this waiver would eliminate the all-or-none approach of \nMedicaid by creating a sliding scale of contributions for those above \nthe Medicaid poverty threshold and up to 250 percent of poverty. At \npresent, Medicaid's all-or-none approach creates the perverse incentive \nof encouraging people to remain unemployed and in poverty in order to \ncontinue to have health care coverage. Florida's approach would clearly \nhelp get people off welfare and be a much fairer system than what we \nhave now.\n  The waiver also allows Florida and the Federal Government better \ncontrol over the costs of the Medicaid Program. Since 1982, Florida's \nMedicaid Program has increased from $1 billion to $7 billion. From 1990 \nthrough 1993, Florida saw its Medicaid budget expand by 30, 26, and 19 \npercent, respectively. Instead, over the 5-year period of Florida's \nwaiver program, costs would be controlled and managed through the \nincreased use of case management and managed care in the private \nsector. Through these savings, the State and the Federal Government \nwill be able to provide coverage to over 1 million previously uninsured \nFloridians without spending additional revenue.\n  In short, Florida's Health Security Program would expand access and \nhealth coverage without raising taxes, control costs and break the \ncategorical link between health care and welfare.\n  To implement this program, Florida Health Security will utilize the \nalready successfully established community health purchasing alliances, \nwhich have reduced premiums for participating small businesses by 10 to \n50 percent \n [[Page S5550]] this year. As a result of this, private health plans \nand insurance agents will be integrally involved in the Florida Health \nSecurity Program.\n  In fact, under Florida Health Security, accountable health \npartnerships would submit bids on premium rates for the standard \nbenefit plan, with a portion of the premium to be paid by Medicaid. \nInsurance agents would be directly involved in the process due to the \nfact that they are an integral part of this process. The alternative \nwould be to employ a statewide force of State workers to provide such \nenrollment services, which would be wasteful and inefficient in \ncomparison such agents are already trained and available in all areas \nacross the State.\n  Unfortunately, HHS and the Department of Justice have expressed \nconcern that payments to insurance agents by accountable health plans \nmight violate the Social Security anti-kickback statute. Clearly, the \n1977 anti-kickback statute was not intended or even contemplated to \napply to programs like Florida's demonstration project.\n  In fact, there are already numerous and widespread examples of \nMedicare and Medicaid funds being used for the payment, directly or \nindirectly, to insurance agents. These include Medicaid revisions in \nthe Family Support Act of 1988, which creates a Medicaid wrap-around \noption allowing States to use Medicaid funds to pay a family's expenses \nfor premiums, deductibles and coinsurance for any health care coverage \noffered by the employer.\n  As the State argued while pursuing the waiver, since insurance \ncompanies use insurance agents, the purchase of insurance and the \npayment of premiums of necessity results in the payment of a commission \nto an insurance agent. This is also true when Medicaid funds health \nmaintenance organizations [HMO's], the Medicare Risk Program and \nvarious State plans relating to areas such as the enrollment of \nMedicaid eligibles in group health plans.\n  Through the section 1115 Medicaid demonstration project waiver \nprocess, Florida is attempting, for the first time, to use Medicaid \nfunds to purchase private health insurance on a wide scale. However, by \nmistakenly applying the anti-kickback statute beyond its intended scope \nto insurance agent commissions, the Departments of Justice and Health \nand Human Services would effectively and radically alter the \ndemonstration. As noted before, insurance agents are an integral part \nof the existing health insurance system and our critical to the \nimplementation of Florida's Health Security Program.\n  As a result, this legislation focuses narrowly on clarifying\n   that the 1977 anti-kickback statute would not unnecessarily be \napplied to Medicaid demonstration projects and Medicaid managed care \nprograms, which were initiatives that were not anticipated in the \noriginal adoption of the statute. Failure to adopt this language, with \nJustice's and HHS's present interpretation of the statute, could very \nwell jeopardize every State or Federal health plan which already uses, \nor which seeks to use, Federal moneys to fund private health insurance \ncoverage.\n\n  Through either payments to employers or directly to individuals, many \nStates have Medicaid programs that buy private insurance policies and \nthereby result in the payment of insurance agent commissions. States \nsuch as Oregon, California, Vermont, Kansas, Kentucky, South Carolina, \nMassachusetts, Missouri, Iowa, Virginia, Ohio, and New Jersey have such \narrangements and do not withhold payment for commissions or limit the \ncommissions which can be paid. These innovative Medicaid programs and \nMedicare risk contracts could all be jeopardized without language \nclarifying the intent of the anti-kickback statute.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 716\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend the period of issuance of Medicare select \npolicies for 12 months, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                        health care legislation\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce legislation with \nSenators Pryor and Rockefeller to extend the reauthorization of the \nMedicare Select Program from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 1996. Florida is \none of the 15 States originally authorized to participate in the \nprogram and more than 20,000 people in Florida were participating in \nMedicare select by the end of 1994.\n  Medicare select has created a more uniform and understandable set of \npolicies for seniors to choose from in the Medicare supplemental \nmarket. As the August 1994 article entitled ``Filling the Gaps in \nMedicare'' in Consumer Reports said.\n\n       The law has had positive effects. It eliminated the \n     bewildering variety of benefits that insurance companies had \n     been selling. It made agents wary of selling a prospect more \n     than one Medicare-supplement policy, a useless and costly \n     duplication of coverage.\n\n  The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida's select policy ranks among the \nbest values in the Nation.\n  However, the expiration date is quickly approaching for this \ndemonstration program. Florida Blue Cross Blue Shield would have \npreferred the program to have already been extended by April 1, 1995, \nso that Florida's Medicare beneficiaries and providers could have \navoided any disruption in the program. That date has passed. In fact, \nif not extended shortly, health plans and providers will have to \nprepare to close the program to new Medicare enrollees on June 30. The \nconsequences would be to significantly increase premiums for current \nMedicare select enrollees and could lead to deterioration of networks \nas providers choose to leave the expired program.\n  In S. 308, the Health Partnership Act, that I introduced with Senator \nHatfield on February 1, 1995, our legislation would have made the \nprogram permanent and expanded the program to all 50 States. I no \nlonger believe this is possible in time to prevent disruption to plans. \nAlthough the House passed a version to extend the program for 5 years \nwith an accompanying study to determine whether the program results in \nsavings to enrollees, reduces expenditures in the Medicare Program, and \nimpacts access to and quality of care, Senate review of the program \ncould not take place quickly enough to prevent disruption in the 15 \nStates.\n  Moreover, a study of the items called for by the House is already \nbeing conducted by the Health Care Financing Administration through the \nResearch Triangle Institute. Rather than commissioning yet another \nanalysis of Medicare select, wasting the money already being spent to \nstudy the program and waiting another 3 years to make potential \nimprovements in the program, it would be better to immediately move \nforward with a 1-year reauthorization of the program. In the meantime, \nCongress should consider improvements to Medicare select based upon the \nforthcoming study and other information we will receive. At that time, \nCongress should extend the program to all 50 States.\n  During the next year, there are many questions we should be asking of \nthis program. For one, what impact is this program having on Medicare? \nMoreover, there have been questions raised as to the rating methods \nused to price and sell these products. According to Consumer Reports,\n\n       [[Page S5551]] Unless state regulations outlaw attained-age \n     pricing or national health reform makes community rating \n     mandatory for Medicare-supplement policies . . . attained-age \n     pricing will take over the marketplace, with serious \n     consequences to the oldest policyholders.\n\n  This is something both Congress and the States should be reviewing.\n  As a result, Mr. President, I urge urgent and immediate consideration \nof this legislation by the Senate and ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 12-MONTH EXTENSION OF PERIOD FOR ISSUANCE OF \n                   MEDICARE SELECT POLICIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 4358(c) of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1320c-3 note) is \n     amended by striking ``3\\1/2\\-year'' and inserting ``54-\n     month''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 718. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish an Environmental Financial Advisory \nBoard and Environmental Finance Centers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                       environmental finance act\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nD'Amato, I introduce the Environmental Finance Act of 1995. This bill \nwill make permanent the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental \nFinancial Advisory Board.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, Congress has appropriated billions \nof dollars in the last 20 years for environmental improvements. While \ngreat progress has been made, much remains to be done. Over the last \nseveral years the EPA has produced significant data showing a shortfall \nbetween the need for environmental infrastructure and the resources \navailable to meet that need.\n  Environmental problems are some of the more compelling, complex, and \ncontroversial issues confronting the more than 83,000 local governments \nin the United States. Government officials are increasingly held liable \nfor violations of environmental statutes, and have to finance \nenvironmental requirements imposed from Washington. Reporting \nrequirements are increasing not only in frequency but in technical \ndifficulty.\n  With this burden now falling heavily on State and local governments, \nnew means to pay for environmental services and infrastructure must be \nfound. This is imperative if we are to maintain and build upon the \nsignificant environmental gains made thus far.\n  In 1989, the Environmental Financial Advisory Board [EFAB] was \ncreated for the reasons I have just described. Over the last 4 years, \nthe EFAB has provided advice and analysis to the EPA on how to pay for \nenvironmental protection and leverage public and private resources. The \nEFAB was initially a committee of the National Advisory Council for \nEnvironmental Technology Policy, and in 1991 it became an independent \nadvisory board consistent with the requirements of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act.\n  The EFAB has been assigned the role\n   of providing advice on environmental financing. Its objectives \ninclude the following: Reducing the cost of financing environmental \nfacilities and discouraging pollution; creating incentives to increase \nprivate investment in the provision of environmental services; removing \nor reducing constraints on private involvement in environmental \nfinancing; identifying approaches specifically targeted to small \ncommunity financing; assessing government strategies for implementing \npublic-private partnerships; and reviewing governmental principles of \naccounting and disclosure standards for their effect on environmental \nprograms.\n\n  The EFAB charter terminated on February 25, 1993. I am greatly \npleased that EPA has initiated a renewal of the EFAB charter. It is, \nindeed, the intention of this legislation to help the EPA by creating \nin statute this most worthy program.

Reilly testified before the House Appropriations Committee in 1991 \nand expressed his hope that the EFAB would eventually become for the \nfinancing field what the Science Advisory Board has become to the field \nof environmental science. I share his determination.\n  Mr. President, my legislation also will establish Environmental \nFinance Centers at universities throughout the country. This \nlegislation will establish environmental finance centers in each of the \n10 Federal regions. These permanent centers will be effective vehicles \nfor the promotion of innovative financing techniques. Currently, two \npilot environmental finance centers at the Universities of New Mexico \nand Maryland promote new financing options by providing training to \nState and local officials, distributing publications, giving technical \nassistance targeted to local needs, and hosting meetings and workshops \nfor State and local officials. These centers will work in conjunction \nwith the EFAB to help States build their capacity to protect the \nenvironment. The Environmental Finance Centers are initially to be \npartially funded through Federal grants, with the goal that they \neventually will become self-sufficient.\n  In my own State, Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship \nand Public Affairs, drawing on the talents Syracuse's Schools of \nEngineering and Law, and the State University of New York's School of \nForestry, is the EPA's Region II Environmental Finance Center. The \nMaxwell School ranks among the country's finest institutions; its \napplied research centers in public finance, metropolitan studies, and \ntechnology and information policy are ranked among the nation's top \nthree such centers. The Metropolitan Studies Program is a national \nleader in examining a broad range of issues involving regional economic \ndevelopment and public finance in the United States.\n  The Maxwell School has established a Center for Environmental Policy \nand Administration in which analysis of environmental issues, such as \nthose envisioned for the EFAB and the regional Environmental Finance \nCenters, will play a major role. In addition, the Syracuse Law School \nis establishing an environmental law center that will complement the \nFinance Center.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 718\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues who have \nexpressed their congratulations to our counterparts in the House who \nthis week completed work on the ``Contract With America.''\n  In the past few days, Mr. President, I have heard some powerful and \nstirring remarks from the other side about the nature of the ``Contract \nWith America.'' I have heard allegations that Republicans are plotting \nto break ketchup bottles over children's heads, to snatch their school \nlunches from their grasping mouths, and to send the seniors of America \ninto the streets to forage from garbage cans.\n  Of course, this is an attempt to cast a judgment on the substance of \nthe legislation that was brought forth under the contract. I would \ninstead prefer to focus my remarks on what I consider to be the real \npoint of the contract, which was a commitment by newly elected leaders \nto--hold on to your hats--to keep their campaign promises.\n  Small wonder that this effort has produced so much discomfiture and \nfury on the other side. I remember a Presidential election in 1992, in \nwhich a Democratic Presidential candidate campaigned against the Bush \npolicy in China, against the Bush policy in Bosnia, promised massive \ntax cuts--then delivered unprecedented tax increases--and on and on and \non. And this is, to the mindset of the other side, what \n``responsibility'' is all about. You don't keep your campaign promises, \nbecause it would be ``irresponsible'' to do so.\n  My view is rather quite different. My view of responsibility is that, \nwhile campaigning, one only makes promises that one intends to keep. \nBut apparently it is a novel idea in Washington, and is described by \nphrases such as ``pandering'' and ``irresponsibility.''\n  Now also, before discussing the substance of the contract itself, let \nme also commend by House colleagues for adhering to the principle that, \nwhether or not the votes were there to pass these items, these matters \nshould be brought forth for a vote. That was the real point of the \ncontract--to bring matters up for a vote.\n  I need not tell American citizens why that is so important, but I \nwould like to refresh my colleagues' understanding of that point. The \npoint is simply that the American public has a right to know where its \nrepresentatives truly stand on these issues. That is a fundamental \nresponsibility of representative democracy.\n  This principle should be supported by all legislators, whether or not \nthey agreed with all of the substantive content of the ``contract.'' \nClearly, these were matters of importance to the American people. Many \nlegislators--on both sides of the aisle--have run for office claiming \nthat they supported such measures. They would say that they favored \nbalanced budgets, favored the line-item veto, favored term limits, \nfavored holding Congress accountable to the laws that it passed--and \nyet these measures were never passed. Those who voted for these \nlegislators had a right to know who really favored these measures and \nwho did not.\n  I think it is a measure of how truly ``out of touch'' Washington has \nbecome if the definition of ``responsibility'' has become--``refusing \nto vote on matters of importance to the American people.'' What House \nRepublicans have accomplished, essentially, is to demonstrate that they \nbelieved that Americans did have a right to know where their \nlegislators really stood, instead of Congress' engaging in the age-old \npractice of refusing to bring matters to a vote simply because it was \nfeared they would pass. That is not my idea of representative \ndemocracy--gimmicking the system to avoid having \nto cast a politically unpopular vote. And we saw a terrible lot of that \nin the House for 40 years.\n  Finally, I would like to address the rather silly charge that the \n``Contract With America'' was a special boon for rich Americans only.\n  If we run down the various items of the contract--and I do not \nsupport every single one of them--we see several measures that have \nnothing to do with being ``rich'' or ``poor.'' We simply see measures \ndesigned to give Washington some long-overdue accountability to the \npeople we represent.\n  For instance--the Congressional Accountability Act. I do not \nunderstand why it would be catering to the ``rich'' to make Congress \naccountable to the laws that it passes.\n  Nor do I understand why a halt to unfunded Federal mandates is a \nspecial benefit for ``the rich.'' It is an irrelevant, nonsensical \nargument to say that somehow it is the height of egalitarianism for \nWashington to send endless unfunded mandates on to the States.\n  The balanced budget amendment; there's another one. Simply the \nproposition that Government should live within its means. I would be \nvery curious to know what tenet of economic theory holds that it is \nnecessary for Government to go into hundreds of billions in debt every \nyear in order to treat ``rich'' and ``poor'' appropriately.\n  Even many of the attacks on the proposed tax cuts struck me as \ndisingenuous, at times even hypocritical. Many Congressmen and Senators \nwaxed eloquent about how unfair it was to give any sort of tax break to \nthe ``rich,'' but when it comes to shelling out billions in Federal \nentitlement benefits to the ``rich,'' they are strangely silent. If it \nis unjust to have any sort of tax relief affecting anyone of means, \nplease explain to me why a billionaire should get a full Social \nSecurity COLA, or to have 75 percent of his Medicare part B premium \npaid by the taxpayer. If you want to know where we have really indulged \nthe ``rich,'' it's not through the Tax Code. It's through Government \nspending.\n  So this was never about ``rich'' versus ``poor.'' It was about big \nGovernment versus small Government.\n  In the end, Mr. President, many of the attacks on the Republican \nlegislative effort are nothing more than the same shopworn, trite, \nridiculous rhetoric of class warfare that got us into this spending \nnightmare, and most assuredly will not get us out.\n  We will hear much more of it in the weeks to come.\n  When we attempt to hold the growth of Government spending to a \nreasonable level--not to cut it, but just to restrain its growth--we \nwill hear how we are ``cutting'' and ``slashing'' and so forth.\n  I just cannot believe--and I say this in all earnestness to my \nDemocratic colleagues and their pollsters--that the American people \nwill swallow that one. I remember those charges during the \n [[Page S5554]] Reagan years. Last I looked, we had a Federal budget \nof, now, $1.6 trillion. Doesn't look like a lot of ``slashing'' and \n``cutting'' to me. Does anyone seriously believe that the American \npublic will buy the notion that we are tearing spending to ribbons when \nwe have a Federal budget of $1.6 trillion? Something just doesn't add \nup there.\n  The reality is that we have programs like Head Start that are going \nup 140 percent over the course of 6 years--and the opposition comes \ndown here, still, to charge that it is being torn apart by Republican \nbudget cuts.\n  It is a mode of argument that simply will not work anymore. There is \nsimply too much clear evidence to the contrary.\n  There is still much to do to bring our Government's house into order. \nBut by any measure, the first 100 days of this Congress have been a \ndarn good start. We owe the House our rich congratulations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5553-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5554-S5556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        SHORTSIGHTED RESCISSIONS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the rescission bill approved by the \nSenate last night included a very short-sighted cut, which I strongly \nopposed. The bill we sent to conference with the House rescinds $93.5 \nmillion for the base realignment and closure account for the 1993 round \nof military facility closures, and another $10.6 million for the base \nrealignment and closure account for the 1991 round of facility \nclosures. These BRAC accounts provide the funds to close and realign \nmilitary bases including, most urgently, to clean up an environmental \ncontamination that the military services caused while they occupied \nthose facilities.\n  During consideration of the bill, I voted for the Mikulski amendment, \nwhich would have restored funds for cleanup of closing bases and funds \nfor other important national programs. Now, I strongly encourage the \nconference committee to restore these funds.\n  When we voted for base closures over the last 5 years, we also \ncommitted to complete environmental restoration and remediation at \nthose facilities quickly, in fact within a maximum of 5 years from the \ntime closure was approved. I consider that a solemn commitment from us, \nand from President Clinton to the affected communities, which spent \nyears as good neighbors to the military, providing all kinds of \nsupport. Each of those communities was serving our country with their \nsupport of local military facilities. The President and Department of \nDefense have tried to keep this commitment by requesting full funding \nfor BRAC activities. We appropriated most of what was asked for last \nyear. It would be a mistake to rescind more funding.\n  Mr. President, not only is it wrong to renege on the commitment we \nmade to cleanup swiftly the military bases we have ordered to close, so \nthat reuse there is possible. Underfunding this activity by rescinding \nfiscal year 1995 BRAC funds is also short-sighted. It's probably not \neven penny-wise, but it is certainly pound-foolish.\n  In many cases, Federal and State laws require this cleanup. At some \nbases, consent agreements now dictate specific cleanup activities and \ndeadlines, the cost of which must be paid from the BRAC accounts. So \nBRAC rescissions are false savings. We still have to complete these \nenvironmental restoration activities. When we delay, it becomes more \nexpensive, because the contamination in many cases gets worse. Soil and \ngroundwater contamination can spread. And if consent agreements are \nviolated because of lack of funds, the Federal Facilities Compliance \nAct says the Federal Government may be subject to fines and penalties.\n  The Governor of California, Pete Wilson, recently wrote to the \nSecretary of Defense on this subject, saying:\n\n       The continued erosion of cleanup funding inevitably will \n     threaten the health of armed services personnel and civilians \n     who work at military bases where contamination is present. It \n     will also exacerbate economic suffering in\n      communities that are struggling to redevelop closing bases. \n     And, if the federal government will not meet its cleanup \n     obligation, how can we expect private industry to do so? \n     DOD is contractually obligated to seek sufficient funding \n     to permit environmental work to proceed according to the \n     schedules contained in those agreements. California will \n     not hesitate to assert its right under those agreements to \n     seek fines, penalties and judicial orders compelling DOD \n     to conduct required environmental work.\n\n  The attorney general of Texas expressed similar sentiments in a \nletter to the Pentagon, saying:\n\n       If, in other words, the DOD and the federal government do \n     not comply with all applicable cleanup laws, then other \n     entities may begin to question why they should comply with \n     cleanup laws. Hopefully, we have not reached the point of the \n     federal government taking the position of ``do as I say, and \n     not as I do.''\n\n  I would ask that the entire letter of January 25, 1995 from Governor \nWilson to Secretary Perry, and the December 29, 1994 letter from \nAttorney General Dan Morales to Under Secretary of Defense Sherri \nWasserman Goodman be printed in the Record.\n\n                                               Sacramento, CA,\n\n                                                 January 25, 1995.\n     Hon. William Perry,\n     Secretary of Defense, The Pentagon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Perry: I would like to express may deep \n     concern about recent actions at the Department of Defense \n     (DOD) and in Congress regarding cuts in funding for \n     environmental restoration of military bases.\n       The recent decision by Congress to cut $400 million from \n     the Defense Environmental Restoration Account (DERA) for FY95 \n     continues a disturbing trend begun last year when Congress \n     rescinded $507 million from the Base Realignment and Closure \n     (BRAC) Account. California was reassured that the BRAC \n     recission would not affect environmental work at closing \n     military bases, but work was indeed scaled back at several \n     California military bases due to the cut. The DERA cut \n     presumably means that DOD will seek to postpone or eliminate \n     environmental work at operational military bases.\n       At the same time, the DOD Comptroller has announced an \n     additional $437 million in cuts for cleanup programs through \n     FY97. Such actions can only encourage members of Congress who \n     would like to redirect DOD environmental spending into more \n     traditional defense programs.\n       The continued erosion of cleanup funding inevitably will \n     threaten the health of armed services personnel and civilians \n     who work at military bases where contamination is present. It \n     will also exacerbate economic suffering in communities that \n     are struggling to redevelop closing bases. And, if the \n     federal government will not meet its cleanup obligation, how \n     can we expect private industry to do so?\n       California expects DOD to comply with the federal/state \n     cleanup agreements it has signed at California military \n     bases. DOD is contractually obligated to seek sufficient \n     funding to permit environmental work to proceed according to \n     the schedules contained in those agreements. California will \n     not hesitate to assert its right under those agreements to \n     seek fines, penalties and judicial orders compelling DOD to \n     conduct required environmental work.\n       I would be happy to work with you to strengthen support in \n     Washington for full funding of DOD cleanup work. One way to \n     reduce oversight costs would be to delist military bases from \n     the National Priorities List and give states the exclusive \n     responsibility for overseeing base cleanups. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance in these \n     areas.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete Wilson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                    Austin, TX, December 29, 1994.\n     Re additional comments to the Defense environmental response \n         task force fiscal year 1994 annual report to Congress.\n\n     Ms. Sherri Wasserman Goodman,\n     Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Environmental Security), \n         Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Goodman: I continue to believe that much progress \n     has been made in the cleanup program of the Department of \n     Defense (``DoD'') as a result of the work done by you and \n     your office. It is important, however, that the policies \n     declared at the headquarters level continue to permeate down \n     through the Services to the base or facility level. I am not \n     quite sure at this point, in other words, that all of the \n     policies and efforts set forth at the headquarters level have \n     been fully embraced or implemented at the facility level.\n       Because of possible adverse effects on future cleanups at \n     closing bases, I am deeply concerned about recent action \n     taken by the DoD Comptroller with regard to the DoD \n     environmental remediation and compliance budget. I understand \n     that the Comptroller desires to cut over a half-billion \n     dollars from the DoD's request for environmental cleanup and \n     compliance. Not only would such a cut be short-sighted, I \n     firmly believe that it would be unlawful if it is the case \n     that all of the legal requirements facing the DoD could not \n     be met (as a financial or budgeting matter) in accordance \n     with Executive Order 12088 (Federal Compliance with Pollution \n     Control Standards (Oct. 10, 1978)) and the many federal \n     facility and state cleanup agreements entered into in good \n     faith by the DoD. While saving taxpayers' money and ensuring \n     military readiness are surely critically important \n     objectives, the compliance by DoD with all applicable laws \n     purposed at protecting \n      [[Page S5555]] our citizens' health and safety is also \n     extremely important. Unfortunately, DoD appears to be sliding \n     towards the purposeful disregard of its cleanup obligations.\n       More fundamentally, I am perplexed that a certain element \n     within DoD apparently does not believe that a safe and \n     healthy work and living environment for our servicemen and \n     women (and their families) is important for their well-being, \n     as well as for our national security. Surely, the people who \n     are responsible for defending this country should be accorded \n     the same degree of protection from carcinogens and other \n     hazardous substances accorded workers and their families in \n     the private sector.\n       Furthermore, I assume that the Comptroller does not intend \n     for the DoD to shirk its responsibility to protect the health \n     and safety of the communities surrounding defense bases, \n     especially if those communities consist of groups, such as \n     Hispanics and African-Americans, which have historically been \n     the victims of environmental injustice. We cannot pull the \n     ladder up on these groups by cutting the environmental \n     cleanup and compliance budget so soon after finally \n     initiating environmental justice efforts.\n       Lastly, regarding the remediation funding issue, it is \n     clear that if DoD does not take its cleanup responsibilities \n     seriously enough to request adequate funding, then DoD will \n     be sending the worst possible signal to the private sector \n     and the local and state governments facing similar cleanup \n     responsibilities. If, in other words, the DoD and the federal \n     government do not comply with all applicable cleanup laws, \n     then other entities may begin to question why they should \n     comply with cleanup laws. Hopefully, we have not reached the \n     point of the federal government taking the position of ``do \n     as I say, and not as I do.''\n       Aside from comments regarding the DoD Comptroller budget \n     cutting issue, I hereby submit additional comments to the \n     1994 Defense Environmental Response Task Force (``DERTF'') \n     Annual Report to Congress:\n       1. Future Land Use. Whether future land use should be a \n     factor in determining if DoD property is contaminated, or to \n     what standards the property must be cleaned up, are policy \n     questions ultimately to be decided by Congress. Until \n     Congress expressly decides, however, whether the \n     consideration of future land use is appropriate in the \n     cleanup context, DoD must comply with all existing applicable \n     requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     (``EPA'') and the respective states in determining what \n     constitutes ``all remedial action'' necessary to protect the \n     human health and environment. Thus, whether future land use \n     is a legitimate or legal consideration in establishing \n     appropriate cleanup levels currently depends upon whether the \n     regulators allow such consideration, either explicitly or \n     implicitly.\n       As my office has frequently stated during the DERTF \n     proceedings, attempts to subsidize economic redevelopment of \n     bases by allowing the cleanup standards to be loosened may be \n     problematic in the long run for our communities, citizens, \n     and base transferees, as well as short-sighted for DoD. It is \n     still unclear to me whether the following issues have been \n     carefully thought through:\n       (1) Who or what entity decides future land use?\n       (2) What happens when a community decides in the future to \n     change the use of the transferred property?\n       (3) What happens when cleanup standards related to a \n     certain use are ratcheted upwards by EPA or by the respective \n     states?\n       Until the answers to such issues are further refined and a \n     consensus is reached by all stakeholders, I caution against \n     moving too quickly to short-term solutions that may be more \n     budget-based than health and safety-based.\n       2. Harmonization with Private Sector Standards. The goal of \n     trying to quickly-transfer bases to our communities is to \n     ensure quick development in order to create jobs and promote \n     the economic health of our communities--it is not the quick \n     transfer of bases for the mere sake of quick transfer. \n     Unless, however, private sector lenders, developers, and \n     investors are sufficiently comfortable that they will not \n     face potential environmental liability, they simply will not \n     get involved in the redevelopment of a closed base.\n       Thus, it is critical that DoD's investigative, remedial, \n     and transfer processes mirror the processes found in the \n     private sector. For example, the investigation and \n     remediation processes established by the Services should \n     reflect and fulfill the same requirements, roles, and \n     functions as environmental due diligence efforts in the \n     private sector. Failure to harmonize efforts between the DoD \n     and the private sector in this regard will only result in \n     delay subsequent to the transfer of closed bases. I have \n     instructed my office to continue to encourage DoD to make \n     every effort to harmonize, to the extent allowed by law, its \n     investigative, remedial, and transfer practices with private \n     sector practices.\n       3. Base Transfers Prior to Remedial Action. The DERTF \n     Annual Report indicates that the DERTF proposes to examine \n     possible changes in the law to allow property to be deeded \n     before remedial actions are in place and properly and \n     successfully operating, so long as there is no increased \n     threat to human health and the environment.\n       Section 120(h)(3) of CERCLA requires that each deed \n     transferring federal property contain a covenant warranting \n     that all remedial action necessary to protect human health \n     and the environment has been taken and that any additional \n     remedial action found to be necessary after the transfer \n     shall be taken by the government. Generally this means that \n     base property cannot be transferred before it is cleaned up. \n     This important statutory requirement helps to protect future \n     occupants from harm, and the United States from liability. In \n     light of the Anti-Deficiency Act and other barriers to the \n     ensuring of sufficient funding for cleanups, the requirement \n     of base cleanup before transfer provides the one sure means \n     of ensuring that there will indeed be cleanup of the facility \n     to be transferred.\n       The risks involved in deeding property before cleanup is \n     completed in accordance with all applicable law outweigh any \n     potential benefits of such premature deeding, in my opinion. \n     Even if deeding contaminated property does not actually \n     increase the threat to human health, it will reduce DoD's \n     control over the transferred property, breach an important \n     regulatory checkpoint, and increase the legal risks to all \n     parties. I continue to believe that this option should be \n     rejected by the DERTF.\n       There is, furthermore, no statutory cleanup completion \n     requirement for leases. While it may be, as the Services are \n     claiming, that leases are not being used by the Services in \n     order to avoid their cleanup responsibilities or to \n     circumvent the ultimate purpose of CERCLA, long-term leases \n     are clearly being used to avoid--strictly speaking--the \n     provisions of CERCLA Sec. 120(h)(3). While leases can and \n     have been used to facilitate reuse in conjunction with \n     remediation on terms that are fully protective of human \n     health and the environment, it is critical that the Services \n     maintain adequate control over the leased property in order \n     to ensure that public health and safety are protected, that \n     cleanup activities are facilitated, and that the lessee is \n     not doing anything that might increase the legal liability of \n     the government or any other party. I am not confident at this \n     point that sufficient institutional controls akin to those \n     established in the private sector long-term property \n     management have yet been developed by DoD in the base closure \n     context.\n       4. Indemnification of Future Owners. The Annual Report \n     points out that the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1993 (``Act'') contains provisions to indemnify transferees \n     from environmental liability, and implies that no further \n     study of indemnification is needed. The Act indemnifies \n     states, political subdivisions and any other person or entity \n     that acquires ownership or control of a closing base from \n     suits arising out of any claim for personal injury or \n     property damage resulting from the release or threatened \n     release of hazardous substances.\n       Clearly, the federal government is solely responsible for \n     cleaning up contamination caused by its activities prior to \n     base closure. CERCLA, however, provides as a general matter \n     that the current owner (i.e., the transferee receiving title \n     to the closed base) is jointly and severally liable for \n     response costs. Thus the transferee may be found jointly and \n     severally liable for the cost of clean up residual \n     contamination left from military activities notwithstanding \n     the provisions of CERCLA Sec. 120(h)(3). I am unsure whether \n     the indemnity provision cited above unambiguously provides \n     otherwise. I recommend that DERTF study this issue and that \n     the Act be clarified to comply with the common understanding \n     of the government's responsibilities.\n       In any event, while who ultimately is responsible for \n     response costs is a relatively straightforward legal issue, \n     determining whose ``molecules'' are contaminating the \n     groundwater or soil may be a very difficult factual issue--an \n     issue that may only be determined after much litigation and \n     much expense for all parties concerned.\n       I look forward to continuing my office's participation in \n     the DERTF proceedings. As we move on to the next round of \n     base closures, it is critical that we continue to improve the \n     base cleanup and transfer process. Thank you for the \n     opportunity to add my comments to the DERTF Annual Report to \n     be submitted to Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dan Morales,\n                                        Attorney General of Texas.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate bill rescinds fiscal year 1995 \nBRAC funding that DOD did ask for and that we appropriated, as we \nshould have. If the conference committee accepts these rescissions in \nthe BRAC accounts, it will further slow cleanup that has already been \ndelayed by previous cuts. Last year Congress rescinded half a billion \ndollars from BRAC accounts to pay part of the cost of earthquake \nrecovery in California. That reduction was spread by the Department of \nDefense among many facilities, and the pace of cleanup was slowed.\n  I know some in Congress have attacked environmental restoration as \nnot a legitimate Pentagon expenditure. But where the military caused \nenvironmental damage, especially where it now interferes with \nproductive reuse of land and property in the middle of severely \ndislocated communities, that damage constitutes a real cost of military \nactivities. It is just a deferred cost \n [[Page S5556]] created by the Federal Government, a bill that has not \nyet been paid. We must pay it. We promised to pay it, and the BRAC \naccounts hold the funds.\n  The Department of Defense strongly supports these BRAC expenditures. \nAir Force Secretary Sheila Widnall told the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       I cannot think of anything more short-sighted than to not \n     fund for to rescind environmental cleanup money for BRAC \n     bases.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Perry told the Budget Committee:\n\n       That work has to be done, there's no doubt. This \n     environmental cleanup we're doing is legislatively required. \n     It's not as if it's a discretion on the part of the Defense \n     Department.\n\n  Reducing our excess military facility capacity is necessary, Mr. \nPresident, but it is extremely painful for local communities whose \neconomics have become reliant on a facility over many decades. Base \nclosure causes a huge economic and social disruption, especially in \nsmaller, rural communities where a base has dominated the local job \npicture. At lest 30 Sates are already directly affected by base \nclosures initiated in the 6 years, and additional bases are scheduled \nto be identified this summer for closure.\n  The base closure process has been devastating to military facilities \nin my own State of Michigan. We have now lost all three of our active \nAir Force bases, a number of smaller facilities, and still more \nclosures have been proposed in Michigan for the current BRAC round IV. \nIf the reductions proposed in this Senate bill are approved by the full \nCongress and signed into law by the President, the impact will be felt \nin many communities with closing bases from BRAC rounds II and III that \nare currently struggling to survive, including Wurtsmith Air Force Base \nin Oscoda and K.I. Sawyer in Gwinn, MI. These communities are trying to \nattract new businesses with new jobs, and the land and property that \nhas been contaminated by the military cannot be made available for \nother use until it is cleaned up. That takes money, and the money must \ncome from these BRAC accounts.\n  Mr. President, last month 17 of my colleagues in the Senate wrote to \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nWe urged the committee to fully fund environmental cleanup at closed \nmilitary bases, and specifically to not rescind fiscal year 1995 funds. \nI ask that the full letter, signed by 18 Senators, be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: When the President and Congress \n     initiated the process of closing military bases, we made a \n     solemn commitment to complete environmental restoration and \n     remediation at those facilities quickly. We recognized that \n     cleanup is essential before property can be released by the \n     government and reused by local communities trying to rebuild \n     their economies and attract new jobs. Congress must not now \n     renege on this commitment by underfunding the Base \n     Realignment and Closure (BRAC) accounts that pay for this \n     cleanup.\n       Our nation's military facilities infrastructure must be \n     reduced commensurate with the downsizing of armed forces. At \n     least 30 states are already directly affected by base \n     closures initiated in the first three rounds of the closure \n     process, and additional bases are scheduled to be identified \n     for closure this summer. Where the federal government has \n     caused environmental contamination during its tenancy, that \n     damage must be substantially repaired before property can be \n     transferred to a state, locality or private owner for \n     productive reuse. Environmental damage is a real cost \n     incurred as a result of DOD activities and it should be paid \n     for out of the DOD budget.\n       In many cases, federal and state laws govern the cleanup \n     activities required, and at some bases the relevant parties \n     have negotiated consent agreements mandating specific cleanup \n     deadlines. Costs associated with thses activities are paid \n     for from the BRAC accounts, which the Administration and \n     Congress have funded adequately in recent years.\n       Defense Secretary William Perry recently testified to the \n     Senate Budget Committee that ``This environmental cleanup \n     we're doing is legislatively required. It's not as if it's a \n     discretion on the part of the Defense Department. That work \n     has to be done, there's no doubt.'' And Air Force Secretary \n     Sheila Widnall testified last year that ``I cannot think of \n     anything more short-sighted than to not fund or to rescind \n     environmental cleanup money for BRAC bases.''\n       For all of these reasons, we request that you reject any \n     rescission of FY 1995 funds in this area, and that you \n     support full funding of the Department of Defense FY 1996 \n     request for Base Realignment and Closure cleanup activities.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Daniel K. Akaka, Barbara Boxer, Ben \n           Nighthorse Campbell, John Lieberman, Frank R. \n           Lautenberg, John F. Kerry, Carl Levin, Claiborne Pell, \n           Patty Murray, David Pryor, Herb Kohl, Chuck Robb, Paul \n           Sarbanes, Tom Daschle, Dianne Feinstein, Olympia Snowe.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. We hope that the committee would heed our advice. Now it \nis vital that the conference committee restores these funds so that \ncleanup goes forward without delay, and productive reuse in communities \nwith closing bases can be accomplished swiftly.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt will live forever in the hearts and minds of Americans. This \nmemorable leader helped to lead this country through both a worldwide \ndepression and a world war, and when he died he left the country \npositioned to take its place as the leader of the free world. Fifty \nyears ago April 12, the people of our great country lost a President, a \nstatesman, and a leader.\n  Since 1971 I have had the honor to have served on the Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt Memorial Commission, the past 5 years of this time serving as \nthe cochairman with my distinguished colleague from Hawaii, Senator \nInouye. This Commission was formally established by Public Law 372 in \n1955 with the responsibility of constructing an appropriate memorial to \nthe 32d President of the United States. That memorial, which is to be \nunveiled in 1997, is a tribute not only to Roosevelt the President, but \nalso to an era.\n  I was 10 years old when Franklin Roosevelt was elected President, I \nwas a 20-year-old naval officer in the waters off Okinawa when I heard \nthe news that the President had died. Millions of Americans, like \nmyself, had grown up with the Roosevelts. To many it seemed that he \nwould be President forever. Suddenly, while the United States are still \nengaged in war, our Commander in Chief was gone. The feeling was one of \nloss and uncertainty, Roosevelt was to many Americans the only \nPresident we had known, to millions he was a hero and a friend. The \nfuture suddenly became uncertain for those at home and overseas.\n  That uncertainty soon turned to confidence as the war was won and the \nUnited States took its place not only as the champion of freedom and \npeace but as the most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \nRoosevelt had ensured the future of the country by preparing it for the \ndemands of the 20th century.\n  It was Roosevelt's dedication to the future of this country which \ninstigated such universally accepted successes as the GI bill of rights \nand the Social Security Act. The GI bill assisted over 50 percent of \nthe returning soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen, guaranteed for \nthe United States an educated and skilled populace unrivaled in the \nworld. While the GI bill provided for those upon whose backs the future \nlay, the Social Security Act helped those who had already carried the \nburden.\n  As is now well known, Franklin Roosevelt fought a constant battle \nwith the crippling effects of polio even as he waged war against the \nGreat Depression and the forces of fascism. His accomplishments as \nPresident serve as the greatest testament to his personal victories, \nand he survives still as an example of the human ability to challenge \nand overcome even the greatest of obstacles.\n  Mr. President, the life and Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nserves as a reminder to each of us, to my colleagues in the Senate and \nto the people all across this country, of the ability of the American \npeople to face up to and overcome any and all challenges. To look the \nuncertainties of the future in the face and to move forward with \nconfidence and an unshakable faith. This is indeed Roosevelt's longest \nand best lived legacy, his eternal challenge to each and every one of \nus.

Mr. President, spring has arrived here in \nWashington, the Grounds of the Capitol are looking their best and we \nwelcome the change. Unfortunately, spring in Bosnia is not a welcome \nevent. Spring in Bosnia means the cease-fires of winter melt away and \nthe war will resume with all its ferocity.\n  I have taken this floor many times to decry the ethnic cleansing that \ncontinues in Bosnia and to urge our Government, and the U.N. Security \nCouncil, to act more responsibly in addressing this terrible tragedy. \nIt comes as no surprise that those affected by our inaction are \nastonished at our apparent indifference, and chastise us for failing to \nuphold basic moral and legal norms.\n  On Wednesday, the Washington Post printed a portion of a statement by \nVinko Cardinal Puljic, archbishop of Sarajevo. While the United States, \nalong with the U.N. Security Council and NATO sit on our hands, we \ncannot also cover our ears. The archbishop of Sarajevo knows of what he \nspeaks. The Senate would do well to listen.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 5, 1995]\n\n                             For the Record\n\n                       (By Vinko Cardinal Puljic)\n\n       I, like so many in Bosnia-Herzegovina, am astonished and \n     bewildered . . . at the international community's \n     indifferent, half-hearted, inconsistent and ineffectual \n     response to aggression and ``ethnic cleansing.'' Not only has \n     [it] not acted decisively, it has even contributed to the \n     ethnic division of Bosnia and has legitimized aggression by \n     failing to uphold basic moral and legal norms.\n       If the principles of peace and international justice are \n     buried in the soil of the Balkans, Western civilization will \n     be threatened. . . . I am convinced that there are moral \n     means to thwart immoral aggression. The international \n     community must have the will to use the means available to it \n     to protect threatened populations, to encourage \n     demilitarization and to establish other conditions necessary \n     for progress toward peace. The solution cannot be simply to \n     give up and withdraw. If the United Nations and the \n     international community do not now have effective means to \n     respond to the humanitarian crisis in Bosnia and elsewhere--\n     and it is clear that they do not--then nations have the \n     responsibility to take the steps necessary to develop more \n     effective international structures.\n       This is not a religious conflict, but some would misuse \n     religion in support of ethnic division and extreme \n     nationalism. Therefore, as a religious leader, I believe I \n     have a special responsibility to stand beside those who are \n     victims of injustice and aggression, regardless of their \n     religious, ethnic or national identity. I also believe that, \n     even though a just peace seems far off, religious and other \n     leaders must not wait for an end to war to begin the daunting \n     task of reconciling deeply divided communities.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5557-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last night, I voted for final \npassage of the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The bill, as amended by the compromise substitute, is a distinct \nimprovement over the legislation reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee. The compromise reduces Federal spending by nearly $16 \nbillion and restores funding to a number of critical programs affecting \nchildren and education.\n  This includes a broad range of programs that I very strongly support: \nHead Start, education reform, safe and drug free school programs, the \nWomen Infants and Children Program, the childcare block grant program, \ntitle I programs to improve reading, writing, and math skills for \neducationally disadvantaged kids, impact aid, and the TRIO Program for \nfirst generation college-bound students, and the national service \ncollege scholarship program--AmeriCorps.\n  However, the legislation still cuts too deeply into important \nprograms which the American people approve of such as assisting the \nStates in protecting the quality and safety of our drinking water, the \nopening of Jobs Corps centers already announced, and for which \ncommunities across the country have expended funds and resources and \nfunding for the promised environmental cleanup of military bases.\n  One of the great disappointments on this bill was the defeat of the \nMikulski amendment by a vote of 68 to 32.\n  The Mikulski amendment would have restored funds for a number of \nimportant national programs such as the housing program, and also would \nhave funded the EPA Center in Bay City, the CIESIN facility in Saginaw, \nand announced Job Corps centers in nine cities across the country, \nincluding Flint.\n  I have already begun discussions with colleagues in an effort to \nrestore some of these cuts in conference between the House and the \nSenate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5557-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5557-S5558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    U.S.-HONG KONG POLICY ACT REPORT\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the March 31, 1995 report required by \nthe U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act made some useful contributions to the \nhistorical record of Hong Kong's transition from a dependent territory \nof the United Kingdom to a special administrative region of the \nPeople's Republic of China. The report correctly assessed Governor \nPatten's highly touted legislative reforms as modest.\n  The account given of threats to press freedoms was also important, in \nlight of the People's Republic of China's recent actions against Hong \nKong and other journalists. While the report included the case of Xi \nYang, the Hong Kong reporter imprisoned inside mainland China for \n``stealing state financial secrets,'' it would have been appropriate \nfor the report to have included the detail that the secrets were \nplanned increases in interest rates and the sale of gold.\n  Most important, the report expressed U.S. support for ``continued \ndevelopment of democratic institu- \ntions * * * and the conduct of free and fair elections after July 1.'' \nI hope the United States Government is making this position clear to \nthe People's Republic of China in no uncertain terms.\n  The report neglected to discuss a number of important developments \nwhich I highlight here because they are so critical to the future of \nthe territory.\n  Much as China's treatment of the press has had a chilling effect on \nHong Kong journalists, the People's Republic of China's harsh and \narbitrary treatment of businessmen is having pernicious effects in Hong \nKong. The People's Republic of China frequently arrests, imprisons, and \nholds incommunicado, foreign businessmen--almost 20 in the past 3 \nyears--particularly those with whom People's Republic of China state-\nowned enterprises have commercial disputes. For example, at the \ninstigation of the People's Republic of China, James Peng, an \nAustralian citizen, was arrested by Macau police and deported to \nShenzen in Guandong Province. Mr. Peng's offense was that he won a \nlegal battle to retain\n control of his company, a Sino-foreign joint venture listed on the \nShenzen stock exchange. Another businessman, Zhang Guei-Xing, who holds \nan American green card, was jailed under horrific conditions in a \ndetention camp in Zhengzhou for 2\\1/2\\ years. A Miami businessman, Troy \nMcBride, has been detained in Anhui province since mid-March, his \npassport confiscated, because of a commercial dispute. In the People's \nRepublic of China today, economic disputes have become economic crimes. \nArrests, detention, and harassment of businessmen are just one more \nbusiness practice. The ultimate goal is a settlement involving the \nsurrender of property or other assets--in effect, a ransom payment.\n\n  Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption [ICAC] reports \na sharp increase in corruption complaints as the People's Republic of \nChina and Hong Kong markets become more intertwined. The People's \nRepublic of China's treatment of businessmen, the absence of the rule \nof law, and the insidious spread of corruption from the mainland to \nHong Kong, must be included in future U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act \nreports.\n  The report's recognition of the lack of progress and even stalling on \nrule of law issues within the joint liaison group is also important. \nHowever, the report should have acknowledged that the role the joint \nliaison group has assumed in this transition period is contrary to the \nterms of the joint declaration, which expressly states that the \n [[Page S5558]] joint liaison group is ``not an organ of power.'' Under \nthe joint declaration's terms, Great Britain has the authority to \ngovern Hong Kong until June 30, 1997.\n  The People's Republic of China's manipulation of the joint liaison \ngroup is part of the People's Republic of China's 10-year pattern of \nreneging on its commitments under the joint declaration. \nNotwithstanding the recent public relations tour through the United \nStates by Lu Ping, Beijing's top Hong Kong official, the People's \nRepublic of China has repeatedly displayed its contempt for the joint \ndeclaration. Five years ago this week, in April 1990, Beijing codified \nsignificant deviations from the joint declaration in the basic law, the \nso-called miniconstitution for post-1997 Hong Kong that Beijing wrote \nand rubberstamped in its National People's Congress. The basic law \nsubordinates the Hong Kong Legislature to the Beijing-appointed \nexecutive, and assigns the power of judicial interpretation to the \nstanding committee of the National People Congress rather than to Hong \nKong's judges. The basic law's provisions on the legislature may become \nmoot however, since the People's Republic of China has promised or \nthreatened to dismantle the Legco and Hong Kong's two other tiers of \ngovernment.\n  Beijing also threatens to abolish the Bill of Rights, enacted by the \nLegco in 1991 in reaction to the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and over \nthe objections of the Hong Kong government. Finally, a high official of \nthe Chinese supreme court has suggested that Beijing will replace Hong \nKong's common law system, which is synonymous with individual rights \nand the rule of law within a civil law system. China's own civil law \nsystem is explicitly subordinated to the Communist Party.\n  The status of plans for establishing a high court before 1997 is \ncause for concern as well, and here the report's brief treatment of the \nissue is troubling. The details of a Court of Final Appeal, to replace \nthe Privy Council in London, as the territory's highest court were \nagreed to in the joint declaration. The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act \nreport mistakenly accepts the 1991 agreement between the British \nGovernment of Hong Kong and China as a basis for the Hong Kong \ngovernment's legislation implementing the court. The 1991 agreement \nexplicitly violates the joint declaration and basic law. Accordingly, \ndemocratic legislators plan to amend it to bring it into accord with \nthe joint declaration.\n  I was surprised and disappointed that the report did not address two \nmatters of tremendous significance in this transition period and to \npost-1997 Hong Kong. First, the report omitted any discussion of the \nPatten government's rejection of proposals by Hong Kong's democrats for \nan official human rights commission. Over the next 27 months, the \ncommission cold define a human rights standard against which to judge \nthe Hong Kong SAR government. The People's Republic of China's \nexpressed hostility to independent and democratic government \ninstitutions after 1997 is an argument for moving full-speed ahead with \na human rights commission and other institutional reforms, not for \nbacking off.\n  Also missing from the report was any mention of Great Britain's \nfailure to report on human rights in the colony according to its \nobligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights.\n  As 1997 draws near, there will be a greater need for accurate and \ntimely reporting on developments in Hong Kong. There is also a need for \na clearer recognition of the implications of the People's Republic of \nChina's behavior for the people of Hong Kong. I look forward to future \nreports and hope that, in the intervals between reports, my colleagues \nin the United States. Congress and other friends of Hong Kong will pay \nclose attention to the statements and actions of the Beijing and Hong \nKong governments. Above all, there must be more attention to the voices \nand concerns of the Hong Kong people.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5557-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                               IMPACT AID\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, last night we completed action on \nH.R. 1158, the supplemental appropriations and rescissions for fiscal \nyear 1995. I wanted to briefly discuss one provision included in the \nleadership amendment adopted last evening to restore funding for impact \naid. As my colleagues know, the Impact Aid Program is designed to \nprovide aid to assist communities which have significant Federal \npresence in meeting education objectives. Specifically, this funding is \nimportant to Hatboro-Horsham school district in eastern Pennsylvania. \nMy colleague, Senator Santorum, and I have heard from the local school \ndistrict regarding this funding.\n  I am aware of the importance of this funding to other areas of the \ncountry. In particular, I want to note the efforts of my friend and \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, to preserve the impact \naid funding. He personally told me of the adverse effect of the \nproposed rescission would have on a number of South Dakota schools, \nincluding the Pollock school district in northern South Dakota. I \ncommend Senator Pressler for his leadership and for looking out for the \neducational interests of South Dakota schools, students, and \nfamilies.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5558-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1995\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I wish briefly to add my reflections on \nthe accomplishments of this Congress and especially of our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives during this first 100 days of that \nhistoric Congress.\n  The new leadership of the House of Representatives made certain \ncommitments, ambitious commitments to the people of the United States \nin the course of last year's campaign covering a number of vitally \nimportant subjects to the people of the United States. Those \ncommitments were repeated after the election was over. Those \ncommitments have been kept to the letter by our colleagues in the \nHouse.\n  I believe that this remarkable record of achievement has created a \ndistinct resonance on the part of the American people whose opinion of \nCongress, extremely low as recently as 6 months ago, has at least begun \nto recover. Perhaps more significant in the long run will be the \ncontent of the 100 days' promises, dramatic changes in the way in which \nCongress does its business, a very real attack on the problem of \nviolent crime in our society, a major step \n [[Page S5559]] forward toward welfare reform, toward tax relief for \nfamilies, and for the creation of jobs, toward our national security, \nand toward legal reform, Mr. President.\n  As each of us knows in this body, on the other hand, no one can \nsafely make 100-day promises. The right of unlimited debate, vital to \nthe liberties of the people of the United States, causes more careful \nconsideration frequently of particular items and often frustration on \nthe part of Members of the Senate and of the country itself. \nNevertheless, at least three items in the contract for America have \npassed this body as well as the House.\n  The announcement I just made on behalf of the majority leader \nindicates that a portion of the legal reform agenda will be the first \nitem to be discussed by the Senate upon its return, and I would hazard \nthe estimate that before this year is over every one of the items on \nthe Contract With America will have been discussed and voted on in the \nSenate. We can no more promise than the Speaker of the House can that \nall will be passed. Each and every one of these items requires at least \na degree of bipartisan support in the Senate given the rules of this \nbody. But it is clear that this Congress as a whole has acted more \ndecisively and has created a greater change in course and direction for \nthe country than any Congress literally in decades.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not express my \npersonal pride in the new Members of the House of Represenatives from \nmy own State. My own State has provided more new Members from my party, \nmore freshmen Members than any other State in the United States of \nAmerica, five men and one woman of great distinction in their previous \ncareers, enthusiastically dedicated to the goals of the contract on \nwhich they ran, and major participants, even though they are freshmen \nMembers, in the wonderful successes which the House of Representatives \nhas shown. I am proud to be a part of that delegation and express my \ngreat gratitude to them for all they have accomplished in as yet short \nbut highly distinguished congressional careers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/07/senate-section/article/S5558-6", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
