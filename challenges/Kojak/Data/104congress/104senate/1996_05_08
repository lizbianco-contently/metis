The able majority leader, Senator Dole, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the time between now and 10 o'clock will be \nequally divided prior to a cloture vote at 10 a.m. on H.R. 2937, the \nWhite House Travel Office legislation. If cloture is not invoked at 10 \no'clock, it may be possible to consider any of the following items: Gas \ntax legislation, taxpayer bill of rights, minimum wage legislation, and \nTEAM Act. We hope to have some resolution of these matters today.\n  I again say it is rather ironic that we are prepared to accept the \nminimum wage proposal offered by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. We are prepared to repeal the gas tax that my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle would like to repeal, the Clinton gas tax which was \nnot for highways or bridges or roads, but for deficit reduction, and \nwas part of the larger $268 billion tax increase in 1993, the largest \ntax increase in the history of the world, let alone America. We do not \nunderstand why our colleagues, who I think want to do those things, \nwould be holding it up because of one little amendment we offered \ncalled the TEAM Act, which simply says employees can talk to employers.\n  This is America. But of course the labor bosses, who put $35 million, \njust lately, into the pot on the other side of the aisle, said we do \nnot like that. So when the labor bosses speak, our colleagues on the \nother side say yes--yes, sir.\n  So if we are going to let the labor bosses dictate repeal of the gas \ntax, the increase in the minimum wage because they dislike one \nprovision that simply says that employees can talk to employers, then I \nthink it is a rather sad state of affairs. We hope to debate that at \nlength today, because I believe the American people, once they \nunderstand this issue, will be on the right side.\n  If some employee has a good idea on productivity or whatever it may \nbe, why can that employee not talk to management? Because since 1992 \nthe NLRB says you cannot do that. We are simply trying to change the \nlaw. We think it is good policy. We think it makes a lot of good, \ncommon sense. We believe it improves the working relationship in the \nworkplace. For all the reasons I can think of, we hope to be able to \npersuade our colleagues on the other side that this is a package that \nshould pass this Senate by 100 to 0.\n  Perhaps they are waiting for the liberal media to put their spin on \nit, but it is pretty hard to even put--they do not have a spin. Even \nthe liberal media, who wait for the Democrats' spin and then print it \nalmost verbatim on a daily basis around here, find it very difficult. \nBecause we are going to accept their package on minimum wage, our \npackage on gas tax repeal. Then we had TEAM Act and we are ready to \nvote, after an hour debate on each side. We have even provide they can \nhave a separate vote on minimum wage and a separate vote on TEAM Act.\n\n  Some may not want to vote for the minimum wage increase so we provide \nfor that. Some may not want to vote for TEAM Act, so we provide for \nthat. So we have gone not only the extra mile, but miles and miles \nbeyond.\n  We hope there could be some resolution of this today. If not, we will \ntake our case to the American people and we will continue the debate \nthroughout today and tomorrow and Friday. Hopefully, sooner or later, \nour colleagues will recognize this is a very fair and very reasonable \nproposal we have made and it should have unanimous support in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4813-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the leader's time. How \nmuch time is there of the minority leader's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to yield \nleader's time, to take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have been informed by the leader that \nhe is willing to let me have the leader's time prior to vote on the \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may have that.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will now have 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Over the period of the last 24 hours, there have been a series of \ndifferent proposals for Senate action that I hope will eventually be \nresolved. One deals with the minimum wage, which we have tried to raise \nat different times over the period of the last year and a half and have \nbeen denied the opportunity for a vote up or down.\n  I understand we will have a chance to vote on, hopefully, the gas \ntax. There are other measures on education that I had hoped we could \nhave included as well. But I want to speak right now on another issue \nwhich had been talked about earlier today and certainly yesterday, and \nthat is the Anti-Workplace Democracy Act, otherwise known as the TEAM \nAct.\n  We have really not had the opportunity for much debate and discussion \non that measure, and I will just take a few moments now to raise some \nof the very important questions that I think this legislation \neffectively raises. That is, whether this legislation is really what it \nis suggested to be, and that is just legislation to permit cooperation \nbetween employers and employees in order to deal with a lot of the \nissues that might be in the workplace, and, as we have seen, as I \nstated yesterday, the type of cooperation which has been talked about \nhere on the floor as being the reasons for that cooperation is already \ntaking place. It has been included and recognized in the findings of \nthe bill itself and has also been referenced in the report itself where \ncooperation is taking place between management and workers.\n  There are only three areas where that kind of cooperation is not on \nthe table and which would be altered and changed by the TEAM Act, and \nthat is with regard to wages and working conditions. That has been \nrecognized to be a position since the time of the 1930's to be issues \nreserved to representatives of employees. Effectively, that is the rock \nupon which workers are able to negotiate their working conditions and \nalso their wages, and the matters that will affect their take-home pay \nand what will be available to them to protect their interests and their \nfamilies.\n\n  So the idea that this is just legislation that is going to move us \ninto the next century and increase America's capacity to compete is a \nfalse representation.\n  It is interesting to me that Republicans and Democrats alike stood so \nstrong with Solidarity and Lech Walesa. Why did they stand with Lech \nWalesa? Why did they stand with Solidarity? There were unions in \nPoland. They were government/employer-controlled unions. There was not \nunion democracy. I can remember hearing the clear, eloquent statements \nby then-Republican George Bush that said, ``We support democracy, and \nwe support real workers' rights in Poland, and we support Solidarity.''\n  Why did they support Solidarity? Because Solidarity represented \nworkers. The TEAM Act effectively is going to be company-run union \nshops or company-run management teams. Does anybody in this body think \nthat if they establish that an employer picks representatives of \nworkers, pays their check, that those particular workers are going to \nbuck the management that put them on the team? Of course, they will \nnot. That is as old as the company-run unions that we had in the \n1930's. That was the issue when this body debated the National Labor \nRelations Act in the 1930's and implemented that particular \nlegislation.\n  That is what the issue is, plain and simple: Are we going to say that \ncompany CEO's and management are going to be able to dictate to the \nworkers in this country exactly what their wages are going to be, or \nare we going to let employees represent their interests and go ahead \nand bargain with the employers as to what those wages and working \nconditions are going to be? It is just that simple.\n  The TEAM Act is effectively company-run unions. That is effectively \nwhat it is. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It is so interesting to me, \nMr. President, as someone who has followed the whole debate about \ncompany-run unions and antidemocracy representation in the workplace, \nwhere these organizations were when they had the Dunlop commission only \na few years ago that was trying to look over the relationship between \nCEO's and companies and also the employees. The same groups that are \nsupporting this legislation testified in that committee that they did \nnot think there ought to be a change in the labor laws. The only thing \nthat changed was the 1994 election and the Republicans gaining control \nin the House and the Senate. If you look over what presentations were \nmade before the Dunlop commission, you would say they feel that the \nrelationship between employer and employees is fine with them.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we ought to understand exactly what this is going \nto be. It is going to be the government-run kind of unions in a \ndifferent way.\n  All of us fought for and wanted to see the restoration of democracy \nin Eastern Europe. Most of all, the Eastern European countries had \ngovernment-run unions, effectively employer-run unions. And here in the \nUnited States, we were giving help and assistance to workers for worker \ndemocracy. Now we are saying on the floor of the U.S. Senate, ``Well, \nwe want the TEAM Act,'' and the TEAM Act effectively is going to \neliminate the workers' rights in this country. No ifs, ands, or buts \nabout it.\n  I hear on the floor of the U.S. Senate the central challenge that we \nare facing as we move to the end of this century is to give life to the \n65 or 70 percent of Americans who are being left out and left behind.\n  I hear a great deal about income security, about job security being \nthe issues that this country ought to address. I tell you something, \nyou might as well write off those speeches if we are going to go ahead \nand pass the TEAM Act. Write them off. What you see is continued \nexploitation.\n  You talk about the battle for the increase in the minimum wage. Write\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nthat off, because you will give such power to the employers in this \ncountry that they will be able to write any kind of wage scale that \nthey want. Does anyone think that the team makes the judgment and \ndecision about workers' rights, about what the employees will get paid? \nOf course not. They make the recommendation to the employer, and the \nemployer decides. That is the principal difference: Whether the workers \nare going to be able to make that judgment and decision, sitting across \nthe table from the employer, or whether the team is going to make a \nrecommendation to the employer, then the employer will make the \njudgment.\n  Mr. President, with respect to all of our colleagues who talk about \nwhere we are going to go in terms of the U.S. economy, what we need to \nbe able to compete in the world at the turn of the century is a mature \neconomy with mature relationships between workers and employers and an \neconomy which is going to benefit all of the workers and workers' \nfamilies.\n  We are going in that wrong direction, as we have seen. The right \ndirection for the wealthiest corporations, the right direction for the \nwealthiest individuals--we have seen the accumulation of wealth in \nterms of the richest individuals and corporations taking place in this \ncountry unlike anything we have seen. But those 65 or 70 percent of \nAmerican working families are being left out and left behind. You pass \nthis particular act and you will find that it will not be 65 or 70 \npercent, but it will be 80 percent. They will not just fall back \nsomewhat; their whole life will be disrupted and destroyed with regard \nto their economic conditions.\n  Mr. President, we are entitled to have some debate and discussion on \nthis issue because its implications in terms of working families are \nprofound. It is basically an antiworker act. It ought to be labeled \nsuch. That is something that we ought to at least have a chance to \ndebate and discuss.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague. Nobody \nargues more forcefully for big labor than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Although I want to talk about the Billy Dale matter, I do have to say \nthat most of what the Senator has said is pure Washington-inside labor \nline. The fact is, the NLRB went way beyond where it should have gone \nand took the rights of individual employees to meet with management to \nresolve problems that really have nothing to do with collective \nbargaining. It seems ridiculous to call this antidemocracy. Give me a \nbreak. What is antidemocracy is to close shop where 51 out of 100 \nemployees want a union and the other 49 have to comply and have to pay \ndues and have to be part of the union whether they want to or not. That \nis not democracy.\n\n  On the other hand, what is wrong with management and labor being able \nto get together in teams and make the workplace a safer, better place \nto work in?\n  I had to say that because I listened to the distinguished Senator. He \nis eloquent and forceful. He just happens to be wrong.\n  Mr. President, why we are really here this morning is the Billy Dale \nmatter. Billy Dale and his colleagues at the White House were very \nbadly mistreated by greedy people who wanted to take over the White \nHouse Travel Office--and I might add, there is some indication that the \ntravel offices of every agency in Government--so they could reap \nmillions, if not billions of dollars of free profits at the expense of \nthese people who had served eight Presidents over a pronounced period \nof time and had served them well, done a good job, and who Peat Marwick \nsays did it in a reasonable manner.\n  They were mistreated. The law was used against them in an improper \nway. The FBI was brought in an improper way. I might add, the power of \nthe White House was used against them, the power of the Justice \nDepartment was used against them. Virtually everybody who looks at it, \nespecially those who look at it honestly, say this is a set of wrongs \nthat ought to be righted. In the process, their lives happen to be \nbroken because they are now stuck with all kinds of legal fees that \nwould break any common citizen in this country.\n  We want to right that wrong. Yesterday, my colleagues on the other \nside voted en masse against cloture which would allow this matter to go \nto a vote. One of the arguments which was superficial and fallacious \nwas they cannot even amend it. Of course they can. After cloture, \ngermane amendments are in order. If they want to bring up a germane \namendment to this Billy Dale bill, they are capable of doing so. That \nis just another false assertion and false approach.\n  I think it is time to do what is right around here. It is time to \nrectify these wrongs. It is time to do what is the right and \ncompassionate thing. In all honesty, we have not been doing it as we \nlistened to the arguments on the other side as to what should be done. \nIt has been nearly 3 years since the termination of the White House \nTravel Office employees, and they are still in the unfair position of \ndefending their reputations. It is time to close this chapter on their \nlives.\n\n  The targeting of dedicated public servants, apparently because they \nheld positions coveted by political profiteers, demands an appropriate \nresponse. Although their tarnished personal reputations may never fully \nbe restored, it is only just that the Congress do what it can to \nrectify this wrong.\n  This bill will reimburse Travel Office employees for the expenses of \ndefending themselves against these unjust criminal persecutions. I call \nit ``persecutions'' even though there was a ``prosecution'' of Billy \nDale.\n  The argument that invoking cloture will foreclose the option of \namendments is nonsense. Germane amendments can still be offered, \nalthough I question why anyone would want to delay any further the \ncompensation of these people who have been so unjustly treated. The \nargument that passing the Billy Dale bill will undermine the likelihood \nof seeing the Senate vote on the minimum wage increase is equally \nhollow. In fact, it is superficial and wrong.\n  Only yesterday the majority leader proposed a plan which would ensure \na vote on the minimum wage increase this week, and my colleagues on the \nother side rejected it. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nshould be careful about what they ask for because they might get it. \nThat is what happened yesterday.\n  Here we are today, back on the Billy Dale bill, and their excuse for \nfilibustering is still the minimum wage. Given the political \ntransparency of this filibuster, I hope our colleagues will get \ntogether to do the decent and honorable thing and pass this important \nmeasure.\n  Let me say, I think it is almost unseemly my friends on the other \nside are saying we just want the minimum wage bill and you Republicans \nshould not do anything else because we want this and we have a \npolitical advantage in talking about it. That is not the way it works \naround here. Of course, we are able to ask the majority, combined other \ngood bill aspects, to make this bill even more perfect. Frankly, the \nrepeal of the gas tax would do that. It will make it more perfect. The \nTEAM Act bill would certainly be more fair to employees throughout \nAmerica, more fair to businesses throughout America, more fair in \nbringing economic cooperation among them, without interfering with the \ncollective bargaining process. The NLRB is very capable of making sure \nthat management does not abuse that problem.\n  For the life of me, I cannot see one valid or good argument about it. \nBringing what happened in Eastern Europe does not necessarily cut the \nmustard here in America, where we have the most protective labor laws \nin the world. Rightly so. I have worked with those laws for years, long \nbefore I came to the Senate, and, of course, as former ranking member \nand chairman of the Labor Committee, worked with them during that \nperiod of time as well.\n\n  Mr. President, all of that aside, those are hollow arguments with \nregard to holding up this bill. I hope my colleagues on the other side \nare willing to vote for cloture so that we can pass the Billy Dale bill \nand go on from there, then face the minimum wage, the TEAM Act, gas tax \nreduction, and go on from there and do what is right.\n  The bottom line is that the minimum wage bill is controversial, \nshould not be attached to a bill that has broad bipartisan support, \nthat the President has said he will sign and support and that will \nright some tremendous wrongs that need to be righted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 52 seconds remaining.\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send an amendment to the desk, which is the text of the \ngas tax repeal, with the minimum wage language suggested by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, and the TEAM Act, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3960 to amendment No. 3955, to the instructions of \n     the motion to refer.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, yesterday we discussed how we might resolve \nthe issues at hand. So now we have an opportunity for all Members to \nrepeal the gas tax, which I think has broad support, probably 80 votes, \nto adopt the minimum wage suggested by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, 45 cents July 1 this year, 45 cents next July, and then \nadopt this small provision on the TEAM Act, which means that in America \nemployees can talk to management, which I thought was sort of the \nAmerican way. We are prepared to vote on the whole package right now. \nIt would also reimburse Billy Dale and others who incurred legal \nexpenses because of charges brought against them.\n  I should like to take this opportunity to support the Teamwork for \nEmployees and Management Act. I think my colleague, the chairman of the \nLabor Committee, is in the Chamber, and she will be addressing that \nlater.\n  It is hard to believe that in 1996, Federal laws tell employers and \nemployees that they cannot work together in cooperative teams to \njointly resolve issues of concern in the workplace. Since 1992, the \nNational Labor Relations Act of 1935 has been interpreted to prohibit \nforms of collaborative discussions between groups of employees and \nmanagement that deal with key issues such as workplace safety, \nproductivity rewards and benefits, and job descriptions.\n  Does that make sense? No. And it does not make sense to most \nAmericans. The TEAM Act simply allows common sense to reign in the \nworkplace. Employees and employers can and should be able to resolve \nworkplace issues among themselves without the fear of lawsuits.\n  So, why is the other side so exercised by this commonsense effort to \nhelp employees? Because of the big labor bosses. They see any effort to \nimprove the workplace environment without their involvement as a \nthreat. In other words, they do not want the employees to come up with \nany idea unless it goes through the labor bosses.\n  Suddenly, the minimum wage is not at all that important because \nsomewhere, someplace, some employee might have an idea that improves \nproductivity, that makes the workplace safer, all without the blessing \nof the labor bosses. So that is what this debate is all about. I am not \ncertain, many of the employees even--in fact, I understand that some \nemployees came to lobby people on the TEAM Act and they were asked what \nit was and they did not know what it was. Once it was explained to \nthem, they did not see much wrong with it.\n  It might occur to some employee that he or she does not need a labor \nboss, that he or she can be their own boss. So, it is all about power. \nIt is not about politics, it is about power. It is about contributions. \nIt is about power. I think it is time we pass this package, increase \nthe minimum wage, repeal the gas tax.\n  Yesterday at midnight tax freedom day ended. I hope that workers can \nhave some control over their lives and workplace, the conditions in the \nworkplace. I believe we ought to do everything we can to encourage this \nrelationship, talking back and forth. We do it here from time to time. \nSometimes we are able to work things out by talking to each other. If \nwe cannot talk to each other, if employees cannot talk to management, I \ndo not see how anything can be worked out.\n  In fact, President Clinton used to think so, too. I never cease to be \namazed about how he can shift his positions, but even on this issue he \nhad a position. In his State of the Union Address last January \nPresident Clinton said, ``When companies and workers work as a team, \nthey do better--and so does America.''\n  Let me repeat that, because many people probably forgot that \nPresident Clinton said that. I bet he has forgotten that he said it. \n``When companies and workers work as a team, they do better--and so \ndoes America.'' That is all the TEAM Act is. We have taken what \nPresident Clinton said in the State of the Union Message and drafted it \nso it is now a statute. So it is a Clinton provision, really, the TEAM \nAct. If President Clinton was right then, he is right now.\n  So what happened between January and May? The labor bosses called in\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nand contributed $35 million. That is one thing that happened. I do not \nknow what else happened. They may have also spent millions on \ntelevision, attacking Republicans on Medicare and everything you can \nthink of. A lot of the workers are now having their dues increased who \nmay not want to participate in that process, who may want to vote for \nsomebody else. They cannot be dictated to, anymore than we can dictate \nto anybody.\n\n  So, it seems to us that we have an issue here now. We are all set. We \nhave accepted the minimum wage offer. We have accepted what the \nAmerican people want; that is, repealing the gas tax, 4.3 cents, $4.8 \nbillion a year. We pay for it. It does not add to the deficit.\n  But now we are hung up on whether or not we ought to focus on the \nAmerican worker. If that worker has an idea, should that worker be able \nto go to his employer, or be with a group of workers? Apparently, my \ncolleagues on the other side say you cannot do that in America, you \ncannot talk to each other. Employees cannot talk to employers. It does \nnot interfere with the activities unions already have established in \ncompanies, and it leaves in place protection against sham unions. It \nsimply extends to nonunion workers the rights union workers already \nhave, to have an effective voice for change in the workplace.\n  So it seems to me that we have an opportunity here, now, to move this \nlegislation forward. We are obviously not going to get cloture on the \nBilly Dale, the underlying bill. It was hoped that this amendment might \nbe an incentive for everybody to move forward, end the gridlock. It \nused to be called gridlock by the liberal press when Republicans were \nholding up things, but I have not seen the word ``gridlock'' used by \nthe liberal media in the past 15 months. They cannot spell it anymore, \nthe 89 percent of those who cover us who voted for President Clinton.\n  But it is gridlock. We have had to file 63 cloture motions this year \nin an effort to move the Senate forward. Since it takes 60 votes and we \nonly have 53, it is rather difficult. But I know the Washington Post \nwill figure out somewhere to come down on the right side, the side of \nthe liberals. So will the New York Times. So will the L.A. Times. So \nwill the other liberal papers.\n  But this is an argument about workers, maybe some who work at the \nWashington Post; maybe they do not cover the Hill. Maybe some who work \nfor the Washington Times; maybe they do not cover politics. This is \nabout workers and it is about power and it is about power of the labor \nbosses. That is what this is about. I do not care how they report it, \nthe word will go to the workers that we are prepared to say they have a \nright to talk. They can talk for themselves. They can exercise their \nfirst amendment rights. They do not give up their rights to free speech \nor to engage in discussion when they join a labor union.\n\n  So, it seems to me we have a package here that should be \nirresistible. If, in fact, the Senator from Massachusetts is serious \nabout the minimum wage and if, in fact, those of us on both sides are \nserious about repealing the gas tax, as we are, this bill can be passed \nby noon and be on its way to the House. I think the Speaker would act \nexpeditiously. It is going to take a while, July 1, the first increase \nin minimum wage--it is going to take a while to implement it to make \nall those things happen. It will take a while for the gas tax repeal to \nbe implemented.\n  So, I hope that we can proceed, get an agreement, say an hour on each \nside. I ask unanimous consent that there be an hour on each side, that \neach side have 1 hour, there be no intervening amendments, and then we \ncan proceed to vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Two hours? Two hours on each side?\n  Apparently there must be something other than the time that is the \nproblem on the other side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kansas yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. For a question. Does the Senator from Kansas anticipate \nhe will not allow an amendment on the gas tax proposal to make sure the \nconsumers get the benefit of a gas tax reduction? My understanding is \nthe request the majority leader made would preclude any amendments to \nbe offered on the gas tax reduction issue; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOLE. We have a provision in the gas tax proposal that requires \nthat a study has to be completed and that mandates that the savings go \nto the consumer. I do not know how--I would be happy to look at the \namendment. In fact, we could probably agree on it. We have gone so far \nas to say if we get cloture on the amendment, we could have a separate \nvote on TEAM Act, so all my colleagues on that side could protect \nthemselves and vote against it. We could vote for it. We have minimum \nwage, where I think some on each side are not certain how they are \ngoing to vote. So we would have a separate vote on minimum wage and a \nseparate vote on TEAM Act. If we could agree now to have a cloture vote \non the amendment without waiting until Friday, and get 60 votes on \ncloture, then we could have a separate vote on each. Some of my \ncolleagues would probably like to vote against some portion of it; I do \nnot know which. That would seem to be even going the extra mile.\n\n  I do not know how we can put into law, how we are going to mandate \nthat in every, every, every case. I do not know how many thousands of \nservice stations there are in America, but there are millions of people \nout there who buy gasoline. I do not know how we are going to make \ncertain that that 4.3 cents goes into the pocket of the consumer.\n  The service station operators will tell you that is going to happen. \nWe hope to have letters today from their national association. I have \nhad some tell me personally that is going to happen. They know their \ncustomers. In most cases they are regular customers. They want to keep \nthose customers. It is all a good-faith business practice.\n  But if the Senator had some idea on how we can adopt some language \nthat is going to make certain it happens, we would certainly be pleased \nto look at it. Or if there are other amendments that deal with the \nminimum wage, we would be happy to look at that. Since it is the \nminimum wage package of the Senator from Massachusetts, I do not think \nhe would want to amend it.\n  So, Mr. President, if I can just suggest the absence of a quorum----\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. Excuse me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we go into a quorum, if I could \njust respond to the distinguished majority leader. I guess I begin by \nsaying, here we go again. Once again, the Republicans have put together \na package that they know will go nowhere.\n  We have one of two choices here. We can pass legislation, or we can \nplay games. If this package is good, let us get a little bit more \nelaborate, more inventive. How about adding campaign finance reform? \nWhy not add MFN for China? Let us add the budget. How about a peace \ntreaty? There may be something in there we could deal with as well. Let \nus put it all in and pass it in one vote. That seems to be the practice \naround here these days: Load it up, no amendments, no debate and that \nis it. ``We're telling you, you have to do it this way or there's not \ngoing to be anything at all.''\n  Mr. President, that is unacceptable. They would not have stood for it \n2 years ago and we cannot stand for it now. We have suggested a way \nwith which to resolve our outstanding differences here procedurally. We \nought to have an up-or-down vote on minimum wage.\n  We are prepared to have a good debate about the TEAM Act, and I want \nto touch on that in just a minute.\n  We are prepared to have a debate about gas taxes, but we want to make \nabsolutely certain that the benefit goes to the consumer, and if we \ncannot figure out a way to do that, then maybe we should not do it at \nall. It seems to me that if we cannot guarantee the consumer is going \nto benefit--and there is a pretty good possibility that they will not \nbenefit if you read the papers again this morning--then we will not be \nproviding the relief we claim to be providing in this proposal. We can \nlash out against the press, we can lash out against labor if we want \nto, but the\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nfact is the arguments ought to be debated and we ought to make some \ndecisions. We ought to have some understanding of whether or not this \nis going to work before we do it. That is really what the amendment \nprocess is all about, to have a good-faith debate and some \nopportunities to discuss these important matters.\n  The distinguished majority leader noted that he has had to file \ncloture a few times. Well, I must say, when you load up the tree and \ndeny opportunities for Democrats to have votes on amendments that we \ncare about, I really do not know what option we have. We are not trying \nto prevent legislation from being considered. In fact, in the last \nweek, there were two examples where we worked through our differences \nas soon as we were allowed to offer amendments. The immigration bill \nand the Presidio bill both passed because we wanted to work with the \nmajority to pass them. We did not want to hold up those bills. But we \nwanted the right to offer amendments.\n  And that is true, again. We have no desire to hold up the gas tax \nbill. We will have some good debate about it. We want to get this \nminimum wage issue behind us. We have a whole agenda. We have not \ntalked yet about pensions, and we are going to talk a lot more about \npensions in the balance of this year. We have not talked about losing \njobs overseas, an amendment the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nis talking about. We want to do a little bit of that.\n  And if we are not resolved on this health care bill pretty soon, we \nare going to be bringing that up in the form of an amendment. So we \nwill have a lot of action agenda items, a lot of issues we care deeply \nabout that we want to offer and have a good debate about.\n  Now, as to the TEAM Act, let me just say, Mr. President, I listened \ncarefully to the majority leader. He said all we want is the right for \nemployers and employees to be able to talk together. If that is all \nthey want, they ought to be satisfied with current law.\n  Ninety-six percent of large companies today have employee involvement \nprograms. Seventy-five percent of all workplaces already have programs \nwhere employers and employees work together, and guess what? The only \nissues on which they cannot make agreements with employees are \nmandatory bargaining issues such as hours and wages. Furthermore, if \nthey violate what the National Labor Relations Board and the law \nrequires with regard to what is legitimate consultation and what is \nactual negotiations with labor on issues involving pensions or security \nissues or work issues or wages, there is no penalty, there is no \npenalty at all. They must only disband the committee that has violated \nthe law.\n  So workers are encouraged to work through their problems with \nemployees through the arrangements that are set up right now under \ncurrent law.\n  What the Republicans want to do is roll back 60 years of labor law. \nThey want to be able to allow companies to set up rump organizations to \nnegotiate with themselves. It is like the father asking the son-in-law \nto negotiate on behalf of the employees and to come up with a plan the \nemployees are supposed to accept as fact in that workplace.\n  That is unacceptable. But we ought to have a debate about it. We \nought to decide whether or not we want to roll back 60 years of labor \nlaw. This may be one of the most antiworker Congresses we have seen in \ndecades--blocking an increase in the minimum wage, fighting health \ncare, and now rolling back labor law that protects workers. We are not \nin any way, shape or form opposed to good discussions and good \nnegotiations and good opportunities for employers and employees to work \nout their differences. That should be a fact. It is a fact in 96 \npercent of large corporations. But we will not tolerate rump \norganizations negotiating with companies in the name of labor and \ncalling that some advancement in the workplace.\n  So, Mr. President, we ought to have an opportunity to debate it. We \nought to have an opportunity to offer amendments. We ought to have some \nup-or-down votes. That is what the Senate is made for. That is what we \nhave always done. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. You cannot yield the floor except to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Dakota yield to \nthe Senator from North Dakota for a question only?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from South Dakota, I \nheard this discussion about delay and stalling. Is it not the case that \nin a couple recent occasions, just in recent weeks, we have seen \nlegislation filed in the Senate and a cloture motion filed on the bill \nthat was before the Senate before debate began on the legislation? In \nother words, a motion to shut off debate before debate began on two \npieces of legislation in the last several weeks; is that not the case?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct. A bill is filed, a \nbill is proposed; the amendment tree is completely filled; and cloture \nis filed. It is a pattern now that has been the practice here for the \nlast several weeks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one further question. I \nguess what I observe about that is that it is hardly stalling to \nsuggest there ought to be some debate on legislation. Filing a cloture \nmotion to cut off debate before debate begins is apparently a new way \nto legislate but not, in my judgment, a very thoughtful way to \nlegislate.\n  I ask the Senator one additional question. In this morning's \nnewspaper there is a story that says ``Experts Say Gas Tax Wouldn't \nReach the Pumps.'' It quotes a number of experts. One of the experts \nsays, and I would like to ask you a question about this:\n\n       The Republican-sponsored solution to the current fuels \n     problem . . . is nothing more and nothing less than a \n     refiners' benefit bill . . . It will transfer upwards of $3 \n     billion from the U.S. Treasury to the pockets of refiners and \n     gasoline marketers.\n\n  My question is, does the Senator from South Dakota believe, when we \ndeal with the issue of reducing the gas tax by 4.3 cents, that we ought \nto be able to offer some amendments on the floor to make darn sure that \nit goes in the right pocket?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. That is all we want to do here. \nWe want to have an opportunity to debate the issue, to offer amendments \nto provide assurance to the consumer and taxpayer that we are simply \nnot asking the taxpayers to bail out the oil companies with a $4 \nbillion bailout this year. That is what it could mean if we are not \ncareful about how this is handled.\n  Everybody ought to understand that if we do not have the assurance, \nand it is going to take more than a study to give us that assurance, if \nwe do not have the assurance, what this means. I heard the majority \nleader talk about power and contributions, I do not know what power and \ncontribution connections there may be with the gas tax, but I will tell \nyou this, that it is a $4 billion bailout this country cannot afford \nif, indeed, the result of repeal of the gas tax is $4 billion in \nadditional profits for the oil companies.\n  We ought to work through this, and if we can do that, I am sure there \nis not going to be a problem with regard to providing that assurance to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is a very brief question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Listening to the Senator talk about \nthe distinction between games and moving this forward, am I correct \nthat the Senator is saying, the minority leader is saying that we ought \nto have the opportunity to have amendments and debate on these issues, \nlegitimate debate, and then have separate votes on the wisdom of \nenacting all three bills, whether it be minimum wage, whether it be \nTEAM, or whether it be a repeal of the gas tax, that that is what we \nare aiming for, that we want to have an opportunity for amendments and \nwe want to address each bill in turn?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Consider each one separately, so all of us are \naccountable, no putting different kinds of combinations together, no \nconfusion for people,\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\nno blurring distinctions, just straightforward accountability to people \nin the country as to where we stand. Is that what the Senator is \nproposing?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right. That is \nhow we do things around here. We provide opportunities for Senators to \noffer to bills amendments that are legitimate questions of public \npolicy. That is all we are suggesting here. That is why we offered the \nminimum wage in the first place. When we first offered it, we said, \n``Look, we prefer to have the independent freestanding vote.'' If we \ncannot do that, obviously, we will offer it as an amendment. If we \nstart packaging all these disparate issues together, then I think it is \nfair to ask why not add campaign finance reform and MFN for China and a \nwhole range of other things we might want to debate some time this \nyear.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a question for Senator Daschle. That is, as I \nunderstand the National Labor Relations Act as it exists now and as \nproposed in the TEAM Act, is that the TEAM Act would apply not only to \nthe 13 million workers who are organized, but it applies to about the \n107 million American workers that are in the workplace as well, and \nthat the Senator might agree with me that effectively what we are \ntalking about is company unions replacing legitimate collective \nbargaining appearing by workers pursuing their own interests.\n  Is that the effect of the TEAM Act?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct, that is the effect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator concerned that, as he pointed out, part \nof a whole process evidently against working families, where we have \nhad the repeal of some of the EITC, the opposition to the minimum wage, \nthe undermining of the OSHA Act, and feel that this would be a further \nreduction in the protections for American workers, and that they may, \nif this legislation goes into effect, be further left out and left \nbehind in the modern economy?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Let me just say that there is this perception sometimes created by \nsome of our colleagues on the other side that efforts to protect \nworkers somehow automatically position you against business. We ought \nto be for business, probusiness, just as this administration has shown \nitself to be with so many of its policies.\n  Business has never had a better 3-year period than they have had in \nthe last 3 years. We have seen growth in this economy. The stock market \nhas boomed to levels we never dreamed of a couple of years ago. Export \nsales are up. Everything is going exceedingly well. This economy is as \nstrong as it has been almost in my lifetime. So this administration has \nbeen probusiness. There are a lot of things we have proposed that are \nprobusiness, but we ought to say probusiness also ought to mean \nproworker, making sure that not only corporate executives benefit from \nthis wonderful growth in the economy, but the workers do, too: that the \nworkers have a chance to benefit, whether it is in health care, a good \npaycheck, or retirement security. Those kinds of things ought to be \npart of the overall economic agenda here so that we do not see the \nstratification within our economy that we are seeing right now.\n  Be probusiness and proworker. If we do that, I think we can look \nforward to a lot stronger economy and a lot more blessings for all the \nAmerican people than we have had in the last couple of years.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we would certainly be agreeable we could \nhave three separate votes, gas tax repeal, TEAM Act, minimum wage. In \nfact, we are prepared, if cloture is invoked, to have three separate \nvotes. We cannot get agreement to have three separate votes. So they \nwill have to filibuster gas tax repeal and increase in minimum wage \nbecause of the one deal that upsets the labor bosses. That is certainly \na right they have.\n  Somehow the Washington Post and other papers will figure out some way \nto make it sound good, but the facts are the facts. We are prepared to \nmove right now. The Senator from Massachusetts said on the floor, and I \nhave his quotes here, a couple of times he only needs 30 minutes on the \nminimum wage. We will have 30 minutes on that, 30 minutes on TEAM Act, \nand 30 minutes on gas tax. That is an hour and a half equally divided, \nand then we can vote.\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota has some amendment, if he has figured \nout a way to make certain that in every single case the 4.3 cents will \ngo back to the consumer, maybe have to station a policeman at each \nservice station, or a Federal employee, that would be one way to do it. \nI am not certain what he has in mind.\n  The bottom line is we are prepared to take action. So now we have on \nthis floor the minority saying we will not let you do anything unless \nyou do it our way. We want to do it our way, and even though you are \nthe majority, you do it our way. As I said, I had a little trouble \nexplaining that to my policy luncheon yesterday. They said if they can \nhave their way, why can we not have our way? My view is why not \neverybody have their way? We will have a separate vote on minimum wage, \na separate vote on gas tax repeal, and a separate vote on TEAM Act. It \nseems fair and reasonable to me.\n  I hope that will be the resolution. If there are amendments that \nshould be offered, we have always been able to work out reasonable \namendments. But that is not the thrust coming from the other side. The \nthrust is they will raise this, the experts say maybe the 4.3 cents \nwill not get back to the consumer and this is somehow antiworker, it is \nantiboss, it is antilabor boss, it is proworker.\n  Again, let me quote the President of the United States who said in \nthe State of the Union Message last January, ``When companies and \nworkers work as a team they do better and so does America.''\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not right now.\n  We are prepared to accept the President--in fact, the Senator from \nKansas, Senator Kassebaum, chairman of the Labor Committee really \nunderstands the TEAM Act--and explain how this statement by the \nPresident sort of underscores and supports what we are trying to do \nhere today.\n  We have the support of the President, apparently, on the minimum wage \nand on TEAM Act. I do not know where he is on the gas tax repeal.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just so we can bring this matter to a head, \nI send a cloture motion to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending Dole \n     amendment, No. 3960:\n         Bob Dole, Orrin Hatch, John Warner, Trent Lott, Thad \n           Cochran, Slade Gorton, Phil Gramm, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Connie Mack, Strom Thurmond, Dan Coats, \n           Craig Thomas, Dirk Kempthorne, Jesse Helms, Bob Smith, \n           Jim Jeffords.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, the cloture vote occur at 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 9, the \nmandatory quorum being waived and the time between now and 5 p.m., \nThursday, be equally divided in the usual form for debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. So the cloture vote will occur on Friday, but I ask \nunanimous consent at this time if cloture is invoked on amendment 3960, \nthe amendment be automatically divided, with division I being the gas \ntax issue, division II being the TEAM Act, and division III being the \nproposal for minimum wage, and the time on each division be limited to \n2 hours each, equally divided in the usual form, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on \ndivision I, division II, and division III, back to back, with no \nfurther motions in order prior to the disposition of each division.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the unanimous-consent agreement also include campaign finance \nreform and MFN.\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  Mr. DOLE. Objection to this.\n  So, we will have a cloture vote, then, on Friday, if not before. If \nthere are amendments, we always try to accommodate our colleagues.\n  I learned about how you introduce and file cloture by my friend, the \nformer majority leader, Senator Mitchell. I thought it was very \neffective. I made notes at that time.\n  Mr. FORD. Fill the tree.\n  Mr. DOLE. We do not have it down to the art he had it down to, but we \nwant to tell the press how to spell ``gridlock,'' something they used \nextensively when we were in the minority. You never see the word. \nSuddenly the word has disappeared. This is gridlock. This is Democratic \ngridlock, because the labor bosses do not want this to happen. And he \nwho controls the purse I guess controls the agenda. We will see what \nhappens in the next few days.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. The Democratic leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond briefly. I know a lot \nof our colleagues want to be able to speak.\n  This is unnecessary gridlock. This has nothing to do with the \nDemocratic minority. This has everything to do with Republicans simply \nnot allowing the Senate to be the Senate. I do not recall a time--and \nwe can go back and check--when my predecessor, Senator Mitchell, filled \nthe tree every single time a bill was presented on the floor. I would \nlike to go back and find that time in the last Congress when that \nhappened.\n  I can recall, woefully, how many times we worried about Republican \namendments and how we were going to come up with second-degree \namendments because we were not going to stop them from being offered. \nAnd they were offered.\n  So, Mr. President, we have different views about what happened in the \nlast Congress. I will tell my colleagues on the other side, we are \ntaking notes, and should we have the opportunity again--and I know we \nwill--to be in the majority, what goes around comes around. It may be \nthat we are going to have to extend the session of Congress to 4 years \nrather than just 2, because I am not sure we are going to get anything \ndone in 2 anymore. How unfortunate. How unfortunate.\n  This does not have to be gridlock. We did not want gridlock. Just \nlast week we passed some good legislation. We can do that again. We \nought to do that again, but we ought to be respectful of the minority \nand the opportunities that we have always had to offer amendments. That \nis all we are asking. In the name of fairness, in the name of \ntradition, in the name of this institution, we owe it to the American \npeople to have these reasonable and fair debates.\n  The majority leader offered a unanimous-consent to have up-or-down \nvotes on amendments collectively to a bill that he knows is going \nnowhere. What we have said is, let us have independent votes, free of \nthe opportunity to obfuscate these issues, opportunities to offer \namendments, opportunities to ensure that we can have a good debate \nabout each of these issues--no limits, no filled trees, simply a good, \nold-fashioned Senate debate about all the issues that the majority \nleader and I and others want to confront.\n  So as soon as that happens, I have a feeling we can get a lot of work \ndone. But until that happens, nothing will get done.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to inquire of the Senator from South Dakota, \nhaving listened with great interest to the presentation by the Senator \nfrom Kansas, which was an interesting political presentation but a \npresentation that complained that there was stalling and gridlock in \nthe Senate, first, and then a second presentation that concluded with a \ncloture motion being filed to shut off debate on something where debate \nhas not yet started, I guess the presumption is that we are pieces of \nfurniture on this side of the aisle, we are not living, contributing \nSenators that are interested in legislation. But we are more than \nfurniture. We have a passionate agenda that we care deeply about.\n\n  I guess I am confused by someone who alleges that there is stalling \nand then files a cloture motion to shut off debate before debate \nbegins. What on Earth kind of process is this? It does not make any \nsense.\n  I ask the Senator if he finds it unusual that we have a circumstance \nwhere the majority leader and others come out and they offer a \nproposition to fill up the tree so that no one else can intervene with \namendments and then claim somehow that somebody else is causing their \nproblems. Is it not true they are causing their own problems?\n  The way the Senate ought to do its business is to come and offer \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate, in a regular way, and ask for \nthose who want to amend it to offer their amendments, have up-or-down \nvotes, and then see if the votes exist to pass legislation. But instead \nwe have these parliamentary games, and then we have this pointing \nacross the aisle to say, ``By the way, you're the cause of this,'' and \nthen the filing of a cloture motion to shut off debate before debate \nbegins. Apparently, it is a new way to run the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Apparently the Senator is right. That is the essence of \nthe problem we have here. It is why we are absolutely paralyzed until \nwe can resolve it. All we are trying to do is have the opportunity to \nhave a good debate about each of these issues.\n  We can debate the TEAM Act. We are not averse to having a good old-\nfashioned debate about whether you roll back 60 years of labor law. We \ncan debate the gas tax and figure out whether there is a way to address \nthe issue that the Senator from North Dakota and others have raised \nabout making sure the consumer, and not the oil companies, get the \nbenefit.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We can debate the minimum wage for whatever length of \ntime we want. A half-hour is fine with us, but if they want more time, \nwe can do that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to my colleague on my side, the \nSenator from Louisiana, and then to the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the distinguished minority leader for yielding.\n  There has been some negotiation and talks on the floor about votes on \nthese three different issues. I just want to ask the leader whether he \nhas had any discussion about packaging the three, because I do not \npropose, myself, to allow that, except to the extent the rules allow \nit, for a vote to come up on this gasoline tax, because I think that is \none of the wackiest ideas I have heard. To the extent that we can \nsuccessfully filibuster, yes, filibuster. Call it gridlock, call it \nwhat you want. I am opposed to it. I am not willing to let that come \nup. I think there are a lot of people who feel like I do.\n  I wonder if there has been any negotiation toward saying, ``Well, \nwe'll let you have that on a majority vote as opposed to 60 votes, as \nlong as you will allow a vote on minimum wage''?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There have been a lot of different discussions regarding \nvarious packages and various scenarios, and it is obvious from the \nexchanges this morning that no decisions and certainly no agreement has \nbeen reached.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend. I was trying to seek the floor in my own \nright. I would ask a question.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate very much the distinguished Senator \nyielding to me for a question. My question is, when I heard your \ndiscussion of the unanimous-consent request propounded by the \nRepublican leader, there seemed to be--is this correct--the complaint \nthat the minimum wage issue is something that had not been scheduled \nand, therefore, this was an issue that needed to be scheduled and have \na full debate, and we had to have votes.\n\n  My question is, why were there not debates and why were there not \nvotes\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nwhen the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate and in the House \nand in the administration for the 2 years in the previous Congress?\n  We never had an amendment offered by a Democrat, we never had a bill \noffered by a Democrat, and we never had a unanimous-consent request on \nthe floor propounded by the Democratic leader on that issue. Now, on \nanother unrelated issue, we have to stop now and cannot proceed to take \nup anything because of the request being made on the Senator's side \nthat there be an immediate debate and a vote on a minimum wage proposal \nthat has never been to committee and never had any hearings in either \nthe last Congress or this Congress. All of a sudden the facts are \noverwhelming that this is something that has to be done right now. Why \nis that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am so blessed that the Senator from Mississippi asked \nthe question. I was hoping that one of my colleagues would ask it, \nbecause obviously it is an issue that has come up before.\n  We made a very calculated decision in the beginning of the last \nCongress that we were not going to be able to do both health care and \nthe minimum wage. Obviously, if we could have done both and had the \nagreement of our Republican colleagues to do both, we would very much \nhave wanted to be able to do that. But we decided that at best--at \nbest--we were going to be able to pass a bill that does a lot more than \n90 cents for the American worker.\n  So what we decided to do--and people could accuse us of being \nconservative here and not wanting to do both--but what we decided to \ndo, in a conservative approach to our agenda, was to say, ``Look, we'll \ntake this one step at a time. Let's pass health care. Let's find a way \nto deal with health care that will affect every one of our workers in a \nmonetary, as well as a personal way.'' That is what we decided to do.\n  Unfortunately, because of the opposition of our colleagues on the \nother side, we could not even pass benefits for our workers for health \ncare in the last Congress. So we are relegated now to the Kennedy-\nKassebaum bill, and we may not even pass that, given the insistence by \nsome on the other side to add unrelated and very devastating provisions \nto this bill that would deny the American worker some opportunity for \nbenefit. So that is the answer to my colleague and good friend from \nMississippi.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, let me suggest that it appears to this \nveteran of 18 years in the U.S. Senate and, before that, 8 years as \nGovernor of Nebraska, that this place is more off balance than any \nsupposed representative body that I have ever witnessed. To put it \nbluntly, it has gone bonkers.\n  Here we have a group of supposedly thoughtful and mature men and \nwomen wallowing in politics, throwing aside what is right for America, \nin a seizure of fiscal madness, at the very time we are about to vote \non a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  No one--no one--in this body has been more intent on amending the \nConstitution to require a balanced budget. But the irresponsible bed \nthat we are making, and the grandiose plans for what represents fiscal \nbalance down the road, is so fraught with craziness that I am \nreconsidering my support.\n  I am very concerned that the recent political circus, with more than \nthree rings, designed to present ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' and \nprove beyond a doubt that there is ``a sucker born every minute,'' will \ngo down in history as one of the most shameful exercises in the history \nof the Senate. This year, 1996, could go down as the year that we deep-\nsixed the people under a guise of fiscal sanity that is, in reality, \ninsanity.\n  Mr. President, America deserves better. Unfortunately, the \nringmasters of all of this are the Republican majority leadership in \nthe House and the Senate. The Republican majority leader in the House \neven suggested making up the billions in lost revenue by reducing \neducation funding even more than the Republicans have previously \nannounced. That will not fly.\n  The Senate majority leader, 20 points behind in the race for the \nPresidency, has come up with a gimmick to reduce the gas tax by 4.3 \ncents, which would cost the Treasury $34 billion in revenue by the \nmagical year 2002, when we are already far short of any attainable goal \nto meet the constitutionally guaranteed balance by that date.\n\n  It is politics at its worst. Sooner or later, the American people \nwill see it for what it is, if they have not already.\n  I call on the Republican leadership to announce that they have come \nto their senses and renounce their fiscal indiscretion, and get on with \nbalancing the budget, passing a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, and putting the campaign back on a sane course.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported a balanced Federal budget and a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I used to think that if \nyou favored one, you almost had to support the other. But I have to \nadmit that the antics around here on the gas tax have caused me to \nquestion whether people who favor a balanced budget amendment in \nspeeches really do want to balance the budget at all.\n  You hear all of these pious speeches about how we want to balance the \nbudget. I suggest that if we had a dollar for every speech in the \nSenate that favored a balanced budget, we would have reached a surplus \na long time ago.\n  But then comes along a year divisible by 4, and all of a sudden \nSenators are falling over themselves to cut taxes. I heard one Senator \nsay this was not the first tax that he would cut, but, heck, it was an \nopportunity to cut taxes, and he was not going to miss it. It is a \ntransparent political ploy, Mr. President, and this Senator, for one, \nhas had about enough of it.\n  Repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax is a costly enterprise. Between June \nof this year and the end of the year 2002, it would cost $34 billion in \nlost revenue, and it would worsen the deficit by the year 2005 to $52 \nbillion. Yes, I say, ``worsen the deficit,'' because the offset that \nthe majority cobbles together to pay for the tax cut will, in all \nlikelihood, be something we were already counting on, or desperately \nneed, to help balance the budget by the year 2002 under a \nconstitutional amendment. One way or the other, we are going to have to \ncome up with another $52 billion in additional deficit reduction, or \nincrease taxes, over the next 10 years. I suggest, Mr. President, that \nthat will not be easy.\n  As I said when I started these remarks, this whole gas tax charade \nhas made me reconsider the sincerity of the debate that I have heard \nabout the balanced budget amendment. The willingness of Senators and \nCongressmen to rush headlong to cut the gas tax makes me question \nwhether I want to be a part of an enterprise that promises to balance \nthe budget down the road but avoids every hard vote to cut the deficit \nin the here and now.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that I will consider very \nclosely and see how Senators vote on the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. I certainly feel that, as of now, the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution that I voted for previously, and \nsupported, needs to be examined as to how Senators vote and how sincere \nthey are, which will be keenly measured, I suggest, on the gimmick of \nrepeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. If people vote to cut taxes with wild \nabandon and then ask me to join them in support of a balanced budget \namendment, they may find this Senator unwilling to go down that crooked \nroad of no return.\n  The people should understand that if the tax cut proposed by the \nSenate majority is followed with a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002, the Congress at that time will face, by \nfar, the largest tax increase ever imagined in history.\n  I do not want a small tax cut now that probably would trigger and \nfind its way into higher taxes in the future. In this regard, I must \nalso say that even if the Senate and the House would invoke a law that \neliminates that tax, there is no assurance whatsoever, or likelihood, \nthat the money would end up in the consumers' pockets. It would end up \nelsewhere. Unless someone can rationally explain to me how the numbers \nwork out on this, I will not vote again for a constitutional amendment \nunder the Republicans' changed scenario.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n  In my view, Mr. President, as a fiscal conservative it would be the \nheight of fiscal and budget irresponsibility to do so.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I tried to be recognized earlier \nbecause I wanted to ask the distinguished minority leader a question \nwhen he was on the floor talking about the TEAM Act. I find it hard to \nthink that the people of South Dakota would not be very supportive of \nthe ability to have employers and employees form teams in which they \ncan talk about conditions in their own company. These teams clearly \nwill enhance the quality of work, the quality of working relationships, \nand the productivity of the company.\n  I think there is broad support for that. The distinguished majority \nleader indicated that President Clinton in the State of the Union \nspeech mentioned the importance of working together as a team and how \nthat enhances the productivity and the competitiveness of American \nindustry. We all know how important that is today.\n  The other side of the aisle suggests that the TEAM Act permits sham \nunions. That is not correct, Mr. President. The legislation does not \npermit sham unions in any way.\n  The question was raised, why do we need the legislation? I would \nsuggest that one of the reasons we need the TEAM Act is that we need \nclarity regarding the barriers in Federal labor law regarding worker \nand management cooperation.\n  William Gould, who was appointed Chairman of the National Labor \nRelations Board in 1994 by President Clinton, made the following \nstatement on employee involvement to a seminar at Indiana University \nSchool of Law on February 29, 1996. I want to state that Chairman Gould \nis opposed to the TEAM Act, but he did say that although he opposed it, \nhe does feel that an amendment to section 8(a)(2) is necessary to \npromote employee involvement. He said:\n\n       Nonetheless, as I wrote three years ago an agenda for \n     reform, a revision of 8(a)(2) is desirable. The difficulties \n     involved in determining what constitutes a labor organization \n     under the act as written subjects employees and employers to \n     unnecessary and wasteful litigation, and mandates lay people \n     to employ counsel when they are only attempting to promote \n     dialog and enhanced participation and cooperation.\n\n  Mr. President, I can think of no more effective statement than that \nof the Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board.\n  This is not a question of wanting to roll back 60 years of labor law; \nnot at all. It is really designed to enhance labor law so that we can \nenter a new century and a new time in the strongest, most productive \nfashion. And it is only common sense, Mr. President, that would say \nemployers and employees should be able to sit down at the table and \nreason together. This is not an effort to do away with unions. It is an \neffort to bring some clarity to section 8(a)(2), as was mentioned by \nChairman Gould, so that there can be an understanding of what indeed \nconstitutes, or does not constitute, a violation of Federal labor law.\n  I would just suggest, Mr. President, that workers know their jobs \nbetter than anyone else. They are the ones who are there day in and day \nout listening to customers, making a product, and delivering it to \nclients. Their contributions improve productivity, reduce environmental \nwaste, increase quality, and perhaps most important raise job \nsatisfaction. Participation means that there is a commitment then to \nthe success of that company. Yet Federal labor laws have stood in the \nway of unleashing, I suggest because of this lack of charity, a vast \nreservoir of human capital in America's workplaces.\n  Yesterday there was I thought an exceptionally good exchange, and an \nelaboration of why the TEAM Act is important, between the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Jeffords] and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft]. \nJust to quote from Mr. Ashcroft briefly:\n\n       More importantly than trying to strike a balance from \n     Washington, DC, we should provide American workers with the \n     ability to strike that balance for themselves.\n  Senator Ashcroft went on to lay out examples of reasons why this \nwould become very apparent. Senator Jeffords had said, ``Why in the \nworld would unions oppose this?'' It really is not trying to undermine \nthe unions as has been portrayed. He said, ``They are nervous because \nthey have been going down, and they did not want to do anything that \nwould in any way enhance the workers and management to get together to \nimprove productivity. Is it being done out of fear that, indeed, the \nunions would no longer be able to control the agenda?''\n  I hope not, Mr. President, because that is not the intent of this \nlegislation. I myself would like to provide an example to illustrate \nthe obstacles to employee involvement.\n  A group of workers in a manufacturing plant want to discuss health \nand safety issues with their supervisor. The supervisor forms a safety \ncommittee with the foreman and three or four workers and the group meet \nonce a week. The workers know that the floor is often slippery, and \nworkers have fallen causing injuries and significant worker \ncompensation costs for the company. The workers also note that most \naccidents happened on Mondays. So perhaps a brief safety reinforcement \nbriefing at the start of the shift coming off the weekend would improve \nplant safety.\n  Acting on these employee suggestions the supervisor makes sure that \nmops are available to mop the floors and institutes a 5-minute safety \nmeeting for workers each Monday morning. Sounds reasonable. I would \nthink most of us would agree that these suggestions are reasonable \nideas for workers to bring to their supervisor.\n  What is incredible is that this type of employee involvement is \nillegal under Federal labor law. The National Labor Relations Act \nactually prohibits nonunion employees and supervisors from meeting in \ncommittees to discuss workplace issues like health and safety.\n  I have never viewed the TEAM Act as a union-management issue. \nInstead, I think it is a quality of life issue for workers who do not \nwant to just say, ``We are on the floor of our workplace and do what we \nare told to do and have no input into what we see may be something of \nreal benefit in improving the quality of life there.''\n  In the example I just mentioned the workers are the ones who observed \nthe wet floors. They are the ones who were there. They are the ones who \nare injured when they slip on the floors, and they are the ones who \nhave suggestions for dealing with the problem. This, I think, is the \nquality of work life issue for workers, and not a labor-management \nissue.\n  And for firms, employee involvement is a necessary way to enhance the \nefficiency of the plant. That has been proven over and over again \nwhere, indeed, companies have had team relationships that have proved \nsuccessful.\n  I think since the 1980's many American companies have tried to copy \nwhat companies were doing in Japan, because frequently there were \nemployee-employer relationships that our Japanese competitors were \nusing some years ago that were found to be successful.\n  We can even improve on what the Japanese have done. I would suggest, \nMr. President, that employee involvement is a necessary way to enhance \nthe efficiency of our workplaces. And more importantly, there are \nsignificant contributions that I believe workers can make with \ninnovative and thoughtful ways of improving the workplace.\n  Unfortunately, the National Labor Relations Board has issued a series \nof decisions beginning in 1992 that interpreted Federal labor law to \nprohibit many forms of employee involvement. These decisions have \ncreated uncertainty as to what types of employee involvement programs \nare permissible, as Chairman Gould pointed out.\n  These decisions have cast doubt on all employee involvement in \nnonunion settings. In union settings it works all right. But in \nnonunion settings it has raised suspicion, doubt, fear, and an \naggressiveness that I think has proven totally counterproductive on the \npart of the unions. I think we need a legislative solution to address \nthe problem.\n\n  Mr. President, the TEAM Act removes the barriers in Federal labor law \nto employee involvement. It clarifies what that involvement can be. At \nthe same time, the legislation maintains\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nprotections to ensure that workers have the right to select union \nrepresentation. The TEAM Act assures that employee involvement programs \nmay not negotiate collective bargaining agreements or seek in any way \nto displace independent unions. And nothing in the TEAM Act permits \nemployers to bypass an existing union if that is what the union and \nthat is what the workers have chosen.\n  Finally, I point out that the Congress prohibited company unions in \nthe National Labor Relations Act of 1935. They were prohibited then \nbecause firms were negotiating with company unions and refusing to \nrecognize independent unions which the workers had selected. But the \nTEAM Act requires employers to recognize and negotiate with independent \nunion representatives if that is what the workers have decided they \nwant. It really is urging that workers become more involved. The \nworkers are encouraged to participate and employers are encouraged to \nlisten to their employees.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that the TEAM Act is good for workers. It \nis good for firms. It is good for America. It is not attempting to roll \nback labor law. It is attempting to enhance it in ways that I think \nwill be far more constructive and productive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the Presidential years are referred to \nas the ``silly season'' and certainly this Presidential year is the \nsilly season. The competition for the award for the most improvidently \nproposed bill is very keen in the Chamber, Mr. President, but surely \nthe 4.3-cent gasoline tax decrease has got to take the cake for this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, all this Congress we have heard about the balanced \nbudget. I endorse the balanced budget. I am part of that bipartisan \ngroup of Senators that is trying to get a balanced budget passed. But \nnow that we finally propose it, it is not being accepted by my friend, \nthe majority leader.\n  On top of that, with budget deficits continuing, with no plan \napproved for the balanced budget, we now have a proposal to cut taxes. \nSurely, Mr. President, this has got to be in the category of bread and \ncircuses of ancient Rome when proposals are put out not for the good of \nsociety but in order to please the voters.\n  Now, the American voters may not be very smart on some issues, but \nthey are not stupid, and they know that this is not good policy. At a \ntime when we are trying to cut all kinds of programs, all across the \nboard, to come in and then cut taxes on gasoline is surely not good \npolicy. Gasoline in the United States is somewhere between one-half and \none-fourth as expensive as it is in Europe. In France, in Germany, in \nItaly, in those countries you pay three and four times as much for \ngasoline as you do in the United States. But if the gasoline goes up a \nvery small amount in the United States, it is used as a trigger to try \nto cut those taxes.\n  Mr. President, let us look at the facts about gasoline.\n  If you look at gasoline in real prices, in inflation adjusted prices, \nthis chart represents what gasoline prices have been since 1950 through \n1996, and it shows that in real inflation adjusted prices, the price of \ngasoline is close to the lowest it has been since 1950--almost 50 \nyears. Now, to be sure, there is a small blip of, what, 20 cents a \ngallon in some places. But in terms of the actual purchasing price that \nyou have to pay for gasoline, it is almost a historic low.\n  The next question is: what is going to happen from here? Is this \nincrease in gasoline prices permanent or is it likely to come down?\n  It is clear it is going to come down. When you look at crude oil \nprices--these first two blocks on this chart are actual prices from \nApril and May--you will note that they have come down from over $25 a \nbarrel already to about $21 a barrel. Those are actual prices that are \ncoming down very fast.\n  These prices on this chart are futures prices, and futures prices, of \ncourse, are real prices. You can purchase the crude now for delivery in \nMay or September or whatever these months are, so they are price \nreductions already realized. So we already have realized price \nreductions in the price of crude oil from over $25 a barrel to about \n$19 a barrel, or a decrease of $6 a barrel already realized in the \nprice of crude oil.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, this rather busy chart shows the relationship \nbetween crude oil and gasoline prices. On the bottom, we have crude oil \nprices, which shows a slight up-tick in crude oil for the month of \nApril, and it already shows that crude oil is going down. With respect \nto wholesale regular gasoline prices--these are in real prices--we see \nthat went up for the month of April and has already begun to go down.\n  Wholesale California reformulated gasoline is already coming down \nrather precipitantly. California is the area of the country, of course, \nwhich has the greatest concern about this because you have the greatest \nrunup in prices. But wholesale California reformulated gasoline prices \nare coming down very fast.\n  Retail gasoline prices in the United States and retail in California \nhave leveled off. They are not yet reflecting these downturns in prices \nof crude oil, wholesale regular gasoline and wholesale reformulated \ngasoline in California. But these prices will begin--already in retail \nit has come down slightly in California and leveled off in the United \nStates generally. However, as night follows the day, it is inevitable \nthat these prices will come down and come down precipitantly because \nwholesale prices are coming down.\n  Mr. President, what caused the shortage and the runup? On this rather \nbusy chart here, these hash lines show the historical range of gasoline \nstocks, and they go up and down every year because the summer driving \nseason and the heating season call for greater or lesser supplies and \nusually the actual amount follows within those hash mark lines, and \nwhen that happens supply and demand are in balance.\n  When we go to January and the spring of 1996, our supply line drops \nwell below the traditional levels. And why was that? Well, it was, \nfirst of all, because the winter was much colder than usual. Second, \nbecause many refineries across the country, particularly in California, \nwere down. Third, because there was an anticipation that the embargo on \nIraqi oil was to be lifted, and that was not lifted as expected, so the \ninflux of Iraqi oil was not as we expected, plus driving was up as well \nas the fuel efficiency of cars was down. That caused our stocks to be \ndown. However, this is already being corrected. As you can see, the \nstocks have begun to come up. This chart shows gasoline imports, and \ngasoline imports are up precipitously.\n\n  This is caused by two things. First of all, the market. When the \nprice is high, then that extra refining capacity in Europe is used to \nexport to the United States. Consequently, our imports are drastically \nup. With imports coming up, it is clear that this upswing in gasoline \nprices is soon to be over with. I mean it is not a problem to worry \nabout in the first place, as I mentioned, because we are at almost \nhistoric lows in the price of gasoline--almost. We are up only slightly \nfrom historic lows for the last 50 years. But even that small upswing, \nabout 20 cents a gallon, is soon to be over with because of these \nfactors: Additional imported crude oil, the supply; imported gasoline; \nsupply of crude oil coming up.\n  Finally, there is this vexing problem of why is it? I mean, are we \nbeing ripped off? Is there price gouging by the oil companies? Oil \ncompanies, I know, are those we love to hate. People think this market \ndoes not work. The fact of the matter is, it is a highly competitive \nmarket and it does work, as those imports of gasoline show. This is \nevidence that that market is working. As the price goes up, the imports \nof gasoline go up.\n  Let us deal with this question of profits. What this rather busy \nchart shows is the spread between gasoline prices and the price of \ncrude oil, in this case west Texas intermediate, which is usually the \nmarker for the price of crude oil. The gasoline is the New York harbor \nprice of gasoline.\n  This shows the spread, starting in January 1989 through April 1996. \nYou will notice that there are ups and downs every year. There is a \nhigher spread starting in the spring and that always ameliorates every \nsingle year as you get further, as the summer driving season is over \nwith. What this shows is that there is an increase in price level, an \nincrease in the spread in\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nApril 1996 compared to March 1996. However, if you go back to Aprils--\ngo back to April 1995, the spread was even greater. The spread was less \nin April 1994, slightly less in April 1993, but in April 1992 it was \nmore, and in April 1991 it was much more, in April 1990 it was much \nmore, and in April 1989 it was much more.\n  What does this tell us? It tells us that, if you look at the last 7 \nyears, the spread between the cost of crude oil and the price of \ngasoline is less now, on the average, than it has been in the past 7 \nyears. It tells you that this is not an unusual spread compared to past \nyears. It also tells us that April is one of the very highest months \nand that the spread comes down from April because of competitive \npressures.\n\n  I mention this because many people think--there have been these \ncharges without one shred of evidence, without a whisper of evidence to \nsupport them--that there is a conspiracy to make that price go up. But \nas you can well see, profit margins are less than the average they have \nbeen in the last 7 years, even though slightly more than they were in \n1994, but less than they were in 1995.\n  Any legislation such as an amendment I have heard that would say, in \neffect, that it shall be unlawful for any person to fail to fully pass \nthrough a price reduction--it would be completely impossible, as you \ncan see, to identify what the price reduction is, because every year \nthere is wild fluctuation between the price of crude oil and the price \nof gasoline, the spread between those two prices. So if you say you \nhave to pass through this price reduction--compared to what? What is \nyour baseline? Is it the average of the last 7 years? Is it this \nmonth's price the day on which you price it? Suppose you had a big \nspread on the day on which this amendment passed; can you rely upon \nthat? Could you up your prices at the pump on that particular day and \nthereby say, I am going to pass this on by giving you 4.3 cents less \nthan the highest level we have charged in the last 7 years?\n  I think any such amendment would be impossible to draw, impossible to \nenforce, and a very improvident thing for this Congress to do.\n  It is always nice to be for a tax decrease. But at a time when we are \ntrying to bring this deficit down, to decrease taxes, whether they be \nincome taxes, whether they be taxes on beer or gasoline or anything \nelse, I believe the American public has sense enough to be able to see \nthrough that kind of political pandering. That is all it is, to try to \npander to the American public and give them a little bread and \ncircuses.\n  I do not know what the polls show. I have heard that the polls show \nthat people like tax decreases, not surprisingly. But I believe that \nany blip in polls caused by giving a small amount of decrease in price, \neven if it was passed on--and who can possibly say whether it is passed \non or not? How can you identify a 4.3-cent decrease against the \nbackground noise of swings, which are annual swings in the price? You \ncould not identify that.\n  So there is hardly anything that the driver in America can point to, \nto thank the Congress for reducing his price, because you are not going \nto be able to determine what that decrease is or, indeed, whether it is \npassed along at all. But whatever that recompense, whatever that thanks \nwould be they would give would surely be short-lived because the \nAmerican public would understand that the deficit, about which we have \nbeen preaching for 2 years solid, nonstop rhetoric about the deficit--\nthey would understand that that deficit is only to be higher because we \nreduced taxes in an election year.\n\n  It is not a good thing to do. It is not good policy. Prices are lower \nthan they have been at almost any time in the last 50 years in real \nterms in the United States. They are a third to a fourth what they are \nin Europe. They ought to be higher, from the standpoint of \nconservation. Whatever happened to conservation in this country? Don't \nwe care about that anymore? Do we want to encourage gas guzzlers? Do we \nwant to encourage bigger cars, more gas-guzzling cars? I guess so, \nbecause that is the direction in which this goes.\n  It is not good policy, Mr. President. I hope we will not do it. If it \nis done, it will not be with my vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, perhaps a brief review of what it is that \nwe are debating on the floor of the U.S. Senate might be in order at \nthis point for those who may be watching or listening. The bill before \nus is to provide a modest degree of relief, the reimbursement of \nattorney's fees and costs incurred by former employees of the White \nHouse Travel Office who were fired at the beginning of the Clinton \nadministration and one of whom was unsuccessfully prosecuted. That bill \nhas passed the House of Representatives.\n  If the Senate were permitted to pass it, it would go to the President \nand, I presume, be signed. It is not particularly controversial. But \nthe majority leader of the Senate has been unable to get consent from \nthe other side of the aisle simply to pass that bill and send it to the \nPresident without conditions being imposed upon that consent.\n  So now this modest House resolution has had included with it a \nreduction in the tax on motor vehicle fuel, the 4-plus-cents-a-gallon \ntax that was imposed in 1993.\n  At the time at which it was imposed, at the time at which that tax \nhike was passed, every Member on the Republican side of the aisle voted \nagainst it. In some measure, that vote was simply a statement that we \ndid not feel that increased taxes was appropriate.\n  But there is another element in the opposition then and the desire to \nrepeal it now, which is equally important. That element is the fact \nthat for the first time in the history of the Congress and almost \nwithout precedent in any of the 50 States of the United States, a motor \nvehicle fuel tax was imposed to pay for various social and political \nprograms entirely unrelated to transportation. I think it is \nappropriate to say that perhaps the least objectionable tax to most of \nthe people of the United States is a gas tax, a motor vehicle fuel tax, \nwhen it is used to improve transportation, when it is used to maintain \nor to build roads and highways or, for that matter, to improve mass \ntransit systems in our major metropolitan areas.\n  Lord knows that we have fallen far behind in that traffic \ninfrastructure. This gas tax increase in 1993, however, was not for \nthat purpose. That was not a part of the agenda at the beginning of the \nClinton administration. It was simply for the wide range of other \nspending programs in which the then new President desired to \n``invest,'' in his own words, to ``spend'' in ours. And so much of the \nimpetus for this reduction comes from the fact that that was a terrible \nprecedent to set.\n  The gasoline tax is not a general purpose tax, should never have been \nused that way in the first place and should not be used that way now \nand, therefore, ought to be repealed. If the President wishes to come \nto the Congress with a proposal that would build our infrastructure by \nthe use of user fees, he would certainly get a more positive response \nthan he does when it is simply to disappear into the mass of hundreds \nof other programs.\n  This view, that we ought to repeal this gas tax, is not partisan in \nnature. There are, I think, at least a few Republicans who feel it to \nbe unwise. There are a significant number of Democrats who are quite \nready to vote for it, and the President has at least indicated that he \nwill sign and approve it. But, Mr. President, when the majority leader \nasked that we deal with the gas tax repeal alone, he was denied that \nright unless certain other unrelated demands on the part of the \nDemocratic Party were met.\n\n  So we cannot provide the relief for people wrongly fired in the White \nHouse Travel Office; we cannot deal simply with a gas tax repeal which, \nwhether wise or not, is something the American people understand and \nunderstand the debate about; no, we cannot do any of these things \nunless, Mr. President, paradoxically we agree that we will, in fact, \nhave a vote on an increase in the minimum wage uncluttered by any \nirrelevancies.\n  So it is do as I say, not as I do. Those on the other side of the \naisle demand the right for absolutely uncluttered votes on their agenda \nbut deny that right to the majority party.\n  Personally, I think an increase in the minimum wage undesirable for \nthe very people it is nominally designed to benefit. My inclination is \nto believe\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nthat it will cost a significant number of jobs, both among those who \nlose their jobs, because their employers do not think that they really \nproduce this larger hourly wage, but even more significant, among those \nwho are attempting to work their way off welfare or are teenagers \ncoming into the job market who will not get jobs in the first place \nbecause of a minimum wage that is too high.\n  It also seems to me that it is an extremely blunt instrument with \nwhich to increase the obviously too low income of those Americans who \nare the primary support for families and who are now on full-time \nemployment at the minimum wage, something like 3 percent of those who \nare making the minimum wage at the present time.\n  But, I am perfectly willing to admit that there is an argument on the \nother side of that question. Most middle-of-the-road economists think \nthat an increase in the minimum wage is neither a particularly good \nidea nor a particularly bad idea; that it will not have all of the \nharmful effects that some of its opponents state and clearly will not \nhave the positive effects that its proponents assert.\n  As a consequence, I think as a part of an overall look at the economy \nof the country, it is perfectly appropriate that we vote on increasing \nthe minimum wage. But, Mr. President, I think it is perfectly \nappropriate and far more logical that we vote on it at the same time \nthat we vote on something else which really will help the economy of \nthe United States, which will improve labor-management relations, which \nwill increase productivity and which will increase the number of jobs \nthat we have for people who are coming into the job market or seeking \nto improve the position that they hold in it. But we are told that the \nTEAM Act, which has actually been the subject of hearings in the Labor \nCommittee and approved by the Labor Committee, unlike a minimum wage \nincrease, is such a hard prospect that we will not be allowed to vote \non it by a minority that demands the right to vote clean on a minimum \nwage increase.\n\n  Mr. President, that is simply an unsupportable position. If we are to \ndo something that clearly makes it more difficult for people who \nprovide jobs to provide them for those who are coming into the market, \nwe certainly at the same time are overwhelmingly justified in saying \nthat a practice that is now in place in some 30,000 places of \nemployment in the United States, the setting up of informal teams to \ndeal with questions of productivity and vacations and the incidental \nfrustrations that are a part of everyday life, should be validated as \nagainst a decision of the courts not wanting that which says, ``No. You \ncan't do any of these things unless you have a union and engage in them \nthrough collective bargaining.''\n  That is great for the people who lead labor unions. And there may \neven have been the remotest justification for it in the 1930's. But in \nthe 1990's, and a more prosperous time, in a more competitive time, the \ntime at which the United States is very much in competition with the \nrest of the world, and a time in which the ancient total antagonism \nbetween management and labor is being increasingly succeeded by \ncooperation, a system, a proposal which encourages that cooperation is \nnot only a good idea, it is a necessity.\n  So what we have before us right now is a refusal by filibuster, \nhowever politely described, to allow a vote, to allow a majority to \ndetermine whether or not we should have the passage of the TEAM Act, \nvery much needed in a growing economy, together with an increase in the \nminimum wage, together with a reduction in the gas tax, and tend to \nthis horrid precedent that we use it for other than transportation \npurposes, together with the relief of the victims of the White House \nTravel Office.\n  Mr. President, that seems to me to be highly reasonable. If a \nmajority of the Members of the U.S. Senate do not like it, they can \ncertainly vote against it. Personally I think it is quite clear that a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate would vote for it. But the demand \nthat we can only deal with a minimum wage and that the minimum wage is \nthe only proposal to which this rule applies, without attaching \nanything else to it, that it is so important, so pristine, that it must \ngo through without amendment, while everything else can be \nfilibustered, that is a demand that is as unreasonable as it is \nunlikely to succeed.\n  So, Mr. President, my suggestion is that we go forward, we have a \ndebate on the merits, the shortcomings, of the TEAM Act, on the merits \nand the shortcomings of a minimum wage increase, on the merits and \nshortcomings of the gas tax increase, being the three elements in this \namendment, and then vote on the amendment and determine whether or not \nwe are for it, or alternatively, as the majority leader has suggested, \nwithout acceptance, that we vote separately on those first two. And if \nboth are passed, they go out of this body together to the House of \nRepresentatives. If one is passed, and one is defeated, the survivor \ngoes out as it is.\n  All kinds of alternatives have been offered to the minority party. \nBut it will accept only its own proposition for the way in which the \nbusiness of the Senate will be conducted. That is neither in the \ninterest of the Senate, Mr. President, or of the people of the United \nStates. Let us go forward and by the end of the afternoon vote on the \namendment that the majority leader has proposed for us, and get on to \nother business.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I fail to be persuaded by the argument of \nmy good friend from the State of Washington. I think that the point was \nmade very, very well by our leader that there were going to be some \namendments that would be offered to the gas tax. It would be directly \nrelated to that issue to try and make sure that if there was going to \nbe a repeal, that actually it would go down to benefit the families \nthat would be going to the gas pumps. And that has effectively been \ndenied.\n  I know the majority leader said, ``Well, if there's an amendment that \nmakes some sense, we'll be glad to consider it.'' But this body is not \na traffic cop for just the majority leader or the minority leader or \nany particular Member to say what a Senator can offer, outside of the \nissues of cloture, to a particular measure. That is a rule of the \nSenate. It might not be acceptable to some other Members, but that has \nbeen the rule here for 200 years.\n  Effectively you are closing out the Senator from North Dakota, you \nare closing out the Senator from Massachusetts, other members of the \nHuman Resources Committee, who offered other amendments to the TEAM Act \nduring the committee's consideration of the bill. All one has to do is \nlook over the debate that took place in the House of Representatives, \nfor example, and review that debate, and see that Congressman Sawyer, \nfor example, offered a substitute to try to address the kind of \nquestions about the particular language that some had raised to provide \nsome additional clarity about the effect of 8(a)(2). And that was very \nthoughtfully debated over there.\n  I think the Sawyer amendment included a number of different measures \nthat I think the Senate would be interested in. It may very well help \nwork out a point of accommodation so that that legislation would pass \nunanimously. But we are denied any opportunity to consider any such \npossibility either today or tomorrow or after the period of cloture.\n  So with all respect, the right of Senators to offer amendments is \nbeing cut off--and there might have even been Members who wanted to go \nback to the original proposal on the minimum wage. That was 50 cents--\n50 cents--50 cents over a period of 3 years, and also had an increase \nin the cost of living, so that we would not have the situation where \nworkers would fall continuously behind. That is a directly related kind \nof subject matter, probably worthy of debate, in trying to deal with \nthe fact that this program of the increase in the minimum wage it is \nexceedingly modest. People are denied that opportunity as well and are \njust foreclosed any opportunity to do anything other than speak. There \nwas not a desire to prolong the debate and discussion on any of these \nmeasures, but we are denied the opportunity even to offer them.\n  So we will have a chance to vote whether the Senate is going to be \nwilling to be gagged or not gagged on the proposal that is now before \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\n And all we have to do is look at the floor of the U.S. Senate right \nnow.\n  We invite all Americans to take a good look at the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. There are three Members here. We are effectively being denied \nthe opportunity to address these issues that are going to affect \nworking conditions for workers, not only those that affect the 14.5 \nmillion that are part of a trade union, but the 110 million Americans \nwho are not union members, their interests, their wages, their hours, \ntheir working conditions.\n  It just seems to me at a time when about 65 or 70 percent of the \nAmerican workers are falling further and further behind, it is \nunfortunate that our Republican friends have made a pretty wholesale \nassault on those conditions for workers by trying to fight the increase \nin the minimum wage, fight the earned income tax credit, fight against \nDavis-Bacon that provides an average of $27,000 for a construction \nworker in this country, and other matters which we debated at other \ntimes.\n  We are foreclosed from making any changes. They said you either have \nto take it or leave it. I find it quite amusing to hear the leader talk \nabout, ``Well, we will have to go along with what the majority wants.'' \nThe majority have indicated they favor the increase in the minimum \nwage. He has the facts wrong. The majority of the Senators favor the \nincrease. When he says, ``Well, the majority is going to insist you \neither take it our way or not,'' I do not think is a fair \nrepresentation of what the fact situation is. We are where we are, and \nwe will have to do the best we can. We will do so.\n  I want to take just a few moments to correct the record on \nrepresentations that were made in the last day or so and then speak \nbriefly with regard to the TEAM Act and respond to some of the points \nthat have been raised here. Then I will yield to others who want to \naddress the Senate. I see my friend and colleague and a member of our \nHuman Resource Committee, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, on \nthe floor at this time. I was wondering if we might ask him--I know he \nhas been very involved and interested during the course of our hearings \non the TEAM Act, and also during the markup. I will ask him maybe a few \nquestions, if that is all right.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans say that an employer cannot talk to \nhis employees in a nonunion shop about things like smoking policies or \nflextime schedules where employees work a 4-day week or whether to have \na pension plan or how to do the work safely; is that true?\n  Mr. SIMON. Absolutely not, I say to my colleague from Massachusetts. \nThat is hogwash. In a nonunion shop, the employer can talk to his \nemployees about anything. He can call them together as a group or talk \nto them individually. Nothing in the law prevents a nonunion employer \nfrom talking to his employees. In fact, section 8(c) of the National \nLabor Relations Act specifically protects his right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  As you know, this point was made yesterday about no smoking. There \nwere a whole series of issues that were brought out in one of the court \nopinions, of which one was no smoking. But the rest of it dealt with a \nvariety of different workplace issues.\n  It is being used selectively in distorting and misrepresenting a \nlegal holding to suggest that this kind of communication is not \npermitted at the present time. That is a gross distortion and a gross \nmisrepresentation.\n  It is interesting, our Republican friends must all be reading from \nthe same briefing sheet, because if you read through the debate in the \nHouse of Representatives, you find exactly the same quotation. I would \nhave thought that perhaps Members of the Senate might have changed at \nleast a few words about it. I am glad to get the response of the \nSenator.\n  Second, I mention that yesterday one of our colleagues said that the \nlaw prohibits an employee from going to the employer to ask for a day \noff to attend a child's award ceremony at school; is that true?\n  Mr. SIMON. Senator Kennedy, that is absolutely not true. When you \ntalk about distortions, you are absolutely correct. This thing has been \nso distorted.\n  If this bill passes, we will have a huge imbalance. In a union shop, \nthe employees bargain with the employer to have personal leave days. In \na nonunion shop, under current law, any employee can bargain \nindividually or ask the employer as an individual for time off.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further, there were some suggestions yesterday that the \nwhole future of labor-management cooperation is threatened if what they \ncall the TEAM Act--I call it the antiworkplace democracy act myself--\nbut they say the whole future of labor-management cooperation is \nthreatened if this bill does not pass.\n  Now, does the Senator remember the testimony that we have had in \nprobably the last Congress by the head of OSHA, Mr. Dear, about actions \ntaken, for example, in the State of Washington, where employers and \nemployees worked effectively together to reduce hazards in the \nworkplace? As a direct result of that cooperation, we saw a 38-percent \nreduction in workmen's compensation costs, and we see corresponding \nincreases in wages for workers. The associated industries from that \nState praised that cooperation, which is already taking place, can take \nplace today without this legislation, that saved industry approximately \n$1 billion over the period of the last 5 years.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of what is included in Senator Kassebaum's \nfindings, that we already have a multitude of these working \npartnerships and relationships? Even in the Republican report that is \non everyone's desk here they acknowledge that they are taking place in \n96 percent of the major corporations and over 75 percent of medium and \nsmall companies. That seems to be working.\n  Mr. SIMON. Absolutely. This is taking place in thousands and \nthousands of plants in your State, in my State, in every State here. \nThe law has permitted explosive growth in cooperative programs and \nemployee involvement plans.\n  The committee report claims that 75 percent, as you pointed out, of \nall employers use employee involvement; 96 percent of large employers \ndo so. That has occurred without this so-called TEAM Act. I agree, it \nis misnamed. The law has not changed one iota with respect to company \nunions in 61 years. The TEAM Act is completely unnecessary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The reference was made yesterday by the majority leader \nthat this was necessary because of the NLRB holding in 1992, the \nElectromation case in 1992, which allegedly changed the law and \nallegedly prohibits teams and committees and quality circles. I know \nthe Senator is familiar with that case because it was a subject of a \ngood deal of discussion in our committee hearing.\n  It is always interesting that even after this case, as the Senator \nknows, we had testimony before the Dunlop Commission by the various \ngroups that are pounding on the door. It is so interesting to listen to \nthose who are complaining about those who present workers' rights and \nwho complain about the money that is being spent presenting workers' \nrights.\n  Maybe we should talk about the various companies and corporations \nthat are supporting this legislation and what they have contributed to \nvarious candidates. Evidently that is the way you have to get along in \nthese times to try to impugn those who might have some benefit in here. \nI guess that is what we are sinking to. We have not done that. I would \njust as soon avoid it. But it is worth noting that many of those who \nare going to benefit from this bill are companies and corporations that \nhave made sizable contributions, I daresay, not to Democrats but to \nRepublicans.\n  Let me ask the Senator, is the Senator not interested that this \nlegislation that purportedly is going to protect workers is being \ndriven not by workers themselves that want that protection, but by the \ncompanies that are going to establish these company-owned, effectively \ncompany-run unions.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator is absolutely correct. One of the things that \nis wrong in our society today and wrong in this body is those who are \nheavy contributors have an inordinate access and inordinate power. We \nhave to struggle to get millions of people who are getting the minimum \nwage--they are not big contributors; 41 million Americans do not have \nhealth care, and\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nthey are not big contributors. But a few, a very few employers would be \naffected here; they are contributing.\n  It is interesting, you mention the Electromation case. A unanimous \nLabor Relation Board made up of Republican appointees held that the \nElectromation case was a typical garden variety case of a company \nunion. It held that no new principles were involved in finding the \ncompany union unlawful. The court of appeals again unanimously found \nthat the case had nothing to do with quality circles or productivity \nteams. The case was about an employer who was trying to control \ndisgruntled employees by imposing on them a representative that they \ndid not ask for or choose.\n  I would add, when you mentioned the Dunlop Commission headed by \nformer Secretary of Labor John Dunlop, he was the Secretary of Labor \nunder a Republican administration. He says this kind of thing does not \nmake any sense.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think you noted that all of the members of the \nNational Labor Relations Board that made that unanimous judgment in the \nElectromation case had all been appointed by Republican Presidents.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suppose that the reason for that is the one that is \noutlined in our own report. It says, on page 27 at the top:\n\n       No good purpose is served by allowing the employer to \n     choose and dominate the employees' representative. \n     Cooperation is not truly furthered because the employer is \n     not really dealing with the employees if he is dealing with \n     his own hand-picked representative. An employer does not need \n     the pretense of a team or committee if he only wants to \n     cooperate with himself.\n\n  Does the Senator think that sort of captures exactly what this piece \nof legislation is about?\n  Mr. SIMON. I think that is well stated. It is a good summary of what \nthis is all about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now, some claim that under the NLRB rule, management may \nnot include nonmanagement employees in the decisionmaking process, is \nthat true?\n  Mr. SIMON. That is not the case. Ever since the General Foods case in \n1977, it has been clear that employees can be given decisionmaking \nauthority without violating section 8(a)(2). If management wants to set \nup work teams and allow them to schedule their own hours, investigate \nplant safety, or redesign job procedures, the law permits it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is parliamentary procedure being observed \nhere?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The regular order is that the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas the floor and is recognized. That is the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. And the Senator is so advised \nthat he may yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to yield----\n  Mr. McCAIN. You would think that after some years the Senator from \nMassachusetts would observe the regular procedure on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is doing that. Regular order, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It might not be pleasing to the Senator from Arizona, \nbut that is the rule and that is the regular order.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Massachusetts \na question. We talked about the fact that quality teams are legal, as \nlong as they do not strain the questions concerning wages, hours, terms \nand conditions of employment. But what if they do, or what if an \nemployer wants to appoint a safety team to figure out why so many \nemployees had back injuries, for example? Can the employer do that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Very definitely. As the Senator knows, management has \nthe right to direct employees to do the job it wants done, whether the \njob is driving a truck or figuring out the best pension plan. \nManagement can direct employees working as a team to solve safety \nproblems or production problems. What it cannot do is to appoint \nemployees to a safety committee that is supposed to represent the views \nof other employees--other employees--about what pension benefits they \nwant, or what safety issues concern them. Management can find out what \nthe employees think by asking them, but it cannot establish an employee \norganization, choose its membership and deal with the organization as \nif it were the representative of the employees.\n  I think the Senator would understand the logic of that position and \nthe reason for it.\n  Mr. SIMON. Finally, the Republicans have said in their official \nposition that it is illegal for an employer to provide paper and \npencils or a place to meet for a team or a committee; is that true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. That is completely untrue. I just ask those that are \ncoming up with those speeches to read the debate over in the House of \nRepresentatives, where the same examples are being used. These are pat \nand standard, evidently, speeches being handed out and used by our \ncolleagues here, because the same language is included in the House \ndebate. I do not know whether it would be worthwhile to include the \ndebate that took place over in the House. But I urge my colleagues to \nread it because I think it is incisive as to what this whole issue is \nreally about.\n\n  I thank the Senator very much for those interrogatories. I will just \nspeak briefly about this legislation that is before us.\n  As I mentioned earlier, my good friend and highly regarded \nchairperson of our committee, Senator Kassebaum, indicated that the \nprincipal reason for this legislation was some ambiguity in terms of \nthe language of certain holdings. I find myself at odds with that \nunderstanding and, if that is the difficulty, it is certainly not \nreflected in the number of cases that are being brought to the NLRB. If \nyou look at the period of last year, and the year before, you are \ntalking about a handful of cases. It is not of such an urgency because \neven if there is a finding that there is some misunderstanding about \nwhat a company can or cannot do, there are no penalties. There are \nproblems out there in terms of protecting workers and workers' rights. \nBut, quite frankly, this does not appear to be one of them.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it is interesting to me that those who are \npushing this particular proposal--you can go back and examine the \ntestimony before the Dunlop Commission, in 1993, made up of a \nbipartisan group of labor relation experts in business and academia. \nThey conducted an intensive study of labor-management cooperation and \nemployee participation. And the committee held 21 public hearings, and \nhad testimony from 411 witnesses, and received and reviewed numerous \nreports and studies. The commission made one recommendation that is of \nparticular relevance. This is the recommendation: ``The law should \ncontinue to make it illegal to set up or operate company-dominated \nforms of employee representation.''\n  That is one of the strong recommendations, and that runs completely \ncontrary to the antiworkplace democracy act.\n  It is for very sound reasons, Mr. President. It makes no sense for a \ncompany and a CEO to pretend to represent workers when that individual \nhas bought that representation lock, stock, and barrel, with the \npaycheck. It is a disservice to those employees to appoint a worker and \nto say, ``Well, that worker is going to represent all of you in the \nworkplace, and I am paying him. I have the ability to dismiss him, and \nI have the ability to fire him tomorrow. I have the ability to tell him \nwhen they are going to have a meeting and what the agenda is going to \nbe.''\n  That is what this legislation effectively does. It says that an \nemployer can name anyone they want to be the representative of workers, \nand that individual is going to be paid by the employer, who can fire \nthem the moment that person makes a recommendation or a suggestion that \nis at odds with the employer or the CEO, and they will set the agenda \nfor that worker and tell them what the nature of the debate is going to \nbe, and tell them who that worker will recognize in any debate, and \neffectively control that person.\n  Now, if you call that representing employees, Mr. President, I do \nnot. That does not represent the employees. That is what this \nlegislation is about. It is not about just issues of cooperation.\n  As I mentioned just yesterday, in the legislation, S. 295, the bill \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nby Senator Kassebaum, on page 2, it says:\n\n       Employee involvement structures, which operate successfully \n     in both unionized and non-unionized settings, have been \n     established by over 80 percent of the largest employers of \n     the United States and exist in an estimated 30,000 \n     workplaces.\n\n  That is good. It is happening. That is taking place today. The report \nitself recognizes it.\n  On page 99, the report talks about the commission on the future of \nworker-management relations. The survey found that 75 percent of \nresponding employers, large and small, incorporate some means of \nemployee involvement in their operation, meaning that larger employers, \nthose with 5,000 or more employees, the percentage was even higher--96 \npercent. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 employers currently \nemploy some form of employee involvement or participation. Amen. That \nis the way to go. We urge that. It is taking place.\n  We looked at the provisions. If there is some question about that, we \nlooked at the various provisions to understand what is included and \npermitted and what would be prohibited. Basically, we are talking about \nencouraging people and company employee teams to work on everything \nother than the wages and the hours and the exact working conditions. \nThere has been a point in talking about, Well, what about certain types \nof working conditions? I had hoped at least to be able to address that \nissue and work with our Republican colleagues to clarify that. I think \nthose measures have been clarified in the proposal that was advanced in \nthe House of Representatives when it talked about three different \ncommittees that would be set up and how they would be set up to address \nany possible question about what is permitted and what is not \npermitted. But that was summarily dismissed in the House of \nRepresentatives, which gives you a pretty good idea about what is \nunderlying this bill.\n  As a matter of fact, in the House of Representatives, they even \nexcluded these kinds of activities in the House version--excluded the \ncompanies' employees who already had voted for representation. That was \nthe Petri amendment to H.R. 743. We have not done so in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments to talk about why \nthis concept is, I think, a dangerous one for working families, those \nfamilies that are represented by the 120 million Americans who are in \nthe workplace virtually every single day, not just the 13.5 million who \nare members of the trade union movement, but all working Americans. We \nknow--and we have examined here on the floor very considerably--what \nhas happened to the American work force from 1947 to 1970. All \nAmericans had moved up with the expansion of the economy. All had moved \nup.\n  What we have seen since 1972 to 1992 is that more than 60 percent of \nAmericans have actually fallen further and further behind. It is close \nto about 75 percent. Many of us believe that is a major issue and \nchallenge for us as a society.\n\n  It boils down to one basic question. Are we going to have an economy \nin the United States of America that is only going to benefit the \nrichest and the most powerful individuals in our country and society, \nor are we going to have an economy in which all Americans participate \nin a growing economy?\n  I believe that was really the concept that was supported by \nRepublicans and Democrats for years, and years, and years. It is now \nbeing undermined by these assaults on working families. We saw it in \nthe early part of this Congress when one of the first actions of our \nRepublican friends was to try to eliminate the Davis-Bacon Act. The \nDavis-Bacon Act provides a prevailing wage for workers who work in a \nparticular geographical area. It works out effectively to about $27,000 \na year for working families that work in construction.\n  I do not know what it is about our Republican friends that they feel \nthat one of the major problems in this country is to try to undermine \nworkers that are working for $27,000 a year. There are a lot of \nproblems that we have in our society, but that does not seem to me to \nbe uppermost, and it should be uppermost in the minds of the Members of \nthe Senate. But that was there.\n  Then, second, we have gone along a few weeks. We saw the assault on \nthe earned-income tax credit. That is important as we are talking about \nthe increase in the minimum wage because the earned-income tax credit \nhelps those workers that are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder \nand who have children, and it goes on up to $25,000, $26,000, and \n$27,000. Sure enough. We saw that the one part of the Republic budget \nthat was before the Senate was not only to provide $270 billion in tax \ncuts for the wealthy individuals but to cut back on that help and \nsupport for working families that have children. It was about the same \ntime that Republican opposition came about in terms of opposition to \nthe increase in the minimum wage; about the same time.\n  What is it about--$27,000 for construction workers and $23,000 for \nworking families with children--the opposition to the increase in the \nminimum wage that helps working families if they are by themselves, or \njust a couple? Families are aided more by the earned-income tax credit \nif they have several members in their families and working in that \nparticular area. But we have the cutbacks in the earned-income tax \ncredit and the opposition in terms of the increase in the minimum wage.\n  Then we came out on the floor of the U.S. Senate on that budget which \nprovided corporate raiders the opportunity to invade pension funds. We \nhad a vote here of 94 to 5 to close that out. That went over to \nconference with the House of Representatives, and the doors had not \neven closed, and the action that was taken overwhelmingly by the Senate \nwas effectively eliminated.\n\n  We should not have been so surprised at that because when we tried to \nclose the billionaires' tax cut that provides billions and billions of \ndollars to a handful of Americans who make it in the United States and \nthen renounce their citizenship--the Benedict Arnold provisions--and \ntake up citizenship overseas to escape paying their taxes here, we \nrepealed that two different times, and we could not kill it. We went \nover in the conference, and it kept coming back. There just was not a \ntax break out there for powerful interests that the majority was not \nprepared to support.\n  Here they go again looking after the company heads, those heads of \ncompanies that want to set up phony unions and exploit the workers. \nThat is what this is all about. It was virtually unanimously rejected \nby the Dunlop Commission, a Republican, former distinguished Secretary \nof Labor, a balanced commission of Republicans and Democrats, \nrepresentatives of employees and employers. They rejected that concept \nof going in this nefarious direction. We have got it back now.\n  I talked earlier today about how Republicans cheered with the \nemergence of solidarity in Poland in opposition to effectively have \ncompany-run unions and company-structured benefits and wages in all \nworkplaces in Poland and, for that matter, for all of Eastern Europe. \nThe reason Republicans--President Bush, Republicans all over--hailed \nLech Walesa and those brave shipyard workers--many of us have had a \nchance to visit that shipyard, and we have seen the memorial outside \nwhere those shipyard workers had faced down the military that shot many \nof them in cold blood as they were demonstrating for their own economic \nrights. We cheered them on and we supported them. Why? Not because they \nhad a government-run union or controlled company union, but because \npower was going to the people and they were representing themselves and \nworking for democracy and fighting tyranny.\n  Now we are going just in the opposite direction here. We are falling \nover ourselves with time limits and no effective debate on this issue, \nwhich I call the antiworkplace democracy act.\n  Mr. President, it will undermine that kind of effective empowerment \nwhich permits workers to be able to sit across the table and to be able \nto represent their own interests and to be able to try to work out a \nprocess by which their sweat and their work will be respected instead \nof being dictated to as was the case before the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  So, Mr. President, this issue that is before us today is basically \nabout workplace democracy. It is about whether workers should have the \nright to choose their own representatives\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nand not have them dictated by the company, or the Government. This is \nnot a new issue for our country or the world. This very issue was \nfought out in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union over many years. When \nthe Communist Party controlled the governments in those countries, they \nestablished sham unions which were completely dominated by the \ngovernment instead of being freely elected by the workers. In effect, \nthese sham unions were the means by which the Communist Party \nsubjugated workers throughout these countries, suppressing their wages \nand living conditions.\n\n  The effect of the company-run unions is to suppress the wages and \nworking conditions and living standards. As we know, Lech Walesa \nfinally stood up and challenged the antidemocratic system when he \njumped over the wall at the shipyard in Gdansk and led workers out on \nstrike. The central issue was workplace democracy.\n  This legislation, this antidemocracy piece of legislation, is not \nabout empowering workers and workers' rights; it is about empowering \ncompanies and management rights. That is what it is about. That is what \nwe are basically talking about. It is not just a little bill to talk \nabout cooperation. We have already addressed that issue. We have \ncooperation. It is important. We support it. That is not what this is \nabout. That is not what this bill is about.\n  Now, thanks to the courageous actions of Lech Walesa and thousands of \nPolish workers, they finally prevailed in their struggle for workplace \ndemocracy, and the strike at Gdansk not only led to solidarity of the \nfree and independent Polish trade union but also led ultimately to the \ncollapse of communism.\n  When Lech Walesa visited the United States, he was widely honored and \nacclaimed by Republicans and Democrats for his courageous struggle on \nbehalf of workers' rights and democracy.\n  Mr. President, I submit that American workers are entitled to the \nsame fundamental rights as the Polish workers and workers throughout \nEastern Europe and the Soviet Union. If we believe that workers should \nhave the right to choose their own representatives in these countries, \nthen we should also be committed to the principle that American workers \nshould also be guaranteed this same right. If it is wrong for the \ngovernment-run companies in Poland and other Communist countries to \ndictate who would serve as the representatives of their workers, then \nsurely it is wrong for companies in this country to dictate who will \nserve as representatives of American workers.\n  I do not understand why that concept should be so difficult to \nunderstand. We cannot shower Lech Walesa with praise and honors for his \nleadership in the fight for workplace democracy and then try to deny \ndemocratic rights to American workers. That is what the fight over S. \n295 is all about. That is why this bill should be known as the \nantiworkplace democracy act, because that is what it is designed to do. \nIt is designed to undermine the rights of workers to democratically \nelect their own representatives who can sit down as equals with the \nemployer to discuss wages, hours and other terms and conditions of \nemployment. It is designed to allow employers to establish sham, \ncompany-dominated committees which can be controlled and manipulated by \nmanagement as a means of suppressing legitimate worker aspirations. And \nit is no secret why big business is pushing the antiworkplace democracy \nact.\n\n  Just as the Communist-dominated unions in Poland and the Soviet Union \nwere an instrument for suppressing workers' wages and benefits, the \nsham company-dominated unions which would be legalized under S. 295 \nwould be used as a mechanism for holding down wages and benefits of \nAmerican workers, just at a time when I thought we were beginning to \nunderstand the importance of addressing this fundamental development in \nour economy that working families are being left further behind in the \nlast 10 to 12 years, and we ought to be trying to find ways of working \ntogether to try and see that they are going to participate in the \neconomic growth and expansion of our society rather than freeze them \nout.\n  If workers are denied the right to have their own independent \nrepresentatives, clearly it becomes much easier for the employers to \nsay no to their demands for better wages, better health care, better \npensions, and better and safer work conditions. For as long as \nemployees are precluded from having their own independent, \ndemocratically elected representatives, then it becomes very difficult \nfor workers to improve their standard of living and conditions of work. \nThus, the current effort by our Republican friends to pass S. 295 is \nsimply another example of GOP attacks on workers' rights and the \nstandard of living of working men and women.\n  The Republican leader continues to block the efforts to pass a modest \nincrease in the minimum wage which would help provide a living wage to \nmillions of low-income working families at the same time their leaders \nare pushing S. 295 in an effort to give big business another weapon for \nsuppressing the wages of millions of workers throughout this country. \nIt is time to call a halt to these attacks on American workers. It is \ntime to stand up for democracy in the workplace and the right of \nworkers to choose their own representatives, not have them be dictated \nby the company or the Government. It is time to stand up for the rights \nof workers for better wages, better benefits, and better conditions of \nemployment--in short, the right of workers to freely and democratically \nimprove their standard of living.\n\n  Mr. President, we will have an opportunity, I imagine, to address the \nSenate further on this issue. I see others of my colleagues wish to \naddress the Senate, and I will return to this subject at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have listened intently to the impassioned pleas of my \ngood friend from Massachusetts, with whom I have served either across \nthe bodies here in the House and Senate or across the aisle in the \nSenate for 22 years now. He is articulate. He believes strongly in his \nissues.\n  I would like to, however, try to get us back to the issues as I see \nthem and as I believe they are before us in this body. Few of my \ncolleagues in the Senate support all three of the measures that are \nbefore us today. I am one of those. I support repeal of the gas tax \nbecause it does not go where it ought to go--into infrastructure \nrepairs which would benefit the users. I support increasing the minimum \nwage because I believe it is due time that it be increased to reflect \nthe reality of the wages and cost of living in our country. And I am an \noriginal cosponsor and a strong supporter of the TEAM Act because I \nbelieve we are here talking about not the issues which have been raised \nby my good friend from Massachusetts but, rather, about improving \nproductivity and working together to straighten out some provisions of \nthe law which have created havoc with respect to businesses working in \na friendly relationship with employees in order to improve \nproductivity.\n  That is the issue which we have before us. It is a volatile issue \nbecause the unions sense that this will somehow inhibit them from being \nable to organize and represent workers. However, they are wrong. The \nbill does not apply if there is a union present.\n  We have also in the act before us, S. 295, specifically stated that \nit will not interfere with union operations or interfere with the \ndesires of a union.\n  Let me just read those words, and then I will be happy to yield to \nthe Senator from Arizona.\n  What we do is we modify the provision of the law which does define \nthese matters, and we add these words. First of all, we do not change \nin any way section 8(a)(5), which defines the employer obligation to \nbargain collectively with the union that is the certified \nrepresentative of the employees. We do change section 8(a)(2) because \nof the ambiguities inherent in the act. There are some 70 cases now \nwhich have tried to define the line as to whether or not discussions by \nemployer-employee work teams or other cooperative groups are infringing \nupon workers' rights to only be represented by a union. But there is no \nclarity on this issue.\n  We add these words. They can discuss matters of mutual interest, \nincluding issues of quality, productivity and efficiency, and then it \nadds:\n\n       And which does not have, claim or seek authority to \n     negotiate or enter into collective\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\n     bargaining agreements under this act with the employer or to \n     amend existing collective bargaining agreements between the \n     employer and any labor organization.\n\n  That just clarifies it. What you have now is they say, well, why \nbother, because you have thousands and thousands of these teams out \nthere, but every one of them, if you take a look at those 70 cases \nwhich cut one way or another, what you have is 70 areas of confusion, \nleaving employers in a position to have an action brought before the \nNational Labor Relations Board where they can get a cease-and-desist \norder and demolish the team, they can be fined. So this is just an \nattempt to make sure that what ought to be done can be done and there \nshould be no disagreement about it.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. For a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to ask a question of Senator Jeffords.\n  I ask my colleague and the Chair if I was appropriate in demanding \nregular order as an aggrieved Senator when the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Illinois were in a colloquy which \nwas not within the rights of the Senate. I would ask the Chair if I was \nwithin my rights in calling for regular order at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may call for the regular order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At any time, whether I happen to have the floor or not? \nIf I saw a violation of the rules of the Senate, I was within my rights \nas a Senator to call for regular order; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By the rules of the Senate, you are correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is very unfortunate, I say to my friend from Vermont, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts continues to violate the rules of the \nSenate and then--he has been here for more than a few years--and then \nrides roughshod over a legitimate objection made by a colleague. You \nknow, it has characterized, I am sorry to say, my exchanges with the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I want to let it be on the Record that when \nI see the Senator from Massachusetts violating the rules of the Senate, \nI will act within my rights, and I hope the Chair, rather than what \nhappened, his yelling for regular order, that the Chair will intervene, \nbecause I was fully within my rights as a Senator to intervene when the \nrules of the Senate were being violated.\n  It is very unfortunate, and it does not help the comity around here, \nwhen the Senator from Massachusetts deliberately violates the rules of \nthe Senate and then, when called that those rules are being violated, \ncontinues to just act in a bellicose fashion.\n  I think he owes the Senate and me an apology.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, the Democratic leader came to the floor \nof the Senate and, in response to a request for a unanimous consent--a \nrequest by the majority leader--he then asked that campaign finance \nreform be added. When the majority leader refused, the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, then objected to the proposed unanimous-\nconsent agreement.\n  I know it is getting very politicized around here. I know things are \ngetting rather tense. I understand the tactics that are being employed \nby the minority. I understand them, and I do not disrespect those \ntactics.\n  But when the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, comes \nto this floor and talks about campaign finance reform and politicizes \nthat issue, when I have been working with the Senator from Wisconsin \nand others on a bipartisan basis, and attempts to use it for political \ngain, then I have to come to this floor and take strong exception to \nthis crass politicization of this issue which for 10 years was blocked, \nwas blocked because it was politicized.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is not a cosponsor of the bill. He has \nannounced that he is opposed to certain portions of the bill. Yet, he \nhas the chutzpah to come to the floor of the Senate and call for the \ninclusion of campaign finance reform being included in a unanimous-\nconsent agreement.\n  I have been working with the majority leader and I have been working \nwith my friends on the other side of the aisle, trying to work out an \nagreement where we can bring this issue up, where we can debate it and \ndispose of it one way or another. If the Senator from South Dakota \nwants to politicize this issue, then that is fine. But what he will do \nis politicize this issue, and then we will make no progress.\n  I remind my colleagues, for the first time in 10 years we have a \nbipartisan bill, and we have to move forward in a bipartisan fashion. \nThe distinguished majority leader has expressed his willingness to try \nto work out some kind of accommodation. But if the Democratic leader \ncomes to this floor and politicizes this issue, then we will make no \nprogress. Again, the American people will be deeply disappointed. I \nhope--I hope--the Senator from South Dakota will let us work through \nthis, bring it up this month and have this issue disposed of one way or \nanother.\n  Again, I express my deep disappointment that the Senator from South \nDakota should stoop to politicizing this issue in that fashion.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Vermont has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask my colleague, and this is asking for a \ncourtesy, that I might have a moment? It will not be acrimonious at \nall.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield for a question only. I am trying to get back on \nthe discussion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just in the form of a question, I guess. The Senator \nyielded for a question from the Senator from Arizona; is that correct? \nIt sounded like----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If you have a question for me, I will be happy to yield \nto you for the question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do. I will be brief. I am sorry to put it this way \nbut it is a question, in the form of a question, but it is a point. In \nthe spirit of honesty, I just wonder whether the Senator from Vermont \nknows--whether or not the Senator from Vermont knows that, as much \nrespect as I have for the Senator from Arizona, and I love working with \nhim on issues, that I believe that this morning--I could be wrong, we \ncan look at the record, but I was here out on the floor--I wonder \nwhether the Senator from Vermont knows that when the minority leader \ncame out, he was just simply saying that, if we keep putting together \nall these different kinds of pieces of legislation, what will be the \nfinal combination? He then went on to say, we could have campaign \nfinance reform, we could have foreign policy, we could have something \ndealing with arms agreements.\n  I do not think it was an announcement that in fact the minority \nleader intended to put the campaign finance reform bill, the bill so \nmany of us have worked on, as an amendment on this.\n  I wonder whether the Senator understands that? That is a \nclarification.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am not clear as to what all the discussion was on the \nfloor at that time, so I will have to let the record speak for itself \nin that regard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think we ought to get back to the \nextremely important issue which is before us today, and that is the \nTEAM Act.\n  I am a cosponsor of the TEAM Act because I believe that cooperation \nbetween employers and employees is the wave of the future, and it \nshould have been the wave of the past.\n  We went into it at length yesterday, in discussing what happened some \n40 years ago when the issues were how management and labor can get \ntogether and go into the future in order to work hand in hand to \nimprove productivity. The problem was we did not change the then so-\ncalled Taylor policy of real confrontation and arm's-length \nnegotiations between the workers and management.\n  Our competitors--and this is the issue of the day--on the other hand, \nin Europe and in Asia, said, ``Great idea over in America. You have a \ngreat idea.'' Briefly, I would say, there was a U.S. company that did \nthe same thing, the Donnelly Corp. If you want to read a record of the \ndifficulties they have had over the years, trying to defend what is \nentirely within the TEAM Act's perspective and would be allowable \nmatters for them to get together\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nand improve productivity, you will understand why we are here today--to \nget rid of the ambiguities, to make it crisp and clear that, if a \ncompany works with employees on productivity, as long as they do not \nget into matters of collective bargaining, et cetera, it is perfectly \nallowable. But right now there are thousands of teams that are out \nthere that are in jeopardy of being brought to the NLRB and then being \ngiven an order to get rid of the team they are working with, and they \ncould be fined.\n  So that is where we are. I want to make sure we understand that. Over \n30,000 companies use employee involvement programs. The TEAM Act \naddresses the concern that the National Labor Relations Board, the \nNLRB, will discourage future efforts at labor-management cooperation. \nSpecifically in the Electromation decision, the NLRB held that the \nemployer-employee action committees that involved workers meeting with \nmanagement to discuss attendance problems, no-smoking rules, and \ncompensation issues constituted unlawful company-dominated unions.\n  Congress enacted section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act \nforbidding employer domination of labor organizations to eliminate the \nsham unions of the early 1930's. No one disagrees with that. The TEAM \nAct is a direct recognition that the world of work has changed since \nthe 1930's. In that era, many American businesses believed that success \ncould be achieved without involving workers' minds along with their \nbodies. In those days, with the kind of work that was there, that is \nprobably true. But today, recognition is widespread among business \nexecutives that employee involvement from the shop floor to the \nexecutive suite is the best way to succeed.\n\n  The employee involvement efforts protected by the TEAM Act are not \nintended to replace existing or potential unions. In fact, the language \nof the bill that I read earlier specifically prohibits this result. The \nlegislation allows employers and employees to meet together to address \nissues of mutual concern, including issues related to quality, \nproductivity and efficiency.\n  However, those efforts are limited by language that prohibits the \ncommittees or other joint programs from engaging in collective \nbargaining or holding themselves out as being empowered to negotiate or \nmodify collective bargaining agreements. That is all it does.\n  Mr. President, the essence of the matter is that the definition of \nlabor organization under the NLRA is so broad that whenever employers \nand employees get together to discuss such issues, that act arguably \ncreates a labor organization. In that situation, the existing language, \nsection 8(a)(2) comes into play. The question becomes whether the \nemployer has done anything to dominate or support that labor \norganization. Such domination and support can be as little as providing \nmeeting rooms or pencils and paper for the discussions. This is simply \ntoo fine a line to ask employers to walk successfully.\n  We want to clear that line up to make it absolutely clear that things \neveryone would agree are sensible, logical and appropriate can go \nforward without having the NLRB stop in and say, ``No.''\n  Earlier, I heard Senator Kennedy state that upward of 80 percent of \nAmerican companies are engaging in some form of teamwork or other \ncooperative workplace programs. Fine. His conclusion is that all this \nactivity is going on out there now without a change in the law, so \nthere is no need to change the law.\n  What that argument misses is the fact, as I have said, that much of \nthis activity is a technical violation of existing law. While these \nprograms may be doing wonders for the productivity of the company where \nthey are employed, any one of them is no more than a phone call away \nfrom running afoul of the NLRA.\n  What we have to remember is that the NLRA is very specific in all of \nthe decisions, some 70 of them, where all these kinds of borderline \ncooperative activities are illegal and the defense of an employer is \nvery fragile.\n  It is no defense to an unfair labor practice charge that the program \nis working, that working conditions and productivity have improved and \nthe company's bottom line has risen. None of this matters if it is a \ntechnical violation of the antiquated rule. The NLRB will shut down the \nteam, fine the company and force it to sign papers swearing it will \nnever do it again. The TEAM Act will prevent continuation of these \nabsurd results so detrimental to the national interest.\n  I recently was visited by a workplace team from my own State of \nVermont. I am certain that many of my colleagues in the Senate have had \nsimilar visits, since there are successful teams operating all over the \ncountry. The workers who visited me were from IBM, the computer-\nchipmaking facility in Burlington, VT. The more traditional top-down \nmanagement style still prevails on most shifts and in most departments \nat their plant. However, on the night shift at this plant, the workers \ndecided about 3 years ago to try a cooperative work team. They chose \nthe name Wenoti, meaning ``We, Not I.'' In other words, the workers and \nthe company would work together toward common goals. Wenoti was their \ngroup. That name is a combination, as I said, of the words ``We, Not \nI'' to symbolize their focus on what is good for all and not just one.\n  When the team representatives came to my office a few months ago, \nthey were as proud a group of employees as I have ever met. The Wenoti \nteam consistently leads the plant in all productivity and quality-\ncontrol measures. Moreover, they told me that their job satisfaction \nhas risen directly in relation to their ability to contribute \nmeaningfully to the successful completion of their job. That is what \nthis is all about. For God's sake, what is wrong with it? How can \nanybody argue that fostering this progress is not good for the country?\n\n  IBM is a profitmaking organization. It is not promoting employee \ninvolvement solely out of altruism. Rather, IBM has come to the \nrealization that employee involvement is vital to the company's bottom \nline. Doing so has the added dividend of giving employees a greater \nstake and greater satisfaction with their jobs.\n  Time and again you hear employees praise companies that do not ask \nthem to check their brains at the door. So if affected employers and \nemployees support this legislative effort, what is the problem? It \ncomes as no great surprise that organized labor takes a dim view of it. \nOddly enough, to do so, it must take a dim view of American workers as \nwell.\n  Organized labor's arguments are based on the assumption that workers \nare not smart enough to know the difference between a sham union and a \ngenuine effort to involve them in a cooperative effort to improve the \nproduct, productivity and their working environment. I think workers \nare smart, and I think that is exactly why employers are trying to \nharness their brains in the workplace as well as their backs.\n  The real problem for unions is that under current law, they have a \nmonopoly on employee involvement. Like the AT or the Vermont \nRepublican Party of old, nobody likes to lose their monopoly. But \nconsumers or voters or workers profit from choices and competition, not \nfrom static responses to a changing environment. This is clearly the \ntrend of the future.\n  Yesterday, I spent some time before my colleagues going back into the \nhistory and pointing out that I thought it was ironic--if you can just \nget the unions to sit down and look at what has happened in the last 40 \nyears--that it was back 40 years ago when the leaders in academia and \nothers who had studied business and were looking toward the future and \nwondered what could be done to ensure that we improve productivity in \nthis Nation. They came up with concepts that said if we could get \nworkers and business to work together so that there is productivity and \nthen profit, and then that profit can be split, everybody gains, \neverybody benefits.\n  All sorts of suggestions were made. I went through them yesterday. \nWhat about dividends to the employees in terms of stock profit-sharing \nor stock options or even going so far as to put a member of the union \nor the workers' representative on the board of directors?\n  What happened in this country? Little or nothing. A few companies \nlike Donnelly, which I mentioned before, took it to heart and were very \nsuccessful, but the majority of ours did not.\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\n  What happened overseas? The Japanese, the Germans, and others looked \nat these and said, ``Hey, good idea.'' The ironic part is, their \nunions, having adopted that philosophy, are now stronger and much more \ndominant in their industries than ours are. So why would the unions in \nthis country want to continue to do what created, in my mind, their \nfailures? And that is, not to recognize that much more gets done by \nworking with management with an eye toward improving productivity.\n  Mr. President, if you really want to understand better what is going \non, Hedrick Smith, who I am sure many of my colleagues know, is a \nPulitzer Prize winner and author of ``The Power Game'' and ``The \nRussians,'' wrote a tremendous book. It is ``Rethinking America: A New \nGame Plan for American Innovators, School, Business People and Work.''\n  It really outlines the serious problems we have in this Nation. It \noutlines those problems which are giving us trouble now. On education, \nHedrick, as he traveled all over the world going to education centers, \ngoing to schools and examining what is going on in Japan and what is \ngoing on in Europe and what is going on in this country, finds that we \nhave been placed way back in our ability to compete in our educational \nsystem.\n  I will not dwell on it today. I dwelled on it before. That is a very \ncritical part. What they learned is, you have to start cooperation of \npeople in the schools. In Japan, for instance, they learn right from \nday one that everyone works together. In the grade schools, everybody \nworks to make sure everybody reads, right on through.\n  Then they also realized--this is true in Europe also--that the time \nfor business to get involved, the time for business to get involved in \neducation, is not after a kid graduates from high school, but, rather, \nwhen they are in high school or middle school. So they designed \nprograms for skill training where businesses come in and they are held \njust to dramatize how the different systems are.\n  In this country, our businesses spend $200 billion a year--$200 \nbillion a year--in the training and retraining of the kids that \ngraduate from high school in our work force. The Europeans --and that \nis just Europeans--spend the same amount of money, $200 billion. You \nknow where they spend it? In high school and middle school, so when the \nkids graduate from high school they are already a trained work force.\n  Our schools have failed to recognize the importance of that. We have \nto change that. We are beginning to change that. I was in Mississippi \nthis past weekend, and the area has had a very difficult time with \ntheir education. But they have learned from it. They are now \nrevitalizing their schools and their whole vocational-educational \nprograms to model them after what is going on in Europe and Japan. The \nrest of the country has to do the same thing.\n  Hedrick Smith spent a lot of time putting this together. He went, \narticulately, through and documents exactly what happens. But for \nrelevance today, he goes through what happened in the businesses in \nEurope and the businesses in Asia after the 1950's when our academia \nand some business leaders recognized that the wave of the future, due \nto all the technology changes and all, was to make sure we had a \nqualified work force that was available and ready to work but, most \nimportant, that when they were working, with all the kinds of \ntechnology changes and the complications of the industrial structures \nnow, that the workers are the best ones to know when the quality is \ngoing down or what to do to improve the quality of your goods and \nservices. So they worked with them. And, lo and behold, we had to learn \nthat.\n  There are wonderful stories about how Motorola got involved in \nunderstanding this and how they went through and realized that if they \ndid not improve the skills of their workers and did not work together \nand get them to help them out, they could not compete in Japan. So they \nchanged their whole operation, and they were able to keep jobs here \ninstead of losing them.\n  Senator Kennedy talked about--maybe it was the minority leader--about \nthe huge expansion of the profits in our corporations, but if you \nexamine those profits, you will find that most of those profits are \ncoming from overseas ventures. We should be keeping those ventures \nhere. But we cannot do that if we do not improve our education but \nalso, as importantly, if we do not have the TEAM Act to allow the \nworkers to work with the employers, to improve productivity, to \nunderstand what is going on on the assembly line, to correct the \nproblems which are creating goods that are not saleable before they \nbecome that. That is the lesson that we have to learn in this country.\n  It is productivity that is the issue here. Is this Nation going to be \nas productive as it can and must be in order to endure as a leader in \neconomics in this next century? We are about there now. We established \nsometime ago--in 1983, we took a look at our educational system and \nsaid, ``Hey, yeah, you're right. We have to improve it. The present \nsystem isn't going to work.'' We have not entirely touched on improving \nit. So we have to do that.\n  Also, essentially, at that time, especially with auto workers, there \nis another example, and I would hate to see it kind of reverting back. \nThe UAW recognized that they had to change their ways when they saw the \nflood of cars coming in, much higher quality from Japan and Europe, and \ndemolishing their markets. So they finally said, ``Oh, boy, we've got \nto change our ways.'' So they sat down, and, working with management, \nthey improved their productivity, improved their quality and got \ntogether. And we were able to change things to meet the markets.\n  We have to be ready to do that or we are going to be driven out. The \nfuture of this Nation depends upon our ability to compete in the world \nmarkets. There is fantastic opportunity out there, but we cannot be \ndragged down by old concepts from the 1930's on what worker-management \nrelationships should be. We have to look to the future. The TEAM Act is \na leading tool to do that. It will clarify the law. It will legitimize \nabout 30,000 teams that are out there, which are in jeopardy right now \nif we do not change the law.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to please support the TEAM Act. As I \nsaid earlier, I support all of these issues that we are facing. I have \nno bias one way or the other. I am looking objectively at these things \nand think we should pick and choose those. And, finally, I would thank \nmy colleagues for their time and would hope everyone would get down to \nthe real issues here and not try to get tied up with the emotionalism \nand rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First, with regard to the matter that just came up on \nthe floor a few minutes ago, I want to clarify an exchange that \noccurred with regard to the issue of campaign finance reform. The \nSenator from Arizona came to the floor and spoke and pointed out that \nhe had heard the minority leader asked unanimous consent that the \ncampaign finance reform issue be added to a unanimous-consent proposal \nthat the majority leader had propounded. The Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, indicated that he believed a different attempt had \nbeen made and that in fact the minority leader had simply suggested \nthat this was a matter that might come up.\n  The Senator from Minnesota asked that I clarify this issue and that \nit is, in fact, the case that the minority leader, Mr. Daschle, did \nspecifically ask unanimous consent that campaign finance reform be \nadded to the unanimous-consent agreement. So, in fairness, the Senator \nfrom Arizona did accurately portray what was requested.\n  Let me just say this, however. It is very important, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona indicated, as I know the Senator from Minnesota believes, \nthat this issue remain not a part of partisan bickering. Obviously, \nthere are many reasons why some partisanship is being demonstrated on \nthe floor at this time. That is entirely inappropriate on some of the \nissues that are being discussed. But I agree with the Senator from \nArizona that when it comes to campaign\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\nfinance reform, in this session, with this Congress and this President, \nthat it has to be a bipartisan effort.\n  It is my view that when Mr. Daschle, the minority leader, made this \nunanimous-consent request, that he was not seeking to make this a \npartisan issue. Senator Daschle has indicated that he believes that the \nso-called McCain-Feingold bill ought to be the vehicle for achieving \ncampaign finance reform. He has indicated that he disagrees with some \naspects of it. But I believe that the Senator from South Dakota is a \nfriend to the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  Nonetheless, I think we will do better on the issue of campaign \nfinance reform if it is offered on the basis of a bipartisan agreement, \neither by Senators working together on the bill, as Senator McCain and \nSenator Wellstone and I are doing, or preferably if the two leaders, \nthe Senator from Kansas and the Senator from South Dakota, were to get \ntogether and make sure that in the very near future this body turn \nspecifically to the issue of campaign finance reform as the order of \nthe day. That is what all of us who cosponsor this bill prefer, \nalthough we stand ready to attach this bill as an amendment to other \nlegislation if we are not afforded that opportunity.\n\n  So let me just reiterate, the campaign finance reform effort is the \nfirst bipartisan effort of its kind in 10 years in this body. It is a \nreal effort. It is an effort that has enormous support, and we will not \nallow any partisan maneuvers on either side to prevent us from our \nopportunity to make this change that the American people want very, \nvery much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4832-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND BRIBERY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on another matter, international trade \nis a high priority in almost every country today. We are negotiating \nall sorts of agreements to bring down barriers and protect our workers \nand promote economic development worldwide.\n  One issue, Mr. President, that I have tried to identify as a barrier \nfor competition for American businesses is the issue of bribery. \nAmerican businesses live in accordance with the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act. This was a bill offered by my predecessor from \nWisconsin, Senator William Proxmire. Most businesspeople praise it as a \nway of maintaining honesty, and thus stability, in their business \nrelationships. But, unfortunately, other countries--and one example is \nGermany--actually give their businesses the opportunity to write off a \nbribe in a foreign country as a tax deduction at the end of the year. \nSo it is illegal for one German to bribe another German, but if they \nwere to offer that bribe to somebody in another country, they can use \nit as a tax deduction. This produces some pretty unhappy faces when \nAmerican businesspeople find this out.\n  Some say that bribes are the cost of doing business overseas, \nparticularly in some developing countries. I believe, however, it is a \nbarrier to doing business in the long run, particularly overseas, since \nit can only retard economic growth in some of the developing countries.\n  As a result, Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to try to \nget at this problem. In the State Department authorization bill for \nthis year, I offered an amendment requiring an interagency study on \nbribery and corruption and the impact it causes on American businesses. \nI was disappointed that the majority dropped it in conference \ncommittee, but I am pleased that the Commerce Department is going ahead \nand pursuing a study of its own on this study anyway. I appreciate \nthat.\n  I have also raised the issue of international bribery consistently in \nthe Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, not only as we examine how to \npromote U.S. products, but in my role as the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs, to try to raise the issue of bribery \nwith the African heads of States and other officials when we have \nconfirmation hearings for ambassadors headed to the region. I believe \nthat the ambassadors should be intimately involved in this issue as we \nseek to promote American products overseas.\n  I also want to praise Ambassador Kantor's very direct and public \nefforts on this issue and to say that I think his recent efforts have \nbeen critical in making headway on a universal acceptance of the \nprinciples that underlie the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. I \nam particularly encouraged that the administration seems to want the \nWTO to consider sanctions against bribers when Government contracts are \nunder consideration.\n  Mr. President, it is important that even though we have this tough \nlaw and our businesses have to abide by it, we are not alone in this \ncampaign. There have been many significant accomplishments. The \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, took a \nlandmark step 2 years ago in recognizing that bribery is a \ndestabilizing factor in international trade, and they recommended that \nthe member states cooperate on revisions of their domestic laws about \nbribery.\n  Several weeks ago, OECD tried to eliminate tax writeoffs on the laws \nof the member States of the kind that exist in Germany. Latin America \nhas also taken this issue on. In March of this year, the Inter-America \nConvention Against Corruption, known as the Caracas Convention, \nidentifies corruption as a main obstacle to democratic development in \npublic trust in government institutions, and it also calls and provides \nfor the prohibition on transnational bribery.\n\n  Mr. President, perhaps some might see this document from the Inter-\nAmerica Convention as a utopian document that cannot be enforced, but \nwhat it does do is begin the process, in Latin America, as has been \ndone in the rest of the world, to commit the parties--in theory, at \nleast--to the notion that bribery is a destructive force in democratic \ndevelopment and international business.\n  Given the developments with the OECD, the United States and Latin \nAmerica, one would have thought it was a trend for the future, but we \nare really making progress. Unfortunately, however, at the end of \nApril, the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations spoke \nout for the first time on the issue of bribery and unfortunately \nopposed any attempt by the United States to stamp out corruption, \nsaying they would not talk about it in the context of the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Deputy United States Trade Representative Jeff Lang tried to raise \nthe issue and was criticized by Malaysia and Indonesia officials for \nplotting against the developing nations. This reaction to the seven \ncountries is a very counterproductive reaction. We focus on bribery to \nengage more in business, not to discriminate. I hope that Malaysia and \nIndonesia and others think of this as an area of cooperation, of mutual \ninterest, rather than an area for polarizing, as has been done in this \ncase.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, if international markets are indeed to \nconnect nations around the globe, somehow we have to be able to conduct \nbusiness in a transparent and responsible manner. Bribery has to be \ndiscouraged, not rewarded, by all governments.\n  I hope that the ASEAN countries will reconsider this issue and join \ngovernments from every continent in seeking to end the corruption that \ndoes exist in international markets.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the teamwork \nfor employees and management. If ever there were a law that makes no \nsense, it is to forbid teamwork between management and employees.\n  This is a bill to encourage worker-management cooperation. It is \nsorely needed in this country in industry today. Senator Dole has made \nthis part of the repeal of the gas tax and a rise in the minimum wage. \nThe TEAM Act will permit employees in nonunion\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nsettings, which are most of the employees in this country, to work with \nmanagement to address, in a commonsense way, workplace issues that are \nmutual interests and will benefit the workplace scenery and the company \nas a whole.\n  Under current law, these discussions are permitted only if employees \nare represented by a union and the discussions go through the union \nbargaining representative. Nothing could be more ludicrous as a way to \nhave cooperation than to have to channel your discussion through union \nrepresentatives. It just does not make common sense, or any other kind \nof sense.\n  The current law prohibits workers and managers in nonunion settings \nfrom sitting down to cooperate on a long list of basic workplace \nissues--safety, quality, and productivity. By not allowing employee \ninvolvement, this antiquated law deprives 90 percent of U.S. workers in \nthe private sector of having any voice in their workplace. They simply \ncannot talk to the owners and the management for whom they work, and \nyou eliminate cooperation. The lack of employee involvement also makes \nthe American industrial sector less competitive. Almost every U.S. \nindustry faces strong and aggressive competition from foreign firms \nthat are free to draw on and utilize the ideas, thoughts, and abilities \nof their employees. They use this to compete against American companies \nand American workers.\n  Now, American business leaders know that including employees in this \ndecisionmaking would make them more competitive. They would have an \nability to draw firsthand on the workers, what would be more efficient, \nmore effective, and what would cut costs, which would certainly lead to \nincreased competitiveness. The older approach of telling workers, \n``When you punch the time clock, leave your mind at the door,'' and \ndictating to them how to do the job without having any back-and-forth \ndiscussion with the worker as to the best way to do the job is \nabsolutely the worst law, which should be abandoned. Employers know \nthat the people who perform the work know better how to do it and the \nmost efficient way to do it.\n\n  It concerns me that, under current law, employees cannot be involved \nin workplace decisions, unless they do it through a union steward or a \nunion representative. Workers that are knowledgeable about how to do \nthe work, how to do it better, should have a say in making the \ndecisions and certainly should share their opinions about how it should \nbe done. Employers are anxious to listen to them. They are anxious to \nhave the input and the advice. They want it. The TEAM Act will give \nemployees the voice in the workplace that everyone wants them to have \nand that they want to have.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of Senate bill 295. I believe this \nlegislation is essential if we are going to improve our competitive \nposition in America as compared to other countries around the world--\nespecially in manufacturing, where we so sorely need jobs to be \ncreated.\n  If we are really concerned about doing something to help the working \nAmericans to improve their lot in life and also the competitiveness of \nthe country as a whole, the best we think we can do is to pass the TEAM \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Pressler, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Bryan pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 1735 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank you. I just have a few words to say \nabout the state of affairs on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I was somewhat appalled with the President's press conference, which \nis clearly as blatantly political a press conference as I believe has \never happened in this town, basically saying that the Republicans are \ntying up this legislation in the Senate today.\n  How could anybody make that comment when his own side refuses to \ngrant cloture on something as simple, as fair, as decent, as \nworthwhile, as bipartisan as the Billy Dale bill? And they do it all \nunder the guise that they are not getting what they want on the minimum \nwage, and then they vote against cloture today knowing that Senator \nDole said they can have a vote on their minimum wage. But if they want \ntheir vote on minimum wage, we are going to do something about the gas \ntax, and we are going to do something about the TEAM Act.\n  I have to say I support Senator Dole in his effort to repeal the 4.3-\ncent-per-gallon tax on gasoline that President Clinton and the \nDemocrats passed back in 1993. While some critics might try to dismiss \nthis bill as an election year gimmick, I believe they are missing the \nmain point. This is about far more than just the 4.3-cent gas tax.\n  The fact is the 1993 tax bill was the largest tax increase in \nhistory. We are now paying taxes at the highest rate in history. \nYesterday was tax freedom day, signifying how long we have to work just \nto pay our State and local taxes, and that does not include all the \ncosts of regulatory burdens and other things. As of yesterday, the \nseventh of May, it took the average American all those months, the \nfirst 4 months and 7 days, just to pay their Federal and State taxes. \nThink about that.\n  The fact is that the President has added the largest tax increase in \nhistory. We are paying at the highest tax rates in history, and we are \nstill going into debt phenomenally because the tax increases, like the \ngas tax, have not gone to fill the pot holes in the roads or to help \nour highway system or to help States with their peculiar difficulties \nin highways and roads; those moneys have gone for more social spending, \nmore social welfare spending by none other than Democrats throughout \nthe country.\n  Frankly, they have used the gas tax, which is disproportionately \nunfair to the poor, disproportionately unfair to the West, \ndisproportionately unfair to rural States, and plowed it all back into \ntheir core constituencies right back here, primarily in the East, or in \nother large major urban areas, rather than using those funds to benefit \neverybody through road improvements.\n\n  We are talking about $30 billion here that we are going to repeal. \nOur colleagues on the other side really do not want that repeal to \noccur, because that means there is going to be more pressure on them \nbecause they will not be able to spend more and more buying votes out \nthere in social spending programs, which has been the route that they \nhave taken to power for most of the last 60 years. It is not right. It \nis not right. It is not fair. It is disproportionately harmful to the \npoor. It is disproportionately harmful to the West. It is \ndisproportionately harmful to rural States, and it is time to be fair \nin this process.\n  Well, that is what the repeal of the gas tax will do.\n  I have to say that this 4.3-cent tax has caused gas prices to go up. \nIt is not the only reason it has caused it to go up, but it is one of \nthe pivotal reasons. Gas taxes would not be as high as they are had it \nnot been for that 4.3 cents added on in 1993.\n  We were told time after time by President Clinton in 1993 that the \ntax bill would affect only the very wealthiest in our society. Yet, \nthat bill contained at least nine separate new tax hikes on families \nwho are not wealthy--at least nine.\n  The gas tax increase of 4.3 cents per gallon was one of the worst of \nthose. I wish we could repeal all the 1993 tax bill, because it has \ncaused damaged to our economy.\n  Let me get into the 1993 tax increases on the nonrich:\n  No. 1, increase in individual marginal tax rates. That affects the \nnonrich in the cases of estates and trusts, small businesses, S \ncorporations, and so forth. No question, there has been an increase in \nmarginal tax rates, which always hurts the middle class.\n  No. 2, increase in the percentage of Social Security benefits that \nare taxable. This happened because of President Clinton. That is not \njust on the 2 percent rich, it is on many many senior citizens.\n  No. 3, the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline.\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\n  No. 4, the reduction in the compensation limit for qualified \nretirement plans. This is important.\n  No. 5, reduction in the meals and entertainment expense deduction \nthat has cost an awful lot of damage in the restaurant industry and \nother industries as well, which used to be stronger because they had \nthat deduction.\n  No. 6, the increase in the withholding rate on supplemental \ncompensation.\n  No. 7, the increase in the recovery period for depreciation of \nnonresidential real property.\n  No. 8, limitations in moving expense deductions that have cost the \nmiddle class.\n  No. 9, increased marriage penalties that have always been very, very \nunfair.\n  I have to say, the Heritage Foundation, one of our better think tanks \nhere in Washington, although conservative in nature, recently released \na study that shows that President Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan \ncost the economy $208 billion in lost output from 1993 to 1996. In 1995 \nalone, our gross domestic product would have grown by $66 billion more \nthan it actually did if these taxes had not been raised. Moreover, \nthere would have been 1.2 million more private-sector jobs created \nabsent the 1993 bill, and those jobs would have meant more revenue to \nthe Treasury, not less.\n  The thing that is mind-boggling is what President Clinton said. Why \nwould he say this during his campaign, and then immediately revoke it \nby the tax increase? He said: ``I oppose Federal excise gas tax \nincreases.''\n  Now, why would the President say that if he did not mean it? No \nsooner does he get elected than he does the exact opposite. That is \nwhat Bill Clinton said when he ran for President in 1992: ``I oppose \nFederal excise gas tax increases.''\n  But what he did once he was elected was push through the Democrat-\ncontrolled Congress a permanent 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike as \npart of his overall $268 billion tax increase in 1993, the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n\n  Not a single Republican in the House or the Senate voted for that tax \nincrease. Just think about it. His gas tax increase affects all \nAmericans, not just the rich. In fact, President Clinton's gas tax hike \nhits hardest those families least able to afford it.\n  Now, as Senator Dole said today, drivers across America are paying \nfor the President's mistake. President Clinton raised the gas tax \nhoping to generate $25 billion. That is what the administration \nrepresented before the Senate Finance Committee, upon which I sit. But \nthey thought it would generate $25 billion to help fund the President's \nliberal agenda and social welfare programs, not to fund highway and \ntransportation maintenance, as was historically done with general \nexcise taxes.\n  The President originally wanted to raise the gas taxes even more, \nproposing a sweeping $73 billion Btu energy tax increase in 1993 that \nwould have raised the price of gas by 7.5 cents per gallon. Senate \nRepublicans, under the leadership of Senator Dole, killed that. I was \none of those who worked hard to kill that. We killed Clinton's Btu tax. \nIt should have been killed. It was not fair. It was not fair to the \naverage person, was not fair to society as a whole and, frankly, was \nnot fair in light of the excessive taxes that we are paying today.\n  I might say, voters should not be surprised by the President's gas \ntax increases. As Governor of Arkansas, President Clinton raised the \nState gas tax by a total of 10 cents per gallon from 1979 to 1991. He \nloves to raise taxes. They do it under the guise that they are reducing \nthe deficit, when in fact these taxes have gone for social spending \nprograms. There is no question about it.\n  Let me just say this. The Heritage study also shows that income tax \nrate increases in the 1993 tax bill delivered only 49 percent of the \nrevenues that the President promised we would have or that were \nestimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be received by the \nTreasury. When compared with the jobs that were never created because \nof this bill, this means we sacrificed 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion \nin deficit reduction. This is a very high price to pay for deficit \nreduction that can be achieved in a better way.\n  My Democratic colleagues and the President are quick to defend the \n1993 tax bill by pointing out the progress that has been made in the \ndeficit over the last few years. Let me be clear about this. Balancing \nthe budget should not provide the rationale for raising taxes. It is \nmerely an excuse for those who want to continue the tired, old liberal \npolicies of taxing and spending.\n  For almost half of the last century, the Federal Government has spent \n$1.59 in expenditures for every $1 received through taxes or every new \n$1 in taxes. Government is not taxing the American people to eliminate \nthe deficit; it is taxing the people in order to continue spending. I \ndo not think anybody really doubts that on either side of the floor.\n  We Republicans have demonstrated that we can balance the budget \nwithout increasing taxes. In fact, we balanced the budget while cutting \ntaxes on the American family by providing incentives for new economic \ngrowth.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish.\n  Mr. FORD. I want to ask about Social Security.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield if the Senator wants me to.\n  President Clinton chose to veto the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, just \nas in 1993 he turned his back on the American family and vetoed the \nbill that would have gone a long way toward reversing the tax increases \nhe pushed through in 1993. President Clinton's veto of the Balanced \nBudget Act cost a family of four a minimum of $1,217 a year. A minimum. \nFor many families, it will cost a lot more than that. That is the \naverage family of four. This figure does not even begin to take into \naccount possible tax savings from capital gains tax rate reductions, \nthe adoption credit, the enhanced IRA provisions or deductions for \nstudent loan interest.\n\n  Can you imagine what it really cost the American family? The least it \ncosts them is $1,217 a year. Also, that does not take into account the \nsubstantial savings that would accrue to American families on mortgage \ninterest, auto loans, student loans, other private borrowing, that a \nbalanced Federal budget would mean by lowering interest rates by an \nestimated 2 percent. Those are economic realities.\n  I am the first to agree this 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax repeal would not \nsolve all of our problems. I agree with that. But it is an important \nstart in reversing the trend toward taxing Americans to death. Frankly, \nthat is what we have seen from this administration in the 4 years that \nit has been in existence.\n  I said yesterday was tax freedom day. This is the day that the \nnonpartisan Tax Foundation says that average American workers stop \nworking for the Government and start earning money that they can spend \non their families. That was yesterday. You have the first 5 months of \nthis year. Never has tax freedom day occurred so late in the history of \nthis country as it has in 1996. Look at the calendar. And 1996 is more \nthan a third over.\n  Americans work one-third of the entire year just to support the \nFederal, State and local governments. Just think about it. A family of \nfour in my home State of Utah, with an estimated median income of about \n$45,000, paid $8,800 in direct and indirect Federal taxes. On top of \nthis outrageous amount, they must also pay over $5,700 in State and \nlocal taxes, bringing the total family tax burden to $14,500. This is \nan effective tax rate for the average family of four of over 32 \npercent. Think about it.\n  But if we add to this the cost of Federal and State regulations and \ntheir effect on the prices of goods and services --and, of course, we \nhave had filibusters against trying to change the regulatory system so \nwe can get some reason into it, so people can live within the system, \nso we can still regulate in a reasonable and decent way, so we do not \nhave the overbalances that we have today--even so, if you add the cost \nof Federal and State regulations and the effect they have on the prices \nof goods and services, along with the added interest, the cost the \nfamilies must pay because of our failure to balance the Federal budget, \nthe true family tax burden is even much higher than that $14,500, or 32 \npercent. In fact, these costs are estimated--just these costs alone, \nthese overregulatory costs--at\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nabout $8,600 for a family of four in Utah. Thus, the estimated total \ncost of government to a family of four earning $45,000 a year is over \n$23,000, better than half of what that family has coming in.\n  This is over half of the typical Utah family's income. So when you \ntalk about repealing the gas tax, I say, let us do it. But I call on \nthe President to go beyond this repeal and let us pass more of the \nsignificant tax relief provisions that were included in last year's \nBalanced Budget Act.\n  Having said that about the gas tax, let me just say a few words about \nthe TEAM bill. Having been in labor, one of the few who really came \nthrough the trade union movement, I was a card-carrying union member as \na wood, wire, and metal latherer. I worked in building construction \ntrade unions for 10 years. As one who would fight for the right to \ncollective bargain and who has fought for free trade unionists all over \nthe world, I have to say that to allow what Senator Dole has offered to \nour colleagues on the other side to be stopped--some on the other side \ndo not want to allow employees, workers, if you will, to meet with \nmanagement, in the best safety interests of the workers and of the \ncompanies--is just plain unbelievable.\n  There is only one reason why the folks on this other side take this \nposition. Their biggest single funder of Democratic Party politics in \nthis country happens to be the trade union movement. The trade union \nmovement brings in about $6 billion a year. It is well known in this \ntown that 70 to 80 percent of every dollar in dues that comes in goes \nto paid political operatives who do nothing but push the liberal agenda \nin this country.\n  Even something as simple and as reasonable and as decent as allowing \nworkers to meet with their owners and their managers, in the best \ninterests of safety on the job, is being fought against by these folks \nover here for no other reason than big labor does not want that TEAM \nAct.\n  Now, why do they not want that TEAM Act? I cannot see one good reason \nwhy, except you have to think like they do. They know that the more the \nemployees and the employers get together in meetings and discuss \nthings, the more they find common ground, the better the employees \nunderstand the management concerns, and the better the management \npeople understand the employees' concerns, the better they work \ntogether. Because of that, the union movement believes they will find \nthere is no need for a union because management will treat the \nemployees fairly, and the employees will treat management fairly. Why \npay union dues? That is pretty shortsighted.\n  There are good reasons to have unions. Frankly, unions should not be \nafraid to compete in a reasonable situation. If they have good programs \nand they have good policies and they have good approaches, the \nemployees will join them. If they do not, then they are not going to \njoin. That is why the movement dropped from 33 percent of the work \nforce down to 13 percent of the work force today. It is because of \nbeing afraid of even allowing employees and employers to get together. \nWhy are they not allowed to get together under current law? You would \nthink reasonable, educated, civilized countries would allow employees \nand employers to get together and talk about safety and the best \ninterests of both sides. You would think that would be just a given.\n  The reason it is not a given, Mr. President, is because the National \nLabor Relations Board has been taken over by Clinton appointees who do \nwhatever organized labor within the beltway wants them to do, \nregardless of whether it is in the best interests of the worker. A few \nyears back, the National Labor Relations Board threw out the right to \nhave teamwork together between management and labor, causing a divide \nand divisiveness that should not exist, for no other reason than \nbecause their largest supporters, the union leaders in Washington, did \nnot like it and were afraid they might lose union members because of a \nreasonable relationship with management.\n  That is ridiculous. It is not right. It is not fair. That is what the \nNational Labor Relations Board ruled. Now we are stuck with it unless \nwe pass a statute that allows these two interested parties, who ought \nto be getting along together, who ought to look for common ground, who \nought to work together in the best interests of safety, unless we allow \nthem to get together. That is all this is. It is such a simple, small \nthing, you would think nobody who looks at it objectively and \nreasonably could disagree.\n  Then we have the President at a press conference indicating we are \nslowing things down. Gracious, what will he not say if he can say \nsomething like that? Is there no argument that he will not make no \nmatter how unjustified it might be? We have had almost 70 filibusters \nin a little over a year since the Republicans have taken over. I cannot \nremember ever having anything like that for Republicans when we were in \nthe minority.\n  Now, I will say this: Senator Mitchell had this common habit of \ncoming out here and filing a bill and then filing cloture and accusing \nus of filibuster when nobody on our side intended to filibuster anyway. \nIn almost every case where there was a reasonable bill, the bill passed \nor at least was debated.\n  Here we have had a slowdown on almost everything, and for the last \nnumber of days because the other side wanted the minimum wage. Senator \nDole walks out here and reasonably says, ``We will give it to you and \nlet you have a vote up or down on your bill, on your minimum wage, but \nwe want these two other things that are reasonable--repeal the tax gas \nin the best interests of our citizens, and we certainly, certainly, \nwant to allow employees to meet with their management leaders in order \nto work on the workplace concerns of businesses all over America. \nEmployees have every right to talk to their employers and express their \nconcerns. I think these are reasonable requests, and I think the \nmajority leader is being very reasonable.\n  Frankly, I do not understand why we have to continue to put up with \nthe stonewalling that we have on the other side. Now, I cannot remember \nreferring to stonewalling in several years, and I have not seen the \nword ``stonewalling'' used by the media during the last 2 years, hardly \nat all. I do not recall a time. I am sure there have to be a few times, \nbut I do not recall. It was a daily drumbeat when the Democrats were in \ncontrol and the Republicans were fighting for principles they believed \nin.\n\n  Here is Senator Dole willing to give the other side an opportunity on \nthe principles that they want to fight for, give them a chance to vote \nup or down, and all he asks is we have a chance to vote up or down on \nsome of the principles we want to fight for and let the chips fall \nwhere they may. That is the right way to do it in this particular case. \nIt may be the right way to do it in many cases.\n  Mr. President, it bothers me that underlying this whole thing, \nknowing that Senator Dole, our majority leader, is making an effort to \ntry to bring people together, to try to get the matters moving ahead, \nto do things that give both sides shots at their particular bills, that \nunderlying this whole thing is a deliberate attempt to try to deny \nBilly Dale and his colleagues, former White House staff, who were just \nplain treated miserably, unfortunately, dishonestly, by people who got \ntheir marching orders from, according to those who testified, the \nhighest levels of the White House, from getting just compensation for \nthe attorney's fees they were unduly charged because of the \nmistreatment that they suffered at the hands of the White House.\n  It is a bill that I think would pass the U.S. Senate 100-zip. It is \nbeing held up for no good reason at all. Now, the ostensible reason was \nthat the Democrats did not have a chance to get a vote on the minimum \nwage they wanted to amend to the bill. Now Senator Dole has provided \nthem with that opportunity. Why do they not seize that and let Billy \nDale get compensated?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to know the Senator's feeling on this. Is it the \nSenator's view that the taxpayers ought to pick up the bills of any \nindividual who is indicted by a grand jury, Federal grand jury, and \nthen after indicted, is proved innocent, is not proven guilty, does he \nthink it would be appropriate for the taxpayer to do what he wants to\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\ndo in this particular case for all of those who were indicted by a \nFederal grand jury?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. The fact of the matter is this is a case \nthat everybody agrees is an egregious example of excessive use of \npower, and greedy power at that, of the White House, and this is a case \nwhere the President himself said we should reimburse them with legal \nfees.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I ask the question, I want to make the point \nthat when we set precedence around here----\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask, Who has the floor?\n  Let me say to my distinguished friend and colleague, let me finish \nmaking my explanation, and then I will be glad to yield for another \nquestion.\n  The fact of the matter is we have an injustice here, a gross \ninjustice, which the Democrats and the Republicans admit is a gross \ninjustice, caused by White House personnel and outside people who were \ngreedy. The President wants this to be done and says he will sign the \nbill. It is not comparable to everybody who is indicted.\n  Second, I said yesterday that if people are indicted who are unjustly \ntreated like this because of the same circumstances, I would be the \nfirst to come to the floor and try to help them. But not everyone who \nis indicted fits that category. In fact, very few do. I do not know of \nmany White Houses that have shabbily treated former White House staff \nlike this one has.\n  Now, when we find something similar to that, I am happy to fight for \nit, regardless of their politics or regardless of who they are, \nregardless of whether I like them or do not. I am willing to go beyond \nthat. I would like to right all injustices and wrongs, but the mere \nfact that somebody is indicted does not say we should spend taxpayer \ndollars to help them. We have to look at them as individual cases. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I can say that this is what we \nhave done in the past, what we will do in the future. As I view my job \nas chairman, it is to right wrongs and to solve injustices.\n  Now, we have the distinguished Senator from Arkansas here yesterday \nsaying we should reimburse all of the people who have appeared before \nthe Whitewater committee. Well, we are not giving Billy Dale \nreimbursement for attorney's fees in appearing before Congress. \nFrankly, I do not think you do that until you find out what is the end \nresult of Whitewater, and then maybe we can look at it and see if there \nare some injustices. I think you will be hard pressed to say there is \nsome injustice that comes even close to what has happened to Billy Dale \nand his companions. And if we put it to a test and have a vote on it, I \nthink you would find that 100 percent of the people here will vote for \nit. I think that will be the test.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield for a final question and \nobservation, the reason I raise the question is, I think it is \nimportant when we do take action around here, that we let the taxpayers \nknow what they are paying for. Actually, when this first came up, I say \nto my friend, it did not come into my mind until it was raised by \nanother Senator, who said that there are many people who are indicted \nby a Federal grand jury and then the guilt is not proven.\n  We have to be careful what we are doing here. I think the fact that \nmy friend responded in the way he did, that he is open to looking at \nthis in a larger context, is important because I think whatever we do \nhere will have ramifications. That was the purpose of my question, and \nI thank my friend for answering.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. She makes the very good point that \nwe should not just be an open pocket for people who get indicted.\n  In this particular case, I think almost everybody admits we have to \nright this wrong. It is the appropriate thing to do. There may be \nothers that we will have to treat similarly. I will be at the forefront \nin trying to do so.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me recognize and thank my friend, \nSenator Harkin, who was kind enough to allow me to proceed out of order \nto accommodate my schedule. I ask unanimous consent that he may be \nrecognized next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4833-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4837-S4838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, very soon, we must make an important \ndecision which will lead us to a safer future for all Americans. Mr. \nPresident, today we have highly radioactive nuclear waste and used \nnuclear fuel that is accumulating at over 80 sites in 41 States, \nincluding waste stored at DOE weapon facilities.\n  Here is a chart showing the locations of used nuclear fuel and \nradioactive waste destined for geologic disposal. Each Member can see \nwhere used nuclear fuel is stored in his or her own State. Out at Pearl \nHarbor, we have naval reactor fuel. In Illinois and New Jersey, for \nexample, we have commercial reactors. In many States, particularly on \nthe east and west coasts, we have shut down reactors with spent fuel on \nsite. We have non-Department of Energy research reactors, as indicated \nby the green, in various States. We have DOE-owned spent fuel and high-\nlevel radioactive waste scattered in across the country.\n  The purpose of this chart is to show each Member that used fuel is \nstored in populated areas. It is near neighborhoods, it is near \nschools, it is on the shores of our lakes and rivers, and in the \nbackyards of our constituents young and old all across our land.\n  Now, as you can see, this nuclear fuel is being stored in highly \npopulated areas, near where most Americans live. It may be in your \ntown, my town, your neighborhood, my neighborhood. Unfortunately, used \nfuel is being stored in pools that were not designed for long-term \nstorage. Mr. President, some of this fuel is already over 30 years old. \nWith each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of this \nused fuel at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way \ndiminishes.\n  It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to \nlet this dangerous radioactive material continue to accumulate at more \nthan 80 sites all across America. It is unwise to block the safe \nstorage of this used fuel in a remote area, away from high populations. \nThis is a national problem that requires a coordinated national \nsolution.\n  Senate bill 1271 solves this problem by safely moving this used fuel \naway from these areas to a safe, monitored facility in the remote \nNevada desert. This is a facility designed to safely store the fuel. It \nis the very best that nuclear experts can build--certified safe by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n  Senate bill 1271 will end the practice of storing used fuel on a \nlong-term basis in pools such as Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, California, \nNew York, New Jersey, and 35 other States across the country. And \nSenate bill 1271, Mr. President--make no mistake about it--will solve \nan environmental problem. That is why I was so dismayed to receive the \nstatement of administration policy, dated April 23, 1996, which \nthreatened to veto Senate bill 1271 ``because it designates an interim \nstorage facility at a specific site.''\n  Mr. President, although the statement claims, ``The administration is \ncommitted to resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste \nstorage in a timely and sensible manner,'' such words ring hollow in \nthe context of a threat to veto any legislation that does anything but \nperpetuate the status quo. That is just what a veto of Senate bill 1271 \nwould do.\n  I hope that it is not true, but I have to ask if the President is \nplaying politics with this issue. If so, its a political calculation \nthat I do not understand. Perhaps the President is simply getting poor \nadvice.\n  Are President Clinton and Vice President Gore really telling the \nvoters in Illinois, New Jersey, and all of the other States on this \nmap, that nuclear waste is better stored in their States than out there \nin the Nevada desert? I challenge Vice President Gore, who feels \nstrongly about the environment--much to his credit--to go to the State \nof Minnesota, to go to New Jersey, to go to Wisconsin, and tell those \nvoters that they must continue to store nuclear waste in their State.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  The administration's approach on this matter is simply business as \nusual. The administration's strategy is to avoid making a decision. Mr. \nPresident, that is no strategy at all. But the approach of Senate bill \n1271 is to get the job done, to do what is right for the entire \ncountry.\n  For those who are not familiar with the program, let me describe the \nstatus quo. We have struggled in this country with the nuclear waste \nissue for almost 15 years already, and we have collected $11 billion \nfrom the ratepayers. But the Washington establishment has not delivered \non its promise to take and safely dispose of our Nation's nuclear waste \nby 1998, only 2 years from now. Hard-working Americans have paid for \nthis as part of their monthly electric bill, and they are entitled to \nhave the Government meet its obligation to take the used nuclear fuel \naway. Those people that have paid their electric bills have not gotten \nresults. The program is broken; it has no future unless it is fixed. We \ncan end this stalemate. We can make the right decisions. The job of \nfixing this program is ours. The time for fixing the problem is now.\n  During the debate that will unfold in future days, we will have my \ngood friends, the Senators from Nevada, opposing the bill with all the \narguments they can muster, and that is understandable. They are merely \ndoing what Nevadans have asked them to do. Nobody wants nuclear waste \nin their State. But it simply has to go somewhere.\n  The Senators from Nevada, both friends of mine, have talked to me \nabout this issue, and I understand that they are doing what they feel \nthey must do to satisfy Nevadans. But as U.S. Senators, Mr. President, \nwe must sometimes take a national perspective. We must do what is best \nfor the country as a whole.\n  To keep this waste out of Nevada, the Senators from Nevada will use \nterms like ``mobile Chernobyl'' to frighten Americans about the safety \nof moving this used fuel to the Nevada desert where it belongs. They \nwill not tell you that we have already move commercial and naval \nnuclear fuel today. The commercial industry has shipped over 2,500 \nshipments of used nuclear fuel over the last 30 years, Mr. President. \nThey will not tell you that an even larger amount of used fuel is \ntransported worldwide. Since 1968, the French alone have safely moved \nabout the same amount of spent fuel as we have accumulated at our \nnuclear power plants today. They will not tell you that our Nation's \nbest scientists and our best engineers have designed special casks that \nare safety-certified by the Nuclear Safety Regulatory Commission to \ntransport the used fuel. They will not tell you about the rigorous \ntesting that has been done by the Sandia National Laboratory and others \nto ensure that the casks will safely contain used fuel in the most \nsevere accidents imaginable.\n  There is proof that these safety measures work. Out of the over 2,500 \nshipments of used fuel that have taken place in the United States over \nthe last 30 years, there have been seven traffic accidents involving \nspent nuclear fuel shipments. But when the accidents have happened, the \ncasks have never failed to safely contain the used fuel. Mr. President, \nthere has never been an injury caused by a cask, there has never been a \nfatality, and there has never been damage to the environment.\n  Can the same be said of gasoline trucks? Of course not.\n  Still we can expect that our friends from Nevada will try to convince \npeople that transportation will not be safe. But the safety record of \nnuclear fuel transport, both here and in Europe, speaks for itself.\n  This issue provides a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have \none remote, safe and secure nuclear waste storage facility at the \nNevada test site, the area in the Nevada desert used for nuclear \nweapons testing for some 50 years. Or, through inaction and delay, we \ncan perpetuate the status quo and have 80 such sites spread across the \nNation.\n  Mr. President, it is not morally right to perpetuate the status quo \non this matter. To do so would be to shirk our responsibility to \nprotect the environment and the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren. This Nation needs to confront its nuclear waste problem \nnow. The time is now. Nevada is the place. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the passage of Senate bill 1271.\n  Again, I thank my friend, Senator Harkin, for allowing me the \nopportunity to move ahead of him on the Senate schedule.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague has stepped out. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4837-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4838-S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TEAM ACT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to make some comments on the TEAM \nAct, which is one of the matters that we have been discussing in the \nU.S. Senate. The word ``team,'' of course, is a favorable word in the \nmentality of Americans because we are accustomed to teams. It is an \nOlympic year when we want to support our team, and we want to do well \nin the competition between the nations. So ``team'' has favorable \nconnotations. I think all of us would want to be in favor of an act \ncalled the TEAM Act. But it is far more important that we understand \nthe act itself in that we just have the connotations of the word \n``team.''\n  As a matter of fact, the need to be operating as a team in the United \nStates is a mutually agreed upon concept. We need to operate as a team \nbecause, indeed, we are in competition and the competition is far \ngreater than the competition of the Olympics. We talk about the \ncompetition of the Olympics, ``going for the gold.'' It is an award, \nand it is an honor.\n\n  But to be honest with you, the competition between nations is more \nthan just a competition for an award or for an honor. It is the \ncompetition between nations. The need for productivity which will allow \nAmerica to succeed and to continue to be at the top is a competition \nfor existence. It is the competition for the survival of and for the \nsuccess of our society in the next century. Are we going to prepare for \nthe next century? Are we going to have a framework for work and \nproductivity which allows us to succeed?\n  You have nations approaching the competitive arena of the workplace, \nnations like China. You have the Pacific rim all the way from Korea and \nJapan down through Singapore and Indonesia, hundreds of millions of \nindividuals whose educational levels have skyrocketed, who are poised \nwith the capacity to challenge us for our ability to meet the needs of \nthe world.\n  We as Americans want to be able to meet the needs of the world. When \nwe meet the needs, we have the jobs. When we do not meet the needs, \nsomeone else has the jobs. When we have made the commitment in terms of \nour own development and our own capacity, we will be the people who are \nthe beneficiaries. If we restrain ourselves, if we hamstring ourselves, \nif we decide we do not want to do our very best, we will yield the \ngold, not just the gold medal of the Olympics but the prize of \nenterprise to other countries.\n  We would not think of sending our individuals to the Olympics if we \ndid not allow them to train to be their very best. We would not think \nof taking 9 out of 10 members of the Olympic team and keeping them from \nbeing able to discuss ways to improve their performance with their \ncoaches. It would be unthinkable.\n  Why would a company, or a country, want to restrain its work force, \nor want to restrain its competitors from being at their very best? Yet, \nthat is the strange argument that we hear from those who oppose the \nTEAM Act.\n  Let us just stop for a moment to consider what the TEAM Act \nauthorizes. The TEAM Act authorizes employers to confer with and \ndiscuss with employees ways in which to do a number of things: One, to \nimprove productivity. If they think there is a more efficient way to do \nit, if there is a better way to do it, if there is a better way to\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nbuild the project, if a mousetrap can be improved, the employee is most \nlikely to know about it. After all, if you work on these things 8 hours \na day, 5 days a week, and 50 weeks a year, you are probably likely to \nhave some ideas and very good ideas.\n  Professor Demming in the 1930's, I think, originally wrote about \nthat. We did not take that to heart until the Japanese demonstrated it \nwith their high-quality products and their competition in automobiles \nand electronics, which finally got our attention. We decided to say \nthat we want to be able to tap the energy that exists when workers and \nmanagers talk together to figure out better ways to do things just like \nwhen coaches and players talk together to discuss ways of improving \nperformance.\n  So in the United States there are about 30,000 companies now that \nhave institutionalized this practice of saying to workers, We want to \nget together with you; we want to hear from you about ways that we can \nimprove our performance so that we can have the jobs of the next \ncentury. We want you to be partners with us so that we can get the job \ndone efficiently and effectively so that, in the competition of the \nnext century, America continues to be the survivor; that America \nprovides the much-needed goods and services around this world that \nleaves America at the top of the heap.\n  Good plan. It is working. You have seen it work. You have seen it \nwork in automotives and a variety of other settings. In industry, we \nhave begun to witness a recovery. In automotives, our quality assurance \nhas gone higher and higher until we compete now very effectively with \nthe nondomestic producers in large measure because of what the workers \ncan bring to the equation, their contribution to quality, their \ncontribution to efficiency, their contribution to increased safety, and \ntheir contribution in part because of their realization that when they \nare full-fledged partners and they are real contributors to the \nprocess, they feel a lot better about themselves. I like to think that \nI am respected for what I can be and ought to be.\n  The ability to have these teams is a way of respecting and \nunderstanding the great value that American workers bring to the \nequation. It is the working population of America that distinguishes \nthis country from countries around the globe. Everything was working \npretty well in that direction until, just in this decade, the National \nLabor Relations Board ruled that it is illegal for managers to confer \nwith employees about safety and about a variety of other things.\n  These rulings are so stunning that I think I have to tell you the \nnames of the cases and all to let you know what the National Labor \nRelations Board has forbidden.\n  In the case of Sertafilm and Atlas Micro Filming, the NLRB ruled that \nit was illegal to discuss extension of employees' lunch breaks by 15 \nminutes. Employers could not talk about that with employees.\n  In the case of Weston versus Brooker & Co., the length of the workday \ncould not be discussed--wrong for employers to discuss this with a view \ntoward accommodating the needs and demands of workers. Now, you and I \nknow, with the number of people working in our families and our need to \naccommodate our responsibilities as parents as well as our \nresponsibilities as workers, we need to be able to discuss things like \nworking arrangements with our employers. That is against the law \naccording to the Weston versus Brooker NLRB case, which was decided \njust a few years ago. A decrease in rest breaks from 15 minutes to 10 \nminutes, the U.S. Postal Service could not do that, according to the \nNLRB. Paid holidays were off limits, according to the Singer \nManufacturing case. Extension of store hours during the wheat harvest \nseason, Dillon Stores, 1995, that is off limits. Employers could not \nconfer with their employees about things like this.\n\n  We need to be able to tap the genius, the innovation, the problem-\nsolving capacity of American workers. We have a law against it. Jimmy \nRichards Co., which is a 1974 case, discussing paid vacations was \nillegal.\n  Here are some more. Flexible work schedules. That is interesting to \nme. The NLRB has said that it is illegal for the employer to ask \nemployees what they would like to have and to consider, get into a \ndialog with the employees about what they would like to have in terms \nof flexible work schedules. We need for people to have flexible work \nschedules.\n  As a matter of fact, I have introduced a bill to give to the working \npopulation in the private sector the same kind of break that the \nFederal Government has had for flexible work schedules since 1978. I \nregret to tell you that the administration opposes it. I am sorry about \nthat because the President himself keeps talking about flexible work \nschedules.\n  As a matter of fact, USA Today for Monday of this week talks about \nPresident Clinton, and he is going to hold a convocation about \ncorporate citizenship with dozens of CEO's. According to the newspaper:\n\n       President Clinton has outlined five challenges that he says \n     contribute to corporate responsibility. He singles out \n     companies for praise saying that they should establish \n     family-friendly policies.\n\n  We want to have the TEAM Act, which will allow employers to talk to \ntheir employees about flexible work schedules. You would think, if you \nread the newspaper, that surely since the President is calling upon the \ncorporate community to establish family-friendly policies--and he is \nright in calling on them to do so--he would support the ability of \ncorporations to talk with their employees about flexible work \nschedules. But, no, it is against the law to do so. We want to change \nthe law so that we can operate as a team, so we can talk to each other \nabout the objectives and the working conditions and the safety \nconditions and the like. The President and his administration threaten \nto veto the concept.\n  I began this inquiry for myself about almost a year ago today. \nFrankly, this is May 8, the birthday of a notable Missourian. Harry \nTruman was born on May 8. He sat at one of these desks in the Senate. \nBut on May 10 of last year, I wrote to the Secretary of Labor, Robert \nReich, and I asked him about the TEAM Act. I quoted to him his demands \nupon the American corporation that we would cooperate for flexible work \nschedules and that we would confer with each other and that we would \nact as teams. I asked him to support the TEAM Act because I am a \ncosponsor of the TEAM Act, but, more than that, I asked him to support \nthe TEAM Act because it will help us prepare for the next century. We \nwant the jobs to be here for our children. We do not want the jobs to \nbe overseas for their children. We want to preserve the advantages that \nour forefathers gave us when they worked hard and sacrificed. The \nproductivity, the competitiveness, the capacity of American workers \nshould not be frittered away because we do not allow the team to confer \nwith the coaches.\n  We are 363 days away from the time I sent this letter, and I have yet \nto receive a response. I suspect it is very difficult to respond to \nthis letter because their position is that they want to veto the TEAM \nAct. They oppose the TEAM Act. People on the other side of the aisle \nhave opposed the TEAM Act consistently, and yet all their speeches are \ntalking about teamwork.\n  I was just very pleased with the President's references to teamwork \nin his State of the Union Message. He called upon the citizens of this \ngreat country to work together. He called upon the Congress to call for \nteamwork, saying that we can only do things together; we cannot do them \nseparately. But the TEAM Act still seems to be beyond the teamwork he \nis calling for.\n  Where is it legal in the United States for people, employers to \nconfer with employees? Where can that happen? Well, it can happen when \nthere is a union present. But it is illegal to do it if there is not a \nunion there. Really, the fact is that only 11 percent of America's \nworkers outside of Government are in unions. So for 9 out of 10 workers \nin America we are tying their hands. We are saying you cannot have the \nbenefits of these kinds of discussion groups. You cannot have the \nimproved potentials that come. You cannot have the productivity. You \ncannot have the chance for success that you could otherwise have.\n  I think, if it is appropriate and good to have this kind of \ndiscussion in union facilities, and it is--I mean our automotive people \nhave made great strides\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\nin improving productivity and improving quality and improving safety \nand improving on-time deliveries; they have done it all, where it is \nallowed--I do not see why we do not allow this in other areas as well.\n  So I believe we ought to allow this to extend to the rest of the \ncommunity. Nine out of ten workers should not be forbidden. There are \nthose who say the TEAM Act will permit an employer to have sham unions. \nNot so. No rule about sham unions is changed at all. I mean, if a \nperson wants to petition to have a union election, the same rights \ninure, the same rights to vote in favor of a union inure to workers \nwhether the TEAM Act is in place or not. The TEAM Act would merely \nauthorize the coach to talk with the players, to decide things that \nwould improve productivity.\n  There is an interesting case in my State. The company is named the \nEFCO company. They employed about 100 people or so when I became \nGovernor 10 years ago--12 years, I guess. Time flies. They decided they \nwanted to be expert. They wanted to be the best in their field. They \nknew they could not do that just from a management perspective, so they \nhad to call upon the team of employees. They invited them in. One of \nthe first things they wanted to address was on-time deliveries. They \nhad not been making on-time deliveries very well, 70-some percent in \non-time deliveries. And they wanted to boost that. They moved from 70-\nsome percent in on-time deliveries to well over 90 percent in on-time \ndeliveries by tapping the ingenuity, creativity, understanding, and \nperspective of people on the job floor.\n  What did that do to the job? Did that hurt the working people of \nMissouri? Not really. Because that company went from 100-plus to 1,000-\nplus people in manufacturing, and their architectural glass now graces \nskyscrapers not only across America but around the world. It came as a \nresult of the increased capacity of workers when they conferred with \neach other in the context of talking with the coach, with management. \nIf we want to go for the gold, I think we have to be able to do that.\n  The folks on the other side of the aisle said there are 30,000 \nemployers who are doing it now, it must be legal. It is hard to say it \nis legal when the NLRB is out filing charges and saying it is illegal \nand chilling this operation. Frankly, in my judgment, I think it is \nimportant to note if people on the other side of the aisle say it must \nbe legal, and there are 30,000 companies that are doing it now, what is \nthe big hubbub? Why filibuster the potential? Why oppose it? Why say it \nis a draconian measure, that it is going to ruin the country? You \ncannot have it both ways. If there are 30,000 people that have them and \nyou do not think it is a problem, why say that this is the end of our \nability to be competitive?\n\n  I believe people want to be able to confer with the coach. People \nwant to be able to confer with each other. People want to be able to \nimprove the working conditions. I was just stunned in reading more of \nthese things that were off limits for discussion. It was off limits to \ntalk about bonuses to be given to people as compensation for their good \nwork, off limits to talk about merit wage increases, off limits to talk \nabout free coffee, off limits to talk about safety issues. I was \nstunned.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was trying to pay attention to the Senator. Will the \nSenator repeat again how many people there are working in the United \nStates that have these kind of arrangements? I thought I heard 30,000. \nWill the Senator please clarify that for me so I have an understanding \nof that figure? Was it 30,000 different businesses? Or 30,000 people? I \nam sorry, I just did not hear it and I apologize.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There are 30,000 employers, I believe, that have sought \nto use this kind of collaboration.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Was that 30,000 that use this?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That have sought to do this, yes, and some are not any \nlonger doing it. Obviously, when the NLRB began to prosecute this as a \nviolation of the law, there are those who have chilled their operation. \nThere are some under an order to quit. They have been ordered to stop \nconferring about things.\n  One of the things they were ordered to stop conferring about was \nsafety. It stunned me, the Dillon case said it was inappropriate to \ndiscuss safety labeling of electrical breakers. I would certainly hope \nif I were employed in a plant you could confer with management about \nthe appropriate labeling of electrical breakers.\n  But tornado warning procedures--I know there is going to be \ndiscussion about tornado procedures. I mean, if the tornado starts to \nhit the plant, there will be discussion, regardless of whether the NLRB \nsays it is legal or not. But I would hope it is not illegal to do so in \nadvance. The absurdity of saying it is illegal for employers to discuss \nwith employees evacuation procedures in the event of a tornado points \nout the fact that this law, which was passed in the mid-1930's, is so \nout-of-step with America of the year 2000.\n\n  It is our job to prepare for the future. We ought to be saying we \nwant more discussion between employees and employers and I am pleased \nthat the President is saying that. He is calling this conference to say \nhe wants more discussion. But to say you only want more discussion in \nthe context of unionized plants, which represent 11 percent of the \nworking people of this country, and you will not allow it in terms of \nthe other 89 percent or 88 percent, that boggles the mind. That \nchallenges any credible or reasonable approach to the thing.\n  If, indeed, we want to be competitive and if, indeed, we want people \nto have job satisfaction and we want them to have job security, we will \nbuild the strongest job base possible and we will not say to all those \npeople who are not members of unions: You are not intelligent enough, \nstrong enough or worth enough to be able to confer with your employers, \nand you will not have the ability to tell whether you are in a union or \nnot.\n  I have had the wonderful privilege of going home to work. It is one \nof the things I do as a U.S. Senator. I go home, work on production \nlines. I have worked next to people filling feed sacks. I have worked \nnext to people building windows and window components for new \nconstruction. I worked in a wide variety of things. I do not care what \njob I have done, whether it has been assembly or manufacturing or if \nhas even been in the service industry--one time I helped prepare tax \nreturns--everyone that I have ever talked to was plenty intelligent \nenough to know how to make improvements and could make suggestions. And \nthey all knew whether or not they were in a union and would know the \ndifference between a sham union and a real union. And they would all \nknow how to call the NLRB if there was an unfair labor practice and \nmake that kind of complaint.\n  For the resistance to mount to the authorization for American workers \nto talk with their employers about safety conditions, about improving \nproductivity, about innovation, about improving marketability, even \nabout sales practices and, sure, about safety--things like leaving the \nbuilding in the event of a tornado? Here is a case which said for the \nemployer to talk with the employees about rules relating to employees \nthat got in fights was illegal. I would think it would be important, to \nconfer with our workers on things like that.\n  The purpose of committees--they are designed to improve the security \nand productivity of American jobs and we should enact the TEAM Act. Let \nme just give a few words from the language of an administrative law \njudge who ruled on one of these cases. I quote the administrative law \njudge's opinion from the EFCO opinion. I am quoting now.\n\n  The committees ``were established by the company, in furtherance of \nChris Fuldner's [that's the CEO's] vision for a more productive, more \nprofitable and more satisfying place for employees to work, [by \nimproving] employment policies, employee benefits, employee safety; and \nemployee suggestions.''\n  That is what these things were created for, ``To make a more \nproductive, more profitable, and more satisfying place for employees to \nwork, [by improving] employment policies, employee benefits, employee \nsafety; and employee suggestions.''\n  The opinion went on to say, ``In Fuldner's view, management should \nencourage employees to feel good about themselves and their jobs, and \nmanagement should try to keep employees\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nhappy with their benefits, and to appreciate these benefits.''\n  That was the goal. The administrative law judge confessed that these \nwere all the positive benefits. But then said that the law requires \nthat these be stricken as inappropriate because the company not only \ntalked about these benefits but actually took them to heart, provided \nthings like places for the groups to meet, and pencils and papers upon \nwhich they could write.\n  We started out talking about the Olympics. We would not want to send \nour team to the Olympics without a chance to win. We do not want \nAmerican employees to compete in the world marketplace without the \nability to win. You would not think of sending 9 out of 10 athletes to \nthe Olympics without allowing them to talk with their coaches and each \nother about ways to improve their performance, and yet, we have a rule \nin American industry that to confer with workers, 9 out of 10 of them--\nthere are 11-something percent that are in unions; they are allowed to \nmake these discussions--for the ones not in unions, it is against the \nlaw.\n\n  I do not think we can afford to look to the future and say to 88 or \n89 percent of our work force, ``You can't take advantage of your \ncreativity, your innovation, your wisdom, and share it with your \nemployer and improve productivity and performance in order to be on a \nwinning team.''\n  Because we cannot afford to go into the competitive marketplace with \nour hands tied behind our back, we should enact the TEAM Act, which \nprovides specific authority, not for anything great, not for anything \noutlandish, but basically for something the President says he wants: \ncooperation, teamwork--he asked for it in his State of the Union \nMessage--between employees and employers.\n  I believe, if we provide the American people, through the right legal \nframework, the opportunity to cooperate and work as teams, we will come \nhome with the gold. We have shown it over and over again; even when we \nslip behind, if you let the American people put their shoulder to the \nwheel and their nose to the grindstone, we cannot be beaten. But if you \nhamstring us for special interests rather than turn us loose to win the \ngame, we will have a hard time competing.\n  We must enact the TEAM Act in behalf of the workers of today and the \nchildren of tomorrow for the jobs we hold, not only for us, but we hold \nthem in trust for those who will follow us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement, the Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President.\n  Mr. President, I was listening to the statements by my friend from \nMissouri, with whom I serve on the committee of jurisdiction dealing \nwith this so-called TEAM Act, and I will use that phrase, ``so-called \nTEAM Act.''\n  Listening to my friend from Missouri and looking at the title of this \nbill, the TEAM Act, which stands for, if I am not mistaken, ``teamwork \nfor employees and management,'' I cannot help but be reminded of that \nwonderful phrase from ``Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking \nGlass,'' where Humpty-Dumpty is talking to Alice. Let me paraphrase: \n``When I use a word it means just what I mean it to mean.''\n  And Alice says, ``Well that's not fair. It doesn't work that way.''\n  And Humpty-Dumpty says: ``The real question is, who's going to be the \nboss?''\n  That is really what this is all about. Who is going to be the boss? \nAre we, in fact, going to have a structure that allows for real \ncooperation?\n  I will say to my friend from Missouri that real cooperation, \nproductive cooperation, can only occur when the parties who are seeking \nto cooperate do so on a level playing field. To have one side or the \nother impose a structure, to impose rules, to impose what the framework \nis is not going to lead to productive cooperation. What my friend from \nMissouri is advocating would be like--and under the TEAM Act, I do not \nsay my friend from Missouri--but under the TEAM Act, so-called TEAM \nAct, it would be like if Senator Dole were to pick the representatives \nof the Democratic Party to represent the Democratic Party on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will in just a second. I just want to finish my thought \non that. So, again, we would not want that to happen. Maybe Senator \nDole would like that to happen now that he is majority leader, or \nperhaps if the tables were turned and the Democrats were in charge, \nmaybe the Democratic leader would like to pick who represents the \nRepublicans.\n  I think the Senator sees what I am getting at. But it can only be \ndone if you have that level playing field. I think we have that level \nfield. There is nothing in section 8(a)(2) now that prohibits \nmanagement and labor from getting together to discuss these items and \nto have working relationships. I see them all the time. It just comes \nabout when management says, ``We want to cooperate and here's the terms \nof our cooperation. As long as you agree, we can cooperate.''\n  That is what we are trying to avoid. That is really what this so-\ncalled TEAM Act does.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. You have said you do not think progress can be made as \nlong as the management has the prerogatives that we ask for in the TEAM \nAct. We are really asking for the prerogatives to confer. If there is \nnothing in the law against it, why is this so terrifying?\n  In the one case where they have tried to shut this down in Missouri, \nwhich is the most notable case in my State, it went from 100 employees \nto 1,000 employees. The workers have stormed my office and said, ``We \nwant this. The National Labor Relations Board is keeping us from doing \nthis.''\n  It seems to me you are saying it will not work in theory. But there \nare a thousand workers in Monett, MO, saying, ``It sure works in \npractice, because we have 10 times the jobs we used to have, and we \nlike it.''\n  I met with 300 or 400 workers this morning who were here to lobby the \nCongress saying, ``Let us keep doing what we are doing.''\n  I understand you might say theoretically it cannot work. You said \nthere cannot be any progress under the things we are asking for, and \nthe things we are asking for, when it was allowed to operate that way--\nI saw one plant in my State that went from 100 workers to 1,000 \nworkers. I call that progress.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will say to my friend from Missouri, I can give \nexamples in my own State and around the Nation of businesses, \ncompanies, where the owners and the managers deal forthrightly and with \nevery sense of equality with the workers. Some of those plants are not \norganized, they are not organized labor. So they say, ``We don't need \norganized labor. Look, we get along fine, the workers like it, we have \ngreat benefits, we have a good system set up for any kind of dispute \nresolutions.'' That is true. There are a lot of those around. But the \nfact is there are a lot more that maybe are not, and that is why we \nhave labor law, that is why we have the National Labor Relations Act. \nThat is why we have section 8(a)(2), to provide a framework whereby \nworkers can select their own representatives and where they are on an \nequal footing with management.\n  I suppose the Senator disagrees with my philosophy on this. My \nphilosophy is that capital and labor ought to be represented equally. I \ndo not think capital ought to be above labor, nor do I think labor \nought to be above capital, but I think the two ought to work together. \nI believe it is not in the best interest of our capitalistic system to \nplace capital above labor, because that will destroy our productivity \nand destroy our labor force in this country.\n  I also think the opposite is not good either, trying to elevate labor \nover capital. So we have to try to keep a balance. That is what the \nNational Labor Relations Act is about; that is what section 8(a)(2) is \nabout.\n  I am sure the Senator can find examples of businesses where they \ntreat the workers fine; gosh, why do you need a labor union for all \nthis? Yes, I can show you examples of that in my own State, too.\n  The Senator talks about the EFCO case in Monett, MO, but there is \nanother side to that story. I listened to the Senator from Missouri \ntalking\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nabout this example of a circuit breaker switch or tornado warning. I \nbelieve the Senator is a good lawyer, and it is like if you only read \nthe prosecution side of a case, you say the person is guilty. If that \nis all you read is the prosecution side, you say the person is \nguilty. If you read the defense side, you say, ``Hey, that person's \ninnocent.'' To find out the truth of the facts, you have to read both \nsides. I do not know what the whole story is about the circuit breaker \nor the tornado warnings. I do not know all the facts. But I would like \nto know the whole story.\n\n  It is like EFCO. There is another side to that story. In fact, I will \nstart to go through some of that now. But the fact is, that EFCO really \nstarted reacting only when the employees started to organize. There was \nthe threat of that.\n  The Senator says, hundreds of employees came to him and said, ``We \nlike this, and we want to continue it.'' Yes, I can understand that, if \nthey are afraid of losing their jobs because they did not have that \nkind of bargaining unit, but I thought I might just go through the \nsequence of events that led up to the administrative law judge's ruling \non the EFCO.\n  I think that my friend from Missouri and others have mischaracterized \nthis case and what the decision represents. My friend from Missouri and \nothers use the EFCO decision as really an example of why we need this \nbill. Quite frankly, I think it is an example of why we really do not \nneed this bill.\n  Let me go through some of the factors here. If the Senator from \nMissouri wants to try to correct me on this, he should feel free to do \nso. I am trying to get to the bottom of this and the facts. In April \n1992--first of all, the administrative law judge's decision in EFCO \nruled that four inplant committees were unlawfully dominated and \nassisted by EFCO, by the management. None of those committees \ndemonstrated ``shared management decisionmaking or co-determination of \ncooperation by the work force,'' but they all resembled classic forms \nof management-directed sham bargaining vehicles, or ``employer \nrepresentation plans, that were deliberately outlawed by the Wagner Act \nof section 8(a)(2).''\n  So what happened in this case? In April 1992, EFCO's president \nsuddenly directed its plant facilitator to revive a defunct safety \ncommittee. The plant facilitator announced the formation of the \ncommittee on April 21, 1992, defining its role as setting and enforcing \nsafety policies. He, the plant facilitator, selected the members of the \ncommittee from volunteers, and they shared the first meeting on June 4, \n1992.\n  He was succeeded as the director of the committee by EFCO's safety \ndirector, who continued to set the agendas for the meetings. The \ncommittee never had or exercised any authority to enforce or discipline \nviolations of safety policies--never.\n  In September 1992, EFCO's president announced the employee benefit \ncommittee to the employees on September 8, 1992, defining its function \nas soliciting ideas regarding employee benefits from the employees and \nmaking recommendations to the management committee, which was EFCO's \ncore management group--and in which, I might add, no rank-and-file \nemployees participated. This was all management directed.\n  EFCO's chief financial officer selected the 10 committee members \nagain from volunteers, but those volunteers previously screened by the \nhuman resources manager, again, were part of management. Among the \nappointees was a supervisor and the president's confidential secretary. \nImagine that. They were part of the team they selected to represent the \nemployees.\n  At the initial meeting on October 1, 1992, EFCO's president \ndesignated the first issues to be considered and directed that other \nissues be solicited from the employees. The human resources manager, \nthe CFO, and, later, the comptroller attended the committee meetings. \nThe committee's chairman met with the management committee to discuss \nand clarify the committee's recommendations. The management committee \ndetermined whether or not to adopt the committee's recommendations.\n  Let me repeat that. The management's committee determined whether or \nnot to adopt the committee's recommendation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator's position that the management should \nnot make the final decision about procedures, that it is inappropriate \nto confer with workers unless you turn over the final decision to them? \nI mean, it seems to me that----\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, management always makes the ultimate decision. \nHowever, it is this Senator's position that when we are talking about \nteamwork, in these kinds of structures, there ought to be a level \nplaying field so that the employees can pick their own representatives \nwhere there is not the heavy hand and the ever present authority of \nmanagement there guiding, directing, and selecting, and then have that \ndiscussion proceed, have the committees, management, labor committees \njointly reach their agreements, and then, yes, management can sign off \non it. That was not the structure in this case.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So it is the Senator's position that management could \nonly adopt a policy which had been previously forwarded to them by the \nworkers? I mean, as I understand it, you allow workers, their \ncontribution to be made, but you do not have to surrender the \nmanagement of the corporation to do it. I do not think most workers \nwant you to surrender, but they want input.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would say to my friend, they want input that is genuine \ninput from the employees, from employee organizations that are not \nstructured by management--as I just pointed out, this was structured by \nmanagement. The representatives were selected from volunteers by \nmanagement, not the employees. Management selected them. I just pointed \nout that management selected the confidential secretary of the \npresident.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Do you think the confidential secretary of the \npresident should not have the right to participate in making \ncontributions like other workers?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If they work on the management side. But let the workers \ndecide who they want to represent them, not management. That is my \npoint.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe there are differences. That is more of a side \nversus side rather than a team here. It is this Senator's understanding \nthat we ought to operate as a team, not one side versus another. We \nought to try to work together.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But you see, in order for a team to work, there must be \nopen discourse, there must be a consideration, and there must be not \njust the semblance of, but the genuine foundation of cooperation and \nequal participation.\n  See, I think what my friend from Missouri still believes is that \nmanagement ought to be able to tell workers what to do all the time \njust because they own the plant. They ought to be able to tell a worker \nexactly what to do, when to do it and everything else, and if the \nworker does not like it, out the door. I do not happen to believe that, \nyou see. I am sorry we have a philosophical difference. I happen to \nbelieve that workers, that labor should take equal positions with \ncapital. They both ought to be respected.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. How do you break the deadlock in the case of a deadlock \nunder your system, if they are equal positions and one says yes and one \nsays no? Are you saying that if the workers say, ``I don't want to do \nthat,'' and the employer says, ``We need to have that done,'' is it a \ndeadlock for you, or who breaks the deadlock?\n  Mr. HARKIN. In all of the organizations that I have seen which are \norganized under 8(a)(2), where you have employer representatives and \nyou have management and where they met in that spirit of mutual \nrespect, I can tell you I have not seen one case, nor do I know of one, \nwhere there has been that kind of a gridlock and deadlock.\n  I think there is an assumption by the Senator from Missouri that \nlabor is always--or at least sometimes--always going to act in a way \nthat is going to be detrimental to the management. Workers do not want \nto do that. They want the company to function correctly. What they want \nis their rights protected. They want their rights protected.\n  No one wants to return to slavery in this country where someone just \ntells a\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\nhuman being, ``Look, you do as I say, or else, out the door.'' We have \nadvanced beyond that. We do not want to go back to the old days where \nlabor had no rights whatsoever.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe we have rights, and I think they ought to be \nprotected, but I believe that when the employer says something needs to \nbe done, it has to be that way. I would say this, and I thank the \nSenator, and I will not further interrupt your speech, but I would just \nask----\n  Mr. HARKIN. We ought to have more discussions like this.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. My whole point is, it is not my way or the highway. My \nwhole point is, we need to allow managers to welcome and to capitalize \non and to implement and to benefit from the special expertise, \ncreativity, and input from people in the production pool. Then it is a \nvery valuable thing. It is not that it is antagonistic. I do not think \nmanagement can survive without it.\n  I do believe you are right, that there are very few times when it is \nagainst the interests of management to hear from labor. I think in the \noverwhelming number of cases really what I have sought to do is to \nprovide a framework in which that is something that is legal and is \nappropriate and management is free to solicit the view of labor and to \ngo and ask for it.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I think we ought to have more like \nthis. I would be glad to discuss it even further because I think we \nstart to get to the real differences here and the views of what we are \ntrying to do here in this bill.\n  Again, I guess the Senator and I just have a gentlemen's disagreement \non the role of labor and management in our society.\n  Again, I have seen so many times in our country where management is \nopen, respectful, where they really encourage employees to get \ntogether, to organize and to bargain with them in good faith. That is \nthe most productive unit you have in America.\n  It is the cases where an employer comes in and says, ``Look, I know \nwhat is best. I will set up the structure. You can give me your advice \nif you want, but if I do not like it I will throw it out the door,'' \nand there is not the sense that workers really have a legitimate role \nto play in the decisions that affect their very jobs, that affect the \nfuture of that plant. When that happens, then I think productivity \nfalls.\n  Again, I point out to my friend from Missouri, we have had section \n882 all these years. We have labor-management councils. They operate in \nmy State. Building trades are working, I know in my Quad Cities area, \nthe Davenport area and in Des Moines, where building trades are working \nwith contractors. We call these labor-management councils. They work \nwonders. It is done in a sense where you have a level playing field. I \nthink what my friend from Missouri basically is saying, ``Look, \nmanagement in the end ought to control everything.''\n  I am saying that in a team if you have this real teamwork, the \nemployees have to know that they are equal partners in making the \nproductivity force in America move forward. That is why, I repeat, I \nget back to the EFCO situation here, we hear about EFCO, but when you \ngo through the whole history of EFCO you find this is a classic case of \nwhy section 882 is necessary.\n  I ended on September 1992 when the management committee determined \nwhether or not to adopt the committee's recommendations. Now we go to \nDecember 1992, on December 28, EFCO's president created the employee \nsuggestion screening committee. He did it by memorandum to the six \nemployees he appointed to the committee. That is not bad. Listen to \nthat: EFCO's president created the employee suggestion screening \ncommittee. He did it by memorandum to the six employees he appointed to \nthe committee.\n  How much freedom and how much do you think that these six employees, \nhandpicked by the president, is going to take a position contrary to \nthe president's position? Not only that, the president defined the \ncommittee's purpose as reviewing and referring to management with \nrecommendations, employee suggestions. EFCO issued a general \nannouncement of the committee's formation and solicited suggestions \nfrom all employees on January 14, 1993. EFCO's senior vice president \nand its CFO were assigned to attend the meetings. Again, you have a \nmeeting, you have the senior vice president, the chief financial \nofficer sitting there, listening to everybody. Again, that heavy hand \nover everyone. The CFO set forth the agenda at the first committee \nmeeting. Not a spirit of, ``OK, representatives of labor, what would \nyou like our agenda to be?'' No, management saying, ``Here is the \nagenda, here is what we are going to discuss.''\n  The elected chairman of this committee--mind you, this is a committee \nof six employees handpicked by the president--the elected chairman of \nthe committee was promoted to a management position in the summer and \nyet continued to chair the meetings. The committee had no authority to \ndecide which suggestions would be adopted. None. They could pass them \non, but they had no authority to decide. Again, back to my friend from \nMissouri, he said, yes; we should give management suggestions. We \nshould let employees suggest things. If management does not want to do \nthem, to heck with them.\n  Well, I tend to think if you will have this type of arrangement you \nshould have employees and management together in a teamwork, and if \nthey are equal, and if they have equal status, then if they make \nsuggestions that ought to be adopted by that committee, representing \nboth management and labor--I do not know what the exact effects are if \nthey do not reach a agreement. I assume if they do not reach agreement \nit would not be adopted. If there is gridlock you do not adopt. If they \nagree, it ought to be adopted, not reviewed further, and adopted by \nmanagement.\n  Finally, January 1993, January 14, 1993, EFCO announced that it was \nestablishing an employer policy review committee, whose purpose was to \ngather comments and ideas from the employees regarding company \npolicies, and to make policy recommendations to the management \ncommittee. The human resources manager--this is part of management--\nselected the committee members. Again, the management selected the \ncommittee members. The management appointed the cochairman. The manager \nalso attended committee meetings. One of the members of the employee's \ngroup was a supervisor, and a cochairman was shortly promoted to a \nsupervisory position.\n  EFCO's president attended the first meeting on February 9, 1993. Here \nis what he did. He laid out the ground rule. He dictated the first \npolicy to be considered. He issued a deadline for the presentation of a \nrecommendation to the management committee. It does not sound quite \nlike equal representation of management and employees. It is sort of \nlike the management saying, ``OK, again, here is the policy to be \nconsidered, here are the ground rules, here is the deadline for you to \nsubmit suggestions to the management committee,'' and again, those \nsuggestions might be accepted or they might not be accepted.\n  The appointed cochairman met with the management committee to discuss \nrecommended policies and the management committee determined which \nrecommendations would be adopted. Again, EFCO set up the elaborate sham \nstructure, management laid out the ground rules, management picked many \nof the people to be on it, they dictated the policies and they said, \nOK, if you come up with a suggestion or recommendation, it goes to the \nmanagement committee, and that management committee decides what will \nbe adopted.\n  Again, I guess we get back to my friend from Missouri. His philosophy \nis if you are management, your word is God and you don't need employee \ninput. I am sorry, I disagree with that. I disagree with that because I \nthink that labor and management ought to both be equally represented in \nthese kinds of situations.\n  In short, EFCO unilaterally decided upon and formulated the program \nof employee committees. It created committees and determined their \nsize, functions and procedures. It appointed their members and included \nsupervisors among their membership. It set the scope of each \ncommittee's concerns, goals, and limitations. It established the \ncommittee's agendas. It directed the committees to solicit opinions, \nideas, and suggestions from other\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nemployees. The committees met on company property, during working \nhours. High management officials attended these meetings. Committee \nmembers were paid for the time spent on committee work and EFCO \nprovided any necessary materials or supplies.\n  Cumulatively, when you look at this, the committee dealt with EFCO as \ncompany-created and company-directed representatives on every \nconceivable area of employees' wages, hours and working conditions. The \nvery existence of those committees was and is dependent upon EFCO's \nunfettered discretion. Moreover, EFCO endowed the committees with \nabsolutely no actual power. The company reserved to itself the \nexclusive authority to decide which recommended suggestions, policies, \nsafety rules, or employee benefits would be adopted. The committees \nwere not even authorized to administrator or enforce those of the \nrecommended policies or rules actually implemented by management.\n  Again, I think when you look at the whole case, when you do not just \nread the prosecution side, when you read both the prosecution side and \nyou read the defense side as in any case, perhaps we get to the truth. \nThe truth is that EFCO wanted to set up a structure whereby, yes, \nemployees could give suggestions, only under the steady gaze and the \nheavy hand of management, where those representatives would be picked \nby management, where the structures and guidelines would be established \nby management, and where in the end, where any suggestion, any advice, \nwould then go to a management committee to be finally acted upon, \nadopted or reject. Again, a clear example of why we need section 882.\n  Well, I guess it really boils down to, if you believe that workers \nare intelligent, if you believe that workers have the best interests of \ntheir country at heart, if you believe that workers have the best \ninterests of their employer and their factories and their plants and \nplaces of work at heart, if you believe that, then you ought to permit \nworkers to sit at the table with management. That is what section \n8(a)(2) does; it permits workers to sit at the table.\n  This so-called TEAM Act says, ``Well, you have been at the table all \nthese years under section 8(a)(2).'' You know, we have had a pretty \ngood run of it since the Depression. We are the most productive nation \non Earth today, as we have been for the last 50 years. Oh, we always \nhear about these other countries, but the fact is, American \nproductivity, last year, was higher than any other country in the \nworld--output per hours worked. Oh, yes, for the last 50 years we have \nbeen the most productive nation on Earth. We built the freest, \nstrongest nation the world has ever seen. We have built great \nuniversities and colleges. We have the best medical research anywhere \nin the world. We have the freest society. We have the greatest \nopportunity for the greatest number of people. And guess what? We did \nit under the Wagner Act. We did it with section 8(a)(2), and we did it \nwith labor sitting at the table.\n  Now we hear voices--my friend from Missouri among them--who say labor \nno longer needs to be at the table. Management is at the table; labor \nis sitting on a lower chair. They are down a little bit lower. They are \nsort of sitting on the floor. If the management would deign to give \nthem some crumbs off the table, that is fine. If management does not, \nwell, that is fine, also, because if the workers do not like it, they \ncan get off the floor and walk out the door. Well, that is what has \nbeen happening, and that is what is behind this so-called TEAM Act. I \ndo not ascribe any bad motives to anyone. My friend from Missouri is an \nhonorable gentlemen. But I just believe that this policy is totally \nmisdirected. I think it flies in the face of what we in America have \ndone over the last 50 years and what we are still accomplishing in \nbecoming the most productive nation on Earth.\n  Mr. President, there is a line from one of my favorite plays that \ngoes something like this:\n\n       Life is like cricket. We play by the rules, but the secret, \n     which few people know, that keeps men of class far apart from \n     the fools, is to make up the rules as you go.\n\n  Well, I suppose if you want to keep management up and labor down, you \nmake up new rules as you go along. That is what this is. We are making \nup new rules--rules that would take away a legitimate right of labor to \nbe heard and to sit at the table. No, I am sorry, Mr. President, this \nis not a team act. This is not a team act at all. This breaks down the \nteam. This is a class act, making one class of management and owners at \na higher level than the laborers.\n  So, Mr. President, this is not just a little piece of legislation. I \nthink the majority leader referred to it as a ``minor'' piece of \nlegislation, and no one should bother about it. It is not a minor piece \nof legislation. It is a dagger right at the heart of what has made this \ncountry so productive over the last 50 years. It is a dagger right at \nthe heart of our workers in this country, and we should not let it pass \nthis floor.\n  We ought to reaffirm, once again, our commitment to a level playing \nfield and, as John L. Lewis once said, make sure labor has a seat at \nthe table, not on the floor, where labor would partake of the same meal \nas management and not just get the crumbs from the table.\n  This bill would undo all that we have done in our society to give our \nworking people a decent voice, to give them the recognition, which is \ndue any human being, that their labor is worth something, that they \nthemselves are human beings, and that labor is not just another unit of \nproduction to be written off and thrown out the back door; but that our \nworking people are more than just numbers on a piece of paper, or \nmachines on a shop floor, and that they deserve, and ought to have, by \nright and by law, all of the protections that the Wagner Act and \nsection 8(a)(2) provides them.\n\n  This Senate and this Congress would do a disservice to our country \nwere we to let this TEAM Act pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am greatly disappointed that my Democratic \ncolleagues are continuing to block repeal of the Clinton gas tax. When \nPresident Clinton and the Democratic Congress, without a single \nRepublican vote, passed the biggest tax increase in our Nation's \nhistory in 1993, they said that their $268 billion tax increase was a \ntax increase on the wealthy. Well, now they have a chance to repeal a \ntax that hits the lower and middle income people the hardest, and they \nare refusing to do so.\n  Make no mistake, the gas tax, which was part of that massive tax \nincrease, is a tax burden that is borne by virtually every American. \nEvery mother who drives her children to school, every commuter, every \nfamily who drives to church, every senior who rides the bus to go \nshopping, every family planning a summer vacation gets hit by this tax.\n  Let us be clear. Democrats are denying tax relief to each of these \nAmericans. Incredibly, some of my Democratic colleagues have called for \neven higher gas taxes. Maybe they were not listening when President \nClinton said last fall that he thought he raised taxes too much. \nDespite this admission by President Clinton, our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are threatening to shut down the Senate because \nthey do not want to let this tax cut for working Americans come up for \na vote.\n  The distinguished minority leader said yesterday that the Democrats \nwould shut down the Senate over this tax cut. By shutting down the \nSenate, the Democrats are now blocking not only a tax cut for working \nAmericans, but they are blocking the taxpayer bill of rights; they are \nblocking consideration of a constitutional amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget; they are blocking the opportunity for commonsense \nhealth care reform; they are blocking reauthorization of Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, while I am disappointed by the words and actions of \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am not \nsurprised. Let me explain.\n  This is a chart comparing the records on taxes of the 103d Congress, \nwhich was controlled by Democrats, to the tax record of this \nRepublican-controlled Congress.\n  As this chart shows, the Democrats passed the largest tax increase in \nour Nation's history--$268 billion. This was without a single \nRepublican vote. And, while they said at the time that the tax increase \nwas for deficit reduction, a study released last week shows that 44\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\ncents of every dollar of that tax increase has gone to more big \nGovernment spending. That is why Republicans continue to believe that \nthe way to reduce the deficit is not to raise taxes, but instead to cut \nwasteful Government spending.\n  This chart also shows that the Clinton tax rate increase was \nretroactive--reaching back to the Bush administration. The tax record \nof the 103d Congress included a top tax rate increase to 39.6 percent \nwhich devastated small business, and is probably part of the reason why \nso many Americans feel that their wages have stagnated. When these \nsmall businesses, which are the biggest creators of jobs in this \ncountry, have to give more money to the Federal Government, they have \nless money for expansion, pay raises, and job creation.\n  The Democratic 103d Congress' tax record also included an increase in \ntaxes on Social Security benefits up to 85 percent--an outrageous \nincrease.\n  The 103d Congress also, of course, raised gas taxes by 30 percent.\n  So, the tax accomplishments of the 103d Democratic Congress included \na hard hit at many Americans and they were not all rich.\n  But what a difference a Congress makes. This Republican Congress has \na much different record on taxes. Instead of raising taxes, we have cut \ntaxes. The 104th Congress has passed legislation that has been signed \ninto law including: allowing working seniors to keep more of their \nSocial Security benefits by increasing the earnings limit; tax relief \nfor the thousands of service people in Bosnia; a reinstatement and \nsubsequent increase of the self-employed health insurance deduction; \nand a measure to prohibit States from taxing the benefits of former \nresidents who have retired and moved to other States. These tax changes \nbenefit millions of Americans.\n  And, if President Clinton had signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, \nthe tax burden on millions more working Americans would be lighter. \nFamilies, in particular, would have benefited from the Republican \nbudget, which gave parents a $500 tax credit for each child. Our budget \nalso reduced the capital gains rate, phased out the unfair marriage \npenalty, provided a deduction for student loan interest, and expanded \ntax-deductible individual retirement accounts.\n  The difference between the two records couldn't be more stark. The \nlast Congress increased taxes by a record amount, while this Congress \ncut taxes.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this Congress can undo the economic \ndamage that the last Congress has done. Repeal of the Clinton gas tax \nis a good place to begin.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bumpers pertaining to the introduction of S. 1737 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have not made a lot of progress in the \nlast several hours, and I am hopeful that at some point today we can \nreach an agreement.\n  The current situation would require a vote on three separate \nprovisions of the same amendment to a bill that is now pending, the \nTravel Office reimbursement legislation. We have indicated that that is \nunacceptable to us.\n  Earlier today, at a press conference, the distinguished majority \nleader, when asked if he would agree to consideration of three separate \nbills, answered, ``If we can get an agreement to vote on three separate \nbills, that's one thing. I've already given that agreement to have \nthree separate bills.''\n  As I understand it now, that may not be Senator Dole's exact intent. \nBut I must tell you that if it is, indeed, his position to accept \nconsideration of three separate bills, then, indeed, we would be ready \nthis afternoon to agree; we would allow a vote on the gas tax reduction \nand relevant amendments; a vote on the minimum wage and amendments that \nare relevant; and a vote on the TEAM Act with relevant amendments. That \nseems to me to be exactly what we have been proposing now for several \ndays.\n  If we can do that, we could reach an agreement by 4:45 this \nafternoon. So I am very hopeful that we are getting closer together, \nthat we can find a way to resolve this impasse. Three separate bills, \nas the majority leader suggested earlier today, would do that, would \ngive us that opportunity, and I am hopeful that we can talk in good \nfaith and find a way to determine the sequencing and ultimately come to \nsome conclusion on this legislation.\n  Three separate bills with relevant amendments, perhaps with a \nreasonable time limit, is acceptable to us, and we will take it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4838-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEGAN'S LAW\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, late last evening H.R. 2137 passed the \nHouse, I think, unanimously. It is Megan's law, plus some other \nadditions to help protect our Nation's children from sexual predators. \nThe vote was 418 to 0. Known as Megan's law, it strengthens the \nexisting law to require all 50 States to notify communities of the \npresence of convicted sex offenders who might pose a danger to \nchildren.\n  In 1994 the crime bill was lobbied not to require States to take such \nsteps. Since that time, 49 States have enacted sex offender \nregistration laws, and 30 have adopted community notification \nprovisions, but not all States have taken the necessary steps to \nrequire such notification. And this is a tragedy in the making.\n  It seems to me that we can prevent this from happening and we can \ntake action now. I do not know any reason to hesitate. So I am going to \nask consent when I finish that we bring it up and pass the bill.\n  But every parent in America knows the fear and the doubts he or she \nsuffers worrying about the safety of their children. Parents understand \nthat their children cannot know how truly evil some people are. They \nknow that no matter how hard they try, they cannot be with their \nchildren every second of the day. A second is all it takes for tragedy \nto strike. We have an obligation to ensure that those who committed \nsuch crimes will not be able to do so again. This is a limited measure, \nbut an absolutely necessary one.\n  Again, sort of following along the President's remarks at his press \nconference, it seems to me this would be an area where there would not \nbe any objection. I know when this bill comes up it will be unanimous. \nWe would like to let the American people know that we can respond \nimmediately. The bill is here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4845-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4845-S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2137\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, as I understand, the Democrats have had a \ncaucus, and they might now be willing to agree to the unanimous-consent \nrequest that I made earlier this morning that there be three votes; \ndivision I being the gas tax issue; division II being the TEAM Act \nissue; and division III being the Democratic proposal for the minimum \nwage; that each division be limited to 2 hours each, to be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to division I, division II, and \ndivision III. Then I assume there would be a vote on final passage.\n  If I am correct in that, I would be happy to try to obtain that \nconsent agreement now.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \noffer a unanimous-consent agreement to do what I understand the \nmajority leader proposed earlier--later than that particular offer; \nlater on in the morning--that we have three separate bills, and have \nvotes and amendments to those three separate bills. I offer that as a \nunanimous-consent agreement at this time with amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. With amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We would offer three separate bills with amendments. We \ncould agree to a time limit, but three separate bills with amendments. \nThat is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I never agreed to anything like that. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me say that I did indicate--I do not negotiate with the \npress. As far as I know, they are not Members of the Senate. Some have \nmore power than we have, but they are not voting.\n  I was asked that question, and I repeated the question. I might \nsubscribe to that. But I went on to say, I made almost the identical \noffer today, but I never made any offer that would indicate we would \nhave amendments to these separate bills. That is an entirely different \nprocess.\n  Plus, I am no rocket scientist, but it did occur to me that obviously \nthe President could veto the TEAM Act and sign the other two. He said \nhe would do that today. I would not buy into such an agreement.\n  I do think this is a very reasonable agreement that I have suggested. \nSince I have been asked to object to the Democratic leader's proposal, \nperhaps he would be kind enough to object----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  Mr. DOLE. I find it strange that our colleagues on the other side are \nfilibustering minimum wage. We are prepared to have that vote right \nnow. We will not even need 30 minutes of debate. We are prepared to \nhave the vote on TEAM Act, prepared to have the vote on gas tax.\n  Again, the TEAM Act is just a very little piece of the pie or the \npuzzle. I hope we could find some way to reach an agreement. If there \nare amendments, I know the Senator from North Dakota--I have written \nhim a letter, Senator Dorgan, if he has any way to tighten up the \neffort to make certain that the 4.3 cents will go to the consumer. I \nhad a letter from Texaco, and we will have a response from ARCO. \nSomebody raised a question about ARCO in the press conference. I did \nnot have the answer, but we are getting the answer from ARCO. I think \nwe will have the assurances that some would need before they act on the \ngas tax repeal.\n  As I said at the press conference earlier, we do pay for it. This is \nreally an effort--the President's spending is why we have to have it. \nHe wanted to spend more money, so we had to raise the gas tax. We will \nnot let the deficit grow any larger. We will make certain we offset any \nloss.\n  I hope that this is a reasonable agreement, and I would like to \nproceed with it. If not, I do not see any reason to stay in later this \nevening.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Go ahead.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader would \nyield for a brief question regarding matters that we discussed just a \nfew moments ago.\n  Mr. DOLE. Certainly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand from the press conference, a question \nwas asked, just to follow up on what Senator Daschle has pointed out: \n``Why not have three up-or-down votes on three different bills, whether \nthey are amendable or unamendable? Why not do it that way?''\n  Senator Dole said, ``Three separate bills, I might even subscribe to \nthat. But they won't let it happen. They will filibuster the TEAM Act. \nIf we can get an agreement to vote on three separate bills, that is one \nthing. I have already given that agreement, to have the three separate \nbills.''\n  As I understood the----\n  Mr. DOLE. Three separate votes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The question included the words: ``amendable or \nunamendable? Why not do it that way?''\n  ``Three separate bills, I might even subscribe to that. But they \nwon't let it happen.''\n  As I understood it, that is what Senator Daschle had offered. I was \nwondering, since it appeared, at least from the transcript, that that \nwas the position of the majority leader, why that would not be \nacceptable to do that here as the minority leader has suggested.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I have indicated, I said in that response, I might and I \nmight not. And I will not. That will take care of that.\n  Again, nobody is trying to negotiate. Democrats like to negotiate, \nbut I do not negotiate with press people unless there is one up there \nwho works for the Democrats, but I do not think so, not directly.\n\n  We would be very happy to proceed on the basis we have outlined this \nmorning. We think it is very reasonable. I think the President ought to \naccept it in the spirit he invoked in his 1:30 press conference. He did \nindicate he would sign--he mentioned something about workers' rights. \nThat is what we are talking about, workers' rights.\n  I do not understand how we expect the majority to permit the minority \nto have their way and we not be entitled to have any say at all. We are \nprepared to repeal the gas tax, have that vote, have the TEAM Act vote, \nand have the minimum wage vote and then have a final vote. I think my \ncolleagues on the other side might appreciate the fact we would \nprobably have a fairly healthy vote on final passage, which I think \nwould bode well for what might eventually happen to this legislation.\n  There is a lot of merit to keeping the three together. There may not \nbe any merit on that side of the aisle, but there is merit on this side \nof the aisle.\n  Again, I tried to work with--certainly, always tried to work with--\nthe Democratic leader. I am happy to meet with him at any time and see \nif there is some agreement we can reach.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not belabor this. Let me just say \nthat I think both sides have made their position very clear. The \nmajority leader wants to combine the TEAM Act, the minimum wage, and \nthe Travel Office bill all in one package, in addition, of course, to \nthe gas tax reduction. In one package we would combine all of these \nthings.\n  I must say I do not know that we will ever be able to resolve this \nuntil we\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\ncan find a way to allow separate bills to be considered. The problem we \nhave is, we cannot offer amendments. That is the essence of it. We \ncannot offer amendments to these. We may ultimately have a TEAM Act of \nour own. We may have a substitute of our own to the gas tax reduction \nproposal. We may have a lot of amendments that are very relevant to \nthis bill that we are precluded from offering under this arrangement.\n  I have had a very productive and very good relationship with the \nleader over many months now. I am hopeful that we can find a way \nthrough this and see if we cannot resolve it. I do not see a way to \nresolve it until we can finalize some understanding about the \nopportunity that we must have to offer amendments to bills that we care \ndeeply about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, again, I think we all try to work things out \naround here. At least that has been my experience. I see my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, may not agree \non what will be the final outcome, but we try to agree. If there is an \neffort or wish to offer substitutes, we might have a substitute to the \nminimum wage.\n  We are willing to divorce these three matters from the Travel Office \nbill and bring them up separately, or if there is another H.R. bill \naround here somewhere--there is another H.R. bill. We can accommodate \nthat request. We can go ahead and separate, if that would help, and let \nthe Billy Dale matter be passed.\n  I think the point is that the Senator from Massachusetts made it very \nclear he was going to amend every bill with the minimum wage, which, in \neffect, served notice on us that anything that we brought up would be \nblocked. We want to resolve this issue, get it behind us, so we can \nmove on a number of legislative areas that we think are important, \nimportant to the people of America.\n  I am perfectly willing to try to work it out with the Democratic \nleader. We have never had a problem before. Sometimes these things are \nnot easy. Sometimes they can be resolved. I make no offer to the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just say one other thing that \nI meant to add, the distinguished majority leader this morning said \nthat he took good notes from his predecessor, the majority leader in \nthe 103d Congress, George Mitchell. I know he is a great note taker, \nand I do not deny that he probably, like all of us, learned from past \nexperience.\n  However, we went back in the 103d Congress just to try to find an \nexample or an instance when the majority filled the parliamentary tree, \nfilled the tree in every way, to preclude the minority from having an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. We could not find 10, we could not \nfind 5, we could not find 1 instance where the majority so dominated \nthe political tree--it is a political tree in this case--the \nparliamentary tree so as not to allow the minority the opportunity to \noffer any amendments. It is not something the majority did in the past.\n  Even in the most troubling circumstances, the minority had an \nopportunity to offer an amendment. We had to offer second degrees, and \nwe did. We had to come up with counter strategies, and we did. We never \nfilled the tree and filed cloture and precluded the minority from even \nhaving the opportunity to offer an amendment. Having looked at the \nrecord from at least that perspective, I do not find an example that \ncould be called a precedent for what is happening right now.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I meant--and I talked about Senator Mitchell \nas my friend and the friend of everybody on this side and the other \nside, and he is doing quite well in the private area--that he would \nfile cloture rather quickly.\n  But the point is, I can recall the stimulus package being held up. I \nthink Senator Mitchell did a good job of preventing us from voting on \ncapital gains for many years. I cannot remember, it has been so long. \nSo I think he was quite effective. Maybe I have not been quite as \neffective and I had to fill the trees because I did not know the other \nins-and-outs of the place. He did a good job, and I certainly have high \nrespect for Senator Mitchell. I very much appreciate the fact that he \nwas willing to pass on some of the ideas he had that I have been able \nto pick up.\n  But I would be very happy to visit with my friend, the Democratic \nleader. If it is a question of working out an agreement with \namendments, I think we can do that. But when the Senator from \nMassachusetts makes it impossible to bring up any bill--and he says he \nis not going to do it on Megan's law, but he has everything else, with \nthe exception of the bill he wanted passed, the health bill--then it \nmakes it rather difficult to do the business of the Senate. So I do not \nbelieve that we are doing anything that cannot be resolved, regarding \nthe efforts initiated on that side. I am perfectly willing to work it \nout, if we can, with the Senator from South Dakota, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and everybody else. I know the Senator from Mississippi \nis willing to try and has tried. I think we have all been in good \nfaith.\n  So if we can work it out, that is fine. We would be happy to meet \nthis evening and see if we can resolve this and have not only these \nthree issues behind us, but a number of others that should be dealt \nwith, if we are to have a Memorial Day recess.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wanted to inquire of the leader. Of \ncourse, on the minimum wage, a majority of the Members have actually \nvoted for an increase in the minimum wage. So, in this instance, the \nminority is really the majority, and they have been denied the \nopportunity these many weeks and months from having an opportunity to \nbe able to have a clean bill on the minimum wage. I think that the \nactions that were taken are taken out of frustration, on an issue that \nthe American people are so overwhelmingly in support of, and that is, \npeople that work hard ought to be able to have a livable wage, and we \nought to be addressing that on the floor of the Senate.\n  So I just suggest to the leader that, actually, we are not a minority \non that issue, we are a majority, and with good Republican support. I \nam just puzzled about why we are constantly characterized as a minority \nwhen we have been able to demonstrate from votes here on the Senate \nfloor that a majority wants to have an increase in the minimum wage. I \ndo not see how that is so unreasonable.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it would be my view that when that vote \ncomes, there will be a substantial majority. The vote the Senator \nrefers to is a cloture vote, and sometimes they are a bit deceptive, as \nI have learned.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator now stating to the American people that \nhe will only schedule a vote up or down on the increase in the minimum \nwage if we get cloture? Is that the position of the majority leader on \nthis issue?\n  Mr. DOLE. I did not even raise cloture. I thought that was the \nposition of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, no. I do not believe that the majority leader does \nnot understand what my position is on this.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think I do understand your position. I sometimes admire \nit--sometimes. But I think the point is that we need to resolve this, \nif we can. I would be happy to try to work with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, or the Democratic leader, or both, and see if we cannot \nwork out some arrangement where they can offer amendments. But I do \nbelieve it is pretty difficult to explain to the majority--and I do not \noften refer to the minority. I think we are all Senators. It is pretty \nhard to explain to the majority on this side why we should permit the \nSenator from Massachusetts to do everything he wants, but we cannot do \nwhat we want. If the Senator can help me with that, maybe we can work \nit out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield on that point. It is not what \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants, it is what 13 million Americans \ndeserve.\n  Mr. DOLE. Oh. I will say the same about a lot of things President \nClinton has vetoed, such as the child tax credit, welfare reform, \nbalanced budget, all those things were vetoed. The Senator from \nMassachusetts did not vote for them. The child tax credit will help 50-\nsome million children in 28 million homes.\n  So if we want to get into the numbers game here, we can extend the \ndebate for some time. I think, since I\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nhave an appointment at 5, I will be happy to either recess until \ntomorrow morning, or if we want to continue debate, we can. I know the \nSenator from Georgia is here, and the Senator from Idaho wishes to be \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4846-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, last Saturday the White House political \nmachine was running at full tilt trying to convince the American people \nthat welfare reform is well underway when, in fact, President Clinton \nhas vetoed welfare reform twice. Once again we find that the \nadministration is using the old theory as to whether you can fool all \nof the people all of the time. This time, the administration is trying \nto use figures to confuse the public into believing that it is \nimplementing a successful welfare reform strategy when, in fact, it has \nnot.\n  Last Saturday, President Clinton told the American people that, All \nacross America the welfare rolls are down, food stamps rolls are down, \nand teen pregnancies are down compared to 4 years ago. Unfortunately \nfor the administration, the facts get in the way of the rhetoric.\n  According to the latest available data from the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the estimated average monthly number of AFDC \nrecipients for 1995 was 13.6 million. The final figures for all of 1995 \nare not yet available, and there is a 9-month average from January to \nSeptember 1995. By comparison, the monthly average for all of 1992 was \n13.8 million recipients. This is a modest decline of 200,000 people, or \n1.5 percent.\n  But the real story about the welfare rolls which this administration \ndoes not want the public to see is how the current welfare rolls \ncompare to previous years and administrations. This first chart shows \nthe number of people receiving AFDC benefits over time, and while the \nestimated 1995 AFDC caseload is 13.6 million people, the average \nmonthly number of AFDC recipients between 1970 and 1995 was 11.3 \nmillion.\n  When you look back at the AFDC program over time, you find that the \nAFDC rolls under the Clinton administration are still well above the \nhistorical levels. Comparing 1995 to the averages of the 1980's, it is \neven more dramatic. If the 1995 welfare rolls had declined to the level \nof the 1980's, there would have been 2.7 million fewer people on AFDC.\n  Let me also point out, as this chart shows, that the AFDC rolls were \nrelatively constant throughout the 1970's and 1980's. There was an \naverage of 10.6 million AFDC recipients over the 1970's. In the 1980's, \nthe AFDC rolls rose at a slightly higher level, at 10.8 million.\n  The AFDC rolls increased dramatically in the early 1990's. In fact, \nthe AFDC rolls reached their highest point ever during the Clinton \nadministration in 1993. There have been only 2 years in which the AFDC \ncaseload has ever exceeded 14 million people, and those years were 1993 \nand 1994.\n  Until 1994, there were 14.1 million recipients on AFDC, well above \nthe 1992 level. If the welfare rolls would have declined just to the \nhistorical average, never mind ending welfare as we know it, there \nwould be 2.2 million fewer people on AFDC than there are today. At \nbest, the Clinton administration can only claim that the number of AFDC \nrecipients is just now returning to the level of 4 years ago. Thus, \nPresident Clinton is claiming success for bringing the number of AFDC \nrecipients to a level which is nearly 20 percent higher than the \nhistorical average. It is a little bit like the teenager claiming \nvictory in the Indianapolis 500 just because he found the keys to the \nfamily car.\n  In the Food Stamp Program, we find similar patterns but the news is \nslightly worse for the White House spin doctors. Let me first point \nout, as this second chart shows, that the 1995 food stamp caseload was \nhigher than the 1992 level, not lower, as the administration has \nclaimed. On average, there were about 900,000 more food stamp \nrecipients in 1995 than in 1992. And even if you use only 1 month of \ndata, the most recent food stamp caseload is still higher than the 1992 \nlevel. The February 1996 food stamp caseload was at 25.7 million \npeople. This is 300,000 more people than the 1992 level. And second, \nthere were nearly 7 million more food stamp recipients in 1995 than for \nthe 25 year historical average.\n  Over the past 25 years, the average monthly number of food stamp \nrecipients is 19.4 million people. In 1995, there were 26.3 million \npeople receiving food stamps. There were nearly 6 million more food \nstamp recipients in 1995 than the average for the 1980's.\n  As welfare rolls are linked at least in part to the economy, you \nshould expect the number of welfare recipients to decline even without \nany change in welfare policy.\n  We can see this relationship especially in the food stamp program in \nthe late 1970's and 1980's. This chart shows significant growth \nbeginning in 1979. At the same time the median money income for \nfamilies was declining in real terms from $39,227 in 1979 to $36,326 in \n1982, food stamp caseload peaked in 1981 at 22.4 million recipients. \nBut the chart shows the subsequent steady decline in food stamp \ncaseload during the Reagan administration to less than 19 million \nrecipients in 1988 and 1989. What was happening with the economy? Well, \nthe median money income for families during the Reagan-Bush years \nincreased to $40,890 in 1989 in real terms.\n  The relationship follows in bad economic times as well. Caseloads \nincreased once again as family income declined sliding down to $37,905 \nin 1993. According to Census Bureau reports, the 1993 poverty rate for \nall families with children under age 18 was 18.5 percent, the highest \nlevel since 1962.\n\n  If administration officials can claim success, they need to explain \nprecisely which Clinton welfare policy change is responsible for \nbringing the caseload back to the 1992 level. We need to question \nwhether the Federal bureaucracies at USDA and HHS are really \nresponsible for this decline.\n  The waivers the President continues to talk about appear to have very \nlittle if any effect. Obviously, the administration can claim credit \nfor only those waivers which have been actually approved and \nimplemented since 1993. Even then, the waivers must be evaluated to \ndetermine if they are or not some other factors were, indeed, the cause \nof the change.\n  In 1993, only four State welfare waivers were implemented. Obviously, \nthese four waivers had no effect on other States. They may not have had \nany effect within the respective States depending upon when they were \nimplemented during that year. In 1994, 14 waivers were implemented, in \n1995 another 7. But these figures tell us very little. Waivers may not \nbe implemented throughout the State. A State may have more than one \nwaiver, some of which may have no impact on caseload. Some States with \nwaivers have seen increases in their welfare caseload.\n  What this confusion should really tell the American people is that \nwaivers are no substitute for authentic welfare reform. President \nClinton did not mention that the welfare rolls and other programs have \nincreased from their 1992 levels.\n  In September 1995, the most recent data available, there were 6.5 \nmillion people receiving supplemental security income benefits. This is \nan increase of nearly 1 million people from December 1992. We have also \nadded about 5 million people to the Medicaid Program since 1992.\n  Mr. President, here are a couple of more facts to go with the White \nHouse data. It has now been 39 months since President Clinton outlined \nhis welfare reform goals to the American people and promised to deliver \nwelfare reform to the Nation's Governors. Instead, he has vetoed \nauthentic welfare reform not once but twice in the past 5 months.\n  Mr. President, there are important differences between a vision and \nan optical illusion. The Republicans have outlined their vision for \nending the vicious cycle of dependency through restoring the timeless \nvalues of work and family life. Meanwhile, the White\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\nHouse magicians will continue to conjure up a few minor, if not \nmeaningless, figures in an attempt to divert the public's attention \nfrom the real facts of welfare reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4848-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S THE WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 3, the United States imported 7,301,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,184,000 barrels more than the 6,117,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans now rely on foreign oil for 53 percent of their needs, and \nthere are no signs that this upward spriral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 percent of its \noil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the \n1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the United States--now 7,301,000 barrels a \nday.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senators will examine this information in the \ncontext of rapidly rising gasoline prices. U.S. reliance on foreign oil \nhas caused us to forsake the use of alternative domestic fuels and \nallowed for serious declines in domestic crude oil production. In 1970, \nthe United States produced 9,600,000 million barrels per day. \nCurrently, we are producing only 6,500,000 million barrels per day. \nThus, more than half of the gasoline consumed in this country comes \nfrom foreign sources, and the problem is getting worse.\n  Where's the leadership from the White House on this critical issue? \nThe President ordered a draw down of the strategic oil reserves. The \nAmerican people recognize this for what it is--a cynical joke. Of \ncourse Congress should cut the Clinton gas tax. We should also cut \ntaxes on domestic alternative fuel sources, and on a host of other \ntaxes Democrats have heaped on the shoulders of hardworking American \ntaxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4849-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on Friday, February 23, 1996, the U.S. \nFederal debt broke the $5 trillion sound barrier for the first time in \nhistory. The records show that on that day, at the close of business, \nthe debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53.\n  Twenty years earlier, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 \nbillion, after the first 200 years of America's history, including two \nworld wars. The total Federal debt in 1976, I repeat, stood at $629 \nbillion.\n  Then the big spenders went to work and the compounded interest on the \nFederal debt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past two \ndecades the Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing \nby more than $4 trillion in two decades, from 1976 to 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, as of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, \nMay 7, the Federal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at \n$5,093,910,014,740.64. On a per capita basis, every man, woman, and \nchild in America owes $19,236.90 as his or her share of that debt.\n  This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens \nand especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and \ngrandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, ``to preserve [our] \nindependence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. \nWe must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.'' Isn't it about time that Congress heeded the wise words of \nmy hero, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of \nIndependence?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4849-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to the \nprovisions of section 168(b) of Public Law 102-138, the Speaker \nappoints the following Members on the part of the House to the British \nAmerican Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Hamilton of Indiana, Mr. Lantos \nof California, Mr. Hastings of Florida, and Mrs. Kennelly of \nConnecticut.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to section 232(c)(2) of \nPublic Law 103-432, the Speaker appoints the following members from \nprivate life to the Advisory Board on Welfare Indicators on the part of \nthe House: Ms. Eloise Anderson of California, Mr. Wade F.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       (a) Warrants.--\n       (1) The Lead Agency shall seek the consent of the owner or \n     the operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to \n     be inspected prior to the initiation of any inspection. \n     Before or after seeking such consent, the Lead Agency may \n     seek a search warrant from any official authorized to issue \n     search warrants. Proceedings regarding the issuance of a \n     search warrant shall be conducted ex parte, unless otherwise \n     requested by the Lead Agency. The Lead Agency shall provide \n     to the official authorized to issue search warrants all \n     appropriate information supplied by the Technical Secretariat \n     to the United States National Authority regarding the basis \n     for the selection of the plant site, plant, or other facility \n     or location for the type of inspection sought, including, for \n     challenge inspections pursuant to Article IX of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, appropriate evidence or reasons provided \n     by the requesting State Party to the Convention with regard \n     to its concerns about compliance with the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention at the facility or location. The Lead Agency shall \n     also provide any other appropriate information available to \n     it relating to the reasonableness of the selection of the \n     plant, plant site, or other facility or location for the \n     inspection.\n       (2) The official authorized to issue search warrants shall \n     promptly issue a warrant authorizing the requested inspection \n     upon an affidavit submitted by the Lead Agency showing that--\n       (A) the Chemical Weapons Convention is in force for the \n     United States;\n       (B) the plant site, plant, or other facility or location \n     sought to be inspected is subject to the specific type of \n     inspection requested under the Chemical Weapons Convention;\n       (C) the procedures established under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention and this Act for initiating an inspection have \n     been complied with; and\n       (D) the Lead Agency will ensure that the inspection is \n     conducted in a reasonable manner and will not exceed the \n     scope or duration set forth in or authorized by the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention or this Act.\n       (3) The warrant shall specify the type of inspection \n     authorized; the purpose of the inspection; the type of plant \n     site, plant, or other facility or location to be inspected; \n     to\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\n     the extent possible, the items, documents and areas that may \n     be inspected; the earliest commencement and latest concluding \n     dates and times of the inspection; and the identities of the \n     representatives of the Technical Secretariat, if known, and, \n     if applicable, the representatives of agencies or \n     departments.\n       (b) Subpoenas.--In carrying out this Act, the Lead Agency \n     may by subpoena require the attendance and testimony of \n     witnesses and the production of reports, papers, documents, \n     answers to questions and other information that the Lead \n     Agency deems necessary. Witnesses shall be paid the same fees \n     and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the \n     United States. In the event of contumacy, failure or refusal \n     of any person to obey any such subpoena, any district court \n     of the United States in which venue is proper shall have \n     jurisdiction to order any such person to comply with such \n     subpoena. Any failure to obey such an order of the court is \n     punishable by the court as a contempt thereof.\n       (c) Injunctions and Other Orders.--No court shall issue an \n     injunction or other order that would limit the ability of the \n     Technical Secretariat to conduct, or the United States \n     National Authority or the Lead Agency to facilitate, \n     inspections as required or authorized by the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention.\n\n     SEC. 407.

In conducting such \n     investigations, those officers or employees may, to the \n     extent necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this \n     Act, or for the imposition of any penalty or liability \n     arising under this Act, exercise such authorities as are \n     conferred upon them by other laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 408. SAVING PROVISION.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to enable the United States to \n     comply with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. Accordingly, in addition to the authorities set \n     forth in this Act, the President is authorized to issue such \n     executive orders, directives or regulations as are necessary \n     to fulfill the obligations of the United States under the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, provided such executive orders, \n     directives or regulations do not exceed the requirements \n     specified in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             U.S. Arms Control and\n\n\n                                           Disarmament Agency,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1993.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the Administration, I \n     hereby submit for consideration the ``Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1995.'' The Chemical Weapons \n     Convention (CWC) was signed by the United States in Paris on \n     January 13, 1993, and was submitted by President Clinton to \n     the United States Senate on November 23, 1993, for its advice \n     and consent to ratification. The CWC prohibits, inter alia, \n     the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, \n     retention, and direct or indirect transfer of chemical \n     weapons.\n       The President has urged the Senate to provide its advice \n     and consent to ratification as early as possible so that the \n     United States can continue to exercise its leadership role in \n     seeking the earliest possible entry into force of the \n     Convention. The recent chemical attacks in Japan underscore \n     the importance of early ratification of the CWC and approval \n     of this legislation.\n       The CWC contains a number of provisions that require \n     implementing legislation to give them effect within the \n     United States. These include:\n       International inspections of U.S. facilities;\n       Declarations by U.S. chemical and related industry; and\n       Establishment of a ``National Authority'' to serve as the \n     liaison between the United States and the international \n     organization established by the CWC and States Parties to the \n     Convention.\n       In addition, the CWC requires the United States to prohibit \n     all individuals and legal entities, such as corporations, \n     within the United States, as well as all individuals outside \n     the United States possessing U.S. citizenship, from engaging \n     in activities that are prohibited under the Convention. As \n     part of this obligation, the CWC requires the United States \n     to enact ``penal'' legislation implementing this \n     prohibition (i.e., legislation that penalizes conduct, \n     either by criminal, administrative, military or other \n     sanctions.)\n       The proposed ``Chemical Weapons Convention Act of 1995'' \n     reflects views expressed from representatives of industry as \n     well as from staff of various committees.\n       Expeditious enactment of implementing legislation is very \n     important to the ability of the United States to fulfill its \n     treaty obligations under the Convention. Enactment will \n     enable the United States to collect the required information \n     from industry and to allow the inspections called for in the \n     Convention. It will also enable the United States to outlaw \n     all activities related to chemical weapons, except CWC \n     permitted activities, such as chemical defense programs. This \n     will help fight chemical terrorism by penalizing not just the \n     use, but also the development, production and transfer of \n     chemical weapons. Thus, the enactment of legislation by the \n     United States and other CWC States Parties will make it much \n     easier for law enforcement officials to investigate and \n     punish chemical terrorists early, before chemical weapons are \n     used.\n       The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA) requires \n     that all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-\n     as-you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in \n     an increase to the deficit; and if it does, it could trigger \n     a sequester if not fully offset. This proposal would increase \n     receipts by less than $500,000 a year.\n       As the President indicated in his transmittal letter of the \n     Convention: ``The CWC is in the best interests of the United \n     States. Its provisions will significantly strengthen United \n     States, allied and international security, and enhance global \n     and regional stability.'' Therefore, I urge the Congress to \n     enact the necessary implementing legislation as soon as \n     possible after the Senate has given its advice and consent to \n     ratification.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this proposal and its \n     enactment is in accord with the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John D. Holum.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Brown, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Lott, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1733. A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994 to provide enhanced penalties for crimes \nagainst elderly and child victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n the crimes against children and elderly persons increased punishment \n                                  act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it's difficult to imagine an act more \ncowardly or reprehensible than a violent criminal act against a child, \nor an elderly person, or someone who is mentally or physically \nhandicapped. But this dastardly criminality is becoming more and more \ncommon is society as a part of the general moral decay which is so \npainfully apparent in our cities and towns. Therefore, I am introducing \na bill to strengthen the penalty for criminals who commit violent \nFederal crimes against children, the elderly, and those vulnerable due \nto mental or physical conditions.\n  Crimes against the vulnerable are soaring. For instance, according to \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics, personal crimes against the elderly \nincreased by 90 percent between 1985 and 1991--from 627,318 in 1985 to \n1,146,929 in 1991. Likewise, the homicide rate for children skyrocketed \n47 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n  These are real victims, Mr. President, not just statistics. Just last \nmonth in Durham, NC, two mentally handicapped women were robbed at \nknife point. Earlier this year in Durham, a disabled Vietnam veteran--\npartially blind and with limited use of his legs--was robbed after \nexiting a Greyhound bus. And in my hometown of Raleigh, I recall the \nreports of a blind, 77-year-old lady who in 1993 was raped in her \nbackyard.\n  These types of crimes are sick, outrageous, and revolting. Something \nmust be done to make clear that this kind of depravity will be severely \npunished in the Federal system.\n  The Federal law must reflect our extreme repulsion against those who \nwould victimize people who cannot defend themselves. This bill stiffens \nthe punishment, by an average of 50 percent, for criminals who prey on \nthe vulnerable in our society by committing violent crimes--including \ncarjacking, assault, rape, and robbery. More specifically, this bill \ndirects the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase sentences by five \nlevels above the offense level otherwise provided if a Federal violent \ncrime is committed against a child, an elderly person or other \nvulnerable victim. By vulnerable I mean one whose physical or mental \ncondition makes him susceptible to victimization by the thugs who \ncommit these sorts of crimes.\n  This bill increases most of these sentences by about 50 percent. For \nexample, a conviction of robbery against a senior or a child currently \ncarries with it a base-offense level of 20, which translates into 2\\1/\n2\\ to 3\\1/2\\ years in prison. This bill raises the base-offense level \nto 25, jacking up the prison sentence for robbery to 4\\1/2\\ to 6 years.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, a substantially similar bill, introduced \nby Representative Dick Chrysler of Michigan, was passed 414 to 4 last \nnight in the House of Representatives. The\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\nAmerican people are demanding that these loathsome cries against the \nvulnerable in our society receive the punishment they deserve. This \nbill moves us in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to move with dispatch to enact this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Nunn, \n        Mr. Cohen, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1734. A bill to prohibit false statements to Congress, to clarify \ncongressional authority to obtain truthful testimony, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the false statements penalty restoration act\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, last year the Supreme Court overturned 40 \nyears of statutory interpretation and held that the statute that \nprohibits making false statements to agencies of the Federal Government \nonly prohibits false statements made to agencies of the executive \nbranch.\n  There is no reason why Congress should receive less protection than \nthe executive. The cardinal principle at stake is that in dealing with \nthe Government, any agency of the Government, people must, in the words \nof Justice Holmes, ``cut square corners,'' just as the Government must \ncut square corners in dealing with its citizens. One who lies to an \nentity of Government, be it an agency of the executive or a \nsubcommittee of Congress, is under a justifiable expectation that if he \nor she lies, he or she will be punished.\n  This is not a difficult issue. For 40 years, Congress received the \nsame protection as the executive. Anyone who lied knowingly and \nwilfully in a material way to either an executive agency or a component \nof Congress was subject to prosecution. In its Hubbard decision of last \nyear, the Supreme Court took that protection away from Congress.\n  Let me offer some examples of the types of lies that can now \nknowingly be made without fear of criminal sanction. Recently Congress \nenacted lobbying disclosure. Lobbyists must make more thorough \ndisclosures in filings with Congress. Knowing and material \nmisstatements in these disclosure forms are no longer a basis for \ncriminal prosecution. Many of us asks the General Accounting Office to \ninvestigate the operations of executive branch agencies. An employee of \nan agency being investigated by the GAO can now knowingly lie to a GAO \ninvestigator, or indeed a Senator, without having to fear criminal \nprosecution. Of course, if instead of the GAO the review was being \nconducted by an agency inspector general, then section 1001 would \napply. This distinction cannot be justified.\n  Congress relies on accurate information to legislate, to oversee, to \ndirect public policy. Unless the information coming to us is accurate, \nwe are unable to fulfill our constitutional functions. This issue is a \nsimple one. When someone provides information to Congress, its members, \ncommittees, or offices, that person should not knowingly provide \nuntruthful information. So simple is this principle that I first \noffered legislation to overturn the Hubbard decision a week after it \nwas decided. Since introduction of my bill, S. 830, I have been working \nwith Senator Levin on the language of amended section 1001 and on some \nother ancillary matters.\n  The bill Senator Levin and I are introducing today will amend section \n1001 to restore coverage for misstatements made to both Congress and \nthe Federal judiciary, although it will codify the judiciary created \nexception to the pre-Hubbard section 1001 to exempt from its coverage \nstatements made to a court performing an adjudicative function. The \nrational for this exception is that our adversary system relies on \nunfettered argument and the chilling effect from applying section 1001 \nto statements to a court adjudicating a case could be significant. In \naddition, cross-examination and argument from the other side is \nadequate to reveal misstatements in the judicial context.\n  No similar legislative-function exemption is proposed for statements \nmade to Congress, and none is needed. Congress does not rely on cross-\nexamination to get at the truth. Instead, we must rely on the \ntruthfulness of statements made to us in the course of the performance \nof our official duties.\n  In addition to restoring section 1001 liability for misstatements \nmade to Congress and the courts, this bill would restore force to the \nprohibition against obstructing congressional proceedings by narrowing \nthe meaning of the provision. This amendment is needed to respond to a \ndecision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit which found the current statute too vague to be enforceable.\n  The bill also clarifies when officials of executive branch agencies \ncan assert a privilege and decline to respond to inquiries from \nCongress. The bill requires that an employee of an executive agency \nwould have to demonstrate that the head of the agency directed that the \nprivilege be asserted. This will ensure that the assertion of the \nprivilege is reviewed at the highest levels of the agency by someone \naccountable to the President and ultimately the people. It will also \nensure that any privileges that are asserted are governmental \nprivileges and not personal ones.\n  Finally, the bill would make a minor technical amendment to the \nstatute allowing Congress to seek to take immunized testimony from \nwitnesses by clarifying that the testimony can be taken either at \nproceedings before a committee or subcommittee or any proceeding \nancillary to such proceedings, such as depositions.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is an important bill that will restore \nto the law of the land the principle that one cannot knowingly and \nwilfully lie about a material matter to Congress. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this principle by supporting the bill, which I hope we can \nenact this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

COMPELLING TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY FROM IMMUNIZED WITNESS.\n\n       Section 6005 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``or ancillary to'' \n     after ``any proceeding before''; and\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1) and (2), by inserting ``or ancillary \n     to'' after ``a proceeding before'' each place it appears; and\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by inserting a period at the end.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSpecter in sponsoring the False Statements Penalty Restoration Act.\n  Right now, it is a crime to make a false statement to the executive \nbranch, if the false statement is made knowingly and willfully and is \nmaterial in nature. This prohibition is contained in the Federal \ncriminal code at 18 U.S.C. 1001.\n  Forty years ago, in 1955, the Supreme Court interpreted section 1001 \nto prohibit willful, material false statements not only to the \nexecutive branch, but also to the judicial and legislative branches. \nFor 40 years, that was the law of the land, and it served this country \nwell. But a recent Supreme Court decision has now drastically \ndiminished the scope of this prohibition.\n  Last year, in a case called United States versus Hubbard, the Supreme \nCourt reversed itself and 40 years of precedent and determined that 18 \nU.S.C. 1001 prohibits willful material false statements only to the \nexecutive branch, not to the judicial or legislative branch. It based \nits decision on the wording of the statute which doesn't explicitly \nreference either the courts or Congress.\n  The result has been the dismissal of indictments charging individuals \nwith making willful, material false statements on expense reports or \nfinancial disclosure forms to Congress and the courts. Another \nconsequence has been the exemption of all financial disclosure \nstatements filed by judges and Members of Congress from criminal \nenforcement. Parity among the three branches has been reduced, and \ncommon sense has been violated, since, logically, the criminal status \nof a willful, material false statement shouldn't depend upon which \nbranch of the Federal Government received it.\n  The bill we are introducing today would restore parity by amending \nsection 1001 to make it clear that its prohibition against willful, \nmaterial false statements applies to all three branches. The bill would \nessentially restore the status quo prior to Hubbard, including \nmaintaining the longstanding exception for statements made to courts \nadjudicating disputes to ensure vigorous advocacy in the courtroom.\n  The false statements prohibition in section 1001 has proven itself a \nuseful weapon against fraud, financial deception and other abuses that \naffect all three branches of Government. The Supreme Court gave no \nreason for reducing its usefulness, other than the Court's commitment \nto relying on the express words of the statute itself. Our bill would \nchange those words to clarify Congress' intent to apply the same \nprohibition against willful, material false statements to all three \nbranches.\n  Our bill would also correct a second court decision that has weakened \nlongstanding criminal prohibitions against making false statements to \nCongress. The 50-year-old statute at issue here is 18 U.S.C. 1505 which \nprohibits persons from corruptly obstructing a congressional inquiry.\n  In 1991, in a dramatic departure from other circuits, the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals held in United States versus Poindexter that \nthe statute's use of the term ``corruptly'' was unconstitutionally \nvague and failed to provide clear notice that it prohibited an \nindividual's lying to Congress. The Court held that, at most, the \nstatute only prohibited a person from inducing another person to lie or \notherwise obstruct a congressional inquiry; it did not prohibit a \nperson from personally lying or obstructing Congress.\n  No other Federal circuit has taken this approach. In fact, other \ncircuits have interpreted ``corruptly'' to prohibit false or misleading \nstatements not only in section 1505, but in other Federal obstruction \nstatutes as well, including section 1503 which prohibits obstructing a \nFederal grand jury. These circuits have interpreted the Federal \nobstruction statutes to prohibit not only false statements, but also \nwithholding, concealing, altering or destroying documents.\n  The bill we are introducing today would affirm the interpretations of \nthese other circuits by defining ``corruptly'' to mean ``acting with an \nimproper purpose, personally or by influencing another to act, \nincluding, but not limited to, making a false or misleading statement, \nor withholding, concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other \ninformation.''\n  This definition would make it clear that section 1505 is intended to \nprohibit the obstruction of a congressional inquiry by a person acting \nalone as well as when inducing another to act. It would make it clear \nthat this prohibition bars a person from making false or misleading \nstatements to Congress and from withholding, concealing, altering or \ndestroying documents requested by Congress.\n  Our bill would make clear the conduct that section 1505 was always \nmeant to prohibit. It would also ensure that the prohibition against \nobstructing Congress is given an interpretation that is consistent with \nthe obstruction statutes that apply to the other two branches of \ngovernment.\n  Because congressional obstruction prosecutions are more likely within \nthe District of Columbia than other jurisdictions, the 1991 D.C. \nCircuit Court ruling has had a disproportionate impact on the \nusefulness of 18 U.S.C. 1505 to Federal prosecutors. As with Hubbard, \nthis court ruling has led to the dismissal of charges and the \nlimitation of prosecutorial options. It is time to restore the strength \nand usefulness of the congressional obstruction statute as well as its \nparity with other obstruction statutes protecting the integrity of \nFederal investigations.\n  The final two sections of the bill clarify the ability of Congress to \ncompel truthful testimony. Both provisions are taken from a 1988 bill, \nS. 2350, sponsored by then-Senator Rudman and cosponsored by Senator \nInouye. This bill passed the Senate, but not the House. The problems it \naddressed, however, continue to exist.\n  The first problem involves enforcing Senate subpoenas to compel \ntestimony or documents. The Senate currently has explicit statutory \nauthority, under 28 U.S.C. 1365, to obtain court enforcement of \nsubpoenas issued to private individuals and State officials. This \nenforcement authority does not apply, however, to a Senate subpoena \nissued to a federal official acting in an official capacity, presumably \nto keep political disputes between the legislative and executive \nbranches out of the courtroom. The problem here has been to determine \nwhen a subpoenaed official is acting in an official capacity when \nresisting compliance with a Senate subpoena.\n  The Specter-Levin bill would cure this problem by exempting from \nenforcement only those situations where Federal officials have been \ndirected by their agency heads to exert a government privilege and \nresist compliance with the subpoena. Any official resisting a subpoena \nwithout direction from his or her agency head would be deemed acting \noutside his or her official capacity and would be subject to court \nenforcement.\n  The second problem involves compelling testimony from individuals who \nhave been given immunity from criminal prosecution by Congress. In the \npast, some individuals granted immunity have refused to provide \ntestimony in any setting other than a congressional hearing, because \nthe relevant statute, 18 U.S.C. 6005, is limited to appearances \n``before'' a committee, while the comparable judicial immunity statute, \n18 U.S.C. 6003, applies to appearances ``before or ancillary to'' court \nand grand jury proceedings.\n  The bill would reword the congressional immunity statute to parallel \nthe judicial immunity statute, and make it clear that Congress can \ngrant immunity and compel testimony not only in committee hearings, but \nalso in depositions conducted by committee members or committee staff. \nThis provision, like the proceeding one, would improve the Senate's \nability to compel truthful testimony and obtain requested documents. It \nwould also bring greater consistency across the government in how \nimmunized witnesses may be questioned. Again, both provisions were \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent once before.\n  Provisions to bar false statements and compel truthful testimony have \nbeen on the Federal statute books for 40 years or more. Recent court \ndecisions and events have eroded the usefulness of some of these \nprovisions as they apply to the courts and Congress. The bill before \nyou is a bipartisan effort to redress some of the imbalances\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nthat have arisen among the branches in these areas. I urge you to join \nSenator Specter, myself, and our cosponsors in supporting swift passage \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Warner, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Ford, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. \n        Johnston):\n  S. 1735. A bill to establish the U.S. Tourism Organization as a \nnongovernmental entity for the purpose of promoting tourism in the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   The U.S. Tourism Organization Act\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the travel and tourism industry is the \nsecond most productive in the world. In the United States, the tourism \nindustry employs more than 6.3 million people--making it the second \nlargest employer in the country.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is no longer the No. 1 tourist \ndestination. As other nations have recognized the economic potential of \ntourism, the United States has allowed itself to fall behind. We must \nreverse this trend.\n  This week we celebrate National Tourism Week. To commemorate the \nimportant contributions of this great industry, I am introducing a bill \nto stimulate U.S. tourism. I plan to make it a major priority, as \nchairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation--and \nas cochair of the Senate Tourism Caucus--and as the Senator from one of \nthe finest tourist destinations on Earth. My bill gives Federal charter \nto a new U.S. Tourism Organization--a nonprofit, nongovernmental group \nto promote U.S. tourism, both in this country and abroad.\n  Mr. President, this organization would be put together entirely \nthrough private-sector initiatives. It is designed as a public-private \npartnership--not an expensive new Government program. My bill would \nallow the U.S. Tourism Organization to raise funds through the \ndevelopment and sale of a tourism logo or emblem--much as is done today \nby the U.S. Olympic Committee. In addition, for an annual fee, American \nbusinesses could become members of the U.S. Tourism Organization. \nMembership would allow use of the logo for advertising and promotional \nefforts. Not only would this boost individual businesses, it also would \nadvance the tourism industry as a whole.\n  My bill also would implement a national tourism strategy so that the \nUnited States can once again be the No. 1 tourist destination in the \nworld. This is of critical importance to places like my home State of \nSouth Dakota.\n  In South Dakota, we depend upon our average tourism revenues of $1.24 \nbillion. In fact, tourism is second only to agriculture as the most \nlucrative industry in South Dakota.\n  Ask anyone in Washington and they will tell you I am South Dakota's \nNo. 1 travel agent.\n  Whether it is Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, where I enjoy riding my \nHarley Davidson Softtail, a trip to Laura Ingalls Wilder's home in \nDeSmet, or the Prairie Dog Hunt in Winner--I am always looking for ways \nto promote South Dakota as a tourist destination.\n  Incidentally, I was able to ride my Harley in the beautiful Black \nHills of South Dakota this weekend. I am leading a group of 600 \nmotorcyclists there in 2 weeks. The Sturgis bike rally is one of the \nmajor events in the Nation--South Dakota really is a major tourist \ndestination.\n  Visitors to my Washington office frequently ask about the beautiful \npanorama of Mount Rushmore which hangs in my reception area. Set in the \nheart of the Black Hills National Forest, the memorial is a shrine of \nAmerican Presidential heroes: George Washington, Father of the Nation; \nThomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence; Theodore \nRoosevelt, conservationist and trustbuster; and Abraham Lincoln, the \ngreat emancipator and preserver of the Union. More than 65 years after \nits conception, Mount Rushmore is still one of the most powerful \nsymbols of America's democracy.\n  In my office, I also have a sign letting guests know that the \ninfamous Wall Drug in Wall, SD is only 1,523 miles away. The store \nsurvived the Great Depression by serving free ice water to travelers. \nToday, Wall Drug boasts a restaurant, art gallery, gift shops, and of \ncourse, the drug store that started it all. I might add, the ice water \nis still free.\n\n  As part of my more official efforts, I recently wrote to every \nforeign ambassador in Washington encouraging them to promote South \nDakota as a tourist destination. Not long after receiving my letter, \nthe Ambassador from Austria visited South Dakota. I understand he \nenjoyed his visit very much. Foreign visitors are becoming our fastest \ngrowing tourist population. We welcome them.\n  The bill I am introducing today is designed to make it easier for \nforeign visitors to plan a trip to South Dakota. Among the many duties \nof the U.S. Tourist Organization is the development of a national \ntravel and tourism strategy aimed at increasing foreign tourism in the \nUnited States.\n  I want the organization to aim at high technology. Earlier this year \nwe passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This new law will unleash \nwhole generations of communications technology. When I introduced the \nbill that became that law, I said the technology it would spur would \nbenefit a wide variety of industries. This is a prime example. With \ntechnologies such as the World Wide Web, information on U.S. tourism \ncan be made available to all corners of the globe.\n  Austrians could learn about the world-class Shrine to Music Museum in \nVermillion. Kenyan safari hunters would be able find out when hunting \nseason is in Redfield--the Pheasant Capital of the world. Dogsledders \nin the Yukon may want to try out the snowmobile trails of the Black \nHills National Forest.\n  The use of the latest developments in communications technology could \npromote destinations like the city of Deadwood--one of the fastest \ngrowing tourist destinations in South Dakota. Deadwood's Main Street is \nlined with old-fashioned saloons and gaming halls--inspiring memories \nof the 1890's gold rush. You can still visit Saloon No. 10 where Wild \nBill Hickock was shot--making famous his poker hand of aces and eights, \nthe Deadman's hand.\n  Other legendary sites in South Dakota also would benefit. Near \nGarretson, SD lies Devil's Gulch--a deep rocky chasm, made famous by \nJesse James. As you stand and look across Devil's Gulch, you can almost \nimagine Jesse's cry when, being chased by the law, he spurred his horse \nto leap across the 20-foot wide, 50-foot deep chasm and rode to \nfreedom.\n  Of course, once the destination is decided, visitors would want to \nbook accommodations, and arrange transportation and tour guides. \nHowever, in South Dakota, we have many small businesses which might not \nhave the advertising budgets of the larger tours and resorts.\n  My bill is designed to promote all U.S. tourism interests--including \nboth large and small business operations. To ensure this, the U.S. \nTourism Organization would have a National Tourism Board, with 45 \nmembers, each representing a different aspect of the travel and tourism \nindustry--from transportation, to accommodations, from dining and \nentertainment, to tour guides.\n  This provision would be particularly helpful to small business owners \nin South Dakota like Al Johnson who runs the Palmer Gulch Resort near \nHill City. Or for Alfred Mueller, owner of Al's Oasis in Chamberlain--\nthe famous home of the buffaloburger.\n  The U.S. Tourism Organization would partner the Federal Government \nwith the men and women who are the tourism industry. This type of \npublic-private partnership was discussed by South Dakotans like Vince \nCoyle, of Deadwood, and Julie Jensen, of Rapid City, when they attended \nthe White House conference on tourism. Working together, we can make \ntourism the new key to this country's economic success.\n  This is our opportunity to forge ahead. There is no reason the U.S. \ntravel and tourism should be relegated to the backseat any longer. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in the effort to once again make the \nUnited States the top tourist destination in the world.\n  With that, Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill to establish the \nU.S. Tourism Organization as a nongovernmental entity for the purpose \nof promoting tourism in the United States.\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Warner of Virginia, on the \nfloor.\n  He is a champion of tourism. He has been a leader in the tourism \nindustry since we came to the Senate together in 1978. I am proud he is \njoining in this effort to lead the charge to work for this bill's \npassage. We know that in the Department of Commerce and especially in \nthe Undersecretary for Tourism's office there have been cutbacks. But \nthis provides us with a vehicle to accomplish our goal to promote \ntourism, a vehicle of using public-private partnership. This is the \nspirit and the genius of free enterprise in our country. Senator Warner \nhas been at the forefront of that legislation, and I salute him, and I \nwelcome him to help lead this charge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor to my friend from \nVirginia.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Tourism \n     Organization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the travel and tourism industry is the second largest \n     retail or service industry in the United States, and travel \n     and tourism services ranked as the largest United States \n     export in 1995, generating an $18.6 billion trade surplus for \n     the United States;\n       (2) domestic and international travel and tourism \n     expenditures totaled $433 billion in 1995, $415 billion spent \n     directly within the United States and an additional $18 \n     billion spent by international travelers on United States \n     flag carriers traveling to the United States;\n       (3) direct travel and tourism receipts make up 6 percent of \n     the United States gross domestic product;\n       (4) in 1994 the travel and tourism industry was the \n     nation's second largest employer, directly responsible for \n     6.3 million jobs and indirectly responsible for another 8 \n     million jobs;\n       (5) employment in major sectors of the travel industry is \n     expected to increase 35 percent by the year 2005;\n       (6) 99.7 percent of travel businesses are defined by the \n     federal government as small businesses; and\n       (7) the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in \n     1995 brought together 1,700 travel and tourism industry \n     executives from across the nation and called for the \n     establishment, by federal charter, of a new national tourism \n     organization to promote international tourism to all parts of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Dakota for his kind remarks. Indeed, I had earlier this year, in \nMarch, introduced S. 1623, a bill which in many respects has been \nincorporated, with my concurrence, in the bill that has just been sent \nto the desk, on which I am a principal cosponsor, as the Senator from \nSouth Dakota stated.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, which is the committee of primary jurisdiction for this \nissue. I think it is most proper that he take the lead, and I am happy \nto join him. I at this time urge that the 19 cosponsors--I was \nprivileged to get 19 cosponsors on my bill--now direct their attention \nto this bill which will be the principal focal point for the \ndeliberations in the committee as well as in this Chamber regarding \nthis important subject.\n  It is very interesting that it is just 20 years ago that I began to \ntake my, should we say, initial course in the importance of tourism. At \nthat time, I was privileged to serve the President of the United States \nand, indeed, the Congress as the director of the Nation's bicentennial \nFederal effort. It quickly came to my attention, as it did to all \ninvolved in the bicentennial of the United States, that it would be a \nfocal point that would draw visitors from all over the world. Indeed, \nit did. Millions and millions of people came from all over the world. \nIn the years thereafter, those who could not come during, let us say, \nthe years 1975-76, which was sort of the peak of the centennial--July \n4, 1976, was the focal point--came years after because of the goodwill, \nthe interest that was created by that celebration here in the United \nStates.\n  It was my role to see that each of the States had equal opportunity, \neach of the villages and towns all across America had an equal \nopportunity to participate. If I may say, I was proud to, in many \nrespects, keep the Federal effort down so it was not competitive with \nthe creativity that took place all across our great land and also saved \nthe taxpayers' dollars.\n  I might add that there was a small Federal administration created of \nwhich I was the head. We did our job, closed our doors and turned back \nto the Federal Treasury a considerable portion of the revenue that we \nhad generated primarily through the sale of coins and other items with \nthe national logo affixed thereto.\n  In the years I have been privileged to serve in the Senate, time and \ntime again--indeed, initiated under Republican Presidents--was the \neffort to cut back the participation of the United States in \nfacilitating tourism here in the United States with visitors from \nabroad. I resisted those efforts successfully for a number of years, \nbut now, in this important era of our change of philosophy, namely, to \nlet us move towards less Government and less Government spending, we \naccept the fact that the Federal Government is going to take a lesser \nrole, and the purpose of this act is to try to pick up some of those \nresponsibilities by the private sector at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  Therefore, I think it is important that all begin to give greater \nfocus to travel and tourism in our Nation. Tourism means jobs, and that \nis the single most important thing in America today, in my judgment. As \nI travel about my State, there is the anxiety over jobs. It is job \nsecurity that concerns not just the wage earner, or, in many instances, \ntwo wage earners in the family, but the whole family right on down to \nthe children.\n  This is a means to create superb quality jobs at all levels, and it \nneeds our support. Whether it be at the hotels, airlines, restaurants, \ncampgrounds, amusement parks, or things that interest me and always \nhave, the historical sites all across our great land, tourism works, \nand it works well.\n  Today marks National Tourist Appreciation Day during National Tourism \nWeek. It is a small tribute to this job-impacted industry, which is the \nsecond leading provider of jobs in this Nation--just stop to think, the \nsecond leading provider of jobs in this country--and the third largest \nretail industry, giving the United States a $21 billion trade surplus.\n\n  Last year, visitors from abroad brought approximately $80 billion--\nlet me repeat that--last year visitors coming to our United States from \nall over the world brought $80 billion to the U.S. economy, which is \none-fifth of the total $400 billion provided to the economy by the \ntravel and tourism industry.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I again commend my friend from Virginia for his great \nleadership. I think he found, in getting cosponsors for his original \nbill, there is bipartisan support for this. And I see our friend, \nSenator Dick Bryan, who has done such an outstanding job on tourism and \ntravel matters on his side of the aisle. He also has led the charge on \ntourism and supports this bill. Is it not true that my friend found \ngreat bipartisan support?\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, very definitely. It is absolutely \nbipartisan support on this measure, and that is why I am very much \nencouraged that this bill will be very promptly addressed by the Senate \nand passed.\n  I hasten to add that while we got $80 billion last year, it is \nslipping. The number of persons coming to our shores is going down, \ngoing down, in my judgment, because we do not have the adequate funds \nto project the message beyond our shores--come, come share with us in \nthis magnificent land of ours. And that is the purpose of this bill.\n  For the past several years, the United States' share of the \ninternational travel market has declined. Last year, 2 million fewer \nforeign visitors came to our shores and to visit our land. That was a \n19-percent decline. This translated into 177,000 fewer travel-related \njobs in our Nation.\n  Let us join in this legislation to reverse this decline. We need to \nattract more international tourists and enhance the travel experience \nof both domestic and international travelers. The United States must \nremain the destination of choice for world travelers.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleague from South Dakota in \nintroducing the United States Tourism Organization Act. The bill builds \non the foundation of support in Congress and in the industry \nestablished by S. 1623, the measure that I introduced in March, the \nTravel and Tourism Partnership Act. With the elimination of the U.S. \nTravel and Tourism Administration--that is the Federal role, which \nunderstandably, as Government shrinks, can no longer serve in this \npurpose--the United States, our Nation, will become the only major \ndeveloped nation without a Federal tourism office.\n  We need a national strategy to maintain and increase our share of the \nglobal travel market. Other nations pour money, their tax dollars, into \nmarketing, attempting to lure tourists to their shores, and they are \ndoing so in a way that is taking them away from our United States. Our \nlegislation will provide the tools with which the United States can \nbetter compete with these nations. We can counter these foreign \npromotion dollars with a combination of technical assistance from the \nFederal Government and financial assistance from the private sector.\n  This legislation will create a true public-private partnership \nbetween the travel and tourism industry and the public sector to \neffectively promote international travel to the United States. It \nsupplants the big Government, top-down bureaucracy which was eliminated \nwith the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. This bill establishes \na Federal charter for a privately funded, nonprofit organization tasked \nwith facilitating the development of increasing the United States share \nof the global tourism market. The travel tourism data bank will collect \ninternational market data for dissemination to the travel and tourism \nindustry. It is my hope that the final bill will incorporate the \ntechnical assistance provisions that we included in S. 1623. The U.S. \nTourism Organization will represent the United States in its relations \nwith world tourism, and with other international agencies, and will be \ngoverned by the national tourism board.\n\n  This bill does not cost the taxpayer a nickel. No Federal funding is \nassociated with the legislation. The bill includes a sunset provision \nwhich directs the U.S. Tourism Organization to develop a long-term \nfinancing plan within 2 years, encouraging ongoing industry support for \nits promotion efforts.\n  Travel industry leaders from around the Nation enthusiastically \nendorse the plan embodied in this bill. Let me just pause on that. This \nbill is a direct result of tremendous support all across the tourism \nindustry. So it is a joint effort at the very inception with those of \nus in the legislative branch and those in the private sector.\n  The White House Conference on Travel and Tourism supported this \namendment. Together, through the collective talent of both the \norganization and the board of directors, it is my hope that America \nwill once again launch itself into the international tourism market and \nbe a strong competitor, as it has been in years previously, again \ncreating jobs here in our United States.\n  I encourage all 19 of my colleagues who supported S. 1623, the Travel \nand Tourism Partnership Act, which I introduced in March, to join in \nthis initiative.\n  The Senator from South Dakota extolled, quite properly, the virtues \nof his State. I will not take time here today to extol the virtues of \nVirginia. But we are proud to be known as the Mother of Presidents. So \nmuch of the early history of our Nation, particularly the formation of \nthe Government, devolved upon Virginians, to bring forth the ideas that \nwe cherish today. Indeed, the very manual that rests on the President's \ndesk is derivative of Mr. Jefferson's teachings years ago.\n  So Virginia will take second place to none. But I think in fairness \nwe are here today to concentrate on this legislation. Indeed, our \nGovernor, with the help of his lovely wife, is spending a great deal of \ntime on the subject of tourism today, recognizing how important it is \nto the economy of our State. But it is also important that our State be \nunderstood all across America, particularly in the educational process, \nas to how it had a major role in the development of our Government \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I commend the distinguished Senator \nabout to speak for his participation in this bill, Senator Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the committee chairman, Senator \nPressler, Senator Hollings, Senator Inouye, Senator Ford, Senator \nKerry, Senator Breaux, Senator Dorgan, Senator Akaka, and Senator \nJohnston for their leadership in introducing this bill which is the \nUnited States Tourism Organization Act.\n  Let me say, parenthetically, I hail from a State where tourism is far \nand above our largest single economic industry. It is the mainstream, \nthe main spring for an economy which has grown more rapidly than any \neconomy in America, added more new jobs, enjoys more economic growth \nand vitality. The southern part of the State, Las Vegas, will soon have \n100,000 hotel rooms. That is larger than any city, not only in America, \nbut in the world. And several new properties are on the drawing boards.\n  So tourism is something we understand in Nevada. From my former \ncapacity as the chief executive of Nevada, I know that we work at the \nState level to establish the public-private partnership that my \ncolleagues have alluded to earlier this afternoon in their remarks on \nthe floor. So I am delighted to work with them in fashioning this piece \nof legislation.\n  Travel and tourism has been one of our country's great success \nstories. Tourism is the second largest employer in our Nation after \nhealth care. It employs, either directly or indirectly, 13 million \nAmericans and has created jobs at more than twice the national average.\n  Travel and tourism generated $417 billion spending in 1994. \nInternational visitor spending accounted for $77 billion in foreign \nexchange, making it America's largest export.\n  Tourism generated a $22 billion net surplus in our trade balance. The \nopportunity that we have is ever so promising because international \ntourism is the most rapidly growing sector in the tourism market. By \nthe year 2000, 4 years from now, more than 661 million people will be \ntraveling throughout the world. That is twice as many people as \ntraveled just a little more than a decade ago, in 1985.\n  Unfortunately, even as we look forward to anticipate the good news of \nexpanded international travel, we reflect upon the fact that America's \nshare of the world's tourism market is declining. In 1983, the United \nStates enjoyed almost 19 percent of the world's tourism receipts. That \nhas declined to 15.6 percent this year and is expected to shrink to \n13.8 percent by the end of this decade.\n\n  The loss in the U.S. share of the world tourism market can be \ntranslated into a significant impact on our trade deficit and \nemployment--jobs, as the distinguished Senator from Virginia pointed \nout. If we were able to keep our world tourism share from shrinking, we \nwould improve our trade balance by $28 billion and increase employment \nin America by 370,000 persons by the year 2000.\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n  Those are significant numbers by any measure. Very few industries can \nshape our economy to this extent. Until a few months ago, the Federal \nGovernment funded a tourism program effort that ranked 23d in the world \nin terms of dollars spent, putting the United States behind such \ncountries as Tunisia and Malaysia. While this effort fell far short of \nwhat should have been, it was a worthwhile effort that produced \ntangible effects.\n  Under the skillful leadership of the Under Secretary of Travel and \nTourism, Greg Farmer, USTTA was an effective organization and helped to \ncreate a favorable impression of our country to foreign tourists.\n  Although this bill enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the \ncontinuation of the agency for a transitional year, it was supported in \nthe Senate; we had strong bipartisan support of Senator Burns and \nSenator McConnell. Unfortunately, in the House the action of the \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee killed this minimal \neffort and left our country without any international tourism \npromotion, while at the same time our international competitors have \nimpressive international tourism efforts, trying to entice America and \nother countries' citizens to visit their countries. The United States, \nas a result of this action, was unilaterally disarmed in the \ncompetition for international travel markets.\n  This was a bad decision, when we consider the great opportunities \nthat we have to encourage visitors to this country this summer. As the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair knows, we have, in an adjacent \nState to his own, the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta; an opportunity \nfor people from around the world to stay and not only visit the Olympic \nGames but to see other parts of our country as well.\n  While the effort to continue the USTTA for the transitional year, as \nI have indicated, was unsuccessful--and I opposed what I considered a \nmyopic approach--nevertheless, we do have an opportunity to recover. \nLast October the White House hosted the first ever White House \nConference on Travel and Tourism. That conference came up with a series \nof recommendations from all segments of the tourism industry on how to \nimprove our promotional efforts as a country.\n  Most significant was the recommendation to establish a public-private \npartnership for tourism promotion, and it is this legislation that \ntraces its origins to the White House conference, generated by a broad \nsector of the tourism industry, that we embody in the legislation that \nwe introduce today.\n  This legislation establishes, by a Federal charter, the U.S. Tourism \nOrganization. The organization shall be nonprofit and shall implement \nthe national travel and tourism strategy, operate travel and tourism \npromotion outside the United States, establish a travel and tourism \ndata bank to collect and disseminate international market data and to \nconduct market research for the effective promotion of U.S. tourism.\n  The organization shall be governed by a board of directors which \nshall have 45 members and be known as the national tourism board, \nrepresenting a broad and diverse cross-section of various public and \nprivate-sector tourism entities.\n  The tourism industry strongly supports this legislation. We are \ncounting on them to turn this into a successful organization.\n  This legislation, incorporating a public-private sector partnership, \nis a model for how Government, industry, and labor should cooperate in \npromoting our national efforts. I hope we can swiftly pass this \nlegislation and send it to the President so we can get on with our \nefforts to encourage more travel and tourism from abroad to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak \nbriefly in support of S. 1735, a bill that will establish an \nindependent U.S. Tourism Organization.\n  I am supportive, particularly, of the structure of the bill that \nSenator Pressler has put together. I want to commend him and the staff \nof the Commerce Committee for their hard work. They have fashioned a \nbill that has gotten strong bipartisan support here in the Senate.\n  We used the 1950 act that incorporates the U.S. Olympic Committee \n[USOC] as a model for this bill. That act was greatly expanded upon by \nthe Amateur Sports Act of 1978 [ASA], and the concepts in S. 1735 draw \nmuch from the ASA.\n  The primary goal of the ASA was to create a strong, central authority \nto serve amateur athletics.\n  We are now creating a strong, central authority for the tourism \nindustry, which will be called the U.S. Tourism Organization [USTO].\n  The USTO would have many of the same duties and powers as provided in \nthe Amateur Sports Act for the U.S. Olympic Committee, including the \nauthority to represent the United States internationally with respect \nto tourism and to adopt a constitution and bylaws. Like the U.S. \nOlympic Committee, the U.S. Tourism Organization would be required to \nbe nonpolitical.\n  S. 1735 would specify the founding members of a board of directors \nfor the U.S. Tourism Organization.\n  As with the ASA, S. 1735 would grant the USTO the authority to design \nappropriate symbols, emblems, trademarks, and names, and would make it \na violation of the Trademark Act of 1946 for any person to use these \nwithout the consent of the USTO.\n  The Olympic Committee's ability to raise funds for its operations is \nalmost entirely related to its exclusive rights under the ASA to \nOlympic symbols, and we hope the exclusive use of these will work as \nfor the new USTO.\n  Significantly, as with the U.S. Olympic Committee, no Federal funding \nis associated with this legislation. This is an industry-funded and \nindustry-directed initiative.\n  Supporting over 14 million jobs directly and indirectly, the travel \nand tourism industry is America's second largest employer. It is the \nthird largest retail industry, generating an estimated $430 billion in \nexpenditures. And it is good for State, local, and Federal Government, \ngenerating almost $60 billion a year in Federal, State, and local \ntaxes.\n  Tourism is extremely important to my State of Alaska. Over 1 million \npeople will visit Alaska this year; that's more visitors than there are \nState residents.\n  Tourists, both domestic and international, support 22,000 jobs in \nAlaska and $523 million in payroll. This year, tourists will spend $1.2 \nbillion in my State.\n  I support this legislation, which would create the foundations of a \nstrong, independent entity to promote travel and tourism in the United \nStates. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 1736. A bill for the relief of Staff Sergeant Charles Raymond \nStewart and Cynthia M. Stewart of Anchorage, Alaska, and their minor \nson, Jeff Christopher Stewart; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private bill for \na young Alaskan, Jeff Stewart. Jeff's father, Charles Stewart was a \nstaff sergeant stationed in Germany in 1992. Jeff and his brother were \nplaying when Jeff fell and fractured his hip. Jeff was taken to the \nLangstuhl Army Hospital's emergency room where an Army physician failed \nto diagnose his fractured hip. Jeff was sent home for bed rest. Two \ndays later Jeff's mother took Jeff to the Air Force clinic at Ramstein \nAir Base because Jeff was still in intense pain. At Ramstein, Jeff was \nseen by an Air Force physician who also failed to diagnose his \nfractured hip and sent Jeff home for bed rest. Six days later Jeff's \nparents took him back to Ramstein where an Air Force nurse diagnosed \nhis fractured hip.\n  Unfortunately, this diagnosis was too late to prevent permanent \ninjury to Jeff. Jeff must now face a painful hip replacement operation \nevery 7 to 10 years for the rest of his life.\n  My bill will not automatically compensate Jeff and his family; \nrather, it will allow them to bring suit in a U.S. court as they would \nhave had a right to do if the treatment had occurred in the United \nStates. Nor is this bill meant to infer negligence on the part of the \nUnited States or the military doctors that treated Jeff Stewart; rather \nit will give Jeff and his family the opportunity to explain their case \nto a judge\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nwho can make the final decision as to whether or not Jeff should be \ncompensated.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 1737. A bill to protect Yellowstone National Park, the Clarks Fork \nof the Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River, and the Absaroka-\nBeartooth Wilderness Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 the yellowstone protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill dealing with a \nproposed gold, silver, and copper mine to be operated by the Crown \nButte Mining Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of two Canadian companies, \n2\\1/2\\ miles north of Yellowstone National Park.\n  They also propose to construct a 72-acre impoundment area with a dam \nthat would be somewhere between 75 and 100 feet high, which would have \na plastic lining on the bottom and some sort of a cap on top to keep \noxygen away from the 5.5 million tons of tailings from the mining \noperation that would go into this impoundment area. The purpose of \nkeeping the oxygen away from it is to keep the waste from turning into \nsulfuric acid.\n  The President of the United States flew over this area last summer \nand promptly thereafter, by Executive order, withdrew 19,100 acres of \nland in the Gallatin and Custer National Forests in Montana.\n  The President has the authority to segregate public lands, subject to \nvalid existing rights, and keep that land from being used for mining \npurposes for a period of 2 years. Then the Secretary of the Interior \nhas the right, pursuant to the Federal Lands Policy Management Act, to \nwithdraw that land for 20 years.\n  My bill would prevent approximately 24,000 acres of Federal land in \nthe area from being used for mining, subject to valid existing rights. \nMy bill admittedly cannot legally stop Crown Butte from proceeding with \nthe mine, assuming the proposed mine meets all of the environmental \nrequirements. My bill and the President's action before my bill are \ndesigned to discourage them and dissuade them from doing it. I hope \nthat Crown Butte, as good corporate citizens, will not force the issue \nand leave us to wonder whether or not this 5.5 million tons of tailings \nthat they propose to impound there could possibly break loose and \npollute Clarks Fork and Soda Butte Creek, which flows right into \nYellowstone National Park.\n  The American Rivers Association has listed, for the last 3 years, the \nClarks Fork of the Yellowstone River as the most threatened river in \nAmerica. The World Heritage Convention, which consists of more than 135 \nnations that collaborate on what they consider to be sites of \ninternational significance, has declared Yellowstone National Park as \nendangered because of the proposed mine.\n  All of that does not have to tell us anything. I went to Yellowstone \nwhen I was 12 years old--breathtaking. I never forgot any part of it, \nthe geysers, the magnificent waterfalls--all of it. Here is the first \nnational park in America, Yellowstone, a crown jewel. To allow a mining \ncompany, in the interest of extracting $500 million to $700 million \nworth of gold, silver and copper, to threaten to destroy the first \nnational park in America, one of the real crown jewels of the world, \nnot just America, is absolutely unacceptable.\n  From a purely philosophical standpoint, I am an unrepentant \nenvironmentalist. I have not always been, because I never fully \nunderstood it until I came to the Senate. But I have come to the \nconclusion that if something is going to cause a lot of economic \ndislocation, cost a lot of jobs, and the environmental damage is \ntemporary and can be fully, 100 percent mitigated, there are instances \nwhen that might be acceptable. But any time you cannot conclusively \nshow that the environmental damage you are about to do cannot be \nmitigated, cannot be reversed, that is a no brainer to this Senator. \nWhile Crown Butte says that their impoundment area is a state-of-the-\nart method of impounding these horrible, environmentally devastating \ntailings from that gold operation, that is a no brainer for us not to \ndo everything we can to stop it.\n  The American people share many heartfelt values. None is greater than \nthe protection of our environment. Last year, when these savage \nassaults on the environment were proposed, the American people were \nvocally opposed and 74 percent of the people said they did not want to \nturn the clock back on the environment.\n  So I hope I will attract both Democratic and Republican cosponsors to \nthis bill, because I know the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, for the \nmost part, are environmentalists. I know they share my concerns about \nthe possible ecological disaster that awaits us if we do not do \nsomething to stop this mining operation from ever opening its doors so \nnear to Yellowstone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill which I now send to \nthe desk be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Yellowstone Protection Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the superlative nature and scenic resources of the \n     Yellowstone area led Congress in 1872 to establish \n     Yellowstone National Park as the world's first national park;\n       (2) a 20.5 mile segment of the Clarks Fork of the \n     Yellowstone River was designated in 1990 as a component of \n     the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, the only such \n     designation within the State of Wyoming, in order to preserve \n     and enhance the natural, scenic, and recreational resources \n     of such segment;\n       (3) the Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area was \n     designated in 1978 to protect the wilderness and ecological \n     values of certain lands north and east of Yellowstone \n     National Park;\n       (4) in recognition of its natural resource values and \n     international significance, Yellowstone National Park was \n     designated a World Heritage Site in 1978;\n       (5) past and ongoing mining practices have degraded the \n     resource values of Henderson Mountain and adjacent lands \n     upstream of Yellowstone National Park, the Absaroka-Beartooth \n     National Wilderness Area and the Clarks Fork of the \n     Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River, and acid mine \n     pollution and heavy metal contamination caused by such \n     practices have polluted the headwater sources of Soda Butte \n     Creek and the Lamar River, the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone \n     River and the Stillwater River;\n       (6) on September 1, 1995 approximately 19,100 acres of \n     federal land upstream of Yellowstone National Park, the \n     Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River \n     and the Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area were \n     segregated from entry under the general mining laws for a \n     two-year period, in order to protect the watersheds within \n     the drainages of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, \n     Soda Butte Creek and the Stillwater River and to protect the \n     water quality and fresh water fishery resources within \n     Yellowstone National Park;\n       (7) because of proposed mineral development upstream of \n     Yellowstone National Park, and other reasons, the World \n     Heritage Committee added Yellowstone National Park to the \n     ``List of World Heritage in Danger'' in December, 1995; and\n       (8) proposed mining activities in the area present a clear \n     and present danger to the resource values of the area as well \n     as those of Yellowstone National Park, the Clarks Fork of the \n     Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River and the Absaroka-\n     Beartooth National Wilderness Area, and it is, therefore, in \n     the public interest to protect these lands and rivers from \n     such mining activities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to make permanent the present \n     temporary segregation of lands upstream of Yellowstone \n     National Park, Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area \n     and the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone National Wild and \n     Scenic River from entry under the general mining laws, \n     restrict the use of certain federal lands, and to provide \n     assurance that the exercise of valid existing mineral rights \n     does not threaten the water quality, fisheries and other \n     resource values of this area.\n\n     SEC. 4. AREA INCLUDED.\n\n       The area affected by this Act shall be comprised of \n     approximately 24,000 acres of lands and interests in lands \n     within the Gallatin and Custer National Forests as generally \n     depicted on the map entitle ``Yellowstone Protection Act of \n     1996''. The map shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the offices of the Chief of the Forest Service, \n     Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.\n\n     SEC. 5. MINERALS AND MINING.\n\n       (a) Withdrawal.--After enactment of this Act, and subject \n     to valid existing rights, the lands segregated from entry \n     under the general mining laws pursuant to the order contained \n     on page 45732 of the Federal Register (September 1, 1995) \n     shall not be:\n       (1) open to location of mining claims under the general \n     mining laws of the United States;\n       (2) available for leasing under the mineral leasing and \n     geothermal leasing laws of the United States; and\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n       (3) available for disposal of mineral materials under the \n     Act of July 31, 1947, commonly known as the Material Act of \n     1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).\n       (b) Limitation on Patent Issuance.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights, no patents under the general mining laws \n     shall be issued for any claim located in the area described \n     in section 4.\n       (c) Prohibition.--(1) Subject to valid existing rights, no \n     federal lands within the area described in section 4 may be \n     used in connection with any mining related activity, except \n     for reclamation.\n       (2) Subject to valid existing rights, no federal department \n     or agency shall assist by loan, grant, license or otherwise \n     in the development or construction of cyanide heap- or vat-\n     leach facilities, dams or other impoundment structures for \n     the storage of mine tailing, work camps, power plants, \n     electrical transmission lines, gravel or rock borrow pits or \n     mills within the area described in section 4. However, \n     nothing in this section shall limit reclamation.\n       (d) Reclamation.--Any mining or mining related activities \n     occurring in the area described in section 4 shall be subject \n     to operation and reclamation requirements established by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, including requirements for \n     reasonable reclamation of disturbed lands to a visual and \n     hydrological condition as close as practical to their \n     premining condition.\n       (e) Mining Claim Validity Reviews.--The Secretary of \n     Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, \n     shall complete within three years of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, a review of the validity of all claims under the \n     general mining laws within the area described in section 4. \n     If a claim is determined to be invalid, the claim shall be \n     immediately declared null and void.\n       (f) Plans of Operation.--(1) The Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall not approve a plan of operation for mining activities \n     within the area described in section 4 that threatens to \n     pollute groundwater or surface water flowing into Yellowstone \n     National Park, the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone National \n     Wild and Scenic River or the Absaroka--Beartooth National \n     Wilderness Area.\n       (2) Prior to granting an order approving a plan of \n     operations for mining activities within the area described in \n     section 4, the Secretary of Agriculture shall transmit the \n     proposed plan of operation to the Secretary of Interior and \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     the Governors of Montana and Wyoming.\n       (3) Within 90 days of the date on which the proposed plan \n     of operations is submitted for their review, the Secretary of \n     Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall either (1) certify that the proposed \n     plan of operation does not threaten to pollute groundwater or \n     surface water flowing into Yellowstone National park, the \n     Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River \n     or the Absoraka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area or (2) \n     make recommendations for any actions or conditions that would \n     be necessary to obtain their certification that the proposed \n     plan of operation will not threaten such pollution.\n       (4) The Secretary of Agriculture shall not approve a plan \n     of operation unless (1) the Secretary of Interior and the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency provide \n     the certification under subsection (f)(3) of this section or \n     (2) the plan of operation is modified to adopt the \n     recommendations made by them and (3) any comments submitted \n     by the Governors of Montana and Wyoming are taken into \n     account.\n       (5) The Secretary of Agriculture shall not approve a plan \n     of operation for any mining activities within the area \n     described in section 4 that requires the perpetual treatment \n     of acid mine pollution of surface or groundwater resources.\n       (6) Prior to executing a final approval of the plan of \n     operation, the Secretary of Agriculture shall transmit the \n     proposed final plan to the President and Congress.

A bill to provide for improved access to and use of the \nBoundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nthe boundary waters canoe area wilderness accessibility and partnership \n                              act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to resolve one of the longest and most heartfelt controversies \nin my home State of Minnesota: the future of the Boundary Waters Canoe \nArea Wilderness.\n  In 1978, 1 million acres in northern Minnesota were designated by \nCongress as our Nation's only lakeland-based Federal wilderness area.\n  This area was named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, or \nBWCAW.\n  Through this Federal designation, Congress rightfully acknowledged \nthe need to protect the tremendous ecological and recreational \nresources existing within the BWCAW.\n  At the same time, however, Congress recognized that it was to be a \nmultiple-use wilderness area, as first envisioned by Senator Hubert \nHumphrey back in 1964.\n  When Senator Humphrey included the region now known as the boundary \nwaters in the National Wilderness System, he made that commitment to \nthe people of Minnesota when he said ``The Wilderness bill will not ban \nmotorboats.''\n  Respected preservationist Sigurd F. Olson reiterated Senator \nHumphrey's pledge, saying ``Nothing in this act shall preclude the \ncontinuance within the area of already established use of motorboats.''\n  In fact, it is safe to say that without those commitments to the \npeople of Minnesota, it is doubtful whether this region would be a \nwilderness area today.\n  The 1978 legislation creating the boundary waters also included \ncommitments allowing motorized uses of select lakes and portages.\n  Minnesotans were to be given reasonable access to recreation in the \nboundary waters. The region would be preserved as a national treasure \nthat could be enjoyed by everyone.\n  But as time passed, those commitments were forgotten in Washington.\n  Since 1978, the people of northern Minnesota have been subjected to \never-increasing U.S. Forest Service regulations in the boundary waters.\n  Many in the area have seen their customs, cultures and traditions \nuprooted by federal regulations which have shut them out of the land \nthey call home.\n  Definition changes and unreasonable permit restrictions are just a \nfew of the administrative changes that have twisted the original intent \nof the boundary waters legislation, making the area less accessible for \nthe people who live there.\n  This 18-year history of broken promises and creeping encroachment by \nthe Federal Government has led to a region of our State being overtaken \nby Washington bureaucrats, their rules and regulations, and \nrestrictions on public access and input.\n  It has turned the original boundary waters law on its head and \nprevented many of us from enjoying the same natural resources our \nmothers and fathers cared for over the years.\n  Enough is enough.\n  It is time to return to the original intent of the boundary waters \nlegislation, to give the public access to the natural resources which \nsurround them, and to give Minnesotans a say in how their land is \nmanaged. My legislation will do just that.\n  The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Accessibility and \nPartnership Act is designed to achieve these goals with several modest, \ncommon-sense reforms.\n  First, it will allow the reinstatement of three motorized portages to \nassist in transporting boats between five lakes in the boundary waters \nregion.\n  Prior to their closing in 1993, these portages were essential in \ntransporting many of the elderly and disabled between motorized lakes \nin the BWCAW.\n  Because of the successful efforts of environmental extremists to \nclose down the portages, these Minnesotans have found themselves \nunfairly shut out from the boundary waters because of their age or \ndisability. Under my legislation, such discrimination will no longer be \ntolerated.\n  By reopening the portages, my bill will ensure that the boundary \nwaters will be there for the enjoyment of all who visit, not just the \nyoung and strong.\n  Second, it will create a new Planning and Management Council charged \nwith developing and monitoring a comprehensive management plan. This \nmanagement council will consist of 11 members appointed by the \nSecretary of Agriculture and will include representatives from Federal, \nState, local, and tribal governments.\n\n  The management council will be authorized to create advisory councils \nmade up of individuals representing civic, business, conservation, \nsportsperson, and citizen organizations.\n  All council meetings will be open to the public, who will be given \nopportunities to provide comment on agenda items. Minutes will be \nrecorded at all meetings and made available for public inspection.\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\n  Under my legislation, public input will no longer be ignored--in \nfact, it will be encouraged as part of the management process.\n  Finally, my legislation will prohibit the Forest Service from issuing \nany additional regulations regarding the BWCAW between enactment of the \nbill and final approval of the management plan, except in cases of \nroutine administration, law enforcement need, and emergencies.\n  All in all, the bill I introduce today is a modest and reasonable \nattempt to give back to the people one of their most basic rights: the \nfreedom to enjoy our natural resources responsibly.\n  It comes as the result of two public field hearings in Minnesota, 9 \nhours of public testimony from 32 witnesses from Minnesota, and pages \nof documents, data, and public feedback.\n  It will increase public input and participation in the management of \nthe boundary waters, creating a partnership between the Government and \nthe people of Minnesota. And it will ensure the protection of this \nnational treasure for generations to come.\n  This legislation has been a long time coming. For nearly 20 years, \nthe people of Minnesota have waited patiently for the Federal \nGovernment to act on their behalf. They should not have to wait any \nlonger. We must move expeditiously to ensure that their rights--as \nprescribed within this measure--are no longer held hostage by \noverzealous regulators and administrators from Washington.\n  The people of northern Minnesota deserve to finally have their voices \nheard in the Halls of Congress. Today, we take that first step.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1738\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, located \n     amidst the scenic splendor of the Minnesota-Ontario border, \n     is and always will be a unique lakeland-based Federal \n     wilderness unit that serves as 1 of the Nation's great \n     natural ecosystems;\n       (2) the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is a special \n     wilderness area dedicated to appropriate public access and \n     use through recognized motorized and nonmotorized \n     recreational activities under protections and commitments in \n     the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and Public Law \n     95-495 (92 Stat. 1649);\n       (3) intergovernmental cooperation that respects and \n     emphasizes the role of State, local, and tribal governments \n     in land management decisionmaking processes is essential to \n     optimize the preservation and development of social, \n     historical, cultural, and recreational resources; and\n       (4) the national interest is served by--\n       (A) improving the management and protection of the Boundary \n     Waters Canoe Area Wilderness;\n       (B) allowing Federal, State, local, and tribal governments \n     to engage in an innovative management partnership in Federal \n     land management decisionmaking processes; and\n       (C) ensuring adequate public access, enjoyment, and use of \n     the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness through \n     nonmotorized and limited motorized means.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 4.3-cent increase in the transportation motor fuels excise tax \nrates enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and \ndedicated to the general fund of the Treasury; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                       GAS TAX REPEAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nrepeals the 4.3-cent gas tax increase imposed by President Clinton in \nhis 1993 tax bill--a $265 billion increase--the largest in history.\n  I am confident that this legislation would pass immediately, and by a \nwide margin, if my Democratic colleagues would remove their objection \nto a vote.\n  As we all know, gas prices are at their highest level since the gulf \nwar. This bill will provide much-needed tax relief to American \ntravelers. I am happy to be joined by more than 20 of my colleagues who \nare cosponsoring this legislation to repeal the gas tax hike.\n  The 1993 tax increase raised fuel taxes on all modes of \ntransportation by 4.3 cents per gallon. This tax increase was not \ndedicated to the highway trust fund to maintain and to improve our \nNation's highways, roads, and bridges. Rather it was used to fund a \nlarger and more pervasive Federal Government.\n  President Clinton and his Democratic colleagues would rather tax more \nand spend more than cut wasteful government spending. In 1993, they \nraised income, estate, and Social Security taxes. This $265 billion tax \nincrease passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or \nthe Senate.\n  And their taxes particularly hurt working Americans, making it harder \nfor them to make ends meet. As we repeal the gas tax hike, 60 percent \nof the\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\ntax relief would go to Americans making less than $50,000 a year--\nalmost half of the total relief would be for families making less than \n$40,000 a year.\n  These drivers probably didn't feel rich when the President increased \ntheir taxes in 1993, but they will certainly be better off when we \nrepeal the tax hike.\n  I also would note that if the President had his way, gas prices would \nbe rising yet again--by another 2.5 cents per gallon tax that would \nhave begun on July 1, 1996--the last installment of a 7.5-cent-per-\ngallon tax that was part of his overall energy tax increase proposal. \nRepublicans fought against that increase and this bill will remove the \nlast vestige of the 1993 gas tax increase.\n  This legislation does not increase the budget deficit. It is paid for \nby reductions in the Department of Energy administrative overhead \naccount, which includes the Secretary's travel budget. These Energy \nDepartment cost savings were proposed by the President in his latest \nbudget. The bill also calls for a limited auction of Federal \ncommunications spectrum. Together, these offsets raise the $2.9 billion \nnecessary to fund the repeal through 1996. I will work for a long-term \nrepeal in the context of our efforts to eliminate the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  Repealing the 1993 gas tax is the fastest and surest way to lower gas \nprices. It will provide immediate relief--especially to American \nfamilies who drive to their summer vacations.\n  The bill provides for an immediate tax credit for service station \nowners and others that purchase gas for resale to customers. This way \nthey can pass the savings on to their customers as they have told us \nthey will.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Repeal of Transportation Motor Fuels Excise Tax\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 imposed a \n     permanent 4.3-cents-per-gallon excise tax on transportation \n     motor fuels. Revenues from this tax are retained in the \n     General Fund of the Treasury. This excise tax applies to \n     fuels used in all transportation sectors: highway, aviation, \n     rail, inland waterway shipping, and recreational boating. All \n     fuels used in those transportation sectors (gasoline, diesel \n     fuel, special motor fuels, compressed natural gas, jet fuel, \n     and barge fuel) are subject to tax.\n       Statutorily, the 4.3-cents-per-gallon transportation motor \n     fuels excise tax is imposed as an additional component of the \n     rates of other motor fuels excise taxes.\\1\\ Those other \n     excise taxes typically are imposed as a financing source for \n     Federal environmental and public works programs administered \n     through Federal trust funds. The other excise taxes have \n     scheduled expiration dates, which generally coincide with \n     expiration of authorizing legislation for those Federal \n     programs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Because compressed natural gas (``CNG'') is a gaseous \n     fuel rather than a liquid, the rate of tax is stated as 48.54 \n     cents per MCF, which was the statutory equivalent for CNG of \n     the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax rate enacted in 1993. The 48.54-\n     cents-per-gallon rate is the only excise tax imposed on CNG.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The bill would repeal the 4.3-cents-per-gallon General Fund \n     transportation motor fuels excise tax on fuel used in all \n     transportation sectors currently subject to the tax during \n     the period beginning seven days after enactment and ending \n     after December 31, 1996. Statutorily this is accomplished by \n     reducing the aggregate tax rate that otherwise would be \n     imposed by 4.3 cents per gallon, or removing the denial of an \n     exemption. The bill does not affect any of the motor fuels \n     excise taxes that are dedicated funding sources for Federal \n     environmental or public works trust fund programs.\n       Because the 4.3-cents-per-gallon transportation motor fuels \n     excise tax (along with other applicable excise taxes on the \n     same motor fuels) is imposed on certain motor fuels before \n     the fuels reach the consumer level, the bill includes rules \n     comparable to present-law ``floor stocks refund'' provisions \n     that allow refunds to producers and dealers for fuel held for \n     sale on the effective date of the tax reduction when the \n     excise tax already has been paid. These refunds must be \n     claimed by persons liable for payment of the tax, based on \n     amounts of tax-paid fuel they own on the tax-reduction date \n     and on documented claims from dealers that purchased tax-paid \n     fuel from them and hold the fuel for sale on the tax-\n     reduction date. These refunds are intended to be allowable \n     either as refund claims filed with the Internal Revenue \n     Service or as credits against required deposits and payments \n     of other excise taxes owed by the claimants.\n       The bill further would impose floor stocks taxes, identical \n     to those imposed in 1993, on taxable fuels held on January 1, \n     1997, when the tax-reduction period expires.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       These provisions of the bill would be effective on the date \n     of enactment for taxable fuels removed, entered, sold or used \n     more than six days after that date and before January 1, \n     1997.\n     2. Sense of the Congress on Benefit to Ultimate Consumers\n       The bill includes a statement that it is the Sense of the \n     Congress that the full benefit of repeal of the 4.3-cents-\n     per-gallon transportation motor fuels excise tax be flowed \n     through to consumers, and that persons receiving floor stocks \n     refunds from the Internal Revenue Service immediately credit \n     their customers' accounts to reflect those refunds.\n     3. Study\n       The bill directs the General Accounting Office to study the \n     impact of repeal of the 4.3-cents-per-gallon transportation \n     motor fuels excise tax and to report its findings to the \n     Congress no later than January 31, 1997.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself and Mr. Dole):\n  S. 1740. A bill to define and protect the institution of marriage; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \ncalled the Defense of Marriage Act. It is a simple measure, limited in \nscope and based on common sense. It does just two things.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act defines the words ``marriage'' and \n``spouse'' for purposes of Federal law and allows each State to decide \nfor itself with respect to same-sex marriages.\n  Most Americans will have a hard time understanding how our country \nhas come to the point where such simple and traditional terms as \n``marriage'' and ``spouse'' need to be defined\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nin Federal law. But under challenge from courts, lawsuits and an \nerosion of values, we find ourselves at the point today that this \nlegislation is needed.\n  This bill says that marriage is the legal union between one man and \none woman as husband and wife, and spouse is a husband or wife of the \nopposite sex. There is nothing earth-shattering there. No breaking of \nnew ground. No setting of new precedents. No revocation of rights.\n  Indeed, these provisions simply reaffirm what is already known, what \nis already in place, and what is already in practice from a policy \nperspective. This legislation seems quite unexciting yet it may still \ndraw criticism. I do hope everyone will read and understand the scope \nof the legislation before drawing any conclusions.\n  The definitions are based on common understandings rooted in our \nNation's history, our statutes and our case law. They merely reaffirm \nwhat Americans have meant for 200 years when using the words \n``marriage'' and ``spouse.'' The current United States Code does not \ncontain a definition of marriage, presumably because most Americans \nknow what it means and never imagined challenges such as those we are \nfacing today.\n  This bill does not change State law, but allows each State to decide \nfor itself with respect to same-sex marriage. It does this by \nexercising Congress's powers under the Constitution to legislate with \nrespect to the full faith and credit clause. It provides that no State \nshall be required to give effect to any public act of any other State \nrespecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is \ntreated as a marriage under the laws of such other State.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act is necessary for several reasons.\n  In May 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court rendered a preliminary ruling \nin favor of three same-sex couples applying for marriage licenses. The \ncourt said the marriage law was discriminatory and violated their \nrights under the equal-rights clause of the State constitution.\n  Many States are concerned that another State's recognition of same-\nsex marriages will compromise their own law prohibiting such marriages. \nAccording to a March 11, 1996, Washington Times article, ``legislators \nin 24 States have introduced bills to deny recognition of same-sex \nmarriage. Two States--Utah and South Dakota--have already approved such \nlaws, and 17 other states are now grappling with the issue--including \nHawaii, where legislative leaders are fighting to block their own \nsupreme court from sanctioning such marriages.'' Several other States \nhave passed such laws since this article was written. This bill would \naddress this issue head on and allow States to make the final \ndetermination concerning same-sex marriages without other States' law \ninterfering.\n  Another reason this bill is needed now, concerns Federal benefits. \nThe Federal Government extends benefits, rights, and privileges to \npersons who are married, and generally accepts a State's definition of \nmarriage. This bill will help the Federal Government defend its own \ntraditional and common-sense definitions of ``marriage'' and \n``spouse.'' If, for example, Hawaii gives new meaning to the words \n``marriage'' and ``spouse,'' the reverberations may be felt throughout \nthe Federal Code unless this bill is enacted.\n  Another example of why we need a Federal definition of the terms \n``marriage'' and ``spouse'' stems from experience during debate on the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Shortly before passage of this \nact, I attached an amendment that defined ``spouse'' as ``a husband or \nwife, as the case may be.'' When the Secretary of Labor published his \nproposed regulations, a considerable number of comments were received \nurging that the definition of ``spouse'' be ``broadened to include \ndomestic partners in committed relationships, including same-sex \nrelationships.'' When the Secretary issued the final rules he stated \nthat the definition of ``spouse'' and the legislative history precluded \nsuch a broadening of the definition. This amendment, which was \nunanimously adopted, spared a great deal of costly and unnecessary \nlitigation over the definition of spouse.\n  These are just a few reasons for why we need to enact the Defense of \nMarriage Act. Enactment of this bill will allow States to give full and \nfair consideration of how they wish to address the issue of same-sex \nmarriages instead of rushing to legislate because of fear that another \nState's laws may be imposed upon them. It also will eliminate legal \nuncertainty concerning Federal benefits, and make it clear what is \nmeant when the words ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' are used in the \nFederal Code.\n  This effort hardly seems to be news as it reaffirms current practice \nand policy, but surely somehow, somewhere given today's climate, it \nwill be. I believe the fact that it will be news--that some may even \nconsider this legislation controversial--should make the average \nAmerican stop and take stock of where we are as a country and where we \nwant to go. Apathy and indifference among the American people is one of \nthe great threats to our Nation's future.\n  This legislation is important. It is about the defense of marriage as \nan institution and as the backbone of the American family. I urge my \ncolleagues and fellow Americans to join me in support of the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following two factsheets be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Defense of Marriage Act\n\n       The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is short, and it does \n     just two things:\n       It provides that no State shall be required to give effect \n     to a law of any other State with respect to a same-sex \n     ``marriage''.\n       It defines the words ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' for \n     purposes of Federal law.\n       Section 1 of the bill gives its title, the ``Defense of \n     Marriage Act''.\n       Section 2 allows each State (or other political \n     jurisdiction) to decide for itself with respect to same-sex \n     ``marriage''. Section 2 of the bill will add a new section to \n     Title 28, United States Code, as follows:\n       ``Sec. 1738C. Certain acts, records, and proceedings and \n     the effect thereof\n       ``No State, territory, or possession of the United States, \n     or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any \n     public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other \n     State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a \n     relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated \n     as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, \n     possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such \n     relationship.''\n       This section of the bill is an exercise of Congress' powers \n     under the ``Effect'' clause of Article IV, section 1 of the \n     Constitution, which reads, ``Full Faith and Credit shall be \n     given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial \n     Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may be \n     general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records \n     and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.'' \n     [Emphasis added.]\n       Precedents. Congress has legislated before with respect to \n     full faith and credit. The general provisions, 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1738 & 1739, go back to the earliest days of the \n     Republic. Act of May 26, 1790, 1 Statutes at Large, chap. XI. \n     More recently, Congress has reinvigorated its powers under \n     Article IV of the Constitution by enacting--\n       The Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, Public Law \n     96-611, 94 Stat. 3569, codified at 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738A (each \n     State required to enforce child custody determinations made \n     by home State if made consistently with the provisions of the \n     Act);\n       The Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act [of \n     1994], Pub. L. 103-383, 108 Stat. 4064, codified at 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1738B (each State required to enforce child support \n     orders made by the child's State if made consistently with \n     the provisions of the Act); and\n       The Safe Homes for Women Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, \n     title IV, Sec. 40221(a), 108 Stat. 1930, codified at 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2265 (full faith and credit to be given to \n     protective orders issued against a spouse or intimate partner \n     with respect to domestic violence).\n       Section 3 contains definitions. It will amend Chapter 1 of \n     Title 1 of the United States Code by adding the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec. 7. Definition of `marriage' and `spouse'\n       ``In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of \n     any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various \n     administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the \n     word `marriage' means only a legal union between one man and \n     one woman as husband and wife, and the word `spouse' refers \n     only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a \n     wife.''\n       Section 3 merely restates the current understanding. The \n     text reaffirms what Congress and the executive agencies have \n     meant for 200 years when using the words ``marriage'' and \n     ``spouse''--a marriage is the legal union of a man and a \n     woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a husband or wife \n     of the opposite sex.\n       Most of section 3 borrows directly from the current United \n     States Code. The introductory phrases are taken from sections \n     1 and 6 of Title 1, and the definition of spouse is taken \n     from paragraph 31 of section 101, Title 31. The current Code \n     does not contain a definition of marriage, presumably because \n     Americans have known what it means.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n     Therefore, the definition of marriage in DOMA is derived most \n     immediately from a Washington State case, Singer v. Hara, 522 \n     P.2d 1187, 1191-92 (Wash. App. 1974), and this definition has \n     now found its way into Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). \n     There are many similar definitions, both in the dictionaries \n     and in the cases. For example, more than a century ago the \n     U.S. Supreme Court spoke of the ``union for life of one man \n     and one woman in the holy estate of matrimony.'' Murphy v. \n     Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 45 (1885).\n       Note that ``marriage'' is defined, but the word ``spouse'' \n     is not defined but refers to. This distinction is used \n     because the word ``spouse'' is defined at several places in \n     the Code to include substantive meaning (e.g., Title II of \n     the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 416 (a), (b), & \n     (f), contains a definition of ``spouse'' that runs to dozens \n     of lines), and DOMA is not meant to affect such substantive \n     definitions. DOMA is meant to ensure that whatever \n     substantive definition of ``spouse'' may be used in Federal \n     law, the word refers only to a person of the opposite sex.\n       [Prepared by the Office of Senator Don Nickles]\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              The Defense of Marriage Act Is Necessary Now\n\n       The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is a modest proposal. In \n     large measure, it merely restates current law. Some may ask, \n     therefore, if it is necessary. The correct answer is . . . \n     it's essential, and it's essential now. A couple of examples \n     will illustrate why:\n       Same-Sex ``Marriages'' in Hawaii. Prompted by a decision of \n     its State Supreme Court, Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, \n     reconsideration granted in part, 875 P.2d 225 (Haw. 1993), \n     the people of Hawaii are in the process of deciding if their \n     State is going to sanction the legal union of persons of the \n     same sex. After Hawaii's high court acted, the legislature \n     amended Hawaii's law to make it unmistakably clear that \n     marriage is available only between a man and a woman, Act of \n     June 22, 1994 (Act 217, Sec. 3), amending Hawaii Revised \n     Statutes Sec. 572-1, but the issue still thrives in the \n     courts, and a lower court may hand down a decision later this \n     year.\n       If Hawaii sanctions same-sex ``marriage'', the implications \n     will be felt far beyond Hawaii. Because Article IV of the \n     U.S. Constitution requires every State to give ``full faith \n     and credit'' to the ``public Acts, Records, and judicial \n     Proceedings'' of each State, the other 49 States will be \n     faced with recognizing Hawaii's same-sex ``marriages'' even \n     though no State now sanctions such relationships. The Federal \n     Government will have similar concerns because it extends \n     benefits and privileges to persons who are married, and \n     generally it uses a State's definition of marriage.\n       DOMA. The Defense of Marriage Act does not affect the \n     Hawaii situation. It does not tell Hawaii what it must do, \n     and it does not tell the other 49 States what they must do. \n     If Hawaii or another State decides to sanction same-sex \n     ``marriage'', DOMA will not stand in the way.\n       The Defense of Marriage Act does two things: First, it \n     allows each State to decide for itself what legal effect it \n     will give to another State's same-sex ``marriages''. This \n     initiative is based on Congress' power under Article IV, \n     section 1 of the Constitution to say what ``effect'' one \n     State's acts, records, and judicial proceedings shall have in \n     another State. Second, DOMA defines the words ``marriage'' \n     and ``spouse'' for purposes of Federal law. Since the word \n     ``marriage'' appears in more than 800 sections of Federal \n     statutes and regulations, and since the word ``spouse'' \n     appears more than 3,100 times, a redefinition of ``marriage'' \n     or ``spouse'' could have enormous implication for Federal \n     law.\n       The following examples illustrating DOMA's importance are \n     from Federal law, but similar situations can be found in \n     every State.\n       Veterans' Benefits. In the 1970s, Richard Baker, a male, \n     demanded increased veterans' educational benefits because he \n     claimed James McConnell, another male, as his dependent \n     spouse. When the Veterans Administration turned him down, he \n     sued, and the outcome turned on a Federal statute (38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 103(c)) that made eligibility for the \n     benefits contingent on his State's definition of \n     ``spouse'' and ``marriage''. The Federal courts rejected \n     the claim for added benefits, McConnell v.  Nooner, 547 \n     F.2d 54 (8th Cir. 1976), because the Minnesota supreme \n     court had already determined that marriage (which it \n     defined as ``the state of union between persons of the \n     opposite sex'') was not available to persons of the same \n     sex. Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971), \n     dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, 409 \n     U.S. 810 (1972).\n       If Hawaii changes its law, a Baker v. Nelson-type case \n     based on Hawaiian law will create genuine risks to the \n     Federal Government's consistent policy. The Defense of \n     Marriage Act anticipates future demands such as that made in \n     the veterans' benefits case, and it reasserts that the words \n     ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' will continue to mean what they \n     have traditionally meant.\n       Family and Medical Leave Act. The Family and Medical Leave \n     Act of 1993 (FMLA), Pub. L. 103-3, 107 Stat. 6, requires that \n     employees be given unpaid leave to care for a ``spouse'' who \n     is ill.\n       Shortly before passage of the Act in the Senate, Senator \n     Nickles attached an amendment defining ``spouse'' as ``a \n     husband or wife, as the case may be.'' That amendment proved \n     essential when the regulations were written.\n       When the Secretary of Labor published his proposed \n     regulations, he noted that a ``considerable number of \n     comments'' were received urging that the definition of \n     ``spouse'' ``be broadened to include domestic partners in \n     committed relationships, including same-sex relationships.'' \n     However, the Nickles amendment precluded him from adopting an \n     expansive definition of ``spouse''. The Secretary then quoted \n     the Senator's remarks on the floor:\n       ``. . . This is the same definition [of `spouse'] that \n     appears in Title 10 of the United States Code (10 U.S.C. \n     101). Under this amendment, an employer would be required to \n     give an eligible female employee unpaid leave to care for her \n     husband and an eligible male employee unpaid leave to care \n     for his wife. No employer would be required to grant an \n     eligible employee unpaid leave to care for an unmarried \n     domestic partner. This simple definition will spare us a \n     great deal of costly and unnecessary litigation. Without this \n     amendment, the bill would invite lawsuits by workers who \n     unsuccessfully seek leave on the basis of the illness of \n     their unmarried adult companions.''\n       ``Accordingly,'' continued the Secretary, ``given this \n     legislative history, the recommendations that the definition \n     of `spouse' be broadened cannot be adopted.'' 60 Federal \n     Register 2180, 2191-92 (Jan. 6, 1995) (emphasis added).\n       The Family and Medical Leave Act is an excellent example of \n     how a little anticipation in the Legislative Branch can \n     prevent a far-reaching, even revolutionary, change in \n     American law.\n       [Prepared by the Office of Senator Don Nickles]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR EXPENSES OF \n                   ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.\n\n       Section 660 of the Department of Energy Organization Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 7270) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' Before \n     ``Appropriations''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Fiscal Years 1997 Through 2002.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated for salaries and expenses of the \n     Department of Energy for departmental administration and \n     other activities in carrying out the purposes of this Act--\n       ``(1) $104,000,000 for fiscal year 1997;\n       ``(2) $104,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;\n       ``(3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 1999;\n       ``(4) $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       ``(5) $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2001; and\n       ``(6) $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.''.\n\n                   TITLE  --TEAMWORK AND MINIMUM WAGE\n\n     SEC.  01. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of American employers to make \n     dramatic changes in workplace and employer-employee \n     relationships;\n       (2) these changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``employee \n     involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) employee involvement structures, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and non-unionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers of the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of American businesses, employee involvement \n     structures have had a positive impact on the lives of those \n     employees, better enabling them to reach their potential in \n     their working lives;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized employee involvement techniques, Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful employee involvement \n     structures in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate employee \n     involvement structures have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930s when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) employee involvement is currently threatened by \n     interpretations of the prohibition against employer-dominated \n     ``company unions''.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) protect legitimate employee involvement structures \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) permit legitimate employee involvement structures where \n     workers may discuss issues involving terms and conditions of \n     employment, to continue to evolve and proliferate.\n\n     SEC.   02. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 8(a)(2) OF THE NATIONAL LABOR \n                   RELATIONS ACT.\n\n       Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 158(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following: ``Provided further, That it shall not constitute \n     or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under this \n     paragraph for an employer to establish, assist, maintain or \n     participate in any organization or entity of any kind, in \n     which employees participate to address matters of mutual \n     interest (including issues of quality, productivity and \n     efficiency) and which does not have, claim or seek authority \n     to negotiate or enter into collective bargaining agreements \n     under this Act with the employer or to amend existing \n     collective bargaining agreements between the employer and any \n     labor organization;''.\n\n     SEC.   03. CONSTRUCTION CLAUSE LIMITING EFFECT OF ACT.\n\n       Nothing in the amendment made by section 3 shall be \n     construed as affecting employee rights and responsibilities \n     under the National Labor Relations Act other than those \n     contained in section 8(a)(2) of such Act.\n\n     SEC.   04.

Mr. President, I wish to reflect briefly on \nthe loss of life and tremendous talent our Nation suffered when, only \ndays before Easter Sunday, 33 Americans--leaders in business and \nGovernment--perished in a storm off the coast of Croatia.\n  Each of these individuals was strongly committed to the idea that \neconomic renewal is critical to achieving peace in that desperately \nwar-torn land. Compassion for others in need drew all of them on their \nmission to the Balkans in an effort to help heal that desperate corner \nof the globe.\n  I particularly want to remember U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown. \nCharismatic and energetic, he inevitably devoted himself to the task at \nhand with all his heart and mind. His enthusiasm for public service was \nonly equaled by an amazing ability to attain his goals. He lived the \nAmerican success story by proving that everyone, through hard work and \ndetermination can achieve their heart's desire.\n  Ron Brown's immense personal popularity made his untimely death all \nthe more sorrowful.\n  Born in Washington, DC, but raised in New York's Harlem, Secretary \nBrown attended Middlebury College in Vermont where he was the only \nblack student in his class. After graduation he joined the U.S. Army \nand, serving as an officer, proudly represented his country abroad.\n  Following his military career he worked as a welfare caseworker in \nNew York City while attending law school at night. An individual of \nenormous charm and wit, Ron Brown became the first African-American \nleader of a major political party in the United States. Regarding this \nhistorical achievement he stated, ``I did not run on the basis of race, \nbut I will not run away from it. I am proud of who I am.''\n  President Clinton named Ron Brown to serve as U.S. Secretary of \nCommerce, the first African-American to occupy that post. He performed \nits duties with wisdom, dedication, and conscientious attention to \ndetail. Secretary Brown more than anyone else in Government, gave \nbusiness a seat at the diplomatic table. Because of his friendship with \nand access to the President, the State Department was on constant \nnotice that if our economic efforts overseas were not represented, Ron \nBrown stood ready to serve as their advocate.\n  Representing the United States around the world, he was America's \npremier salesman for what we have to offer--equality, opportunity, and \nabundance.\n  This April, bravely undertaking a mission into what had recently been \na war zone and still was a potentially hostile region, Ron Brown proved \nto the world what those who knew him always took for granted: that he \ncared less for his personal safety than for the good of the people who \nlive there.\n  In his own wonderful way, Ron Brown served as a peacekeeper. Working \nto establish international trade and business in the region, he offered \nits people the opportunity to rebuild a civil society.\n  Yes, the United States lost 33 lives, 33 talented individuals, each \nwith an unlimited potential to achieve.\n  But we as a nation have also gained 33 luminous examples of ultimate \ndedication and compassion. These bright stars of self-sacrifice form an \nAmerican constellation which can, if we let it, guide us forward with \ngenerosity and courage toward a better tomorrow for ourselves and all \nof our neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4874-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4874-S4875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROBERT BELOUS\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding contributions of Robert Belous who, since January 1991, has \nserved as the superintendent of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park \nand Preserve in Louisiana. Bob is retiring from the Park Service after \nmore than 25 years of service and we in Louisiana will miss him very \nmuch.\n  Bob Belous has been an outstanding park superintendent and public \nservant. He has enthusiastically embraced a number of innovative and \ncreative\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nprojects and programs related to the Jean Lafitte National Historical \nPark and Preserve. In addition, he has been very active and helpful in \nthe creation and early beginnings of our newest park units in \nLouisiana, the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park and the Cane \nRiver National Historical Park and Heritage Area.\n  Mr. President, Jean Lafitte is a very unique park unit. It's like a \nwheel with many spokes. Jean Lafitte consists of a French Quarter unit; \nthe Barataria marsh unit, Chalmette, the site of the Battle of New \nOrleans in 1815; and two Cajun cultural centers in Eunice and \nThibodaux, LA, that interpret Cajun history. This type of park is very \ndifficult to administer. It takes a dedicated person of many interests, \nskills, and talents to bring together these diverse elements and \nresources into a coherent whole. Not only has Bob managed to accomplish \nthis difficult task, but he has done it with flair and good humor.\n  Over the years, Bob Belous has always been available to provide \nassistance to me and my staff here in Washington as well as my offices \nin Louisiana, especially my New Orleans office. He has always provided \nus with sound professional advice and counsel. I know I speak for many \npeople in Louisiana and all over the country when I wish Bob well in \nhis retirement from the Park Service and thank him for his many \ncontributions to our National Park System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4874-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SALUTE TO OKLAHOMA GIRL SCOUTS\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I salute 10 outstanding young \nwomen from Oklahoma who have been honored by Red Lands Council of Girl \nScouts in Oklahoma City, OK. Each has received the prestigious Girl \nScouts of the USA Gold Award.\n  They were honored April 25, 1996, for earning the highest achievement \naward in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes \noutstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community \nservice, career planning, and personal development. The Girl Scout \nAward can be earned by girls aged 14-17 or in grades 9-12.\n  Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving more than 2.5 million \ngirls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior \nGirl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the \naward, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: Earn four interest \nproject patches, earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl \nScout Challenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award \nproject. A plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award is created \nby the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation \nbetween the girl and adult Girl Scout volunteer.\n  As members of the Red Lands Council of Girl Scouts, these young women \nbegan working toward the Girl Scout Gold Award in 1995, and all \ncompleted their projects in the areas of leadership and community \nservice.\n  The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment \ndeserving of special public recognition and commendation.\n  I salute the following girls for their accomplishments and for their \nservice to their community and their country:\n  Melanie Brockman of Girl Scout Troop 55. She helped design, organize, \nand  carry out a Special Kids Day. This was a program for the special \neducation students in the community. The children were divided by age \nand abilities to provide them an opportunity to participate in normal \nactivities. This very successful program gave each special education \nstudent a chance to feel good about themselves.\n  Kansas Conrady of Girl Scout Troop 569. She designed an overnight \nlock-in for sixth grade Junior Girl Scouts and Cadette Girl Scouts to \ndiscuss the contemporary issues of substance abuse, facing a family \ncrisis, youth suicide, and teen pregnancy. Professionals were brought \nin to speak and share their knowledge with the girls, and the girls \nthen participated in activities from the Contemporary Issues Program \nfor Girl Scouts in a round robin format.\n  Melanie Foglesong of Girl Scout Troop 17. She undertook the massive \nproject of cleaning and painting the Wichita Lodge at Camp Red Rock. \nShe organized a work crew, collected supplies, and directed the cleanup \nfrom washing walls and windows through the painting of all the interior \nof the lodge.\n  Leslie Hooks. She planned a program to help Junior Girls Scouts \nthrough Senior Girls Scouts know the joys of sailing by learning the \nfundamentals of sailing and culminating in a hands-on sailing event.\n  Andrea Johnson of Girl Scout Troop 569. She created an informative \nvideo of Camp Red Rock and Camp Cookieland for the use of Red Lands \nCouncil of Girl Scouts to introduce the camp properties to prospective \ncampers.\n  Danette Kniffin. She planned a program to teach girls of the \ncommunity the art of canoeing. The program is designed for both \nbeginning and intermediate canoers and included a basic water safety \nprogram.\n  Kimmie Kohl of Girl Scout Troop 55. She designed, organized, and \ncarried out a Special Kids Day. This was a program for the special \neducation students in the community. The children were divided by age \nand abilities to provide them an opportunity to participate in normal \nactivities. This very successful program gave each special education \nstudent a chance to feel good about themselves.\n  Amanda Newman. She organized the first active Youth Red Cross Chapter \nin Blaine County. The goal of the organization is to be trained to help \nmeet the emergencies of their community.\n  Ambra Prestage of Girl Scout Troop 55. She helped design, organize, \nand carry out a Special Kids Day. This was a program for the special \neducation students in the community. The children were divided by age \nand abilities to provide them an opportunity to participate in normal \nactivities. This very successful program gave each special education \nstudent a chance to feel good about themselves.\n  Nicole Robertson of Girl Scout Troop 127. She organized a Girls' Day \nOut to introduce the girls to the joys of being a Girls Scout. She also \nworked with the In-School Program for Red Lands Council Girl Scouts and \nhelped bring the Scouting program to numerous girls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4875-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO MS. DANETTA FAITH FISHER-RAINING BIRD\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nyoung Montanan. Ms. Danetta Faith Fisher-Raining Bird has been awarded \na Rockefeller Brothers Fund Fellowship, as 1 of 25 outstanding minority \nstudents entering the teaching profession.\n  The Rockefeller Brothers Fund is in their fifth year of awarding \nthese fellowships and I am proud that Danetta joins with four other \nnative Americans from Montana who have received this award since the \naward began. With the stiff competition nationwide, it took a very \nstrong commitment to the education of minorities and to improving \nteaching in public schools to be selected. No doubt Danetta met that \nchallenge.\n  This award will allow Danetta to take part in a summer project and to \ngo on to graduate school to pursue further training in education or a \nrelated field. And once she begins teaching, the Rockefeller Brothers \nFund will help with loan repayments. This is exactly the type of \nprivate sector involvement that our education system needs. And it is \nexactly what students like Danetta depend on in order to succeed these \ndays.\n  I congratulate Danetta on this achievement. I know she will put this \naward to good use and I am hopeful that she will not only continue her \nstudies in our great State, but use her valuable training to improve \nthe education for other native Americans. I am proud of her as a \nMontanan and as a representative of our future and I wish her all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4875-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4875-S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          URI DEBATE TEAM DOES WELL IN LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATE\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the University of Rhode Island debate \nteam was honored last week at the Rhode Island State House, where the \nteam members received citations for their recent outstanding \nperformance at the National Forensics Association [NFA] Individual \nEvents Nationals at Western Illinois University.\n  I understand that this competition, which was one of the largest in \nthe history of NFA, drew 2,000 competitors\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nrepresenting 29 States. In the Lincoln-Douglas debate there were 92 \ncompetitors representing 33 different colleges and universities.\n  Rebecca Makris, Derek Young, Jonathan Cross, and Tara McErien \nrepresented the University of Rhode Island. During the six preliminary \nrounds the team defeated teams from Northeastern University, Simmons \nCollege, Oakland University, Colorado State University, Cornell \nUniversity, Ohio University, Morgan State, and Central Michigan \nUniversity.\n  Overall the winning record of the team placed them at 10th in the \nNation and Rebecca Makris compiled an outstanding record, earning her a \nplace as the 4th best debater in the competition.\n  Kristen Maar, director of the debate, states: ``This is quite an \naccomplishment for the team and the University. The debaters that \nqualified for this national tournament were the best in the country, \nand to have Rebecca place fourth overall is a true achievement.''\n  Coincidentally, the debate topic this year and the debate topic next \nyear reflect some of my own interests in the Senate--the topics \n``United Nations'' and ``Education Reform.''\n  This year's topic was ``Resolved: That participation in one or more \nof the six principal bodies of the United Nations should be \nsignificantly restricted by altering the U.N. charter and/or rules of \nprocedure.''\n  The debate season will begin again in September, with the resolution \ndealing with education reform. The exact wording of the resolution will \nbe released on August 1, 1996.\n  I want to commend the URI team for its excellent job and all the \nparticipants this year for their focus on the United Nations and key \nissues affecting our global future. I look forward to learning more \nabout next year's debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4875-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while our leaders are deciding the outcome \nof the evening and, more important, the outcome of a most important \nvote on the repeal of the gas tax, I guess I am surprised that the \nminority would not allow us to go forward to consider H.R. 2137.\n  We talk about the lack of security within the American family today, \nbe it income security or job security. I know one thing that the \nAmerican family is extremely concerned about, and that is the security \nand well-being of their own children. The House overwhelmingly has just \nvoted on a law that will deal with the issue of sexual predators, \nMegan's law. I am amazed that we could not move swiftly, as the House \nhas moved, to deal with this issue. I hope that we can deal with it.\n  I hope that the minority will not block us from dealing with it in \nthe future. Clearly, it is something that has to be dealt with. The \nAmerican people need to know that when these kinds of problems arise, \nand there are glitches within the legal system that allow young people \nlike Megan to be destroyed, their lives to be taken by people who \nclearly never should have been let out of incarceration, that this \nCongress will deal with it.\n  Mr. President, on Monday of this week, I was reading in USA Today an \narticle by Tony Snowe, where he was talking about the concern and \nuneasiness of the American family, whether it is the issue of sexual \npredators, or the loss of a job, or working a multiple of jobs to get \nahead, or whether it is the fact that in his article the American \nfamily was experiencing income stagnation.\n  I thought it was interesting when he pointed out that prior to \nPresident Clinton being elected, the average family was looking at \nabout 31.3 percent of the gross national product of this country being \ntaken away in taxes. Now, that is up 1\\1/2\\ to 2 percent in this \nadministration. And one of the greatest bites out of that, which \ndragged down the ability of the family to use their income or to use \ntheir salary increases, was the gas tax increase.\n  In my State of Idaho, with 1.3 million people, it is a big bite. This \ngas tax hike that, for the first time in our Nation's history, goes to \nwelfare programs instead of roads, bridges and transportation systems, \ncosts $32.1 million. And, boy, anybody who serves large rural States \nlike mine knows that it strikes right at the heart of the productive \nsector of my State, whether it is the farmer, rancher, or the people \nwho commute long distances, as nearly everybody in my State does, to \nthe supermarket, to the business center, to visit, and to work. Those \nwho are the working people of our society are the ones that are now \npaying even more.\n  I am amazed that our administration keeps talking about sticking it \nto the rich, soaking it to the rich. I am amazed they do not say, ``And \nwe soaked it to the worker, to the wage earner because we are sucking \naway from them at the gas pump an ever increasing amount of their \nincome.''\n  I also find it uniquely ironic that while taxes have ticked up \naggressively in this administration from 30 percent of GDP to 31.3, \nthat candidate Clinton in 1992 said he opposed increasing a gas tax, \nthat he opposed increasing those kinds of taxes, he said they were \nregressive and unfair to working families, I am amazed that he somehow \nthrough what he may think is slight of hand or subterfuge created an \nomnibus tax bill and then, of course, says the way you pay them back is \nto force everybody to pay higher wages.\n  In my State of Idaho, that does not work because most of the people \ndid not get higher wages, and a minimum wage increase would affect few \nof these kinds of people who are our farmers and ranchers and small \nbusiness people and commuters who travel hundreds of miles daily, not \n20 or 30, not down the street in the commuter bus, not on the \nMetrorail, but 50 miles one way to work and 50 miles home at night. And \nwhen it starts costing $20 or more, or $25 to fill the gas tank a \ncouple of times a week, that is one very large bite out of the \npocketbook of the American family.\n  I am amazed that this administration would even begin to drag its \nfeet on that kind of reality. And while this Congress should be holding \noversight hearings on the ramp up in gas prices, we ought to be \nresponding immediately in the areas that we can respond in, and that is \nin the area of bringing this tax down and doing it in a way that makes \nsense.\n  I respect highly the move that our majority leader has made. That is \nthe kind of responsiveness and leadership that we ought to be hearing \nfrom this Congress, and now we are locked up again, blocked, if you \nwill, by the minority because they want it their way when the American \npeople are saying: Wait a moment. Your way was to increase our taxes. \nYour way was not to give us economic opportunity. Your way was to \ncreate through the 1993 tax act and the budget an economy that did not \nproduce like it should, that could have produced billions of dollars \nmore, that lost 1.2 million jobs it otherwise would have created if the \ntax act pushed by, endorsed by, recommended by President Clinton had \nnot gone through.\n  Now, that is from 1993 to 1996 that I use that figure. Those are real \nfigures just being brought out by the Heritage Foundation. Absent the \ntax increase in 1993, this economy would have created 1.2 million more \njobs. Last month, we did not create a job. Something is wrong in an \neconomy, a growth economy like ours when our President says that the \neconomy is good and we create no jobs, zero jobs.\n\n  I am sorry; I do not figure it the way you figure it, Mr. President. \nI look at these kinds of figures and while they may be statistics, in \nmy State of Idaho they are real jobs; they are food on the family \ntable; they are a little more gas in the gas tank; they are a few more \ndollars in savings; it is the new house purchased or the clothes bought \nfor the kids. That is what job creation and economic vitality is all \nabout.\n  When I mentioned 1.2 million jobs lost, not created by the tax \nincrease, when we carry that through next year, that will be an \nestimated 1.4 million jobs. That is 40,400 new business starts that did \nnot start, that did not happen. Those are real figures in this country. \nWhy? Because the risk of taking that opportunity just was not there, \nthe money was not available because it was drained into the public \nsector to go out in ways that some of us would question\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nwhether it was productive or not. That is a loss of $138 billion in \npersonal savings or maybe 1.3 million new cars and light truck sales. \nIf you sell the cars, you have to produce the cars.\n  That is what the economy now tells us could have happened had we had \nnot taxed it at the rate that Bill Clinton and the Democrats taxed it \nin the 1993 tax act. That is $42.5 billion in durable goods orders that \nwere not ordered. The list goes on and on.\n  We have always known that the way you get out of the financial \ntroubles our Government is in is to expand the economic pie, create new \njobs and from that take a reasonable tax to pay for the largesse of \nGovernment while at the same time trying to reduce the growth rate, \ntrying to control it. You do not continue to tax or you get the kind of \nuneasiness that I think is now being experienced by the American people \nwhen they say: Well, yes, I still have my job but the reality is I did \nnot get a pay increase. More importantly, I still have my job but I am \npaying higher taxes with no pay increase. So what I have is less buying \npower, less ability to provide for my children, and in this instance \nfor working women in our society they took the greater hit once again \nin a slow, flat economy of the kind that was produced by this tax \nincrease.\n  So let us move on. Let us repeal the gas tax. Let us return billions \nof dollars to the American consumers, to the American entrepreneur, to \nthe American small business person, to the job creators and to the \nworkers of our society. That is where productivity comes from. That is \nwhat will grow us out of our problems.\n\n  I urge this Senate, most importantly I urge my colleagues on the \nother side to work with us to solve this problem, not to block us, not \nto force us into stagnation and not to say to the American people once \nagain we hear you but we just do not feel your pain.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will not take but just a moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4876-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, earlier, we were required and asked to \nobject to a bill being brought up without being notified, and that was \nMegan's law. We did not know anything about it until it was offered, at \nleast I did not. We did not have an opportunity. What we do around here \nis hotline to see if any Senators have any objection or if they have \nany amendments. And so we knew that there were amendments and we would \nlike to improve the bill. And so therefore we were required to object.\n  I do not think there was any motive there to stop the law. It will \npass. We just had some Senators I think who wanted an opportunity to \namend. And so I think that is where we are on the debate here. We talk \nabout the tax, 4.3 cents. You would think it was going to save the \nworld. But the minute we take it off and we do not assure that the \nconsumer will receive it, the oil companies increase it a nickel.\n  I bought gasoline last night, 2 cents higher today. We did not take \nthe tax off and have not changed anything. We put the tax on 3 years \nago, gasoline went down. They were telling us put on more tax; maybe it \nwill be cheaper. Mr. President, 3.8 million barrels of gasoline is what \nis being used today, about 8.4 is the maximum amount of gasoline that \ncan be produced in this country today. That is running it at full \nspeed. And we have not had a new refinery in over 20 years.\n  So what you are going to find, taking the speed limit off, taking the \nspeed limit off has helped. Four of every 10 vehicles purchased get \nonly 14 miles to the gallon. And so regardless of what we do here, we \nlose.\n  Now, if we do not want to reduce the deficit, you have to offset it \nfrom something else. How are you going to offset it? They threw out \nslurringly on Sunday they were going to take it out of education--you \nknow, I hate Government anyhow. That was the statement. Well, they had \nto retract that the next day. And how are you going to offset it?\n  So what we would like to do, or what I would like to do is to find \nout how you could assure that the consumer gets 4.3 cents because you \nare going to cut it someplace else. Once you reduce the 4.3 cents and \nnot assure the consumer receive the 4.3, you are going to reduce the \nbudget some place else because you have to have an offset.\n  So the consumer probably, with the approach here, is going to lose \ntwice. One, they will not see the 4.3 cents, and you are going to cut \nthe budget someplace else. So they get hit twice.\n  So I think we ought to be sure that when we reduce the gasoline tax--\nand I think we are going to be able to vote for that--but let us be \nsure that the consumer receives it and that the big oil companies do \nnot have a windfall, because the 4.3 cents now is reducing the deficit. \nIt has had 4 consecutive years in reduction of the deficit. We have \nabout 8.5 million new jobs in a little over 3 years. Oh, I can hear the \ncrocodile tears that, ``We could do better if you would listen to us.'' \nI remember the 1990 tax.\n  If we are not reducing the deficit, how in the world are you going to \nget to a balanced budget? If the deficit went down, it was back when \nPresident Clinton took office--$300 billion. If it was still there, and \nsuppose President Clinton had not won and it was still there, under \npast procedures, under past administrations, it would go up $300 \nbillion a year. That was not under ours. You say, ``Well, that is a \nDemocratic Congress, and for 6 years you had it right here--control.'' \nI tell you, the President had the same kind of wet pen that this \nPresident has, the same kind of wet pen on the same desk in the same \nroom. All they have to do is speak to him to get 34. That is all he \nneeds. But how many vetoes did we get?--caved in. He said it was not \ngoing to increase taxes, and did. All he had to do is put the pen to \nit. You fussed at the President for vetoing. Look at the mess we were \nin when you would not veto. So you can brag and plead and fuss.\n  I would like, if we could, to try to find some way to get this Senate \nback in order, to get it back on track, to try to do something that \nwill help people and get a balanced budget up. We argue over these \nthings that are sound bites. It is $389 a page to have your speech put \nin the Record, and we will have 10 some mornings, and they will all say \nthe same thing and cost the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars; \n$389 a page. That is when it is electronically. Otherwise, it is over \n$400. Every time you make a speech here--and I do not make very many--\nevery time you talk, the page in that Record is $389. So I just want \nyou to know that every time we hear 10 speeches, it costs tens of \nthousands of dollars. It has been hundreds and hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in speeches anti the President, and his popularity is better \ntoday than it has been any time. So keep knocking. I think you ought to \nkeep knocking--sour grapes, you know.\n  I think one thing that we ought to do to get it on the right track is \nthat they ought to run the race for the Presidency out in the field and \nnot every little item that comes up here saying to the Democrats, you \ncannot vote, you cannot offer an amendment, you cannot vote on one of \nyour amendments.\n  So we are going to have to start getting this place in a position \nwhere it is respected.\n  Are we limited to 5? I did not know that. I apologize to the Chair. I \ndid not know we were limited to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, there is an agreement on \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. If I reached the 5 minutes, I did not want to charge the \ntaxpayers any more than $389.

Mr. President, I want to touch on a few issues quickly, \nsome which the Senator from Kentucky referred to and some that we are \ntalking about generally.\n  First, on the deficit being close to $300 billion in 1992; it is half \nthat now.\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\n When I campaigned in 1992 for election, I said that the deficit will \ncome down regardless of what happens, and every politician in \nWashington will take credit for it coming down. One of the major \nreasons it will come down, having nothing whatever to do with any \npolitician in Washington, is that we will finish paying for the savings \nand loan bailout. That is moving through the system like a pig in a \npython, and once it finally is digested and taken care of, you will go \nback down to the same level of deficit you had before we had the \nbailout of the savings and loan. A lot of us will look at each other \nand say, ``Aren't we heroes? Look. It has come down.'' When in fact all \nthat really happened is that we are paying off a one-time obligation, \nand that was completed.\n  The other reason it comes down is because the cold war is over and we \nhave had substantial downsizing in the Defense Department. The \nPresident talks about 270,000-and-some civilian employees no longer on \nthe payroll. Yes, and over 200,000 of those are in the Defense \nDepartment having to do with base closures and other downsizing \nactivities in the Defense Department.\n\n  The structural deficit is as persistent and pernicious as it ever \nwas, and the size of the civilian work force unrelated to the cold war \nis as big and as obtrusive as it ever was, and we are kidding ourselves \nwith these short-term numbers to think that something serious and long \nterm is taking place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4877-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to talk about the two issues that \nare on the floor; first the minimum wage, and then the TEAM Act. I am \nwilling to vote on the minimum wage at any time. I intend to vote \nagainst an increase in the minimum wage, and I do so for the following \nreasons.\n  If we increase the minimum wage, we eliminate jobs, and we eliminate \njobs primarily among middle-class white suburban teenagers. You may \nsay, ``Well, that is fine. We do not owe these middle-class white \nsuburban teenagers anything. So let us eliminate their jobs.'' I was a \nwhite suburban teenager in a middle-class family, and I started work at \n14 when the minimum wage was 40 cents an hour. That dates me, I \nrecognize, around here. I got a nice raise when the minimum wage went \nto 75 cents an hour. I did not need the money. The money was not the \nissue. The issue was that I learned that I had to be at work on time. I \nlearned that I had to put in a good time at work. Looking back on it, \nthe work I did, frankly, was not significant to the corporation. They \ncould have done without it. But as long as they were paying me that low \nwage, it did not hurt them that much to have me around, and I liked to \nthink I at least made things a little more comfortable if not more \nprofitable.\n  It was the most significant learning experience of my young life. It \nwas more significant than many, if not most, of the classes I took in \nhigh school. It was more significant in setting the pattern of my life \nand work habits in my life than the extracurricular clubs that I went \nto and the other things I was involved in. It was a tremendously \nworthwhile experience, as I am sure it is for the other middle-class \nteenagers who are experiencing their first work opportunity, a work \nopportunity that will be outlawed if we raise the minimum wage to the \npoint where the employer says, ``Well, I cannot afford it anymore, and \nI will cut it off.''\n  Virtually every employer who has contacted me on this issue has said, \n``If the minimum wage goes up, I will eliminate jobs.'' I say to those \nwho get so excited about how low the money is, why is it more moral for \na person to be unemployed at $5.25 an hour than it is for that person \nto be working at $4.25 an hour? Somehow, I do not see the social \nbenefit in having somebody unemployed at a high rate whereas they could \nbe working at a lower rate in an entry-level job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4878-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TEAM ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Finally, on the TEAM Act, as it is called, I want to \nmake these observations.\n  Going back to a headline that appeared in a local U.S. paper--I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to continue for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The headline coming from another circumstance but \ndriving to the heart of this issue said this: ``Why are the liberals \nafraid of democracy?''\n  This had to do with another circumstance where liberals were \ncomplaining about people voting on an issue and saying that the \nGovernment should dictate it. Why, said the speaker at this particular \nsymposium, himself a liberal, ``are the liberals afraid of democracy? \nAre they afraid they would lose? Why are the unions afraid of the TEAM \nAct? Are they afraid that workers, speaking for themselves, exercising \ndemocratic rights, will in fact end up in a circumstance that might be \ngood for those workers? Do they not trust the workers?''\n  Here are the kinds of things that are illegal now, without the \npassage of the TEAM Act, in terms of discussions between workers and \nbusinesses. They cannot discuss an extension of employees' lunch breaks \nby 15 minutes. That is illegal. They have to have the union discuss \nthat in their behalf. They cannot discuss the issue of decreasing rest \nbreaks from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. You would think they could get \ntogether, exercise their democratic rights, rights of free speech, to \ntalk about that? Oh, no. Under the present law that is illegal. The \nunion has to be the one to do that.\n  How about sitting down with management and the workers to discuss \ntornado warning procedures? Oh, no, we cannot trust the workers to have \nthat kind of discussion. They may give away the store. We have to have \nthe union there to protect their rights. The union must decide, not the \nworkers who are directly involved.\n  How about rules about fighting? Oh, no, we cannot have that \ndiscussion with the workers. We have to have that discussion with the \nunion.\n  Sharpness of the edges of safety knives? No, we cannot have the \npeople who actually handle the safety knives discuss that with \nmanagement. We have to have the union there. The list goes on and on.\n  I am willing to vote on minimum wage. I am willing to vote on TEAM \nAct. I am willing to vote on the gas increase. I am not willing to have \nsome people in this body say to us, ``You can vote on the ones that we \nthink are important, but we will not let you vote on the ones that you \nthink are important.''\n  I say, in closing, to those who are so concerned about the minimum \nwage, why, if it is such a vital social benefit for so many people, was \nit never mentioned by the then-majority party for the 2 years that they \nheld both the Presidency and the Congress? Never once did it come up \nwhen they had the opportunity to control the agenda, control the veto, \nand control the passage through here. They did not even mention it, let \nalone raise it. Now, all of a sudden, it is an amendment that must be \noffered to every single bill.\n\n  I think the coincidence is that $35 million has been pledged in \nsupport of the President's campaign by the labor unions, and the \ndecision has been, suddenly, well, it is important. So now we will \nbring it up, even though we never did when we were in charge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4878-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4878-S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE THREE PROPOSALS BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, to lay a framework here, we have three \nproposals that are before the Senate offered by the majority leader, \nSenator Dole of Kansas. We have an opportunity to repeal a 4\\1/2\\-cent \ngas tax that was imposed by President Clinton in August 1993. This is \nthe gas tax that the President, while campaigning, said should not be \nimposed because it is especially harsh on the poor families in our \ncountry. But when he became President, he changed his mind and imposed \na 4.3-cent gas tax that, as I said, is very, very difficult for the \npoorer sectors of our society to deal with, the rural sectors, rural \ncommunities that have to utilize gas extensively in their travels and \nin their work. This has added a deficit in a family checking account \nbetween $100 and $200 per family.\n  It is interesting we are discussing that on this day, because May 8 \nis the first day that wage earners get to keep\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\ntheir checks for their own housing, their own food, their own \ntransportation. From January 1 to yesterday, every check that was \nearned by every worker in America went to the Government. It is hard to \nbelieve we are at a point in time in our country where you work from \nJanuary 1 to May 7 and you have to wait until May 8 to keep the first \ncheck that you earned. So repealing this gas tax is just the beginning \nof a series of steps that ought to occur to lighten that load and push \nthose days back.\n  If you ask Americans what date they think is the appropriate one, \nthey say March 1. Now it is May 7, and you have to wait until May 8 \nuntil you can begin to keep what you worked for, for your own family.\n  So we are talking about repealing this gas tax. We are talking about \nthe minimum wage, which the Senator from Massachusetts has argued now \nfor several weeks ought to be passed. I disagree with him, but there \nwould be a vote on the minimum wage in this proposal the majority \nleader has put before the Senate.\n  I agree with the Senator from Utah that the minimum wage will hurt \nthose that they argue it will help. Entry-level, beginning employees, \nminority employees will find it harder to get a job. That debate has \nbeen aired now for several weeks, and there will be a vote on that \nproposal.\n\n  Then there will be a vote on legislation that makes it possible--it \nis called the TEAM Act. But basically it is a proposal that allows \nemployers and employees to meet together and discuss the modern \nworkplace. Today, representative employees from a company in \nLawrenceville, GA, visited our office and said their working groups had \nsaved $6 million. A team that consisted of nine employees, people from \nthe assembly line to plant managers, chosen by coworkers, met for 6 \nmonths, and they saved that company $6 million. They are up here saying \nwe want that flexibility in labor law.\n  A small business from Macon, GA--they employ 30 people in Macon--they \nhave created a committee called TRAQ, total responsibility in quality, \nmade up of employee-selected representatives. Top management does not \nparticipate but makes recommendations. These employees from this \ncompany in Georgia have written endorsing this new concept. The concept \nhas been endorsed by the Savannah Morning News, the TEAM Act concept, \nthe ability of people to come together.\n  Mr. President, do I need to ask unanimous consent for another 2 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is about to expire.\n  Mr. FORD. If I do not object, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I sure will.\n  Mr. FORD. You will?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. So I will not object.\n  Why do we need to change the law when these people you are talking \nabout now are on a team?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Because we are a right-to-work State, and they can \nfunction under the law here. There are many shops where that is not the \ncase.\n  Mr. FORD. But 96 percent of all businesses now, I understand, have \nthe team concept, but what they do is try to improve the assembly line, \nto try to improve, so that the nuts and bolts ought to be here on the \nright instead of on the left. The Ranger truck in Louisville that was \nnot doing so well, management and the employees got together and they \nwere able to learn to put the truck upside-down and be able to lean on \nthe machine that tightens the bolts and turn the truck back up and were \nable to do these things. That is fine. But now are you saying that \nthese teams will be able to negotiate wages? Negotiate hours? Is that \nthe team concept that you want?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Frankly, if it were up to me----\n  Mr. FORD. Oh, I understand that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It would.\n  Mr. FORD. But what this law----\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No; and to respond to your question--I know neither \none of us want to put a full page in here.\n  Mr. FORD. I am trying not to, but some people just say some things.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The National Labor Relations Board has called into \nquestion all of these concepts.\n  And is it very simple to read what this act does. It simply would \nmake this possible. I simply quote Secretary Reich:\n\n       Many companies have already discovered that management \n     practices fully involving workers have great value beyond \n     their twin virtues.\n\n  Or as President Clinton said in his 1996 State of the Union Message:\n\n       When companies and workers work as a team, they do better, \n     and so does America.\n\n  We could not agree more. So why not make it possible and make it \ncertain that no one is under a threat from the National Labor Relations \nBoard?\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my colleague, you take one line out of a statement \nand then you do not read the paragraph before or the paragraph under of \nthe President's State of the Union Message. My interpretation of that \nwas that employees ought to be recognized as assets, to be nurtured and \nimproved and trained--that was No. 1--so that management and the \nemployees could work together.\n  Second, I think his intent was the employees should not be used to be \nfired so the CEO could get $5 million as a bonus for that year while \nthey are out walking on the street. So what he was saying, as long as \nthe----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senators the additional \n2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. FORD. I request 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator from Georgia----\n  Mr. FORD. You have the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. I like what we are doing. We are having a good time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me finish this statement and I will not object to \nan additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not want the meat loaf to get too hard, and I do not \nwant to stay around here. I would like to talk with you now.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. All right.\n  Mr. FORD. Because I think the team concept is fine. I understand that \nwell. That is to improve the flow of the----\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent that we have an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. But I like the team concept of working together, making the \nassembly line work better, put out a better product, make more profit \nfor the employer. But if you take this out, if you pass this bill, as I \nunderstand it, as my lawyers tell me, then the employer selects the \nteam and that is the end of it. He appoints his son-in-law and a couple \nof others and that is the end of it, because you do not allow what is \ngoing on now. You eliminate the law, and the law then gives the \nemployer the opportunity to select the teams.\n  Now you say, ``Well, that will never happen.'' That is what this law \nsays.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No; that is not what this law says. Now I am going to \ntake my prerogative and finish my statement.\n  Mr. FORD. You disagree. Well, I had fun while it lasted.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. This is a good debate, because talking about the TEAM \nAct or the ability for employers and employees to work together is \nsomething that actually came out of Asia. We have all sat back and \nnoticed the efficiencies that some of the Japanese companies have. This \nis where this concept comes from.\n  This is talking about a new workplace. Labor law in this country is \nessentially drawn for industry and the workplace that is 50 years old. \nWe are about to go into a new century, and we ought to be talking about \na more flexible workplace, like this suggests. We ought to be talking \nand acknowledging the fact that the American family is under severe \npressures and anxiety today. Both of them have to work today just to \nkeep up with the point I made a minute ago that half their income is \ntaken by the Government now.\n  Mr. FORD. Plural; plural.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And we ought to be guiding them to a more flexible \nworkplace, a more friendlier work environment. I think the President's \nstatement sort of speaks for itself. It is not a question of \ninterpreting it. He simply says, this is a quote:\n\n       When companies and workers work as a team, they do better \n     and so does America.\n\n  He is right, and we ought to be shaping law that gets us ready for \nthe new century, that allows a friendlier environment, that allows \nworkers and management to work together. That is what the TEAM Act will \ndo.\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\n  I might point out that it is not management that was up here from \nthese Georgia companies, it was employees who were up here trying to \nhelp endorse these newer concepts for the new century and the new \nworkplace.\n  Again, we have three proposals here. One is to repeal the gas tax \nthat President Clinton and the administration imposed in August 1993. \nIt is an initial step to lighten this burden on the American family. \nThe second is the minimum wage that the Senator from Massachusetts just \ntried to propose for America. And the third is a modification that \nfrees companies not to be threatened by the National Labor Relations \nBoard if employers and employees set up work groups to cover the very \npoints that the Senator from Utah espoused.\n\n  This is a good law. It actually ought to be just the beginning. We \nought to be thinking of other forms of flexibility and other forms of a \nnew environment in the workplace that adjusts itself to the modern \nworkplace and modern family of employees are having to contend with.\n  With that, Mr. President, I am going to do the leader's notice for \nthe end of the day.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I asked for recognition.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield----\n  Mr. FORD. You yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I apologize for taking so much time here, \nbut I think what we are getting into is important. There is no way \nunder the 4.3-cent gasoline tax any assurance that the consumer will \nget it. So all we ask is let that proposal stand alone and we will have \nrelevant amendments and a time agreement. But we are blocked out of \namendments; we have to take it as is.\n  Why, you could give an income tax credit of 4.3 cents, and that would \nassure that the consumer, the taxpayer would get the money. We do not \neven have a chance to put up that kind of amendment. You know, a blind \nhog every once in a while finds an acorn. We might come up with a good \nsuggestion, but we are precluded from amending. That is No. 1.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. I am glad to yield--you yielded to me--as long as I do not \ngo beyond.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think we heard the majority leader say to the \nminority leader that he was prepared to discuss an amendment, that he \nwas prepared to meet this evening----\n  Mr. FORD. But he wants to keep it in the same package.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. He did not say that.\n  Mr. FORD. Absolutely, absolutely, that is the whole theme here, and \nyou have to approve of the amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will say this, I am encouraged the Senator from \nKentucky is talking as though he is prepared to grant some time.\n  Mr. FORD. We have been prepared all along, but what you do is put a \npoison pill in, and we are not going to accept the poison pill. Wait a \nminute. We are not going to accept the poison pill. You say this is it, \nand we say we cannot be for it if you put that in. Well, you put that \nin and so, therefore, we have told you in advance we cannot be for it.\n  So we are put in a position of having to be against it, and I do not \nparticularly like that. But I wanted to tell you, if I am precluded \nfrom offering any amendment, I think I have the right, and this side \nhas the right, and some on that side will have the right to offer \namendments and be quite disturbed about not being able to offer \namendments.\n  So what we did is we offered three stand-alone bills with relevant \namendments and a time, and you say, ``No, we want to put it all in a \npackage, and we have to vote on it as a package. We get three votes and \nthen a vote on the package.''\n  I do not understand why you will not take the offer. There must be \nsome reason, because the minimum wage was the only threat you had. That \nwas the only threat. Now you are agreeing to the minimum wage to take \nit as an amendment or vote on it. And there is a majority in this body \nthat will vote for it, and the majority leader stated that this \nafternoon. So the majority wants to increase the minimum wage in the \nSenate. The majority leader agreed to that.\n  So, that is one vote. That is stand alone. That is the only threat \nyou have had. That is the only thing that the majority leader has been \nbuilding the tree for, so we cannot have an amendment, so we cannot put \non the minimum wage.\n  Now something happened out there beyond the beltway, and all of a \nsudden we are agreeing to the minimum wage, because you have Senators \non your side who want to vote for the minimum wage increase.\n  So we just say there are three bills. Let them stand alone, let us \nhave relevant amendments, let us do a time agreement, if that is what \nis necessary, instead of putting it in a package and then having three \nvotes and then the fourth vote to approve the package. There is some \nreason beyond the minimum wage.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. What we are worried about is the poison pen.\n  Mr. FORD. Pill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Pen, the one that vetoed the tax relief earlier this \nyear, the one that vetoed welfare reform.\n  Mr. FORD. The one that signed the tax in 1990, that was a poison pen \ntoo, my friend?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am talking about----\n  Mr. FORD. You want to talk about the President. There was a history \nof a $300 billion deficit when President Clinton took over. It is now \n$140 billion, down 4 consecutive years--4 consecutive years--after you \nbuilt it up over almost $5 trillion.\n  You say, we have not done very well? Let us look at the record. You \nare saying, we had to swallow the poison pill to vote for that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You are about to run past your $389.\n  Mr. FORD. You got me worked up, and I am sweating a little bit. But \nthe thing that really bothers this Senator is to say that it is all \nPresident Clinton's fault. Why, I even saw one story that he was \nresponsible--an op-ed piece--that he was responsible for the Unabomber. \nKeep on keeping on, because he is going up in the ratings. He is even \n16 points ahead in Kentucky. Will you believe that? I yield the floor. \nAnd I will go to dinner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just in response--I do not speak for \nthe leader, but I do not believe the package will be separated, because \nof the fear of the poison pen of a veto. So they will not be taken up \nin separate votes. I am sure there can be an accommodation to other \namendments. But the separation that would allow the President the \nauthority to accept what that side wants and reject what our side wants \nis not likely the case.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia agree that at the present \ntime we on this side of the aisle have sought to pass a very simple \nbill, which has already passed the House of Representatives, to \nreimburse attorney's fees and costs to those people who were wrongfully \nfired in the White House Travel Office just a couple years ago, and \nthat we have been denied the right to pass that bill without any \nchanges and without any conditions?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator is absolutely correct. It is the \nunderlying bill to which the majority leader's package would be \nattached.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia not agree that we asked \nfor the ability to debate a repeal of the gas tax, an unprecedented gas \ntax, not for use for transportation infrastructure, but for the first \ntime in the history of our country the gas tax increase passed 3 years \nago simply went into the general fund for various social programs, and \nwe are denied the ability to deal with that issue standing alone?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator is absolutely correct. It was under threat \nof amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia agree that we now have \nbefore us not only those two together, but also an increase in the \nminimum wage, the very increase in the minimum wage that the other \nparty has asked for, but at the same time that we deal with that \naspect, the questions relating to labor, that we have wanted to\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nensure that the Senate majority could work its will with respect to the \nTEAM Act, an act which will authorize the kind of cooperation which is \nin fact taking place right now in more than 30,000 places of employment \nthroughout the country, in which members of a corporation management \nand labor can work together for safer conditions, for better \nproductivity, for the creation of production teams and the like, things \nthat are not specifically collective bargaining, and that we have \nthought it was quite appropriate that we deal with both the minimum \nwage on one side of the equation and this one as a package and ensure \nthat, if we are going to have one passed along, we would pass the other \nas well?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Washington is correct. He is \narticulating very well the balance here. If we are going to deal with, \nin my judgment, the old systems of managing the workplace, I think \ncoming to the new century is a wonderful time to begin talking about \nsome of the newer ideas.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia agree that the only \noffer--perhaps not offer; demand--demand we have from the minority \nparty is that we deal with these issues in a way in which those that \nthe minority party favors are assured to become law while those that \nthe majority party favors are assured to be vetoed?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As I said a moment ago, I could not envision us \nseparating this thing in a form where the President's poison pen versus \nthis poison pill they are talking about could be applied to the issues \nwe want to become law and he could accept the provisions that they want \nto become law.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Does the Senator from Georgia agree that the rationale \nfor this is that the various labor union bosses find absolutely \nanathema any proposal which would allow informal arrangements between \nmanagement and labor that does not go through formal labor unions, and \nfor that reason they are perfectly prepared to filibuster and are \nfilibustering, and the President is perfectly prepared to veto, and \nwill veto a proposal that gives gas tax relief; and the minimum wage \nincrease, if it is accompanied by this modern management technique \nwhich so many people, both the management and labor, whatever their \ndevotion to lower taxes, whatever their devotion to a minimum wage \nincrease, they are far less important than preventing the passage of \nthe TEAM Act?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Well, I agree. It is a matter of public discourse at \nthis point that the labor bosses in this city have publicly stated that \nthey are going to expend $35 million to destabilize the majority----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator the time limit \nhas expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That they will put 100 paid volunteers in some 70 \ncongressional districts. So you do not have to be a rocket scientist to \nfigure out why the other side is scared to death of a procedure or \nmanagement tool that those labor bosses do not want.\n  I might add to that, but the employees--as I noted just a moment ago, \nit was the employees, not management, who came from my State today and \nyesterday asking for this new vehicle. I think the American worker, \nunlike the boss system in this city, the American worker wants these \nflexibilities.\n  Mr. GORTON. Obviously, because they can only take place with their \ninvolvement.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is right.\n  Mr. GORTON. So those of us who feel that cooperation, rather than \nconfrontation, is the future for America and labor-management \nrelationships, that this is the way we will build more jobs and greater \ncompetitiveness, that the only way we can authorize what in fact has \nbeen going on until it was determined to be a violation of an act from \nthe 1930's, that the only way that we could bring ourselves into the \n1990's or into the 21st century under this set of circumstances is to \nmarry this proposal, which otherwise would be filibustered and vetoed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Being filibustered now.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is being filibustered and would be vetoed.\n  The only way we can possibly get it into law is to marry it with \nsomething that the other side would like to see passed and let them \ndetermine whether or not their expressed devotion to a minimum wage \nincrease is sufficient to overcome their loyalty to these union \nleaders.\n  Is it not the opinion of the Senator from Georgia that they have now \nshown us that their devotion to a minimum wage increase is far less \nthan their devotion to following the dictates of union leaders who say \nthat no relationship between management and labor can take place except \nthrough formal labor unions?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If this afternoon and whatever we uncovered from the \nSenator from Kentucky, the sensitivities that were raised here a few \nminutes ago would suggest that you are right.\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe that I am. I thank the Senator from Georgia. If \nI may, I express my own opinion that while I think that a minimum wage \nincrease, at least marginally, would decrease jobs and job \nopportunities, I nevertheless feel that creating a better overall \neconomy through the TEAM Act is worth a compromise which puts the two \nof these together and sends it to the President of the United States \nwith the hope that the President would sign them.\n  I share the regret and opinion of the Senator from Georgia that \ndevotion to the minimum wage increase is no more than lip deep, that it \nwill disappear once anything else of a more balanced nature should \nappear with it.\n  It seems to me we should continue to insist that if we are going to \ndo the one, we ought to do the other at the same time and in a way \nwhich that poison pen of the White House can accept simply what he \nwishes and not have to do something which will really improve the \neconomy and labor-management relations in the United States of America.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I underscore that regarding this \nproposal, 90 percent of the economists have alluded to the fact that it \nwill cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. The proposal we are talking \nabout is part of a new workplace. It comes from nations that are using \nit that have become tough competitors of ours. We better start getting \nmodern labor law in place if we are going to compete in the new \ncentury.\n  Mr. MACK. Would the Senator from Georgia be willing to yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. MACK. Would the Senator agree it is possible that our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are filibustering this legislation \nbecause, frankly, it is an embarrassment if this 4.3-cent gasoline tax \ncut were to make its way to the President of the United States?\n  Again, what I am trying to draw in your mind is a picture of the \nPresident of the United States who campaigned in 1992 that he was going \nto reduce the burden on America's middle-income families. In fact, I \nthink he proposed a tax cut for middle-income families. Then within the \nfirst year after he was elected he introduced and enabled the passage \nof a tax plan that would, in fact, increase taxes on all Americans, \npart of which was the 4.3-cent gasoline tax.\n  Now, we are in a situation where we would be saying that we want to \ngive the President an opportunity to keep his campaign promise of 1992, \nbut it puts him in an embarrassing position, because after he got \nthrough saying the things he said in 1992, he went ahead and supported \nthe tax increase.\n  Is it possible our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nengaging in this filibuster to try to protect the President from an \nembarrassing situation where he will either have to sign into law \nsomething that would reverse something he has done, or he will have to \nveto?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we be allowed \nto finish our colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, there are two promises here. First, the President \nsaid he would lower taxes on the middle-class as part of the campaign \nof 1992. That was substantially reversed. Instead of lowering the \neconomic pressure on America and America's working families, he \nreversed it and increased the economic pressure with a\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nhistoric tax increase of which the gas tax is a significant piece.\n  Second, he said during the same campaign that a gas tax was \nregressive and would be particularly harmful on the poor and the \nelderly and should not be imposed, and then reversed that and imposed a \nnew gas tax.\n  So the debate is about reversing something the President imposed on \nthe country through his leadership in the Congress, and more \nimportantly, reminds us of a promise that was made that was not kept, \nwhich is what the Senator from Florida has alluded to.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/08/senate-section/article/S4878-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 9, 1996\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
