The clerk will report the pending \nbusiness.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3603) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1997, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Bryan amendment No. 4977, to establish funding limitations \n     for the market access program.\n       Kerrey amendment No. 4978, to increase funding for the \n     Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration and \n     the Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n       Leahy amendment No. 4987, to implement the recommendations \n     of the Northern Forest Lands Council.\n       Santorum amendment No. 4995, to prohibit the use of funds \n     to provide a total amount of nonrecourse loans to producers \n     for peanuts in excess of $125,000.\n       Santorum amendment No. 4967, to prohibit the use of funds \n     to carry out a peanut program that is operated by a marketing \n     association if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that a \n     member of the board of directors of the association has a \n     conflict of interest with respect to the program.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we made good progress yesterday afternoon \nand last evening in the debate of several amendments. We resolved some \nof the issues that were presented to us in the form of amendments. We \nhave votes ordered on amendments which will begin at 11 a.m. We have \npending other amendments that have been debated on which the yeas and \nnays have not been ordered but which may require rollcall votes.\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\n  There are also some on the list of amendments that are in order that \nare yet to be offered. We hope that Senators who are planning to offer \nthose amendments will please come to the floor as soon as possible so \nwe can begin consideration of those amendments.\n  Let me say this in addition to comments that have already been made \nabout one pending amendment. I think the first amendment that was \noffered that has not been resolved and on which the yeas and nays have \nnot yet been ordered is an amendment offered by the Senator from \nNevada, [Mr. Bryan], to limit the funds available to the Department for \nthe Market Access Program in the next fiscal year to $70 million. I \nthink that is what the amendment seeks to do. I feel constrained to \npoint out that since this bill was considered by the Senate last year, \nin last year's appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture, \nwe enacted a farm bill which has been signed by the President which is \nnow the law. The 1996 farm bill reduced the authorized mandatory \nfunding level from $110 million to $90 million annually. It also \nprohibits funding for non-U.S. for-profit corporations, and for \nforeign-produced products. Funding for the Market Access Program is \nlimited to small businesses, nonprofit trade associations, and \ncooperatives. I was not excited about the reduction in the \nauthorization level that was made by the legislative committee. But, \nnonetheless, it is a fact.\n  The way the law is written now, there will be spent--there ``shall'' \nbe spent--the sum of $90 million annually on market access promotion. \nSo that leaves the Senate with a new set of facts.\n  The argument has been made that we cut funding in the previous years, \nand the Senate did approve reductions in funding. But the Senate also \nwas a party to the writing of that farm bill. There were amendments \noffered on the subject of the funding level. The conference report \ncontained the funding level of $90 million, and that was signed by the \nPresident. That ought to be considered and understood by the Senate \nbefore we vote on the amendment proposed by the Senator from Nevada.\n  I am not suggesting that it is inappropriate for him to offer that \namendment. I am just pointing out that the Senate has already decided \nthat issue. They decided the issue when the farm bill was written and \nthat provision was included in the farm bill.\n  I put in the Record a copy of a letter that was written to me as \nchairman of the subcommittee by a coalition of groups and associations \nwho are interested in export promotion and who know how important funds \nof this kind are to our efforts to deal with unfair trade practices and \nefforts by foreign competitors to keep us out of markets, to deny us \nmarket share.\n  It is a tough competitive environment out there. The global economy \nhas been made more competitive because of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade and the Uruguay Round Agreement that has broken down \nbarriers to trade and prohibited a number of trading practices that in \nthe past had made it impossible for us to compete in some markets. But \nnow that the playing field has been made more level and access has been \nmade more available, we are seeing other countries increase the amount \nof funding and activity in this kind of effort to enlarge market share \nand to create market access for their agriculture commodities and \nfoodstuff.\n  Some countries spend as much on promoting just one kind of foodstuff \nas we have to appropriate and make available for the Foreign \nAgriculture Service to go around to all commodities and foodstuffs that \nare exported by the United States. But in spite of that, we are doing \nwell. We are increasing our dollar volume of export sales. This year it \nis estimated that we will sell 60 billion dollars worth of U.S. \nagriculture commodities and foodstuffs in the international \nmarketplace. That is a tremendous amount of volume. It means jobs here \nin America. It means better pay. It means a healthier economy for the \nUnited States. This is the only program of its type that makes funds \navailable to promote specific commodities or brand-name items in the \ninternational market.\n\n  I have talked in our Embassies in other countries to those who have \nhad experience with the use of these funds in special situations, and \nthey tell me that it is very effective and without this program we \nwould end up losing out to other competitors from other countries that \nare competing in those markets.\n  So it seems to me, Mr. President, we ought not limit the funding for \nthis program with the adoption of the Bryan amendment. I hope that the \nadditional information that I have been able to give the Senate on that \nsubject is helpful. Senators have voted on this issue time and time \nagain in various forms.\n  My good friend from Arkansas is one of the most eloquent and \npersuasive Senators who take the other side of the issue, and so it is \nwith some trepidation and the knowledge that I am going to have a \nrebuttal here on my hands that I rose this morning to give that \nadditional information. But it is important for the Senate to \nunderstand the difference between the state of the funding question and \nthe issue this year as compared to last year when we voted on a number \nof different amendments designed to change this program and reform it. \nIt has been reformed. It has been changed. There are limitations now on \nthe eligibility for funds from the Foreign Agriculture Service for \nthese purposes.\n  Associations are still eligible for these funds. Small businesses can \nget funds to promote their products in overseas trade. But a major \ncomplaint and the thing that made this program controversial has been \nreformed by law with the enactment of the farm bill earlier this year.\n  I am hopeful that we will not keep beating on this program and \nslandering it and causing Senators to have to vote to cut the program. \nIt is mandated by law that it will be funded at $90 million a year, and \nthe changes have been made that reform the program and take care of \nsome of the complaints that had been levied against it in the past.\n  At some point I will move to table that amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays, but I do not want to do that and cut off the right of \nany other Senator to speak on the issue, particularly the Senator from \nNevada [Mr. Bryan], who is the author of the amendment. He did not know \nI was going to say these things this morning. I did not know that I was \ngoing to say them either, but it occurred to me that this has not been \nthe subject of any discussion except the few minutes of debate we had \nwhen he first proposed the amendment. And it was the first amendment, \none of the first amendments proposed to the bill, and it seems like \nthat has been a long time ago. I think it was a long time ago. We need \nto wrap this bill up. We are going to start voting at 11, and I am not \nsure how many votes we are going to have. We have, I know, two peanut \namendments that Senator Santorum offered last night. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered on those. Senator Kerrey has an amendment on which \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered. We approved two of his amendments. \nMaybe he will withdraw this one. Two-thirds--that is pretty good--of \nwhat he wanted he has gotten.\n  So I hope Senators will come to the floor. I see the Senator from \nColorado here, and I am prepared to yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I do not want to shock my colleague too \nmuch, but I am not going to offer a rebuttal to the arguments he just \nmade on the Market Promotion Program. I think I first offered an \namendment to strike those funds 5 years ago, and the Senate has heard \nthat debate many, many times and so I will not belabor it again. But I \ndid want to point out to my colleagues that there was a very \ninteresting op-ed piece in the Post this morning by Daniel Greenberg \nwho is editor and publisher of Science & Government Report, a \nWashington newsletter.\n  Yesterday, in the Chamber, I pointed out that last year is the first \nyear in modern history that yields per acre on a same-crop basis did \nnot increase. Every year in the lifetime of every single person in the \nSenate soybean yields have gone up, wheat yields have gone up, cotton \nyields have gone up, and\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\nparticularly food yields have gone up to feed an ever-expanding \npopulation in the world. As you know, one of the reasons corn and wheat \nare as high as they are right now is because there was a genuine \nconcern that we were going to run out of wheat and corn in this \ncountry.\n  I will not bore the Senate by reading it to them, but there are a \ncouple of paragraphs I think ought to be emphasized.\n\n       Pre-harvest stocks of grain--\n\n  That means the carryover; preharvest stocks are what we have on hand \nwhen we start harvesting the next crop.\n\n       Pre-harvest stocks of grain have declined for the third \n     straight year and now are at the lowest levels on record, \n     according to Worldwatch Institute. To satisfy its growing \n     appetite for meat, China has shifted from a net exporter to a \n     net importer of grain, even as urban growth takes over \n     farmlands.\n\n  Another big problem, Mr. President.\n\n       In the United States and elsewhere, increases in per-acre \n     yields have leveled off from the fabulous gains from the past \n     three decades. Throughout the world, food prices have risen \n     substantially as supply fails to keep pace with population \n     growth and upscale tastes.\n       Worrisome? Yes. But history records the capacity of science \n     to mock Malthusian gloom with miracles of productivity. \n     Surely it will deliver a late-century encore for the Green \n     Revolution and other science-based breakthroughs in \n     agriculture.\n       It can, but don't count on it.\n\n  He goes on to point out--we had an amendment offered here which may \nbe withdrawn or voted on a voice vote to cut research money in this \nbill, agricultural research. And here is what he says. These are \nstatistics that maybe Senator Cochran and I are not as familiar with as \nwe should have been.\n\n       At about $1.2 billion this year, the research budget of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture accounts for a mere 2 \n     percent of all Federal research and is lower in purchasing \n     power than it was 5 years ago. In Washington politics, \n     agricultural research is barely noticed among such giants of \n     Federal research as defense ($35 billion),--\n\n  That is pure research in defense.\n\n     Space ($14 billion) and health ($12 billion).\n\n  That is a combined total of $61 billion in those areas compared to \n$1.2 billion for agriculture research, and the population of the world \nis now calculated to be 5\\1/2\\ billion people and growing at 100 \nmillion per year.\n\n  The fishermen all around the world, particularly in littoral nations \nthat depend almost exclusively on the oceans, are draining the oceans. \nWhen I was a child, I can remember one of my elementary school teachers \nsaying: Do not worry about it. The oceans will always supply enough \nfood to feed the world. No matter how many droughts we have, no matter \nhow many other devastating things happen to our crops--hail, flood, \nwhatever--the oceans will feed us.\n  Right here at our back door, the New England fisheries have had to \nvirtually shut down in order to give the fisheries there a chance to \nreplenish themselves, which they have not yet done. Yesterday morning \nthe front page of the Metro section of the Washington Post pointed out \nthat the crab supply in the Chesapeake Bay is down dramatically, 500 \npeople out of work, and a few crab-picking operations working 3 days a \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I always have a tendency to get a little too dramatic \nabout these things, but you cannot overdramatize a problem like this. \nMy complaint, in the 22 years I have been in the Senate, is that we \nhave a serious misplacement of priorities. We deal with the politics of \nissues instead of what the real issue is.\n  Senator Cochran and I were talking early yesterday afternoon. He told \nme he had been reading ``The Adams Family,'' the chronicle of the John \nAdams and John Quincy Adams family, all of whom were brilliant. They \nbelieved, about public service, it was a place to do good, just like \nthe ministry. In the old days, people went into public service, \npolitics, because it was a place where they could serve their fellow \nman. They did not worry about the politics of the issues they debated. \nI said on welfare, it is a tragedy it has to be passed in such a highly \nvolatile, political climate.\n  But my father, as I have said many times, was probably the last man \nwho ever lived who encouraged his sons to go into politics. He did not \nencourage my sister, because in those days it was unthinkable for a \nwoman to go into politics. But he urged my brothers and me to go into \npolitics because he considered politics a noble calling. He considered \nit a noble calling because he studied Edmund Burke, he studied John \nAdams, he had studied all the Founding Fathers who went to Philadelphia \nand crafted a Constitution to give this country guidance for 200-plus \nyears and who were not worrying about somebody accosting them on the \nstreet when they got home about some uncrossed t or undotted i.\n  So we have come a very long way in politics in this country. While \nmost of it has been good, an awful lot of it has not been. We have put \nour priorities on things that have been politically popular. Nobody \nwants to curb the $35 billion expenditure on defense because nobody \nwants to see a 30-second attack ad when they run again that they are \nsoft on defense. Nobody wants to vote against welfare reform because \nwelfare is very unpopular. If you ask the ordinary man on the street--\n80 percent of them say they hate welfare. Yes, it ought to be reformed; \nyes, it ought to be changed. So it is not easy for me to be one of 24 \nSenators who voted no yesterday. I am not saying I am all right. I am \nsaying the bill could have been an awful lot better.\n  One of the things that disturbed me was the total lack of compassion \nduring the entire debate. People love to go to church on Sunday morning \nand read the Sermon on the Mount on ``blessed are the poor,'' but when \nit comes to worrying about children and people who are kicked off \nwelfare, we could not seem to be punitive enough around here. So I \nstill believe those old Methodist Sunday school stories I learned as a \nchild. I also did not like the formula which I thought discriminated \nagainst my State tragically--tragically.\n\n  Back to the point I was going to make a moment ago on misplaced \npriorities. Science can only do so much--and it can do a lot more. But \nwe are not going to solve the world's food problem, which is developing \nright as I speak, by putting $1.2 billion in agriculture research and \n$35 billion into making something explode and $14 billion on sending a \nspace station up which has absolutely no merit whatever.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Daniel S. \nGreenberg article, to which I referred, printed in the Record, and I \nyield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       A Drought We Can't Afford\n\n                        (By Daniel S. Greenberg)\n\n       Science will provide. That's the confident assurance of the \n     optimists in response to worrisome indications that demand is \n     en route to outpacing food production.\n       Pre-harvest stocks of grain have declined for the third \n     straight year and now are at the lowest level on record, \n     according to Worldwatch Institute. To satisfy its growing \n     appetite for meat, China has shifted from a net exporter to a \n     net importer of grain, even as urban growth takes over \n     farmlands. In the United States and elsewhere, increases in \n     per-acre yield have leveled off from the fabulous gains of \n     the past three decades. Throughout the world, food prices \n     have risen substantially as supply fails to keep pace with \n     population growth and upscale tastes.\n       Worrisome? Yes. But history records the capacity of science \n     to mock Malthusian gloom with miracles of productivity. \n     Surely it will deliver a late-century encore for the Green \n     Revolution and other science-based breakthroughs in \n     agriculture.\n       It can, but don't count on it.\n       The scientific enterprise that revolutionized American \n     agriculture is decaying from political and fiscal neglect, \n     though alarms have been sounding all across the political \n     spectrum and in independent think tanks for at least a \n     decade. Nonetheless, agricultural science consistently ranks \n     near the bottom in government research priorities, and that's \n     what hurts, since Washington provides the bankroll for the \n     fundamental science that ignites agricultural revolutions.\n       At about $1.2 billion this year, the research budget of the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture accounts for a mere 2 percent \n     of all federal research spending and is lower in purchasing \n     power than it was five years ago. In Washington politics, \n     agricultural research is barely noticed among such giants of \n     federal research as defense ($35 billion), space ($14 \n     billion) and health ($12 billion).\n       One reason for the absence of broad interest is that the \n     economics of agriculture research is dominated by entrenched \n     insiders. The system for distributing research money to \n     universities is largely preordained by ancient formulas that \n     guarantee shares for each of 76 land-grant colleges and \n     universities, regardless of the scientific quality or \n     relevance of their research.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n       Decades of efforts to enliven agricultural research with \n     the competitive requirements built into medical research have \n     produced grudgingly small funds from Congress. Whereas \n     university scientists must scramble to get research money \n     from the National Institutes of Health, the bulk of \n     agriculture's academic research money simply comes in the \n     mail for just being there. Agricultural research was years \n     behind in joining the biotechnology revolution.\n       Continuing a White House tradition, the Clinton \n     administration has devoted little attention to agricultural \n     research. The top research post in the Department of \n     Agriculture has been filled on an acting basis by one or \n     another temporary appointee throughout most of the Clinton \n     administration. The only full-fledged occupant left recently \n     after less than a year on the job. Given the logjam of \n     nominees on Capitol Hill, the post is not likely to be filled \n     before Election Day.\n       What's striking about the many recent studies of \n     agricultural research is their unanimity of dismay about the \n     inadequacy of government support. A review of agricultural \n     research published late last year by the conservative \n     American Enterprise Institute concludes that a ``significant \n     increase in federal funding, or federal government action to \n     stimulate increased funding by state government or industry, \n     seems to be warranted.'' The study also sounded the customary \n     reformist call for more competition for research funds.\n       Similar recommendations are contained in a report soon to \n     be published by the nonpartisan, scholarly National Academy \n     of Sciences.\n       No one disagrees with these findings--except the dug-in \n     beneficiaries of our antiquated system of agricultural \n     research.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, what is the current business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current business of the Senate is the \nSantorum amendment No. 4967.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so I may proceed \nwith an amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5002\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5002.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . INTERIM MORATORIUM ON BYPASS FLOWS.\n\n       ``(a) Moratorium.--Section 389(a) of Public Law 104-127 is \n     amended by striking ``an 18-month'' after the word ``be'' and \n     inserting ``a 20-month''.\n       ``(b) Report.--Section 389(d)(4) of Public Law 104-127 is \n     amended by striking ``1 year'' after the word ``than'' and \n     inserting ``14 months''.\n       ``(c) Extension for Delay.--Section 389 of Public Law 104-\n     127 is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection--\n       ``(e) Extension for Delay.--There shall be a day-for-day \n     extension to the 20-month moratorium required by subsection \n     (a) and a day-for-day extension to the report required by \n     subsection (d)(4)--\n       (1) for every day of delay in implementing or establishing \n     the Water Rights Task Force caused by a failure to nominate \n     Task Force members by the Administration or by the Congress; \n     or\n       (2) for every day of delay caused by a failure by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to identify adequate resources to \n     carry out this section.' ''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Senate has been most indulgent with a \nproblem that is extremely serious to Colorado and, I believe, to many \nother States. On the Agriculture appropriations bill last year, the \nranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee were kind enough to \nhelp us with an amendment that was urgently needed. It related to a \npolicy that the Agriculture Department calls ``bypass flows.'' What \nthat has meant is Colorado has asked for a renewal of easements which \ncross Federal grounds. The Forest Service has informed the State, ``You \nwill have to forfeit a third of your water in order to achieve a \nrenewal of an easement.''\n  The concept of someone being landlocked is recognized in most State \nlaws and those State laws provide a way out of that. Whereas, if \nsomeone absolutely needs a way out across that ground, there are \nprovisions under State law where fair compensation can be paid and they \nachieve that easement. What we are dealing with here is cities that \nhave their reservoirs in the mountains surrounded by Federal ground and \nhave no choice but to cross Federal ground to get that drinking water \nto those citizens. Colorado is a very dry State. Without reservoirs and \nwithout that water supply, literally, people do not have water to \ndrink. It is not just a question of water to maintain the beautiful \nenvironments of the homes and lawns and parks. It is literally drinking \nwater we are talking about.\n  What the Forest Service has said is we will not renew your permit to \ncross Federal ground in order to deliver the drinking water to your \nhomes unless you agree to forfeit a third of your drinking water. As I \nthink every Senator can imagine, this is devastating. It is devastating \nto the environment of the State. It is devastating to the people and to \nthe cities. It has already cost our cities some millions of dollars in \nattorney's fees to litigate this. And the Forest Service continues on \nwith this practice.\n  When we drew this problem to the attention of Secretary Madigan, \nSecretary Madigan acted immediately. He put forth a directive and a \npolicy that this would no longer be the policy of the Department of \nAgriculture. It is clearly not authorized by law. If it were litigated \nto the Supreme Court, I think it would be one of those things that \nwould be found to be out of compliance with the authorization of the \nForest Service itself. But the problem of appealing this to the Supreme \nCourt is not just the tens of millions of dollars in attorney's fees it \nwould take. The problem is the cutoff of water in the meantime if the \npermits are not renewed. It is an absolutely devastating problem. This \nChamber was kind enough to help us out last year with a moratorium.\n  That policy of Secretary Madigan, though, would have solved the \nproblem. He set forth, in a letter on October 6, 1992, a clear policy \nthat this was not to be the course of the Forest Service. It was not to \nbe followed and they were not to condition the renewal of permits on \nthe forfeiture of waters.\n  No one complains about paying rent. But let me point out, these are \nnot necessarily new easements. Many of these easements in Colorado \npredate the very existence of the Forest Service. These are easements \nthat have been in use for over 100 years, in some cases. They are \ntalking about cutting off a pipeline that has been in existence longer \nthan the very Forest Service has been in existence.\n  That policy, the Madigan policy, remained the law of the land, at \nleast in terms of the policy of the Forest Service. On February 15, \n1995, almost 3 years later, Under Secretary Jim Lyons testified before \nthe House Agriculture Committee and was asked if the Madigan policy was \nstill in effect. Under Secretary Lyons was the one who had the \nresponsibility for that area. He indicated flatly that that policy \nstill was in effect.\n  Shortly thereafter, in March 1995, Secretary Glickman also testified \nthat the Madigan policy was still in effect. What is unusual about that \nis that the Madigan policy was not in effect.\n  In August 1994, they had revoked it, and yet the leaders of the \nAgriculture Department had testified publicly to Congress that it was \nstill in effect.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that Secretary Glickman \nis an honorable person. I know him well. I respect him a great deal. \nAnd I am convinced that he merely repeated what his staff had advised \nhim when he checked with them on the question.\n  We have already dealt extensively with Under Secretary Lyons and some \nof the concerns this Chamber has had about him. I don't think that \nbears reopening. The point is, we ought to be setting out trying to \nsolve this problem.\n  That resulted, though, in an action last year on this very bill where \nwe enacted a 1-year moratorium. That measure passed in October of last \nyear, a moratorium on the activity of requiring people to forfeit their \nwater in order to renew an easement or permit for an easement.\n  In the meantime, we tried to enact permanent legislation, and did \nenact compromise legislation, on the farm bill. That farm bill \ncompromise was not what I wanted, because what I\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nwanted was a flat prohibition in law against extorting water from \npeople as payment for renewing their easements.\n  What we did get, though, at the request of the Secretary, is a \ncompromise, and that compromise allows for the appointment of a seven-\nmember water rights task force to study the problem and report back. \nThat report will be a year following the date of the enactment of the \nact, and the moratorium will run out in 18 months.\n  The danger with agreeing to that on my part is that if they simply \nstalled on appointing the task force, the moratorium would run out and \nthe Forest Service would then be in the position of cutting off \npeople's water, and they would have no further protection. But I \nbelieved in the good faith of the parties involved, and we went ahead \nwith that compromise.\n  Now what has happened is the administration has failed to appoint \ntheir member to the task force. Moreover, in violation of the law, they \nhave failed to allocate resources to the task force to do their job. \nCertainly, some modest travel fees are important and other fees are \nvital to have that task force act. In other words, what is happening, \neven though the act was passed on April 4 and all the task force \nmembers were supposed to be appointed by June 4, the administration has \nnot acted to even appoint the members of their task force, nor have \nthey acted to allocate funds for the task force.\n  Obviously, this is of enormous concern. Going on the background of \nthe Under Secretary misleading Congress in testimony about the problem, \nit is even of greater concern. The concern is flatly that instead of \ndealing with this problem and developing a compromise, they will simply \nstonewall it, allow the moratorium to run out and wreak havoc upon \npeople's drinking water.\n  Let me be clear about this. The primary people impacted by this \naction are not private developers, they are not agriculture, because \nthey have a separate provision of law that flatly prohibits this kind \nof activity in agriculture that was instituted years ago. Those \nimpacted by this are the cities and the towns and the taxpayers of the \nState, and, I might say, Mr. President, in cities and States across the \nNation as well. The precedent this establishes is devastating.\n  Let me say that the forfeiture required is a forfeiture of a third of \nyour water--at least that is what they have asked for in some cases--a \nthird of your water just for the temporary renewal of the permit. This \nis not a permanent easement. This is simply for its temporary renewal. \nPresumably when it comes up in 5 years or 20 years, they can again ask \nfor additional water.\n  This is a problem that is not going to go away and cannot be ignored \nby either Democrats or Republicans in the State of Colorado or other \nStates where the impact is felt.\n  As Members may recall, the senior Senator from Nebraska and I had \nworked hard to find a compromise on this. His first inclination was not \nto support this measure. I had drafted and intended to offer this \nmorning an extension of that moratorium for 5 years. A 5-year extension \nof the moratorium would give us plenty of time to work on it and plenty \nof time for Congress to act on it.\n\n  The senior Senator from Nebraska has indicated to me that he felt \nvery strongly that 5 years was inappropriate. I must say, I think what \nis appropriate is for the task force to settle down and find an answer. \nI believe personally there is an answer. We ought to do more to \nencourage and support minimum stream flow in our streams and rivers.\n  I have been a strong advocate of minimum stream flow all of my \npolitical life. I was a prime sponsor of Colorado's minimum stream flow \nbill that addresses this problem specifically. I believe there are a \nnumber of things the task force can recommend for Congress that will \nhelp.\n  One of the things is to buy water rights and to use the water rights \nthat are owned for that purpose when dry seasons come along. It is \nworth exploring. It is worth developing. It does have a positive \nimpact.\n  But one of the ironies of all of this is that the forfeiture of water \nrights that the Forest Service has called for in this case would \ndestroy minimum stream flow, not help it. Our stream flow comes in the \nspring when there are floods. The function of the reservoirs and \nstorage projects is to save that spring flood flow so it is usable year \nround. Increasing the flood flow will not only cause damage to \nproperty, but the Forest Service policy will mean there is less water \nin the river to mitigate the dry periods in the year.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of saving the Senate time and of \nreaching a fair compromise on this, I have tried to work with the \nSenators from Nebraska. The amendment that is before the Senate this \nmorning is one that is a compromise. Instead of the 5 years I had asked \nfor, it is only an extension of 2 months. So we have gone from 5 years \nto 2 months in the way of an extension. But there is an added \nprovision.\n  That added provision addresses additional delays. If there are any \ndelays beyond the time set forth in the original bill, that is 2 months \nto appoint people and the time required to submit the report, there \nwill be a day-for-day extension of the 20-month moratorium that is in \nthe legislation.\n  So while this is not as strong an amendment as I hoped for, it at \nleast attempts to make up for the parts that are lost.\n  Having said that, let me add this thought. This is a terribly \nimportant issue, and it is one that cannot be swept under the rug. It \nis one that needs the full cooperation of all parties if we are going \nto find an answer. It has gotten off on a bad foot by the \nadministration refusing even to appoint their member to the task force \nand refusing to allocate the money that the law required them to \nallocate.\n  My hope is not only that the amendment is adopted, which I believe \nhas the support of Senator Kerrey, the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nbut that it is a sign of a new attitude in the Department of \nAgriculture and the administration. Dan Glickman is an honorable person \nwho knows how to work problems out and solve problems. This is not his \nstyle. He is a problem solver, not a problem maker. My hope is that the \nGlickman attitude, the Glickman approach to these problems will prevail \nin the Department of Agriculture in the months and the years ahead, or, \nI should say, at least the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if the compromise amendment has any \nopposition. I had been assured by Senator Kerrey's office that he \nsupports it. At least I don't know of further opposition to it. Our \noffice is trying to check with Senator Exon's office, but pending \nhearing from Senator Exon, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I hope we can accept the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Colorado. He has made a substantial change \nin the proposal that he is making to accommodate concerns of others, \nincluding the administration and other Senators who expressed concerns \nearlier. We are trying to clear the amendment. We are not able at this \ntime to announce whether or not we will be able to take it on a voice \nvote.\n  I hope other Senators will come to the floor and offer their \namendments. We have a number of amendments that should be offered and \nresolved. We would appreciate very much the cooperation of the Senators \nin that regard. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in an effort to clarify the situation we \nhave two amendments that had been offered and debated last night by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum]. And to advise Senators of a \nspecific time when they can expect a vote to occur under the order \nthere was to be no vote this morning before the hour of 11 a.m. But it \nwill be my intention to have votes on motions to table the Santorum \namendments beginning at 11 a.m. Under the order entered last night by \nthe majority leader there was to be 4 minutes of time available for \ndebate on those peanut amendments before the votes would occur.\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\n  So, hoping to clarify when these votes will occur, I am going to \npropound a unanimous-consent agreement which has been cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time between now and 11 a.m. be equally \ndivided on Santorum amendments Nos. 4995 and 4967, and at 11 a.m. I be \nrecognized to move to table amendment No. 4995, as under the previous \norder, to be followed immediately by a motion to table amendment No. \n4967.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  This means that there is opportunity for further debate on these \namendments between now and 11 a.m. So it protects that right. If other \nSenators want to talk about other amendments they can certainly do that \nas well.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, last evening, Senator Santorum laid down \ntwo amendments that were to be voted on, as I understand, around 11, \nbut because of some problems with some of the Senators, it probably \nwill be delayed for a while. But as I understand it, unanimous consent \nhas been granted for us to debate between now and that time the peanut \namendments that have been laid down. So I want to take advantage of it. \nI understand that the author and proponent of the amendments knows of \nthe unanimous consent, and I will be glad to divide time if he wants \nit. But whatever it is, we can accommodate Senators equally with the \ntime.\n  There are two amendments. The first amendment, I understand, that \nwill be called up is one in which he alleges there is a conflict of \ninterest in regard to the peanut program by the fact that co-ops and \nmarketing associations which are run by farmers are involved in the \nadministration of the peanut program. We understand there has been \nfiled with the Department of Agriculture various letters by a law firm \nor law firms here in Washington in which it is anticipated there would \npossibly be some lawsuit pertaining to this matter. We feel that is an \nissue which ought to be determined by the courts.\n  We have contacted the Department of Agriculture. The Department of \nAgriculture tells us they have authority and they constantly monitor \nit. They have a responsibility that is carried out to see that there \nare no conflicts of interest. The idea that farmers participate in \ncarrying out the program is universal. You have committees composed of \nfarmers that are elected at the county level to carry out the program. \nThere are State committees composed of farmers that carry out the \nprogram. It is a matter that farmers participate in, the theory here \nbeing that at the local level they know the local problems and that \nthey are better equipped than Washington.\n  This seems to me to be a program that has been carried out for years \nto allow for those who are closest to the farmers to understand the \nindividual problems of farmers and to work them out. Therefore, the \nconcept of contracting out, the concept of local government, the \nconcept of no big Government in Washington is carried out in regard to \nthe present program if there is any problem that is involved.\n  The Department says this is entirely unnecessary. They administer the \nprogram. There is no conflict of interest. They audit. They monitor. \nThey carry on in a very proper and businesslike manner if there is a \nmatter that ought to be determined, such as a court case that may arise \nin regard to this program.\n  Certainly, right now we have a situation where we are in the middle \nof a growing season. We saw that the peanut program was reformed. There \nwas some matter pertaining to a substantial cut, some cut that amounts \nto about 30 percent of the revenues that go to the peanut farmers, and \nwe ought to allow it to work.\n  So I think this is a matter that is unnecessary. If it is, then it is \nacross the board in every commodity because the farmers are on \ncommittees. The conservation committees have local participants in \nevery county.\n  I see that Senator Santorum is here, and if he wants some time--and I \nsee also Senator Coverdell is here--I will be glad to yield the floor \nat this time. I will reserve my 2 minutes before the vote is taken as \nwe had in the previous unanimous-consent agreement.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to share my feelings on this \namendment with those of my distinguished colleague from Alabama. The \nSenator has made an eloquent case against the amendment which he began \nlast night and has echoed again this morning.\n  I am going to be reasonably brief. I understand that the chairman, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, will move to table this amendment, and I \nwill support that motion. I think it is entirely appropriate. These \nissues were fought extensively in the early part of this year when we \ndealt with the farm bill. Farm policy was settled by the passage of \nthat landmark bill.\n  At the time we were debating that bill, Mr. President, we were \nhearing from the farm community not only from my State and the State of \nthe Senator from Alabama but across the Nation that we had to get the \nfarm policy settled so that people could get into the fields, so that \nthey could make their financial transactions and deal with the planting \nseason and the farm season. We were already late. We passed this in \nearly April, but that was late into the spring. Nevertheless, we got it \ndone. In the ensuing 4 months, the entire farm community, including \nthose who deal with peanuts extensively in my State and the State of \nthe Senator from Alabama and others, everybody has been to the bank. \nEverybody has made their financial transactions. Everybody made their \nplans according to what the Congress of the United States and the \nPresident said the rules of the road would be for the next 7 years. \nHere we are 3 to 4 months later and we are talking about, through these \namendments, changing the rules of the road. I have argued that this \nCongress, this Government does that in far too many ways every time it \nengages in retroactivity--retroactivity on the minimum wage, \nretroactivity on taxes, and now retroactivity on farm policy.\n  So, I would argue that policy should be set in the farm bill. It was \ndebated and passed in early April and the farming community, no matter \nwhat their goals or products, engaged their financial decisions, made \ntheir family decisions, made their business decisions, and this is \nneither the appropriate place nor the appropriate time to alter that \npolicy.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me a few moments to express my \nagreement with this motion, to come and to share my remarks with the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, time has \nexpired. The hour of 11 o'clock having arrived, the Senator from \nMississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania be recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4967\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the second amendment we will be voting \non today is not a peanut amendment. It is an ethics amendment. It has \nnothing to do with the peanut program. It does not change the peanut \nprogram. It does not retroactively or prospectively alter anything in \nthe peanut program. This is an ethics amendment. This amendment is very \nsimple. It says the people who are the quota holders, the people who \nbenefit from the program, should not also be the people who manage the \nprogram, who operate the program, who help promulgate regulations to \noversee the program, who also do the enforcement for the program. That \nis virtually unprecedented in ag policy.\n  I am not changing anything in the peanut program with this amendment, \nnot one thing. All I am saying is the\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nSecretary of Agriculture--this is what the amendment says--the \nSecretary of Agriculture shall determine whether these co-ops who \noversee the program, who also are the beneficiaries of the program, \nviolate the Federal ethics law. That is all this amendment says. That \nis not a change in the peanut program. That is just saying we should \nhave some ethics in dealing with this issue.\n  There have already been letters filed, to the Secretary \nof Agriculture, back on June 5 requesting the Secretary to take action. \nThe Secretary has not responded. What we are suggesting is the \nSecretary should respond. They should make a determination whether \nthese co-ops, that--again I remind my colleagues--they oversee the \nprogram, they enforce the program, they help promulgate regulations on \nthe program, and they are also the beneficiaries of the program. That \nis apparent, to me, a conflict of interest. But I am not suggesting \nthat. I am not saying that it is. I am saying the Secretary should \ndetermine it. That is all this amendment does.\n\n  So we can have all this debate, as I am sure you will hear from \nothers that this is an amendment that hurts the peanut program, that \nchanges the rules of the game halfway through--it is just not the case. \nThe case is this is an ethics amendment about how the Federal \nGovernment should run its ag programs and I hope we could get very \nstrong support for something that is, I think, a relatively simple \namendment that I was hoping we could have agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4995\n\n  The first amendment I am going to talk about is another equity \namendment. This is an amendment that simply says that peanut quota \nholders, unlike any other ag commodity, should be limited as to the \namount of Government largess that they receive. Historically, all of \nthe other crop programs, and now in the future all the other payments \nto farmers under the new freedom to farm bill, are limited to $40,000 \nper person. There is no limit in the peanut program. There are peanut \nfarmers who can put their peanuts on loan and collect $6 million from \nthe Federal Government. And we are saying they should be limited to \n$125,000.\n  The limit on the subsidy payments to all other crops is up to \n$40,000. I am saying $125,000. That affects less than 2,000 quota \nholders. Mr. President, 2,000 quota holders are affected by this, the \nwealthiest, the biggest. If you hear the argument, as you will from the \nother side: Wait a minute, this program is designed to help these \nsmall- to medium-size peanut growers who are really struggling, who are \nin poor areas--fine. We do not touch them. All we say is those who are \nthe big quota holders, many of whom do not even farm their own land, \nthey rent their quota to someone else to do the work for them--what we \nare saying is they can only avail themselves of the largess of getting \ntwice what the world pays for peanuts for their peanuts up to $125,000.\n  I think that is, again, a very minor adjustment to the program. I \nwill admit that is an adjustment to who benefits from the program. But \nwe do not fundamentally restructure the peanut program here. All we are \ndoing is redefining how much people can benefit from it. We do not \nchange the program. We just change how much people benefit from it. I \nthink $125,000 of guaranteed income from the Federal Government at \ntwice the rate of what people will get paid everyplace else in the \nworld for peanuts, is a pretty good deal for most of these quota \nholders and they should be happy with that limitation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the order, I now move to table \namendment No. 4995.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4967\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the previous order I now move to \ntable amendment No. 4967.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4995\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Do I get my 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There now is 4 minutes debate equally divided \non the first motion to table, on amendment 4995. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Does the proponent seek to go first with his 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, there is a little confusion as to which \nvote will be held, but I have to call this Santorum amendment the \nconfusion amendment. We have, of course, argued in the past that we \nreformed it. And we have reformed it, the peanut program. But now we \nare having here, where the Senator from Pennsylvania argues that, since \nother commodities have a payment limitation, therefore peanuts ought \nto.\n  First, the confusion is that peanuts have never had a payment. They \nhave not had a payment. The confusion here is that he is confusing a \nloan program with a payment program. You had deficiency payments, which \nwere based upon a target price in all the commodities. But peanuts \nnever had that. And that is where the limitation was on, was on the \npayments. Now you have, under the new farm bill, direct payments. You \ndo not even have to plant in order to get your payment. You preserve \nyour history. But the limit there is on the direct payment, the money \nthat comes to you, the mailbox money, regardless of whether you plant \nor not plant. And there is a confusion there.\n  The loan program is a program which has been designed over the years \nto help temporarily. When a farmer says, ``All right, I need the money, \nI have to pay my bills, I put it in loan and therefore I take the \nchance. If the price goes up, I will sell it at the time I think is the \nmost appropriate time in order to sell.'' That is a loan basis.\n  In regards to this, we show over the years----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator is recognized for 30 \nadditional seconds.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, this chart shows the loan rate in blue \nover here. Throughout the years, the farmer's price, the market price \nhas always been above the loan rate. So it is a matter being confused \nrelative to this matter. Therefore, I urge that we vote against this \nmatter and not be confused.\n  New farmers are coming into the program all of the time, which shows \nthat 10,000 have come into the program over the last 10 years.\n  I thank the Chair for giving me the extra 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the reason the market price is always \nabove the quota price is because the peanut program is not just a price \nprogram, it is also a quota program. It limits the supply.\n  So, of course, the Secretary tells peanut growers how much they can \nplant, and they tell them to make sure that the demand is always higher \nthan the supply. Therefore, the price, yes, is always higher than the \nquota price because the program makes it that way. That is No. 1.\n  With respect to these deficiency payments, I would be happy to meet \nin the back with the Senator from Alabama and would be very willing to \nget rid of the loan program that peanuts have and turn it into a target \npricing scheme. I would love to do that. In fact, it has been offered \nmany times to the peanut growers to do that, but they don't do that. \nWhy? Because the system they have right now is so ridiculously \nlucrative, they would never opt for something like that.\n  Peanut quota holders get twice--twice--per ton for their peanuts than \nwhat the world market price is. They get almost $700 a ton for their \npeanuts, and the world price is $350 a ton. No wonder they don't want \nto go to a target pricing scheme or some other scheme. They have the \nbest deal in town.\n  What we want to do is say, ``OK, you've got the best deal in town.'' \nI can't beat him. The Senator from Alabama, bless his heart, whops me \nevery\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\ntime I come to the floor on this amendment. I say, if we are going to \nhave this program, at least limit the benefits to the folks who deserve \nthe benefits, and that is the small- and medium-size farmers. Quit \nsubsidizing, to the tune of--and there is a farm out there that gets $6 \nmillion of guaranteed prices, twice what the world market is for \npeanuts.\n  Now, is that what we want to do? Is that what this program is all \nabout? It certainly is not what the arguments of the folks who support \nthe peanut program are all about. What they say it is all about is \nhelping these small farmers, these poor dirt farmers in rural areas \nthat really need this to make ends meet.\n  Fine, this is not going to bother them. Mr. President, $125,000 is \nnot a small dirt farmer. That is about 150 to 200 acres. What we are \ntalking about here are the big guys, less than 2,000. I remind Senators \nthat 22 percent of the quota holders in peanuts own 80 percent of the \nquotas--22 percent, a little over 6,000 quota holders own 80 percent of \nthe poundage for peanuts. The big guys are what drive this program, who \nlobby here, who contribute the money.\n  What I am saying is let's get these big guys out of the picture and \nlet them divest from some of these quotas they hold and spread it \naround a little bit, give it to some of these additional growers who \nare dirt farmers who don't get a lot of money for their peanuts, let \nthem have a little bit of it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent for my additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let these little guys get a little piece \nof the pie here. If you are really for the small- and medium-size \npeanut farmer in Alabama or Georgia, then what you want to do is you \nwant these folks to divest from these big quotas and start spreading it \naround a little bit for the little guys to have a bite of the Federal \nlargess.\n  If we are going to have a Federal largess, at least let more people \nbenefit from it, let the little guy benefit. That is what this \namendment does, this is a vote for the little guy. It actually will \nexpand your base of support for the program and more will benefit from \nit.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, needless to say, I oppose both Senator \nSantorum's amendments, which are renewed assaults on the livelihoods of \nAmerica's family farmers who produce peanuts. I should reiterate that \nthere are more than 20,000 North Carolinians involved in various \naspects of the peanut industry.\n  We've been down this road time and time again, Mr. President. \nHowever, this time, even the fiercest critics of the peanut program \nshould acknowledge the extensive changes made by Congress in the 1996 \nfarm bill. The most important change was the conversion of the peanut \nprogram into a no-net cost commodity program.\n  Mr. President, the burden of these changes is being borne by \nAmerica's peanut farmers who understood the necessity of revamping the \nprogram in order for it to survive. The support price was cut by 10 \npercent, from $678 per ton to $610 and because of many other changes, \npeanut farmers anticipate that their incomes will decline by more than \n20 percent.\n  So clearly, Mr. President, America's peanut farmers have agreed to--\nindeed, participated in reforming the program that has served the \nconsumers of America so well. And, by the way, in North Carolina alone, \nthe peanut industry generates more than $100 million in revenue. \nMoreover, Mr. President, the American taxpayers will save more than \n$434 million as a result of the reforms in the program.\n  It is discouraging that opponents of the program, not satisfied with \nthe farm bill's reforms, now seek to go further in hindering peanut \nfarmers in making their livings.\n  As for the Santorum amendments, they will not--and cannot --guarantee \nlower prices to consumers. Instead, they will disrupt the work of \nCongress which constructed a farm program to produce a reasonable \nprice, an abundant supply, and the highest quality of peanuts in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, it was clearly established during the Agriculture \nCommittee's debates on the 1996 farm bill that even if the peanut \nprogram were to be abolished, candymakers would not reduce the price of \na candy bar, nor would the price of peanut butter be reduced by one red \ncent.\n  The pending after-the-fact amendments do not deserve serious \nconsideration. The Senate should reject them unhesitatingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to table amendment No. 4995. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4967\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous agreement, there are 2 minutes per \nside on amendment number 4967.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment that has \nnothing to do with the peanut program. This does not change the peanut \nprogram at all. This actually does not change anything in law. All this \namendment does is ask the Secretary of Agriculture to determine whether \nthe regulatory body that oversees the peanut program is in violation of \nthe Government ethics statute. That is all this amendment does.\n  Why do I ask the Secretary to do that? The reason I ask the Secretary \nto do that is, unlike virtually any other agriculture commodity \nprogram, the folks who oversee the program, who manage the loan \npolicies, who help promulgate the regulations, the very same people who \nregulate this program, who enforce the program, who actually impose \npenalties on the quota holders are, themselves, the quota holders. The \npeople who benefit from the program run the program. That is unlike any \nother program, with the exception of one, in this country.\n  What we want to do is simply ask the Secretary of Agriculture to \nexamine the applicable Federal statutes to determine whether there is a \nconflict of interest here, and then take action. Frankly, the reason I \nam here on the floor with this amendment, some additional growers out \nWest in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and a lot of other places, had \nasked the Secretary to make this determination 2 months ago. They asked \nhim in a letter. He has not responded to that letter. So what we are \ntrying to do is say, Mr. Secretary,\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nlet us look and see if there is a conflict of interest. We do not \nprejudge it. We ask them to examine to see whether this is a proper \nsetup for the regulation of this program. It does not change the \nprogram. It does not alter it in midstream. It simply asks the \nSecretary to take a look at a potential conflict of interest.\n\n  I hope we can get very strong support for this.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the largest law firm in Washington, DC, is \ntrying to have a lawsuit, and this is in connection with the lawsuit. \nIf there is any problem, it ought to be determined in the lawsuit. The \nDepartment, for years, has had participation by farmers in every phase \nof the program. You elected farm committeemen to the old ASCS, which is \nnow the Farmers' Service, and they carry out the program. They make \ndecisions in regard to it. The Soil Conservation Agency has district \ncommissioners that are elected, and they carry out the various \nprograms. That is nothing different.\n  The Department says this is unnecessary. They have, over the years, \ndeveloped guidelines to ensure that there is no conflict of interest. \nThis is just another attack on the peanut program with an effort to try \nto have a lawsuit, and these people have hired the biggest law firm in \nWashington to bring the lawsuit. They have filed a protest letter and \ninvolved that. The program is now in operation.\n  The farmers have gone to the bank, they have made their plans, and \nthey are moving forward. Now is not the time to change it. So I urge \nyou to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4972\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at this point we are prepared to move to \ntable the amendment previously offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada, [Mr. Bryan] on the Market Access program. My understanding \nwould be that there would be 2 minutes available equally divided for \ndiscussion of that before we actually go to a vote on the motion to \ntable.\n  With that understanding, I move to table the Bryan amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I reserve myself 1 \nminute, and I will yield the remaining minute to the distinguished \nranking member.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that has been before the Senate for a \nnumber of years. It deals with the program formerly known as the market \npromotion program, now referred to as market access program. This is a \nprogram in which taxpayer dollars are provided to some of the largest \ncorporations in America to subsidize their advertising account under \nthe dubious proposition that this is for export of American \nagricultural products abroad.\n  In February of this year, the Senate, by a vote of 59 to 37, approved \nan amendment which this Senator, together with the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas and others, offered that would limit the level of \nfunding, previously at $110 million, to $70 million, and we did so on \nthe basis that we were able to eliminate some $40 million that \npreviously had gone to foreign companies.\n  So the thrust of the Bryan-Bumpers amendment was to say that no \nlonger could this money be allocated to foreign companies and by reason \nof the fact that we eliminated foreign company allocations $70 million \nkept the program constant.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will support us as they did \nin February, and I simply say that this will keep the program level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The proposal before us is $90 million. That is a 29 \npercent increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is a motion that we have actually \nalready debated. Let me point out that under the farm bill there is a \nprescribed mandate for $90 million of funds to be allocated for this \nprogram. So unlike previous years, this is not a discretionary program \nany longer. The reforms that were made sought to address the complaints \nthat had been made about corporate welfare and all the other \nallegations in previous years, but those no longer lie against the \nprogram as it is operated now. Only trade associations and small \nbusinesses are entitled to funds under this program. They are allocated \nby the Foreign Agriculture Service. They help break down barriers to \nU.S. exports. They provide us access to markets that we would not have \notherwise. They are good for American jobs, the American economy. They \nhelp us export more of what we produce on our farms and in our \nfactories in foodstuffs and the like. All the testimony shows that this \nprogram is very helpful and needed, and I urge Senators to vote yea on \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Market Access Program [MAP] is \ncritical to the success of the 1996 farm bill and to continued \nagricultural growth. MAP is one of the few programs specifically \nallowed under the Uruguay Round agreement and not subject to any \nreduction. Many countries are increasingly pursuing policies to help \ntheir agricultural industries to maintain and expand their share of the \nworld market. Now is not the time for the United States to continue to \nunilaterally eliminate or reduce MAP.\n  MAP is a key to helping boost U.S. agricultural exports, \nstrengthening farm income, promoting economic growth and creating jobs. \nI urge your support to ensure programs such as MAP be fully funded. \nAgain, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the motion to table the \nBryan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the body is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table by the Senator from Mississippi. Those who are in \nfavor of that motion should vote yea. Those who are opposed to that \nmotion should vote nay. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         precision agriculture\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to stress the importance of ongoing \nresearch in the area of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is \nalso commonly referred to as site specific agriculture or intelligent \nfarm systems. Precision agriculture is an exciting area of agriculture \nthat enables farmers to produce in a manner that conserves fertilizer, \nenergy, fuel and water while still producing a high quality and high \nyield crop.\n  In a bill that Mr. McConnell recently introduced, precision \nagriculture is given additional attention. I commend Senator McConnell \nfor his efforts and note for the Record that myself, Senator Kempthorne \nand Senator Cochran are all original cosponsors. I ask Senator Cochran, \nis this his understanding?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, I am very supportive of precision agriculture and \nSenator McConnell's legislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in addition, I would like to clarify \nthe intentions of the Fund for Rural America [FRA] under the Federal \nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act. The FRA specifically designated \none-third of the funding go toward research, extension, and education \ngrants that, among other goals, will increase international \ncompetitiveness, efficiency, and farm profitability, and conserve and \nenhance natural resources. Further, the FRA research section clearly \nencourages interdepartment and interagency cooperation by allowing \nFederal agencies and national laboratories to be eligible. This is a \nsolid step toward making the most efficient use of limited Federal \nresearch resources, and will facilitate new and unique applications of \ntechnologies to the agriculture industries.\n  I would like to clarify that research to develop precision \nagriculture, to apply remote sensing and information management \ntechnologies to agriculture, is an example of the type of research that \nthe Secretary of Agriculture should support under the FRA. I ask the \nchairman, is that the case?\n  Mr. LUGAR. It is, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nfrom Idaho and Mississippi to find appropriate ways to support \ndevelopment of precision agriculture.\n\n\n                          Value-Added Products\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, South Dakota farmers and ranchers are \nlooking to value-added products as one way to better market their \ncommodities and products. By adding value to the basic commodity, \nfarmers and ranchers can realize higher prices and improved income. \nThis is being witnessed for all of agriculture, from grain farmers to \nlivestock producers.\n  South Dakota is a leading State in finding innovative ways to add \nvalue to agricultural products. For example, South Dakota is a leader \nin the production of ethanol and more ethanol facilities are being \nplanned to be built in South Dakota.\n  By the end of the year a new soybean processing plant will begin \nproduction in a new facility in Volga, SD. Currently there are serious \nnegotiations underway for a new beef packing plant which would service \nSouth Dakota and regional livestock producers.\n  Another venture in western South Dakota is a plan for the Nation's \nfirst lamb packing facility that would combine slaughtering, breaking, \npacking, and shipping under one roof. The facility would provide fresh \nlamb products to wholesalers and distributors within the food industry. \nThe facility would be called Monument Meats and be located in Belle \nFourche, SD.\n  This effort would be a producer cooperative where producers would be \ncontracted to provide lambs. The facility, when completed, would \ninclude and incorporate the suppliers of lamb with the distributors of \nthe final product into the overall process of the proposed facility.\n\n  One area where Federal taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent is the \nRural Business Enterprise Grants Program. These grants can be used to \nfinance and facilitate development of small and emerging business \nenterprises. Promotion and support of a viable U.S. lamb industry by \nestablishing the proposed facility would certainly meet the objectives \nof these grants.\n  The proposed lamb processing facility for Belle Fourche, SD, \ncertainly meets the test of a promising breakthrough in promoting U.S. \nlamb production. A key role of the Federal Government is to promote \ninnovative and new business opportunities. A $50,000 grant for a \nfeasibility study of the proposed lamb processing plant would be \nhelpful to demonstrate to producers and distributors the benefits that \ncould be accrued from such a facility.\n  Supporters of this facility are only looking for assistance from the \nFederal Government just for the feasibility study. Once completed, \nthere are no intentions of further requests for Federal funding. This \nseems to me to be a worthwhile investment.\n  If I could, I would like to ask a few questions to my distinguished \ncolleague from Mississippi, the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture.\n  I recognize that the bill currently under consideration does not \ncontain funding for a feasibility study for the lamb processing plant \nconceived to be built in Belle Fourche, SD. However, is it the \nchairman's belief that this is the type of venture where rural business \nenterprise grants could come into play?\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Is it also correct to say that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture could utilize this type of grant to establish value-added \nprocessing plants in the United States, like the one planned for in \nBelle Fourche, SD?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Finally, I would like to ask the chairman if he would \nwork with me to secure future funding for a feasibility study to be \ndone for a lamb processing facility in Belle Fourche, SD.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will continue working with my colleague from South \nDakota to find funding for projects like the proposed lamb processing \nfacility in South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my colleague and friend.\n  Again, Mr. President, the proposed lamb processing plant can bring \nhigher prices to lamb producers. The facility can bring economic growth \nand jobs to the community of Belle Fourche, SD. Finally, the facility \ncan go a long way to promote the entire U.S. lamb industry. I will \ncontinue working to secure $50,000 for a Federal feasibility study for \nthis much needed project.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are working to accommodate Senators by\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nworking on amendments that have been proposed that we hope can be \nresolved without rollcall votes. There are some which may require a \nrollcall vote if Senators insist on a vote.\n  Senator Bumpers and I are here and available to discuss these \nproposals. We hope those who want to offer their amendments will come \nforward. We would like to complete action on this bill. I suggest this \nis a good time to resolve differences, if we can, and then proceed to \nvote on those we can't agree on and finish the bill. We are not going \nto stay in all afternoon sitting and waiting. For those who want to \npresent amendments, we will offer them for you and vote on them, and \nthen we can get to the end of the bill, if we can get the cooperation \nof Senators at an early time this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I don't have anything to add to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi said. It is very frustrating, \nfrankly, to sit here hoping somebody will show up with an amendment you \nknow has an amendment and is going to come charging in at the last \nminute if you try to go to third reading.\n  So we have about four amendments here, and I might just mention, \nthere is a Mikulski amendment on crab meat study by FDA, which I think \nis agreeable; there is a Wellstone amendment on wild rice under the \nfarm bill of last year, which I think has been agreed to; there is an \nemergency drought assistance and Hurricane Bertha assistance by Senator \nDomenici, which I think has been cleared on both sides; Senator Lugar \non double cropping. I am told that is not quite worked out. The Brown \namendment I think has about been worked out. A Hatfield amendment on \nrural development has been worked out.\n\n  So we can offer those on behalf of those people if they do not want \nto offer them themselves. But I would like for those people to know \nthat they need to get over here. If they have been cleared, they need \nto offer them unless they want to bring them to us and let us offer \nthem for them.\n  The amendments that are probably going to require rollcall votes are \none by Senator Kennedy dealing with Medguide. I do not know if Senator \nSantorum has any more peanut amendments or not. I understand he had \neight. He has offered two so far. But anyway, the Kennedy amendment, an \namendment by Senator Simpson dealing with wetlands, an amendment by \nSenator Leahy on northeast forestry, and the barley amendment by the \nSenators from North Dakota. So that leaves us about four amendments \nthat could possibly require rollcalls unless we get them worked out.\n  But if we can get those we have agreed on passed, and which will just \nleave us those four that could require rollcall votes, we ought to be \nthrough here by close to the middle of the afternoon or late afternoon. \nSo with that admonition and plea to our colleagues to get over here to \noffer their amendments, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8583-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8593-S8594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1936\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I indicate to the majority leader that this \nhas been cleared on this side of the aisle. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take but a brief moment. Let me \nthank the majority leader and our colleagues from Nevada for the kind \nof work that has produced this unanimous-consent agreement. I trust now \nthat we will be able to move expeditiously on the issue of nuclear \nwaste.\n  While it is an issue of great contention on the part of some of our \nMembers--and certainly our colleagues from Nevada have great concern \nabout what ultimately occurs here--I think we have, with this UC, an \nopportunity for a final conclusion and to express the will of the \nSenate--and, hopefully, the House--on an issue that is of national \nimportance. I thank the Senators for their cooperation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to add, as chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee, my satisfaction with the \nnegotiations. I know the agony associated with this issue relative to \nNevada. Unfortunately, we simply have to put this waste somewhere, and \nthis question will now be resolved with a vote, at least in this body. \nI think, further, the willingness to try and work toward a solution \nenables the majority leader to move on with the business of the Senate, \nrather than tie it up in an extended filibuster, which, obviously, \nevery Member has a right to proceed with. Nevertheless, we have a \nresponsibility to resolve these issues in a manner that suggests some \nexpeditious process.\n  I thank the Senators for their cooperation, ensuring that they will \nleave no stone unturned to pursue their convictions, but yet allowing \nthe Senate majority leader to proceed. That is indicative of not just \ntheir good nature, but a recognition of what this body is all about.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to make certain. No objection was \nheard, so the agreement was reached, is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, if I could briefly say something. I \nwant to personally extend my appreciation to our leader, who spent a \ngreat deal of time with the majority leader trying to work this out. I \nthink it shows good faith that we are trying to move things over here. \nWe feel comfortable with the agreement and especially appreciate the \nwork of the leadership.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there was no objection heard, is \nthat correct? Has this been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to thank all the parties involved, including the two \nSenators from Nevada, for their fairness and knowing how important this \nis to them, and for the involvement of the Senators from Alaska and \nIdaho, for their work.\n  My colleague from Nevada is absolutely right to say that Senator \nDaschle was helpful in this. In fact, he first initiated the idea on \nhow this might be handled. It took a lot of discussion and coordination \non your part.\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\n He has been involved in a constructive way.

The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5002, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in discussing the Brown amendment on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, the junior Senator from Nebraska had \nrecommended that we go with the modified version instead of the 5-year \nmoratorium I suggested. He suggested a 2-month moratorium with an \nallowance for an additional time period in the event that there were \ndelays in the process. So I have incorporated that aspect into my \namendment and go from 5 years down to the 2 months, plus the additional \ntime.\n  In addition, the senior Senator from Nebraska has suggested that we \nmodify the provision regarding funding by the Secretary of Agriculture \nso that the funding relates to an amount which he feels is appropriate. \nThat is very open-ended language and not very tight. But I must say \nthat I have a great deal of confidence and faith in the Secretary of \nAgriculture and in his sense of fairness.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be modified to \nincorporate those changes which I filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5002), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . INTERIM MORATORIUM ON BYPASS FLOWS.\n\n       ``(a) Moratorium.--Section 389(a) of P.L. 104-127 is \n     amended by striking ``an 18-month'' after the word ``be'' and \n     inserting ``a 20-month''.\n       ``(b) Report.--Section 389(d)(4) of P.L. 104-127 is amended \n     by striking ``1 year'' after the word ``than'' and inserting \n     ``14 months''.\n       ``(c) Extension for Delay.--Section 389 of P.L. 104-127 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       `` `(e) Extension for Delay.--There shall be a day-for-day \n     extension to the 20-month moratorium required by subsection \n     (a) and a day-for-day extension to the report required by \n     subsection (d)(4)--\n       `` `(1) for every day of delay in implementing or \n     establishing the Water Rights Task Force caused by a failure \n     to nominate Task Force members by the Administration or by \n     the Congress; or\n       `` `(2) for every day of delay caused by a failure by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to identify adequate resources as \n     determined by the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the \n     purposes of the Task Force.' ''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, while neither \nNebraska Senators now have concerns about the amendment--or perhaps I \nshould say will not object to the amendment--the senior Senator from \nVermont does not want it passed prior to an amendment which he will \noffer.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be ordered and that \nthe timing of the amendment be set at such time as the ranking Member \nand the chairman of the subcommittee would recommend to the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak to an issue that is \nincluded in the agricultural appropriations bill that deals with public \nhealth, and address the Senate for a short time this afternoon. I would \nthen like to introduce the amendment that deals with that particular \nissue and then to move on from there.\n  The legislation before us includes a proposal to cripple the FDA's \nability to protect the public against one of the most costly and deadly \ntragedies suffered by Americans. Every year millions--millions--of our \nfellow citizens are injured or killed by this silent epidemic. It \nresults in over 2 million Americans being hospitalized each and every \nyear. It results in 3 million Americans having to visit their doctor \neach and every year for problems that could be avoided. It costs the \nAmerican economy an estimated $100 billion--$100 billion--a year in \nadditional health costs and lost productivity.\n  What is this epidemic? It is a wave of illnesses, injuries, and even \ndeaths caused by prescription drugs. Millions of Americans are affected \nand billions of dollars are spent on medical problems caused by \nprescription drugs. The Nation spends as much to cure the illnesses \ncaused by prescription drugs as we spend on the drugs themselves.\n  The vast majority of these adverse drug reactions can be avoided if \npatients have basic information about the prescription drugs they are \ntaking. That information will allow patients to understand the proper \nuse of the drugs their doctors prescribe. It will alert them to the \nsymptoms of adverse reactions that can occur with their medication. \nThis basic information would be a written reminder of what doctors tell \ntheir patients when the drug is prescribed. That information is often \nhard to remember, often not followed, and often misunderstood.\n  We should do all we can to end these tragic, costly, and unnecessary \nillnesses, injuries, and deaths. Who can be against providing patients \nwith basic information about the prescription drugs they take? \nUnfortunately, a powerful group of special interests has been fighting \nfor two decades to prevent patients from getting this basic \ninformation. They have been fighting for almost 20 years to prevent \npatients from getting the information that could prevent needless \ninjuries, illnesses, and deaths.\n  The latest battle in this long war by the special interests is this \nappropriations bill. Buried on page 58 of this 81-page bill is a \nprovision that prohibits the FDA from assuring that drugstores and \npharmaceutical companies provide their customers with the simple, basic \ninformation they need to protect themselves against drug-induced \nillnesses.\n  This provision would forbid FDA from going forward with a proposed \nregulation, called the medication guidance regulation, which would \nrequire that patients receive adequate information when they fill a \nprescription. The Food and Drug Administration is America's premier \nconsumer protection agency. It has been working with private industry \nfor many years to implement a program to achieve this objective. Time \nand time again, for more than 17 years, private industry has promised \nto get that information to patients. It has promised to stop these \nmillions of needless injuries, illness, and deaths. It has promised to \nprevent these unnecessary hospitalizations and doctors' visits.\n  But, year after year, as millions of individuals are injured and \nbillions of dollars are wasted, these tragedies continue. Why? Because \nall of these promises have been broken.\n  So, these tragedies continue, even though it costs only a few cents \nper prescription to add this basic information. Rather than spend a few \ncents per prescription, these special interests cause billions of \ndollars in tragedies year-in and year-out. Time and again, they put \nprofit and self-interest ahead of public health.\n  As the result of these efforts the FDA is being muzzled by an unholy \nalliance\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\nof drugstores and pharmaceutical companies. And, the patients are the \nlosers. This provision is nothing more than a gag order preventing the \nFDA from making sure that patients get basic, minimal information about \nthe prescription drugs they are taking. We are no longer in the dark \nages when people mistakenly believed that patients needed to be \nprotected from basic medical information.\n  It is almost inconceivable, Mr. President, but going back to the \nethical statute of the Royal College of Physicians in 1555:\n\n       Let no physician teach the people about medicines or even \n     tell them the names of the medicines, particularly the more \n     potent ones such as purgatives, opiates, narcotics, \n     abortifacients, emetics or any other which are particularly \n     dangerous: For the people may be harmed by their improper \n     use. This under the penalty of 40 shillings.\n\n  That used to be the old method, deny individuals and consumers \ninformation about the types of treatment they were receiving.\n  Then as recently as 1934 a statement published in the Federal \nRegister, stated that drug labeling should be written ``* * * only in \nsuch medical terms as are not likely to be understood by the ordinary \nindividual.'' I repeat, that was in 1934.\n  We have transitioned a long way. The American consumer wants to know \nwhat they are ingesting, what is going into their bodies. They want to \nknow about the food they eat. They want to know about the air they \nbreathe and the water they drink. They want to know about prescription \ndrugs. They want to know about over-the-counter drugs. It is a bygone \nday when we should deny the American consumer the best information that \nwe have available. That is really what this issue is all about. Are we \ngoing to make sure that, for each and every prescription drug, the \nindividual is going to get the best information that is available. They \nneed this information in order to know how take their prescription \ndrugs safely and to know if they are going to interact with any other \ntypes of prescription or over-the-counter drugs that they may be \ntaking?\n  As billions of dollars are wasted each year, as millions of Americans \nare needlessly hospitalized each year, as millions of patients suffer \nadverse reactions each year, these special interests claim that their \nvoluntary efforts are adequate to protect consumers. The body count \ngoes up, but they claim that they have been doing all that is \nnecessary.\n  But, their claims are false, and they know it. The clear facts show \nthat Americans do not get enough information about the prescriptions \nthey are taking. We know that because the hospitalizations, the \ndoctors' visits, the injuries, the illnesses, and the deaths continue. \nThose are facts that the special interests do not want to talk about.\n  But the problem is even worse than that. American consumers get more \ninformation from a box of cereal than they do from the prescription \ndrugs they buy. In fact, almost half of all consumers get no written \ninformation at all of the kind they need to use their prescriptions \nproperly. And when the information is provided, it is too often \ninadequate or incomplete.\n  Approximately half of all consumers get some form of information. \nHalf of them do not. But of the 50 percent that do, much of the \ninformation is incomplete. We have waited for industry to present their \nplans for providing this important information to the consumer: this is \nexactly what the Food and Drug Administration had requested. Industry \nwas to voluntarily create a system and be able to show that 75 percent \nof prescription drug consumers received reliable information by the \nyear 2000 and, hopefully 95 percent by the year 2006.\n  The Food and Drug Administration was going to make an assessment of \nthe progress in the year 2000 and decide if additional steps were \nneeded or if the industry should just continue with their efforts. The \nhope was that industry would provide this program voluntarily. But as \nyou can see by the information presented here, the needed information \nis not forthcoming. This bill allows industry to continue as is and \nwould not allow the Food and Drug Administration to meaningfully \nevaluate the process of information flow to consumers.\n  The Food and Drug Administration looked at the information that was \nprovided to drug stores by eight commercial vendors. Drug stores that \nwant to provide information to their customers can buy information \nsystems from such commercial vendors. The FDA examined the information \nthat these eight vendors provided on three commonly prescribed drugs: a \nsedative, an antibiotic, and a drug used to treat high blood pressure.\n  While there are a number of vendors, for this study, the FDA selected \neight of the better ones.\n  Remember, we are talking about common medications that can result in \nlife-threatening complications. We are talking about providing people \nwith basic information and warnings that the drug that they are about \nto take could result in serious birth defects or could cause a fatal \nallergic reaction.\n  Mr. President, these drugs each have potentially dangerous side \neffects. One of these drugs can cause severe birth defects, but only \nfour of the eight vendors even warned about use in pregnancy. And only \none vendor commented on birth defects when that was the real danger.\n  One drug, the antibiotic, has the potential of causing a fatal \nallergic reaction. While six of the eight vendors provided information \non the possibility of an allergic reaction, only one told ``What to do \nif an allergic reaction occurs.''\n  There were eight sources. This scorecard on this chart should have \nread ``8,8,8,8,8'' all the way down. That is the only score that should \nbe acceptable. For each one of these three commonly used medications, \nthey ought to provide the appropriate warnings about side effects, \ncontraindications, the possibility of serious drug reactions. Anything \nless is unacceptable.\n  This is one of the more recent studies done by the FDA on the \nadequacy or inadequacy of information provided on important, commonly \nused prescription drugs. I remind you, for half of the prescription \ndrugs no information is provided; while information is provided for the \nother half, this is an example of what that information may be.\n  Let me show you a specific example. This is a prescription for a drug \ncalled Macrobid, which is an antibiotic used for chronic therapy.\n  On the left is an enlargement of the information that one patient \nreceived when she had this prescription filled. It sounds pretty simple \nand certainly safe. It says, ``Take one capsule twice a day with food \nfor 30 days. Then decrease dose to one capsule once a day. Take with \nfood to lessen stomach upset. Must use for full length of treatment. \nMay interfere with urine glucose test in diabetics.''\n  But is something missing? Is there information that is generally \navailable and scientifically sound that would be of value to any \nconsumer? What is missing is the fact that this drug is contraindicated \nin term pregnancies and during labor and delivery. If a baby is exposed \nto this drug during such time, there is the possibility of \nprecipitating a rapid destruction of red blood cells that could be \nfatal for the baby.\n  So if a pregnant woman were taking this drug, she should know that if \nshe takes it in the last stages of pregnancy or during labor and \ndelivery she is risking the health of her child.\n  It is contraindicated in mothers who are breastfeeding infants less \nthan 1 month of age. The drug gets into the breast milk and causes the \nsame destruction of red blood cells.\n  Here you see it is also contraindicated in people with G6PD \ndeficiency. G6PD deficiency is a type of blood disorder, reasonably \nrare, but nonetheless noteworthy. If you take this medicine and you \nhave this kind of blood disorder, you may experience a fatal hemolytic \nanemia which is the breakdown of red blood cells. So this would \nobviously be valuable information for a patient who knows they have \nG6PD deficiency.\n  This drug can also cause lung disease. ``Should consult your \nphysician in the event of pulmonary symptoms.'' Physicians suggest that \npatients who take this drug for more than 6 months should have routine \nlung examinations.\n\n  This is the kind of information that should be available. This is the \nkind of information that could easily be available. We are not talking \nabout overly extensive pages of data. We are talking\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nabout the kind of information that is readily available and accessible \nto both the company and to the FDA. This is the kind of information \nthat is not being routinely provided today on these prescription drugs.\n  What is it that the FDA thinks is necessary? Here is a prototype \ndesigned by the FDA which includes the information they believe the \nconsumer should be told. This one uses Cardizem, as an example. This \nprovides all the information. We have it blown up here. ``What is the \nmost important information that I should know about Cardizem?''\n  ``Used to treat angina pectoris--chest pain. May lower blood \npressure. If you get dizzy while using, call your doctor. Can interact \nwith certain medications. Check with your doctor if using beta blocker, \ndigitalis. If you notice very low heart rate, palpitations or feel very \nweak, call your doctor.''\n  Then there is a description of what Cardizem is. It is a relaxant \nthat dilates blood vessels in the body, increases blood flow to the \nheart and helps reduce chest plain. A drug known as calcium channel \nblockers.\n  It has, ``Who should not take it?'' It indicates if you have heart \nproblems, your doctor needs to know. If you have low blood pressure or \nheart block, a pacemaker, heart failure or any other heart problem; if \nyou have liver or kidney problems, your doctor needs to know. If you \nare pregnant--the use of Cardizem in pregnant women has not been \nstudied. Studies with animals suggest, however, that Cardizem may cause \nmiscarriages.\n  So it points out if you have a heart problem, if you have liver or \nkidney problems or if you are expecting you should not take this \nmedication. And it also says, ``If you are nursing, Cardizem is passed \non through the breast milk. If you take, use some form of infant \nfeeding.'' Change from breast to infant feeding.\n  Then it talks about how I should take Cardizem. ``Take before meal, \nif possible. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. However, \nif it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take \nyour medicine as scheduled. Do not take double your prescribed dose.''\n  This is very important. Many people, when they are on prescription \ndrugs, will fail to take it at the time prescribed, and they wonder \nwhether they ought to double up. Maybe they forget for a day, maybe \nthey forget to take a morning, noon or evening dose, and they wonder, \n``Should I take it double tomorrow because I forgot to take \ntoday.'' Say I forget this morning's dose? Do I take two this \nafternoon? And this tells what to do if you do miss a dose.\n\n  ``What should I avoid taking with Cardizem?'' It interacts with other \nmedications. Your doctor may need to change the dosage for the \nmedicine. Check with your doctor before taking the beta blocker drugs, \nulcer drugs, and digitalis for heart failure.\n  So it mentions the types of health challenges that you might face, \nthe sort of chronic problems that you might face, it gives you a \nwarning and a heads up. And then it talks about other types of \nmedicines that would have an adverse reaction.\n  ``What are the side effects?'' It gets into the side effects. The \nswelling of the legs, headache, rash, weakness, a small number, less \nthan a half-percent get heart palpitations. So it says, ask your doctor \nif you have difficulty breathing or have dizziness. This goes on. This \nis the type of information that we are talking about. This is \nscientific information presented to consumers in readable, \nunderstandable form that responds, by and large, to the everyday kind \nof questions that a consumer would have with regard to this particular \nmedication.\n  I think all of us have seen the information for over-the-counter \ndrugs. You know, the insert for Tylenol, Excedrin. Very few people, \nunless you are a chemist, can really understand it. That is not what we \nare talking about here. We are talking about valuable, readable \ninformation that could be of such great importance to consumers.\n  It is readable. It is understandable. And it is enormously valuable \nfor patients. And yet, 50 percent of the American people do not get \nthis kind of information. And the other 50 percent, in too many \ninstances, get information that is inadequate.\n  This is the type of thing that we want to encourage. We want the \nindustry to do this in a voluntary way. As I say, they are doing 50 \npercent now. We were hopeful to get them to 75 percent, working with \nthe industry, working with the FDA to permit them to move through that \nprocess by the year 2000.\n  So this provision of the pending bill tells patients--the provision I \nmentioned earlier--that they do not need these warnings. All they need \nis to trust the industry to take care of them. But the industry is not \nproviding the warnings, is not telling the patients the drug they are \nabout to take will cause a serious birth defect or fatal allergic \nreaction.\n  The industry promised for years to provide the patients with the \ninformation. There are many, many examples of why industry cannot be \ntrusted to do what is right.\n  In 1992 the FDA required a box warning--those are the warnings that \nare printed on the various boxes, the most serious kinds of warnings--\non the labeling provided doctors and pharmacies for Seldane and \nHismanal, two of the most popular prescription antihistamines for \nallergies. When taken in association with certain antibiotics or \nantifungals, which are two other classes of frequently prescribed \ndrugs, there were deaths and serious cardiovascular reactions.\n  Let me tell you about one 29-year-old woman who was taking Seldane \nfor allergies. She went to her podiatrist for athlete's foot and was \ngiven a prescription for Ketoconazole. Two days later she went to an \nemergency room complaining of a blackout. They could find nothing wrong \nwith her, told her to return if it happened again. The next morning she \nwas found dead in bed. Apparently, the cause of death was cardiac \narrhythmia and death. The blackout episodes were most likely caused by \narrhythmias.\n  If she was given patient labeling, she could have easily identified \nthe warning against using the two drugs together. Her death was \npreventable.\n  The needed warnings even appeared in FDA-approved consumer \nadvertising in magazines, such as People, Newsweek and Time.\n  Here in the Washington Post, on April 16, 1996 it talks about a \nwarning: ``Seldane and Popular Antibiotics Equals Trouble.'' And the \npoint of this chart, Mr. President, is this:\n\n       American pharmacists fill about 2 billion prescriptions a \n     year, and the market is more complex than ever, with more \n     diseases treated by multiple drugs. Retail pharmacists \n     have more financial incentive to sell prescriptions than \n     to spend time talking to customers about possible drug \n     interactions,'' Shulke said.\n       They rely increasingly on computer programs to catch \n     potentially dangerous drug interactions. Unfortunately, \n     ``these software programs are lagging behind the state of the \n     art'' and fail to keep up with [the] latest Food and Drug \n     Administration and pharmaceutical [company] warnings.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Much of the information that doctors and patients receive \n     about drugs comes from the companies themselves. Such \n     information, while useful, tends to present ``one side of the \n     story''--emphasizing the benefits of medications more than \n     the risks.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is something that was pointed out. This is by \nthe pharmacists themselves, the American Pharmaceutical Association. \nThe Director of Policy and Regulatory Affairs made those observations.\n  All of us would believe that when a prescription drug is given, that \nthe patient has the best protection because he or she has the doctor. I \nthink all of us understand that. We have come to rely on that doctor. \nThe doctor is not going to obviously put this person at risk. But what \nwe are finding out, what every indication is, particularly with elderly \npeople, is that people either forget after a few days, a week, a month, \nseveral months, they get easily confused between various different \nkinds of information that they may have been told or that they have \nforgotten, all against a background where that kind of information is \neasily available, accessible, and understandable and should be provided \nto the consumer.\n  The warnings against taking these drugs in combination did not appear \non the information sheets that pharmacists gave to consumers. Consumers \nwere given better information in magazine ads than they were given by \nthe pharmacists who dispensed their prescriptions.\n  Even today, after concerted efforts to educate physicians and \npharmacists\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nabout the dangers of prescribing Seldane with certain antibiotics, tens \nof thousands of patients are still given coprescriptions written in \nconjunction with one of those antibiotics.\n  We have been promised that the pharmaceutical industry and retail \npharmacies will take care of keeping the public informed. What is \nhappening in the Washington, DC, area? Well, Dr. Woolsey from \nGeorgetown recently completed a study. Fifty pharmacies were selected \nout of the yellow pages. An investigator was sent to each of these \nstores with a prescription of Seldane and Erythromycin. Thirty-four of \nthe pharmacies either refused to fill them or warned that the two drugs \nshould not be taken together. But 16, or nearly a third, filled both \nprescriptions without any comment or warning, the very kind of \nsituation we are talking about here.\n  A third of the pharmacies issued both of these drugs even though \nthere are these extraordinary dangers. And 14 of those were asked if \nthere were any problems taking the two drugs together. Nine said they \ncould be taken together--that there was no problem.\n  Only nine of the prescriptions were accompanied by a written note \nsuggesting a patient check with a doctor if these two drugs were taken \ntogether or to ``report any other drugs you take or disease you have.''\n  These are the warnings we have for a fatal reaction. Think of the \ninformation we would get for reactions that merely cause disease or \ndiscomfort.\n  Yet the current underlying legislation will allow industry to \nindependently provide this information. This is the same industry that \nhas so overtly failed in just this one situation of the fatal reaction \nof Seldane and Erythromycin. I ask you, how often have you been on an \nantihistamine and an antibiotic at the same time? What about your \nchildren?\n  So the rollcall of patients harmed or injured because they did not \nreceive adequate warnings is a long one, and includes children and \nadults from every walk of life. Senior citizens, as I mentioned, are \nparticularly victimized. The best estimate is 17 percent of all \nhospital admissions for senior citizens is as a result of an adverse \ndrug reaction, about 5 percent for children. But no American can be \nconfident that a member of their family will not be the next to suffer.\n  Let me give you several examples.\n  A 69-year-old man was prescribed an antibiotic called Cipro to treat \na kidney infection. He took the pills for 10 days and failed to notice \nany improvement. When he returned to his physician, a repeat urine \nculture showed that the infection was still present. The physician \nchanged it to another antibiotic.\n  The problem was not the antibiotic. This man was also taking Maalox \nfor indigestion, which he had not been told that Maalox or other \nantacids prevent the antibiotic Cipro from being absorbed. Even though \nhe was swallowing the right dose, not enough entered the bloodstream.\n  This should have been included on a drug information sheet.\n  A 48-year-old man was diagnosed as having a mild form of diabetes \nwhich can be treated by taking pills that will lower the amount of \nsugar in the blood. He had been taking these pills for 4 months. During \nthat time his physician had changed the dose in order to maintain a \ngood blood sugar level. He had been stable without any change in dosage \nfor 2 months.\n  Then one day he twisted his ankle. To treat the pain he started \ntaking Advil every 4 to 6 hours. The next morning he awoke feeling \nsweaty and light-headed and fainted as he got out of bed. He was rushed \nto the hospital where his blood sugar was measured at an extremely low \nlevel.\n  This man should have been warned that Advil and other related drugs \nincrease the effect of the diabetes medication he was taking. What had \nbeen a good dose of medication in the past now lowered his blood sugar \nlevel to a dangerous level.\n  This should have been included on a drug information sheet.\n  A 58-year-old man who was otherwise very healthy developed diarrhea \nand abdominal cramping. He was diagnosed as having irritable bowel \nsyndrome and was placed on a strong tranquilizer medication to calm \ndown his intestines. Six months after being on this medication, he \ndeveloped the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. His doctor started him \non a medication for Parkinson's disease.\n  For 7 years, he took both drugs. Then a neurologist specializing in \nParkinson's disease evaluated him and recognized that the real problem \nwas the tranquilizer. Both drugs were discontinued.\n  Four months after seeing the neurologist, this man was on no \nmedication and all of the Parkinson's symptoms had disappeared.\n  This man suffered from a side effect of the tranquilizer. The \nneurologist who made the correct diagnosis says that in 3 years he had \nseen 38 other patients who had drug-induced Parkinson's disease.\n  A 60-year-old woman was started on a drug called propranolol to treat \nher high blood pressure. The physician had prescribed a large dose \nconsidering her age and her size.\n  Two days after starting the drug she began feeling very weak. This \ngot worse and on the third day she went to the emergency room where on \narrival her pulse rate was only 36 beats per minute. This low heart \nrate was a result of the propranolol.\n  If she had received an adequate drug information guide, she would \nhave recognized that her symptoms were likely a response to the \nmedication, and she could have called her physician rather than going \nto an emergency room. She was lucky. If she had any heart disease, \nlowering her heart rate to such a level could have produced severe \nheart failure.\n  Mr. President, the list goes on. Leaving out critical warnings is \nunacceptable. In these types of life-and-death cases, FDA oversight is \nclearly warranted. The health and lives of too many patients is at \nstake.\n  FDA has rightly decided consumers deserve more protection than the \nstatus quo. The medguide regulation is intended to correct this gross \ndeficiency in our consumer protection laws.\n  Today, we go into a supermarket to buy a loaf of bread, a carton of \nmilk, or a box of cereal. Complete nutritional information is provided \non the package. Here we have the package label for Wheaties, \n``Breakfast of Champions.'' We see that, under the Food and Labeling \nAct we passed just a few years ago, we have the calories, total fat, \ncholesterol, sodium, potassium, all of the vitamins that are listed, \nthe carbohydrates. All of this is printed in an easily and \nunderstandable form that is welcomed by every mother, every parent, \nevery child.\n  When we buy over-the-counter drugs like aspirin or Tylenol, the FDA \nregulations require the drugs to have complete information, so those \nwho take the pills understand what they are taking, how to take them, \nwhat side effects to watch out for, and what food or drugs it interacts \nwith. Anyone who goes to the drugstore this afternoon will find that \ninformation available.\n  But, if we buy a prescription drug in the pharmacy of one of these \nsame grocery stores, there is no guarantee that we will get the same \nkind of information when the prescription is filled. Current laws \nrequire more information about breakfast cereals than about dangerous \nprescription drugs, even though the necessary information can be \nprovided simply and cheaply.\n  The results of this neglect are predictable and shocking. Mr. \nPresident, 30 to 50 percent of adult patients do not use their \nmedications properly. In children, improper use exceeds 50 percent. \nJust look at this dog food label, Alpo puppy food. Friskies Alpo puppy \nfood has all the information--protein, fat, fiber, moisture, calcium, \nphosphorous. It lists the various ingredients and how the minerals and \nvitamins have been added, talks about the weight and age of the dog, \ntalks about recommended amounts and how many different feedings ought \nto be included. We provide it on dog food, cat foot, pet food. We \nprovide it at the grocery store on the box of cereal and just about \nevery other item in the grocery store under the food labeling \nprovisions. We provide it for over-the-counter drugs. But the one area \nwhere we do not provide assurance is in the prescription drugs.\n  The FDA is attempting to provide and encourage the industry to get to \n75 percent information by the year 2000--not by requiring--by working \nwith them. We have seen the attempt in the\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate of the United States to bar \nthat type of action. That is not acceptable.\n  Mr. President, in the elderly, who rely most heavily on medication, \nnoncompliance is often higher. They do not often understand the \nproblems of missing doses or changing doses. This is more dramatic in \nlow-income elderly. There are economically induced compliance problems, \nand patients sometimes attempt to stretch their medication by cutting \nback on their required daily dose. They have not been warned such \naction endangers their health.\n  You cannot have a meeting with senior citizens in any part of this \ncountry without, when you ask them how many spend $25 or more per month \non prescription drugs, 80 percent of their hands going up. Ask who \nspends $50 or $75 a month, and a third of the hands go up that are \ntaking prescription drugs. In many instances, there are a number of \nseniors who are dividing those prescription drugs to make them last \nover a longer period of time and who have no understanding or awareness \nof what that is doing in terms of endangering their health.\n  The patients taking medications are not the only losers. Public \nhealth is put at risk if uncured infections are transmitted and \nresistant infections develop.\n  The economic and human costs are staggering: 2 million avoidable \nhospitalizations, 3 million avoidable doctor visits, $20 billion in \nadditional health care costs, and $100 billion in total costs to \nsociety. The need for action is clear, yet this legislation will stop \nthe FDA from doing what is needed. Here it is, $20 billion, \neffectively, for avoidable hospital admissions because of adverse drug \nuse--$20 billion a year. The best estimate is that it is $100 billion \nin terms of either direct or indirect costs. It has health implications \nand cost implications in terms of individuals and the community.\n  The medication guidelines this legislation would block would \nestablish concrete goals for industry to meet. By the end of the year \n2000, FDA seeks to ensure that at least 75 percent of patients with new \nprescriptions would obtain adequate, useful, easily understood written \ninformation. By the year 2006, 95 percent of patients with new \nprescriptions would receive this information. There is nothing radical \nabout these targets. They are the same commonsense objectives \nestablished in the landmark ``Healthy People 2000'' goals developed \nunder the Reagan-Bush administrations.\n  Working with drug companies, pharmacists, physicians, and consumers, \nFDA was planning to establish nonbinding guidelines on such \ninformation. These guidelines will help pharmacies ensure that the \nwritten information they provide is adequate.\n  If the goals in the proposed regulation are not met, FDA would have a \nchoice--either institute a mandatory program or seek public comment on \nwhat steps to take next.\n  This approach is reasonable. It gives the private sector the \nopportunity to achieve compliance without regulatory requirements over \nthe next 4 years. Yet the industry still objects. It claims that \nneither the medguide regulation nor binding requirements are necessary.\n  Inadvertent misuse of prescription drugs is not a new problem. FDA \nfirst starting tackling the problem on a broad scale in the mid-1970's.\n  In 1975, after examining the issue in-depth by studying existing \nlabels, interviewing consumers, conferring with experts in the \ndifferent health care fields, FDA published a notice in the Federal \nRegister asking for public comments to help formulate a policy on \npatient labeling for prescription drugs.\n  In 1979, the FDA issued a proposed regulation to require drug \nmanufacturers to write patient labeling for their drugs and provide it \nto pharmacists for dispensing with the drug. In comments on this \nproposal, consumers favored the proposal, while manufacturing \npharmacists and the medical professions opposed it.\n  In 1980, after considering the comments, FDA issued a final rule. It \ndecided that the evidence in the rulemaking record amply demonstrated \nthat labeling would improve the benefits that consumers receive from \nprescription drugs in a number of ways. The information would increase \ncompliance, which would in turn decrease injuries from misuse. The \nregulation required manufacturers to provide labeling to pharmacists, \nbut it also allows pharmacists to write their own labeling.\n  In 1981, the incoming Reagan administration delayed the \nimplementation of the FDA regulation. This is an issue that has been \naround for a long period of time. But the regulation was revoked \naltogether. Its justification was that the private sector had promised \nto implement a voluntary program to do the job. So here we are--15 \nyears later--and industry is saying, once again, ``We don't need \nFederal regulation. Give us a few more years and we'll do the job.''\n\n  But the results of the industry's past 15 years of nonaction are \ncrystal clear--too many deaths, too many injuries, and not enough \npatient information. Almost half of all patients receive no written \ninformation of the kind they need to monitor their use of medications. \nToo often, the information they receive is shockingly inadequate.\n  FDA rightly concluded that consumers are not being served. They \ndeveloped a proposal and took it to industry, before even beginning a \nrulemaking proceeding. In a letter to Senator Cochran, FDA explains:\n\n       We originally envisioned mandating that drug manufacturers \n     develop patient leaflets which would be distributed with most \n     prescription drugs, informing patients of such things as how \n     to take the drug, what it was used for, what side effects to \n     watch for, and what to do if problems were experienced with \n     the drug.\n       However, before issuing such a proposal, we met with the \n     medical and pharmacy professions, representative of the \n     nation's drug stores, drug manufacturers, consumers groups, \n     and others. Many told us that new patient information \n     systems, most using computer technology, had been developed \n     and were being implemented that could accomplish our goal at \n     little cost to pharmacies and consumers, and that by the end \n     of the decade, most patients would be getting such \n     information through these private sector mechanisms.\n       We accepted their argument, and our subsequent proposal of \n     August 1995 announced that we would defer consideration of a \n     mandatory comprehensive Federal program until at least the \n     year 2000, to give the private sector time to fulfill that \n     commitment. We believe the proposed rule is very consistent \n     with the concept stated in your letter of giving the \n     marketplace a chance to meet our mutual objective. We are \n     currently reviewing the comments submitted in response to the \n     proposed rule, and recognize that revisions may be necessary \n     to respond to some of the specific concerns raised by those \n     who manufacture, prescribe, dispense prescription drugs.\n\n  So FDA's regulation, developed after consultation with the affected \nindustries, is entirely reasonable. It sets a performance standard and \ngoal of 75 percent of consumers receiving accurate, complete, helpful, \nand legibly written information by the year 2000. The 75 percent goal \ntakes into account the existence of the small corner drug store that \nmay not be able to meet the target as readily as large firms. The \nunderlying mandatory regulation will not go into effect if this goal is \nmet by the year 2000. In addition, it does not apply to drugs dispensed \nin doctors' offices, or hospitals, or in an emergency. In addition, \nthere is special consideration for small retail pharmacies.\n  The FDA has gone the extra mile. Consumers deserve the protection. \nFifteen years of inaction under so-called voluntary guidelines \nestablished by the industry is already too long. Now the industry will \nhave another 5 years to show it can do the job voluntarily. But even \nthat is not enough for the majority of Congress. They want to prohibit \nthe FDA from implementing even this modest approach.\n  The provision in the bill states that if the private sector develops \na plan within 120 days of enactment, FDA's rulemaking is suspended. \nHowever, the Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of FDA cannot review \nthe voluntary program to determine if it is, in fact, adequate. The \nonly action that HHS or FDA is allowed to take is to audit the program \nto see if it meets the goals set by the industry--not the goals set by \nFDA or Healthy People 2000. The bill further hamstrings FDA by \nprecluding any activity, such as guidelines, that might assist the \nprivate sector or assure that its program is adequate.\n  This provision is an abdication of Congress's responsibility to \nprotect the\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\npublic health. Instead of responsible action by FDA, an industry with \nan unsatisfactory track record is permitted to regulate itself--without \nany FDA oversight to make sure that the industry program is adequate.\n  How many more people must be injured or killed before Congress does \nthe right thing? How many more billions of dollars in health care costs \nmust be squandered before we decide that the public interest should \ntake precedence over these special interests.\n  The offensive provision in this bill is also part of the overall FDA \nreform bill reported by the Labor Committee. That legislation is the \nsubject of continuing negotiations between Congress and the \nadministration. The administration has identified modifying this \nprovision as one of its highest priorities. We have been negotiating in \ngood faith in the hope of reaching bipartisan agreement on a \nresponsible FDA reform bill. Yet in the middle of these negotiations, \nthis particular proposal is suddenly being rushed through Congress on \nthis appropriations bill.\n  This FDA gag order does not belong on the agriculture appropriations \nbill. We all know what is going on here.\n  Special interests have brought and paid for this provision with \npolitical campaign contributions. Anti-FDA companies have contributed \n$1.3 million to the sponsors of several so-called FDA reform bills in \nthe 3 years ending December 31, 1995. Of that sum, $888,000 were \ncontributed by political action committees of FDA-regulated companies \nto the sponsors of these anti-FDA bills.\n  And those are only the campaign contributions made through last \nDecember. The money hasn't stopped flowing. In fact, in 1996 the money \nhas continued to pour into the Republicans: Eli Lilly & Co., gave \n$305,000 to the Republican National Committee in the first 4 months of \n1996. Bristol Myers-Squibb contributed $275,000 to the Republican \nNational Committee in the first 4 months of 1996. And now they have \ntheir payoff.\n  The American people deserve a strong and independent FDA--an FDA that \nhas the authority and ability to assure that the food we eat is \nnutritious and healthy, that the medicines we take will cure, not kill, \nand that the medical devices we rely on will sustain and improve life, \nnot harm it.\n  By rejecting the proposal in the bill before us today, the Senate can \nsend a message of reassurance to the American people. Public health is \nnot negotiable. The FDA is not for sale to the highest bidder, and \nneither is Congress. No amount of campaign contributions can possibly \njustify selling out the FDA and jeopardizing the lives and health of \nthe American people. The people have the right to useful and necessary \ninformation about the drugs they take--and FDA should have the chance \nto make sure they get it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, first, I want to commend Senator Kennedy \nfor all his work with the Food and Drug Administration. He has been a \nbulldog in fighting to protect the public interest.\n  I stopped at the little store over in the Dirksen Building on the way \nover here. In the Dirksen Building, I saw pretzels, and I looked on the \nback of the pretzels and I saw how much sodium and everything else was \nthere. A bag of pretzels gives us that information. When you pick up a \ncandy bar, you have the information. But unless there is an agreement--\nand I understand some negotiations are taking place, and we may have an \nagreement here shortly, and I hope we do--what is going to happen is we \nare going to continue to not give people information on prescriptions.\n  Some companies do it voluntarily, but a great many do not. What the \nFDA has worked out is that, by the year 2000, 75 percent of \nprescriptions will have to provide that information. Frankly, I think \nthe FDA, instead of being undermined, as this bill would do, ought to \nbe criticized for not moving further than 75 percent. I cannot believe \nwe would accept that 75 percent of pretzel bags is adequate. We insist \nthat 100 percent of pretzels or dog food or breakfast food have this \ninformation. Why shouldn't people who buy prescriptions have this \ninformation? It just boggles the mind.\n  When you take a look at the reactions that come, which Senator \nKennedy was talking about, to people--and I can remember one of our \ncolleagues just yesterday in the Democratic Caucus talking about a \nreaction that he got to drugs that were prescribed to him. Fortunately, \nhe had information there, and he found out by reading the information \nthat it was a reaction to the drug. By all means, we ought to protect \nthe American public. What the Kennedy amendment does, and what the FDA \nis proposing, is that 75 percent of prescriptions should be covered by \nthe year 2000, which is 4 years from now, and that 95 percent be \ncovered by the year 2006, which is 10 years from now. If there is \nsomething wrong with this, it is that we are not covering everybody by \nthe year 2000, all prescriptions, and, much less, by the year 2006, 10 \nyears from now, still having 1 out of 20 prescriptions not covered.\n  I have to ask the question, Mr. President: Why do we have this here? \nWhy would a pharmaceutical company want to prevent the American public \nfrom having this information? I assume it is that they may want to make \na few more dollars and not have a liability here. I don't know. But, \nfrankly, it seems to me that it protects them from the liability to \nhave that information provided. What we do not need is an FDA gag \norder. That is what this bill is without an amendment. I am hopeful, \nfrom a report I just received from a staff member, that some kind of a \ncompromise is being worked out. I do not know. But to say that the \nindustry can set its own standards, I do not know how many \nprescriptions there are out here for various medicines. Let us say \nthere are a thousand different kinds of things that could be out there. \nAccording to this bill right now, if each year they add one more where \nthey would give the information, then it would take 1,000 years in \norder to meet that industry standard. And that would comply with this \nbill as it now is.\n\n  Mr. President, clearly we have to protect the public. This bill \nwithout an amendment does just the opposite. It protects pharmaceutical \ncompanies and not the public. Our aim ought to be to protect the \npublic. I want good pharmaceutical companies. I want companies that \ninvest in research and do other things. But we cannot do that and \njeopardize the public. We can both protect the public and encourage a \nhealthy pharmaceutical industry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. My good friend serves with me on our Human Resources \nCommittee. We had been considering an FDA reform legislation, had we \nnot, over the period of recent weeks? And the House of Representatives \nCommerce Committee also had been in the process of marking up over \nthere even as we meet here this afternoon. As a matter of fact, I \nunderstood they are going to try to work out in a bipartisan way a \nnumber of the areas in that FDA bill. And the Senator understands I \nbelieve that this whole question of the Medguide has been included in \nthe alleged FDA reform. So it was a matter that was going to come on up \nhere on the floor of the Senate under the FDA reform both in the House \nand in the Senate.\n  I am just wondering whether the Senator was as surprised as I was to \nfind out that this provision was taken out of the FDA reform. It had \nbeen a matter of some considerable discussion and difference in the \nHuman Resources Committee. We had good debate on it for some of the \nreasons that have been outlined here this afternoon. Then to find out \nthat it is tacked onto an agriculture appropriations bill, I do not \nknow whether the Senator was as surprised as I was to find that out. \nThe Senator might remember that we used to have the understanding that \nthere was not going to be legislation on appropriations. That was ruled \nout, and now we permit it evidently under the various precedents on \nlegislation on appropriations.\n  I am just wondering whether the Senator was as surprised as I was to \nsee this measure on this bill. I would think the Senator, representing \nthe great State of Illinois which is industrial in the north and \nagricultural in the south, is eager to see this legislation go forward.\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\n  I do think that it is important to note that this would be a matter \nthat was going to be considered in a timely fashion we had hoped with \nthe FDA reform. Now it is on an agriculture appropriations bill that is \nsome distance from both committees of jurisdiction and subject matter. \nAnd I am just wondering if the Senator is somewhat surprised to see \nthis emerge in this form.\n  Mr. SIMON. The Senator from Massachusetts knows that we were all \nsurprised--most of us were surprised--that it emerged here. We had been \nworking, as he indicated, in a bipartisan way in our committee to try \nto deal with some of these problems, and they are very complex. But to \nsay I was surprised is factual. I have to say I am also puzzled. Why \ndoes this happen to hit on an agriculture appropriations bill? To my \nknowledge no one on that agriculture appropriations bill has been \ncalled in any of these negotiations. Does the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts have any idea how it happened to come on this agriculture \nbill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No; I do not. And I think this is an issue that deserves \na full debate and discussion. I would be hopeful that we could work out \nsome measure that would defer at least full debate so we would be able \nto permit the agriculture appropriations bill to move ahead without \ninterfering with the current status. That was certainly our hope \nearlier in the day because I think that is really the best way to make \nsure that we are going to get the agriculture appropriations. None of \nus are interested in seeing this delayed at all, because of the \nimportance of it. But I must say having this legislation which is of \nsuch enormous importance I think is a matter of importance, and we want \nto make sure that the Senate is fully apprised of it.\n  So it is my hope that we can still work something out. We have been \nin contact with a number of Senators who are interested in it, and we \nwill have a chance to see if we cannot resolve this so that we can get \nback to considering some of the agriculture amendments.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I simply want to again commend my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for his leadership in this whole area, not just on \nthis amendment but he has made a huge contribution in protecting the \nAmerican public as we look at the FDA.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks the floor, I question the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to proceed as if in morning business \nfor a period of approximately 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the courtesy of the managers of the bill in \nallowing me to proceed in morning business.\n\n\n                          RETIREMENT SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about an issue \nthat is absolutely critical, obviously, to the future of America. It is \non the minds of many. And that is the issue of retirement of Americans \nand how we are going to pay for it.\n  This has become increasingly an issue that is receiving some \nvisibility in a substantive way verses in a political and demagogic way \nas a number of proposals have been discussed over the last few months \nregarding the issue of how we are going to pay for retirement for our \nsenior citizens who are presently receiving funds from the Social \nSecurity fund or from private pensions and also for those who are \nheaded toward some sort of retirement benefit.\n  The reason that the visibility of the issue has increased is probably \nbecause the largest generation in America, in American history, I \nguess--the postwar baby boom generation--is starting to see the whites \nof the eyes of retirement coming over the hill and it is necessary for \nthe postwar baby boom generation to focus on how its retirement years \nare going to be paid for. It is a very big issue, and it is one that \nneeds to be addressed.\n  This Republican Congress has actually passed a series of major \nproposals in the area of retirement security. Most of these major \nproposals were included in last year's Balanced Budget Act, and they \nwere aimed at making pensions more available and at making personal \nsavings more attractive and at improving the Medicare system.\n  The President, regrettably, vetoed that proposal, which would have \ngone a long way toward assuring solvency specifically of the Medicare \nsystem. Perhaps as a result of that veto, the White House has become \nconcerned about their culpability in not addressing the important issue \nof how we protect the retirement systems of this country, especially \nMedicare, which, we have heard from the trustees, is going to go \nbankrupt in the year 2001, potentially 2000.\n  And so, as a result of that, the President has now put forward a \nproposal. Of course, he puts forward a proposal on something almost \nevery day, recognizing that most of it is not going to become law or \nenacted. Although it is really political in nature, it is still at \nleast of some value in that he has put forward a proposal called the \nRetirement Security and Savings Act. The congressional leadership on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle has also decided to put forward some \nproposals in this area called pension security bills--well, they were \npension security bills. In May of this year, they put them forward and \nthey were part of their families first agenda.\n  My concern is that many of these ideas which are being initiated on \nthe other side of the aisle not only miss the mark, but they actually \naggravate the problem because, for the most part, most of these ideas \ncome out of the position of big government resolves problems and it is \nto the big-government approach that we should turn in order to address \nthe problems. They are ideas born in the 1930's, which should have died \nwith the passage of the Berlin Wall but, unfortunately, continue to \nengender themselves on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  However, at the same time that those ideas have been put forward, \nduring the past year myself and Senator Simpson have been holding a \nseries of coordinated hearings on the Nation's retirement policy, both \nin the Finance Committee and in the Labor Committee, where we chair the \nvarious subcommittees that are charged with this responsibility, I \nbeing responsible for the Committee on Aging, and he is responsible for \nSocial Security.\n  So we have examined the current status of the Nation's public and \nprivate retirement system and the nature and magnitude of the challenge \nthat system confronts as the baby boom generation moves towards \nretirement.\n  We have learned some important facts that provide a message of \nperspective on the current retirement security debate. These facts tell \nus that the scope of the problem we confront is enormous and, if \nanything, the American public is underestimating the problem and is \nunderanxious about the problem.\n  Fact No. 1 is that the Social Security system presents a major \nproblem in its present structure. Within 35 years, our country as a \nwhole will have more senior citizens than Florida does today. Think \nabout that. In 35 years, the average age of the American population \ngenerally will exceed today's average age of Florida's population. This \nwave of senior citizens will have a life expectancy 8 years longer than \ncurrent seniors, which is good, obviously, but it also creates issues.\n  Social Security is terribly unprepared to cope with this change in \ndemographics. The program operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, which \nworks all right today when about 4.5 workers support each retiree, but \nby the year 2030 the ratio will have fallen to 2 workers supporting \neach retiree, and the program will simply collapse. Absent reform, \nnearly $8 trillion of unfunded liability exists today--$8 trillion. \nThat is more than the national debt. That is what the unfunded \nliability is. Tomorrow's workers and the economy will never be able to \nwithstand the taxes necessary to sustain an unreformed program once the \nbaby boom generation begins to draw its retirement.\n  Fact No. 2: Our private pension regime presents a major problem. \nKeeping in mind Social Security's future, it should be considered a \nnational crisis that just half of today's full-time workers participate \nin employer-sponsored pension plans or that 45 million\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nAmericans have no access to a private pension plan or that over the \npast decade corporate contributions to pension plans have declined by \n50 percent.\n  These sad facts are driven by the even sadder state of the pension \naccess in smaller businesses and for lower income workers.\n  We passed a law just a few weeks ago which will correct some of this \nproblem, but it does not solve all the problem, and it has not been \nsigned by the President so we do not know that it will be agreed to. \nToday only 15 percent of the firms with less than 25 workers offer \npensions to their employees. Whereas almost 80 percent of today's work \nforce earning over $50,000 have pension plans, only 44 percent of the \nworkers earning between $10,000 and $25,000 have pensions, and only 9 \npercent of those earning less than $10,000 have a pension. While many \nlikely theories underlie our Federal pension system regime, the fact \nremains that the marketplace's reaction to it is failing our workers. \nProposals that we did pass just in the last few weeks will help \nalleviate this to some degree, but it will not correct the fundamental \nproblem.\n\n  Fact No. 3, personal savings presents a major problem. The typical \nworking American retires with less than $10,000 of personal savings. \nBaby boomers now earning $75,000 a year, those doing well under the \ncurrent pension statistics and expected to receive a typical employer-\nprovided pension, would have to triple their current savings rate to \nmaintain their current standard of living upon retirement. It is just \nlogic that tells you this. The fact is, people today work for about 30 \nyears. But because life expectancy has been extended, they also retire \nfor about 30 years. So you cannot save just a few dollars while you are \nworking and expect to have enough to cover you during your retirement \nwhen your retirement years are actually almost equaling your working \nyears.\n  The majority of Americans are very unprepared in the area of \npensions. Americans do not save anywhere near the rate required to \nsustain themselves. The reasons for this likely vary--the triumph of \nconsumerism over thrift, the increase in family tax burdens, the \nwelfare state's culture of dependency, the burdens of repaying student \nor other loans which now exist at levels unheard of for prior \ngenerations--but the effects are all too real. We simply are not saving \nenough as a culture.\n  These three basic facts concerning the three legs of the retirement \nstool--Social Security, private pensions, and savings--when viewed in \ncombination, present a startling and disheartening picture. They also \nlead to some important lessons for judging the adequacy of any \nretirement security proposals the Congress may address over the next \nyear.\n  Lesson No. 1: We can no longer ignore the Social Security problems. \nWe have a lot of faith in the common sense of the American people, at \nleast we do in New Hampshire, and believe that the true root of their \nretirement anxiety is the fear that Social Security will not be there \nfor them. They are right to be scared. Continuing to ignore Social \nSecurity reform because the program is now running a surplus is \ninexcusable. Retirement policy is long-term policy. We must allow the \npublic adequate time to adjust their pension and savings activities to \nany Social Security changes we may enact. Every additional year of \ndelay makes any change not only more Draconian but also less fair and \nless likely to succeed.\n  Further, any reforms to Social Security should complement and \nreinforce the changes that must also be made to address today's savings \nand pension inadequacies. Those who champion ``retirement security'' \nbut steadfastly ignore the Social Security problems not only mislead \nthe American public but also now present a real danger to the \nretirement security of today's workers.\n  Lesson No. 2: We must act to buttress the private pension and \npersonal savings activity of Americans. While the need for Social \nSecurity reform has gained some national attention and numerous reform \nproposals have been made, Social Security is just one portion of our \nnational retirement policy. We must also reform the other components \nwith similar zeal and creativity. Just as the debate on Medicare was \ntaken to a new level last year, with a general consensus developing \nthat more individual choices should be offered, and just as the debate \non Social Security is moving toward a new level with the discussion \ngravitating toward personalized savings options, the debate on \nemployer-provided pension reform must move to another level as well.\n\n  Our current pension structure does nothing for roughly half of our \nworking population and neglects mainly the poorer workers at that. We \ndo not need further tinkering, but we need new ways of thinking. We \nmust also move with similar urgency and innovation to address the \nsignificant inadequacies in personal savings. While new tax incentives \nfor savings seem to be the standard for the solution, increasing \neducation on the need to save and changing the cultural attitude toward \nthrift may be even more effective and at a lower price in some regards.\n  Lesson No. 3: We do not have time for political silliness. Our most \nbasic lesson is that we must consider and deal with the totality of the \nproblem. Any retirement reform proposal must be looked at through a \ncomprehensive, long-term lens. The fundamental test for each private \npension or personal savings proposal must be: Will it really expand \npension coverage or savings? And a key test for Social Security reforms \nmust be: Will they complement, not undermine, our pension and savings \ngoals?\n  Based on the facts I have just discussed, we do not have time to pass \nfeel-good proposals that will end up making a bad situation even worse. \nWe believe that many of the Democratic proposals would fail this test. \nWhile in theory they may work to give workers more pension security, in \npractice we know increased mandates, administrative expenses, and \nregulation causes businesses--and particularly small businesses--to opt \nout of pension activities. We have seen that in the defined benefit \narea especially.\n  Some Republican proposals should be reexamined as well. If tax \nincentives like IRA's only cause shifting of savings and not new \nsavings, a tax cut that offers working folks new money to save may be a \nbetter approach.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the problems we confront result \nfrom an excess of good news. Americans are living ever longer, the \nNation is prosperous, and we have come to expect a relatively \ncomfortable retirement lifestyle. Our senior population is, as a whole, \na generation that is in better financial shape than the other \ngenerations within the country.\n  These expectations, however, are running head-on into unavoidable \ndemographic facts. Thus, we believe the Nation's retirement structure, \na public program designed in the 1930's and which has become a Rube \nGoldberg hodge-podge of tax and regulatory provisions built up over \ntime, must be overhauled and restructured in light of the population \npressures the Nation confronts. Continuing a process of incremental \nchanges will continue failure. Outdated structures offer little hope \nfor achieving what must be achieved.\n  During the next few weeks, it is my intention to offer specific \noptions which will lead to a comprehensive response to the problems \nwhich we have in the Social Security accounts, the pension accounts, \nand the savings area. I do not expect these proposals to be the end of \nthe discussion but rather to be an effort to energize and promote the \ndiscussion. What is critical, however, is that we dedicate ourselves to \nthe fact that we have to take action and we have to take it within the \ncontext of the next Congress. During this election year, when many \npoliticians are putting their heads in the sand on this issue, we \ncannot afford that type of action.\n  As we go into this election cycle, there should be a significant \nnational debate and discussion of just what we are going to do in the \narea of retirement security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Nebraska might \ninquire from the managers of the bill as to the status of the Ag \nappropriations bill.\n  I had the false impression earlier that there were not many matters \nto be resolved. I would simply observe the obvious, that not a great \ndeal has taken place since noon when we had some votes. I would just \nlike to know, for the schedule of the Senator from Nebraska, if the \nmanagers could advise as to the status of negotiations going on, \nwhatever they are. What are the remaining matters of controversy on the \nAg appropriations bill, which I thought had been so ably managed out of \nthe committee by the managers of the bill, that we probably were down \nto not a great many contentious issues.\n  We have not had a vote since noon, and since I have been around here \na long time, I know I get the signal when you do not vote from noon \nuntil 5 o'clock in the afternoon, that means we might not vote by 8 or \n9 o'clock tonight. I know that my friend from Mississippi has been \nstruggling with this bill. The Senator from Nebraska has had some \ninterest in some side issues that have basically been resolved. I \ninquire of the managers of the bill if they could enlighten this \nSenator as to what likely might happen the rest of the waking hours \ntoday or in the evening.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, my impression \nis that we are making progress in negotiating some proposed amendments \nwith various Senators. There is a likelihood that we can resolve most \nof these issues without rollcall votes. There probably will be a vote \non final passage, a rollcall vote on final passage. Senators can be \nassured of that. Depending upon how the negotiations go over the next \nseveral minutes, we should know soon about how many votes are likely to \nbe required before we finally dispose of the bill.\n\n  I think we have made good progress and I am encouraged we will be \nable to complete this bill today sometime. I hope we do not have to go \ninto the evening tonight. I see no justification for that. We cannot \ncontrol that. If some Senator wants to talk about an amendment, he or \nshe can start talking and, unless we have 60 votes to cut off debate, \nwe cannot stop them. But I do not see that as happening. I think things \nare progressing in a way that will lead us to conclude this bill \nsometime this afternoon.\n  Mr. EXON. I certainly appreciate that optimistic report from my \nfriend. That would mean the Senator from Mississippi holds out the hope \nwe maybe would have final passage by 6 o'clock? Is that a fair \nassumption on the part of the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I do \nnot predict any particular time. I am hopeful we will be able to \ncomplete action sometime this afternoon, certainly before evening.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, I suggest if you have plans after 6 o'clock, \ncancel them. We have been here since 12 clock without one single \namendment being offered, without anything happening. As the Senator \nfrom Mississippi said, a lot of negotiations are going on. I assume \nsome progress is being made. But we have about four pretty contentious \namendments and I do not know whether they are resolvable or not. If \nthey are not, obviously each one of them is going to require a \nrollcall.\n  We have a number of other amendments that we could offer right now \nthat have been cleared but, as I say, we have four or five that are \npretty contentious. I do not know whether any progress is being made. \nBut, if it is not, we are obviously going to be here for a while.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank both of my friends. I find myself in a similar \nposition they are from time to time. It is very frustrating to manage \nbills on the floor of the Senate: Nobody offers any amendments; nothing \nis accomplished.\n  I wondered about this earlier, since we have not voted since noon. As \nfar as I know, no amendments have been offered since noon. I would \nsimply say, we get into these ruts from time to time. I am certainly \nnot blaming either of the managers of the bill. They are the ones who \nhave been here. It is most frustrating on their part. I was simply \nmaking inquiry to maybe jar things along, to help the managers of the \nbill. I know they are trying to break the deadlock.\n  I hope it takes place, and I appreciate their frankness with regard \nto what I think is a rather dark prospect for early resolution of these \nmatters this afternoon. I hope we can dispose of them sometime during \nthe daylight hours.\n  I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate approved by \nunanimous consent an amendment to reauthorize USDA's authority to allow \nseasonal base plans under Federal milk marketing orders. Producers in \nWisconsin have no quarrels with seasonal base plans but they want \nassurances that they will not exacerbate what they believe to be an \nalready discriminatory pricing structure within Federal orders. Farmers \nin Wisconsin seek assurances that seasonal base plans for milk \nmarketing orders are neither intended to nor will have the effect of \nincreasing milk prices or production on an average annual basis. Mr. \nPresident, I ask the managers of H.R. 3603, Is it their understanding \nthat seasonal base plans under milk marketing orders will increase \nneither overall prices levels nor milk production in orders in which \nthey are implemented?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is correct. \nThe seasonal base plans reauthorized by this bill are merely intended \nto level production and prices over the year to stabilize the market \nand are not intended to provide any price enhancement or production \nincentives, measured on a yearly basis, to dairy farmers in those \norders. The Secretary of Agriculture should administer any seasonal \nbase plans consistent with that understanding.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, that is my understanding as well. \nSeasonal base plans are merely a stabilization tool, not a price \nenhancement mechanism, and should be administered as such.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n                 Northern Plains Policy Research Center\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a matter of some \nimportance to the Northern Great Plains and my State of North Dakota \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I note their presence on the floor, and ask if they would \nbe willing to engage in a colloquy at this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I too would appreciate the ability to discuss the bill \nbefore us with the distinguished Senators from Mississippi and \nArkansas.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be pleased to discuss this bill with the \nSenators from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. First, let me thank the chairman and ranking member for \nputting together this important piece of legislation. They have an \nextremely difficult task balancing many important programs funded in \nthis bill in the context of a very difficult funding situation. I know \nthe committee receives many requests each year for worthwhile projects, \nand of course budget restraints make it impossible to fund all those \nprojects.\n  One of the projects I believe the Senators considered this year was \nthe development of a Northern Plains policy research center. As the \nSenators know, research models currently available provide important \ninformation to farmers and others in rural America regarding issues \nthat affect rural economies. Unfortunately, the data collected through \ncurrent research models, as valuable as it is, does not capture the \nspecial characteristics of Northern Great Plains agriculture.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I share the sentiments expressed by my colleague, and \nalso would like to commend the Senators for the work they have done \nwith this legislation. I would like to offer a few additional thoughts \non the proposed Northern Plains policy research center. This center \nwould conduct a wide range of policy-related research and outreach \nactivities focused on policy changes for agricultural producers, \nagribusiness firms, and the rural economies of the Northern Plains \nStates. The center would identify and evaluate alternative policies for \nNorthern Plains commodities and value-added products; evaluate the \nimpact of policies on international competitiveness, on rural business \ndevelopment, and on farm structure and sustainability; and examine the \nimpact of cross-border policy inconsistencies in North America and \nstrategies to improve export opportunities.\n  As the Senators know, these are not easy times for rural America. The \ncenter would play a critical role in the economic vitality of Northern \nPlains States. Would the chairman and ranking member be willing to \nindicate their thoughts on the establishment of a Northern Plains \npolicy research center?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from North Dakota is correct when they say \nthis was one of the many issues considered by the committee this year. \nI agree that the data provided by the proposed center would be valuable \nto Northern Plains States. Unfortunately, the committee's funding \nallocation did not allow us to provide funding.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I agree with the chairman's assessment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the chairman and ranking member be willing to \nindicate whether they would support the USDA using funds provided in \nthis bill for markets, trade, and policy research under the Competitive \nGrants Program to develop such a center?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say to the Senator that I would encourage USDA to \nassist in establishing a Northern Plains policy research center using \nfunds provided in this bill, as the Senator indicated.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I share the view expressed by my colleague from \nArkansas. I would just add that the committee expects the Department to \nconsider only those applications judged meritorious when subjected to \nthe established review process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senators for their support and for their \ncomments.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I also want to express my deep thanks to Senator Cochran \nand Senator Bumpers.\n\n\n   Rural Telemedicine and Distance Learning Services Grant and Loan \n                                Program\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senators be willing to engage in \na colloquy regarding the Rural Telemedicine and Distance Learning \nServices Grant Program at this time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would be happy to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate the subcommittee's support for the Rural \nTelemedicine and Distance Learning Services Grant Program, and am \npleased to see that the subcommittee has provided $10 million for this \nimportant program. In 1993, the University of North Dakota School of \nMedicine and Health Sciences made a major commitment to the education \nand training of rural and frontier health care providers. To support \nthis commitment, the school invested considerably in distance education \ntechnology in the form of satellite transmission equipment, upgraded \ntelecommunications equipment, and advanced computer networks to develop \nthe North Dakota Health Education Network. This network is an important \ncomponent of the overall health education communication program that \nserves the State of North Dakota. However, the system would better \nserve educators, students, and the citizens of North Dakota if it had \naccess to additional computer technology, two-way video technology, \nadditional satellite downlink sites, and funds for additional medical \nand medical education programs.\n  I wish to make the subcommittee aware that the University of North \nDakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences may submit an application \nfor a rural telemedicine and distance learning grant to accomplish the \nadditional activates I just described. Do the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee agree that this grant \napplication, if submitted, would be appropriate for consideration under \nthe Rural Telemedicine and Distance Learning Services Grant Program?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree that it would be appropriate for USDA to \nconsider this application, if submitted, and I encourage the Department \nto give full consideration to an application for a rural telemedicine \nand distance learning grant from the University of North Dakota. \nAdditionally, I expect the Department to consider only applications \njudged meritorious when subjected to the established review process.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I share the chairman's view.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senators for their support.\n\n\n                     grants to broadcasting systems\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture \nappropriations report references a Grants to Broadcasting Systems \nProgram that I would like to discuss with the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Mr. Lugar, and with the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, who was the original sponsor of the program when it \nwas authorized in the 1989 Rural Development Partnership Act.\n  It is my understanding that the program statutorily restricts \neligibility for the program to statewide, private, nonprofit public \ntelevision systems whose coverage is predominantly rural. In order to \nfurther clarify the statute, a new provision was added at my request to \nthe 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 [FAIR] \nAct that defined statewide as having a coverage area of not less than \n90 percent of the population of a State and not less than 80 percent of \nthe rural land area of the State. Is my understanding of the statute \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, the Senator from Oregon is correct. The new provision \nbecame effective upon enactment of the FAIR Act on April 14, 1996.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Am I correct, then, in assuming that an applicant that \nmeets the statutory eligibility criteria of the program as it was \namended by the act would be considered eligible for the program upon \nthe date of the act's enactment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee is \ncorrect. In addition, given the clear statutory eligibility \nrequirements of this particular program, I can see no reason why \neligibility could not be determined in the application process.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As the original sponsor of the provision that authorized \nthe program in the Rural Development Partnership Act of 1989, I commend \nthe Senator from Oregon in his efforts to not only further define the \nstatute, but also to clarify the effective date of eligibility for \napplicants for fiscal year 1996 funding. It is my understanding that \nthe definitional clarification offered by the Senator to the 1996 farm \nbill will not significantly increase the number of eligible applicants \nfor the program. In that regard, I am providing for the Record a letter \nfrom America's Public Television Stations [APTS] which provides a list \nof those public television systems that, given the amended statutory \ncriteria, would be eligible for the program. I ask unanimous consent \nthe letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n\n                                                  America's Public\n\n\n                                          Television Stations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1996.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I am writing in response to your \n     request for assistance in identifying public television \n     stations that may be eligible for the ``Grants to \n     Broadcasting Systems'' program administered by the United \n     States Department of Agriculture.\n       As I understand, to be eligible for the program a public \n     television licensee must be a private, non-profit entity that \n     provides statewide coverage that is predominantly rural. \n     Based on a copy of the states considered ``rural'' by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture and the statutory definition of \n     statewide coverage as outlined in your letter, the following \n     public television licensees would meet the statutory \n     eligibility criteria:\n       Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation,\n       Prairie Public Broadcasting, Inc., North Dakota,\n       Oregon Public Broadcasting, and\n       Vermont ETV, Inc.\n       Please let me know if I can provide you with any further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David J. Brugger,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. My colleagues are aware that I serve on both the Senate \nBudget and Agriculture Committees, and that I have long been concerned \nabout efficiency in Government. One effective method of reducing \nGovernment administrative expenses is writing regulations only when \ninterpretive guidelines are necessary. In the case of the Grants to \nBroadcasting Systems Program, the statute, as amended, clearly speaks \nfor itself, and the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon \nclarifying the definition of statewide does not change the program \nsubstantively. Finally, I would like to associate myself with the \nstatement by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee that there \nshould be no reason why eligibility for this program could not be \ndetermined in the application process.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues from North \nDakota and Indiana, and assume that the USDA will be attentive to the \ndiscussion that we have had with regard to this program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4997\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers of the \nbill have agreed to accept the amendment which I offered on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Mikulski to continue three important research \nprograms at Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. My amendment \nrestores $458,700 to the Regulation of Chilling Injury By Polyamines \nand Membranes in Apple, Tomato, Squash, and Pepper Program; $240,000 to \nthe production and evaluation of tissue cultured fruit crops; and \nnondestructive sonic sensing of firmness and/or condition of apples and \nother agricultural commodities. These programs are critical to growers, \nto maintaining a nutritious and safe food supply for our consumers, to \nBeltsville's mission and to the Department's overall research \nobjectives. I want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember for their support and help with this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nAgricultural appropriations bill before the Senate. I commend the \nchairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for their hard work \non this bill and I thank them for their efforts.\n  The bill before us includes a number of very important items. While \nthe legislation is replete with programs which are of great benefit for \nthe Nation as a whole, there are a number of provisions which are \nespecially critical to Montana. And I'd like to address those issues \nright now.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the bill contains adequate funding \nfor the animal damage control activities conducted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. For livestock producers this is a vital \nprogram. And in Montana and the other Western States which are home to \nthe reintroduction of wolves this program is essential--to both the \nproducers in the affected region and to the wolves.\n  In the area of research I am pleased that the Senate mark has funded \nthe Agricultural Research Service at a level above the level of \nappropriations for 1996. I feel that is appropriate. The Federal \nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 laid the foundation for \na transition to dramatically decreased Federal involvement in \nagriculture production. That transition will result in a greater need \nto be competitive in agricultural production. Research holds the key to \nenhancing that competitiveness.\n  The research conducted and supported by USDA will help ensure that \nAmerican agriculture continues the success that has characterized this \nindustry over the past century. One facility which will play a role in \nthis research effort is the Center of Excellence which is being \nestablished in Sidney, MT. I am pleased that the report language \nencourages the direction of adequate resources to this center.\n  This bill also provides for the continued funding of a number of \nresearch efforts which are underway in Big Sky country. These efforts \nwhich are largely cooperative efforts engaged in with other \ninstitutions will yield the technological advances which will carry \nGreat Plains agriculture into the 21st century.\n  But Mr. President, it is important to note that there is one item \nwhich is not completely provided for in this bill. While I recognize \nthe chairman's desire to avoid revisiting the farm bill, there is \nconsiderable need for a technical corrections package, but that package \nhas not been forthcoming. And I am uncomfortable waiting until next \nyear to repair some of these problems.\n  In one instance--regarding the payment rate for barley producers--\nthere is an inequity which has not been totally resolved. While the \ninitial payment rate projections for all commodities have been reduced \nfrom their initial projected levels, through no fault of their own, \nbarley producers were dealt an exceptionally hard blow. Their payment \nlevels which were lower than most commodities to begin with were \ndramatically impacted by calculations predicting the economic effect by \n0/85 program acreage enrollment.\n  While this program had an effect on all commodities, due to high \nenrollment of barley acres it had a far greater negative impact on the \nbarley payment rates than on other commodity rates.\n  So the barley producers have come to their Senators--those of us from \nbarley producing regions of this Nation--and asked for our assistance. \nI want to give them the fair treatment they deserve.\n  I would thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nassistance in reaching agreement on an amendment to repair this. But I \nwould ask that this issue--this question of fairness for all \ncommodities--be considered for further refinement in the conference. I \nthink we can find a better solution to this issue and I look forward to \nworking with the conferees on that effort.\n  Mr. President, I would conclude my remarks by urging my colleagues to \nsupport this bill--with the change I have mentioned. And I thank the \nmanagers for their work on this matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very important bill for my State \nof California as we are the number one ranking agricultural State in \nthe U.S.\n  While there are many issues addressed in this bill that are important \nfor my State, I would like to highlight three California specific \nissues:\n\n\n                  Methyl Bromide Alternatives Research\n\n  I am pleased that the Senate agreed to my request of an additional $1 \nmillion for methyl bromide alternatives research.\n  Methyl bromide is critically important to California agriculture for \ncontrol of pre-plant and post-harvest pests, and is to date, the only \ncost-effective material for controlling a variety of soil-borne \npathogens and weeds that can seriously impact crop yields. These uses \nare particularly significant for commodities such as strawberries, \nalmonds, walnuts, raisins, and numerous other field and row crops.\n  Methyl bromide was listed as a Class I ozone depleting sub- stance in \nDecember 1993, and according to Section 602 of the Clean Air Act, it \nmust be withdrawn from production, importation and distribution in the \nU.S. by the year 2001.\n  My ``Sense of the Senate'' on methyl bromide included in the farm \nbill sent a clear message to the U.S. Department of Agriculture that \nresearch into alternatives to methyl bromide must be a top priority.\n  The additional $1 million will bring the total up to $14.889 in 1997.\n\n\n                                Avocados\n\n  I support the concurrence of the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nwith\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\nthe House report language regarding the regulation of importation of \nMexican avocados.\n  Last year the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service issued a proposed rule governing the \nimportation of Mexican Hass avocados into the United States. The \nproposed rule would allow Hass avocados to be imported into the \nNortheastern United States during the winter months of November through \nFebruary.\n  California avocado growers have expressed their continued concerns \nthat the USDA proposed rule inadequately protects their industry from \nharmful pests or disease that imported avocados may carry.\n  Importation of Mexican avocados has been prohibited for over 80 years \nbecause of the presence of at least nine known quarantined pests of \neconomic significance. If pest-infested avocados are allowed into the \nUnited States, not only avocados but other crops such as citrus, \napples, peaches and pears will be placed at risk.\n  In light of new scientific data which indicates that the incidence of \navocado pests in Mexico is significantly higher than previously \nthought, it is very important that the Department of Agriculture \ndetermine whether the original data it relied on is sound and complete. \nIf the Secretary cannot make this determination, I urge the Department \nto reopen the rulemaking record on the proposed rule, and undertake the \nprocedures stated in the House report language before issuing a final \nrule.\n\n\n               Fresh-frozen Chicken Labelling Compromise\n\n  National poultry producers have in the past always put fresh labels \non frozen chickens. They freeze their chicken rock solid, label it \nfresh, transport it across the U.S., thaw it out locally, and sell it \nto consumers as if it had never been frozen.\n  As the author of the Truth in Poultry Labeling Act, I have for years \nworked to disallow the use of the fresh label where a poultry product \nhas been previously frozen.\n  Last year, after many years of public debate, we achieved a hard-\nfought victory for consumers when the U.S. Department of Agriculture \npromulgated a common sense rule on labeling fresh and frozen poultry. \nThe rule which had been scheduled to take effect this August sets out \nthree labeling categories: fresh poultry products which have never been \nchilled below poultry's freezing point--26 degrees Fahrenheit--would be \nlabelled ``fresh''; 2) poultry products which have been chilled below \n26 degrees but above 0 degrees would be labelled ``hard chilled'' or \n``previously hard chilled''; and 3) poultry products which have been at \n0 degrees or below would be labelled ``frozen'' or ``previously \nfrozen.''\n  I believe that the implementation of the USDA-promulgated rule would \neliminate consumer confusion, save consumers millions of dollars in \npremiums paid for frozen poultry they believe is fresh, and further \nrestore consumer trust in the integrity of food labels.\n  However, language was included in the 1996 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill, that blocked implementation of the rule. My attempt to remove the \nlanguage in order to allow USDA implementation of the rule was voted \ndown by a vote of 31 to 68.\n  Since then, industry and consumer groups have reached a compromise \nwhich, while not perfect, is a significant step forward.\n  The compromise included in this bill is based on the requirement that \nthe Department of Agriculture issue a revised final regulation based on \na compromise that is supported by industry and many consumer groups.\n  The key positive development is the agreement that only poultry which \nhas not been cooled below 26 degrees Fahrenheit can be labelled \n``fresh.'' While this is a very significant step forward, I remain \nconcerned about the clear labelling of products that are cooled to \ntemperatures below 26 degrees but above 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The \ncompromise would not require these products to bear any specific \nalternative labelling.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to commend subcommittee Chairman \nCochran for his work on the Agriculture Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1997. This bill provides funding for all the activities under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, except for the U.S. \nForest Service. It also funds the activities of the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Farm \nCredit System.\n  This has been one of the most difficult years to date and I \ncongratulate Senator Cochran for his leadership in working through the \ndifficult decisions in crafting this bill. In particular, Chairman \nCochran and his staff are to be commended for the clarity that this \nbill provides for the budget of the Food and Drug Administration. That \naccomplishment required countless hours of hard work, but is just the \nsort of good government effort we have come to expect from the \nsubcommittee chairman and the staff working under his direction.\n  FDA's core mission is to protect the health of the American people. A \ncritical part of FDA's core mission is to provide Americans with timely \naccess to drugs, medical devices, and food technologies that can \nimprove public health. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nrequires FDA to review and approve or deny petitions and applications \nfor foods, drugs, and medical devices within specified timeframes. Yet, \nFDA routinely ignores its statutory deadlines. According to the \nagency's own numbers, FDA, on average, fails to review applications and \npetitions for every FDA-regulated product category within the \nprescribed timeframes. FDA's failure to comply with its statutory \ndeadlines hurts patients and consumers waiting for market introduction \nof new therapies and technologies that can significantly improve public \nhealth. The report accompanying this bill, like similar directives from \nthe House, makes clear the congressional expectation that FDA protect \npublic health by performing product reviews within the timeframes \nprescribed by law.\n  This bill also directs FDA to complete several rulemakings that have \nbeen pending at the agency for as many as 6 years. Although I, like my \ncolleagues, oppose overregulation, I do appreciate the need for \nregulations required to protect public health. Currently pending at FDA \nare several rulemakings that have fallen victim to unreasonable agency \ndelay. FDA has identified each of these rulemakings as agency \npriorities. Yet, the agency's record of follow-through on these \nrulemakings is terribly lax. I commend subcommittee Chairman Cochran \nfor including language in this bill that directs the agency to complete \nrulemakings necessary for the protection of public health without \nunreasonable delay.\n  During fiscal year 1997, this Senator will be closely watching FDA's \nperformance. It is my hope that the agency will heed congressional \ndirectives to comply with statutory review times, as well as complete \naction on several rulemakings that the agency has identified as \nimportant for the protection of public health. Regrettably, over the \nlast few years FDA does not have an impressive record of responsiveness \nto Congress. If FDA's failure in these areas continues, it is my \nexpectation that the committee will revisit the issue with the \nintention of compelling FDA compliance with its statutory obligations.\n  Timely access to new therapies and technologies can significantly \nenhance public health. FDA must meet the requirements of the Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act in its review of petitions and applications.\n  I am grateful that language concerning the regulation of commercial \ntransportation of equine to slaughter is included. The committee urges \nthe Department to expeditiously act to implement this regulation. Often \nthese horses are transported for long periods, in overcrowded \nconditions, and often in vehicles that have inadequate head room. The \nimplementation of regulations would allow horses to get to a slaughter \nfacility safely and as quickly as possible with the least amount of \nstress to the animal.\n  Again, Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Cochran on his \nleadership in developing a well balanced bill that addresses food \nsafety, research, nutrition, conservation, market promotion, and \ndevelopment, and rural development.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the fiscal year \n1997 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, the Food \nand Drug\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\nAdministration, and Related Agencies. This bill, as reported by the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations provides $54,276,792,000 in total \nobligational authority for the coming fiscal year. This amount is \n$1,224,755,000 more than provided in the House bill, but it is \nnevertheless $4,040,522,000 below the President's request and nearly \n$10 billion below the amount provided for fiscal year 1996.\n  This bill provides funding necessary to support a wide variety of \nprograms that are very important to all Americans. These programs \ninclude food and nutrition programs, environmental protection and \nconservation, rural development, export promotion, assurance that we \nhave a safe food and drug supply, and research and education programs \nnecessary for the production of agricultural products and equally \nimportant to consumers of those products. In fact this bill provides \nfunding for all programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, except \nthe Forest Service, and also includes funding for the Food and Drug \nAdministration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  While West Virginia may not reach the levels of traditional farm \ncommodity production of some states in the Midwest or other regions of \nthe country, this bill is very important to my state. West Virginia is \non the cutting edge of new methodologies in aquacultural production for \nspecies that thrive in cool and cold water environments. There is a \ngrowing demand for these products and it is vitally important that we \ndevelop the tools and methods to increase production to meet this \ndemand. This bill helps us to achieve that goal.\n  Conservation is important to all Americans. Without proper \nconservation practices, erosion would sweep our prime farmland into \nrivers and streams. Water quality would suffer, aquatic species would \nfail, and community costs for clean water would escalate. Proper \nconservation practices also mean better management of water resources \nin order to reduce the threat of floods. Recent events in West \nVirginia, and other states, remind us of the need to invest in flood \nprotection and this bill helps forge the relationships necessary \nbetween federal agencies and local communities to best meet their water \nand soil management needs.\n  The Department of Agriculture provides a variety of programs \nimportant to rural communities. The Rural Development title of this \nbill contains a number of loan and grant programs to provide housing \nassistance, rural business and community development, basic utilities \nsuch as water and sewer services, and distance learning programs for \nimproved rural communication.\n  Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture completed Water 2000, a \nstudy of safe drinking water needs in the United States. I hope \neveryone will take note of the results. Nearly 3 million families, \nrepresenting 8 million people, do not have access to safe drinking \nwater. Let me repeat that. Eight million citizens of the United States \nof America do not have access to a reliable source of clean drinking \nwater. Every day, every night, millions of Americans can not turn on \ntheir faucets and drink safe water.\n  Regreattably, in my own state of West Virginia, the study reports \nthat it would take $162.3 million to clean up and provide potable water \nto approximately 79,000 West Virginians. It would take another $405.7 \nmillion to meet the worsening drinking water supply situation of some \n476,000 West Virginians. Many other states are facing similarly serious \nsituations.\n  This bill provides nearly $659 million in budget authority for water \nand sewer programs. I am happy to note that this is a great improvement \nfrom last year's bill and is nearly the amount of the President's \nrequest. But our House counterparts recently approved their version of \nthe FY 1997 Agriculture appropriations bill in which they provided only \n$496,868,000 for water and sewer programs. I urge my colleagues to \nstand firm on the Senate level of funding for these critically \nimportant programs. The bill also contains provisions to allow the \ntransfer of funds from other programs to the water and sewer accounts, \nwhich represents the broad-based recognition that these services are \nvery basic to all our people and deserve our attention.\n\n  I would also like the speak about a provision in the recently passed \nfarm bill that involves rural development opportunities, the so-called \nFund for Rural America. The Fund for Rural America, which is referenced \nin the report accompanying this bill, provides the Secretary of \nAgriculture $100 million directly out of the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to use, at his discretion, in a manner designed to assist \nrural Americans. Among the types of programs the Secretary can use \nthrough this Fund are rural housing, water and sewer loans and grants, \nrural business loans and grants, and a variety of research program \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, this Fund presents the Secretary of Agriculture with \nrare opportunity. Over the past several decades, a number of Federal \nprograms have been developed to assist rural America in a variety of \nways. Unfortunately, budgetary constraints have limited the Secretary's \nability to focus these programs on specific areas so that they can be \nutilized to their full potential. An unfortunate reality of our current \nfiscal condition is that scarce resources tend to be spread thin.\n  The Fund for Rural America gives the Secretary of Agriculture the \nopportunity to showcase what can be done for rural America, given \nadequate resources. There are rural areas throughout the Nation that \nare in desperate need of the types of assistance the Department of \nAgriculture can provide. There are such areas in West Virginia, there \nare such areas in the Western United States, there are such areas along \nthe Lower Mississippi River Delta of which both the chairman and \nranking member managing this bill are very familiar.\n  While I recognize the importance of providing the Secretary full \ndiscretion in how the Fund for Rural America is to be managed, I hope, \nand I believe, he shares my view that this Fund provides the type of \nopportunity I have just described. I am confident the programs \nadministered by the Secretary can make a great difference in the lives \nof West Virginians, as well as in the lives of other rural citizens in \nall regions of the country. I hope the Fund for Rural America will give \nus the chance to see exactly what kind of difference it can be.\n  Mr. President, there are many other programs in this bill that are \nimportant. Obviously, food and nutrition are important to us all. Food \nsafety and confidence in our drug and blood supply are also vitally \nimportant to every American. Agricultural trade continues to be a very \nbright star in our Nation's balance of trade. Protection of investors \nin the commodity futures markets is becoming increasingly challenging \nas the market place continues to develop new and innovative forms of \ntransactions. All these areas of importance are touched on by programs \nfunded in this bill.\n  I am pleased to express my support for this bill and I want to \ncongratulate the very capable chairman and the equally capable ranking \nmember of the Agriculture and Rural Development Subcommittee, Senators \nCochran and Bumpers, for crafting this bill and bringing it to the \nfloor. As is too often the case, I wish we were able to do more to \nincrease funding for these important programs beyond the levels \ncontained in this bill. However, given all the budget constraints with \nwhich we are faced, I believe an admirable job has been done. I fully \nexpect a strong show of support in Senate passage of this bill, a \nsuccessful conference with the House, and approval by the President.\n  I also thank the subcommittee staff for their fine work: Galen \nFountain and Carole Geagley for the minority, and Rebecca Davies, \nJimmie Reynolds, and Hunt Shipman for the majority.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I support the agricultural appropriations \nbill that we are considering today and want to commend the chairman, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and the ranking member, the Senator from \nArkansas, for their work on this important legislation. They and their \nstaffs have spent countless hours under enormous pressure trying to \nensure that discretionary agriculture programs are adequately funded. \nConsidering the fiscal constraints with which they have been forced to \ncomply, they have done a commendable job.\n  The appropriations process is never easy, as the committee faces a \nnumber\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nof difficult choices. For this reason, the bill does contain some \nprovisions that are troublesome to me. For example, I regret the \ndecision to provide less than full funding for the food safety \ninspection system at the same time the USDA is implementing the new \nscience-based meat and poultry inspection system, the hazard analysis \nof critical control points [HACCP]. Also, the potential reduction in \nFederal outlays for lending programs that benefit our Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and rural communities could jeopardize the rural economy. \nThese issues deserve further attention.\n  Mr. President, I am not entirely pleased with the shape of this \nlegislation. However, I am hopeful that it can be improved in \nconference with the House. Therefore, I urge my colleagues' support of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after listening to our debate today, it \nstrikes me that the agriculture appropriations bill is really \nfundamental to the heart of the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] \nreform initiative that so many of us in the Congress believe is \ndrastically needed.\n  I think that a majority of Americans would be surprised, perhaps even \nshocked, to learn that the FDA routinely ignores deadlines set forth in \nthe law, deadlines for reviews of products vital to public health such \nas approvals of new medical devices or generic drugs.\n  The committee, in fact, recognized this disregard of the law and its \ndramatic impact in its report this year. The committee noted in part:\n\n       The Committee expects the FDA to meet statutory review \n     times for the review and approval of various food, drug and \n     device applications and petitions . . . Extensive testimony \n     has been presented about how the delay in approval of new \n     drugs and medical devices has hurt American public health \n     because U.S. patients do not have access to the latest \n     technologies. Also, slow approval times are driving research \n     and manufacturing jobs in these industries overseas, where \n     earlier approvals are routinely expected.\n\n  The committee went on to say:\n\n       The problem is this agency often disregards its statutory \n     obligation to approve or deny various applications and \n     petitions within specified timeframes. As a result, many \n     applications disappear into FDA for years.\n\n  For the edification of my colleagues, I want to point out a few \nexamples of statutory mandates which the FDA has failed to meet.\n  Section 409(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nstipulates that FDA consideration of food additive petitions must \nnormally be completed within 90 days. The FDA performance is so \npathetic in this area that the Department of Health and Human Services \nfiscal year 1997 budget justifications do not even contain \nquantification of the backlog in this area. The FDA report merely \nstates, ``The backlog currently includes approximately 300 petitions, \nwith 11 classified as `novel or important.' ''\n  However, a report by the House Committee on Government Reform and \nOversight in December 1995 indicated that since 1970 the average time \nto approval of a direct food additive has been at least 20 months.\n  It is interesting to note that at the time of the House committee's \nJune 22, 1995, hearing on food additives, there were 295 pending food \nadditive petitions. Seven percent of them were filed between 1971 and \n1979.\n  The story is not much better for drugs and devices.\n  For human drugs, the mean approval time for new drug applications \n[NDA's] in 1995 is 25.7 months; that is 428 percent greater than the \nstatutory deadline of 6 months.\n\n  For animal drugs, the comparable 1995 figure is 39 months, which is 6 \ntimes the statutory timeframe of 6 months.\n  For generic animal drugs, the time is 31 months, 5 times the limit of \n6 months.\n  For human generic drugs, the average approval time is 34.2 months, an \nincredible 570 percent greater than the statutory deadline of 6 months.\n  Although the pioneer and generic animal drug approvals exceed their \nstatutory deadlines by substantial amounts, it is puzzling why the \nagency allocates its resources so that generic animal drugs are \napproved faster than generic human drugs.\n  Let me turn now to medical devices.\n  Approval of 510(k) applications is running at 137 days on average, \nwhich is 47 days beyond the statutory 90-day timeframe.\n  For pre-market approvals, the 1995 statistic is 276 days, which is \nnearly 100 days beyond the law's 180-day mandate.\n  In perhaps the most blatant disregard of congressional directives, \nthe Appropriations Committee was forced to note this year that the FDA \ndid not even honor the Committee's request for quarterly reports on its \nplans to refocus resources and make a greater priority completion of \nongoing product reviews.\n  Mr. President, I have devoted a good deal of my congressional career \nto study and advocacy of FDA related issues.\n  I consider FDA to exemplify what is best in government--and, \nunfortunately, what is worst.\n  This agency can work miracles to protect the public health.\n  This agency can also go off on a tangent, with a bureaucratic, one-\nway/my-way attitude that rivals none in its ability to obfuscate and \ncircle the wagons.\n  In my experience, FDA responds to much of such criticism by citing \nthat it does not have the resources it needs to do the job.\n  Mr. President, I will take a back seat to no one in my support for \nadequate funds and facilities for the FDA. As a member of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee for 18 years, I fought hard for improved \nresources for this agency.\n  But, today, the FDA's plaint of inadequate resources is only in part \ntruth--in part it is bunk.\n  The FDA does, in fact, have the resources it needs to accomplish its \ncore mission, such as product review.\n  The Appropriations Committee has worked hard to review the FDA's \naccounting in great detail and provide them with necessary funding in \nthe bill we consider today.\n  What FDA does not have resources for is to self-generate work or \nexpand its mission.\n  Moreover, the fallacy of the FDA's ``we don't have the resources'' \ndefense can be found in this simple question: ``If you don't have the \nresources, why don't you request them?''\n  If the agency is serious about product reviews and can't meet \ndeadlines, then why don't they seek the resources to do the job?\n  Those of us who take a great interest in the FDA have struggled for \nyears to find a method to compel the agency to focus its priorities. We \nmust find a way to discourage them from adopting that infamous kid-in-\nthe-candy-store attitude which has led to an ever-expanding empire at \nthe expense of meeting statutorily mandated deadlines. The FDA never \nmet an issue it didn't like, no matter how small or how large.\n\n  That is the central issue of the debate on FDA reform.\n  And as I listen to our debate today, I have realized that the will of \nthe FDA follows its resources.\n  With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, the Congress \nprovided a new source of income for new drug approvals --industry-\nfunded user fees--and suddenly new drug approval times are coming down \ndramatically.\n  Unfortunately, though, the agency--which during our GATT debate was \nsuch a staunch defender of the generic drug industry --seems to have \nabandoned its commitment to that industry when you look at the budget \nfor next year, which presumes decreases in FTE's for generic drug \nreviews and increases in product approval times.\n  That is why we are seeing such a bitter debate today over issues such \nas the Medguide regulations.\n  I think that any objective study of Medguide will show that the FDA \nhas taken an old regulation off the shelves, dusted it off, and \nattempted to move it forward almost 20 years later.\n  When challenged about the initiative, they have resorted to their \npublic health defense, exhorting their allies in the Senate to throw up \nthe special interest shield, the most common FDA tool to block \nlegislative activities the agency dislikes.\n  If there is such a pressing public health need for the Medguide \nregulation, then why has it laid dormant for almost 20 years?\n  Perhaps the publicity this debate has engendered is the real answer.\n  But the bottom line is that the FDA must get serious about using its \nresources more wisely. That would do a\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nlot to restore its credibility with the Congress.\n  Let me turn now to some specifics in the bill we are considering \ntoday.\n  The legislation contains three technical amendments to the recently \nenacted FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act that the committee \nincluded on behalf of Senator Gregg and myself.\n  The purpose of the Export Act is to increase the opportunities for \nU.S. firms to export their medical products to our trading partners \naround the world. This new law will result in jobs for Americans and \nwill help keep our country as the leader in developing new medical \ntechnologies.\n  Consistent with the intent of the new export law, these technical \namendments, included in the Appropriations Committee mark, would make \nthree clarifications. The first is that products which have not been \napproved in the United States may be imported for further processing, \nsuch as sterilization, and then exported.\n  The second change clarifies that FDA-approved insulin, antibiotic \ndrugs, and animal drugs which may be exported, subject to section \n801(e)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for other than \nFDA-approved indications need not also meet the labeling requirements \nof section 801(f).\n  The final change explains that products exported under section 802 \nmust, consistent with the requirements of section 201(m), include the \nlabeling required by the approving and importing country.\n  Next, I would like to discuss briefly the issue of the patent \nextension for the drug lodine that is contained in the House companion \nto this bill. We are all sensitive to the issue of legislating on \nappropriations bills. We all recognize the need to respect the process \nby which authorizing committees develop legislation.\n\n  But given the realities of the legislative calendar, we also know \nthere will be very limited opportunities to pass any new free-standing \nbills during the remainder of this session.\n  The plain truth of the matter is that between now and adjournment \nthere will be extraordinary pressures to attach amendments to any \nactive legislative vehicles and many of these will be appropriations \nmeasures.\n  During consideration of the issue related to pharmaceutical patents \nand GATT, the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the request of Senator \nSpecter, included a lodine patent extension provision and the bill was \napproved by the committee on May 2. In response to Senator Pryor's \nattempt to attach his version of pharmaceutical patent legislation on \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, S. 1745, I offered the \nJudiciary Committee compromise legislation, further modified by an \namendment by Senator Specter. This amendment, which was adopted on June \n27 by a 53-45 vote, also included the lodine amendment.\n  In my view, should it be considered advisable to retain lodine \nprovisions in the agriculture appropriations bill, I believe that the \nlanguage of the Judiciary Committee compromise amendment, already \npassed by the full Senate, is preferable to the House-passed language.\n  This is so because some have read the lodine provision adopted by the \nHouse to suspend the operation of the Bolar provisions of the Hatch-\nWaxman Act with respect to this one drug. This is the exception to the \ngeneral rule against patent infringement that allows generic drug \nfirms--and only generic drug firms--to test and seek FDA regulatory \napproval for their products prior to the expiration of the patent of \nthe pioneer product.\n  If this is the correct reading of the House language, the effect \nwould be to extend the exclusivity period for lodine for 2 to 5 years \nbeyond the 2 years nominally stated in the amendment. Two years should \nmean 2 years, not 5 or 7 years.\n  The Senate-passed lodine provision closely parallels the daypro \nprovision signed into law. We should retain this approach with lodine \nby adopting the Senate language contained in the DOD authorization.\n  I wish to also make a few comments about saccharin. The House bill \ncontains a 5-year extension on the ban to prevent FDA taking saccharin \noff the market. The Senate bill provides a 1 year extension for \nsaccharin.\n  Unless the Congress acts, the FDA will be compelled to enforce the \nmindless zero risk standard imposed by the Delaney Clause and ban \nsaccharin.\n  While I believe that this matter should be addressed through the \nauthorization process and that the Delaney Clauses be repealed, in the \nshort term, I believe it prudent to adopt the House's 5-year extension.\n  Let me say again that there are strong arguments to be made that an \nappropriations bill is not the best mechanism to legislate on such \ncontroversial matters as the Delaney Clauses. But some believe that the \nDelaney Clauses are too controversial to address in a comprehensive \nfashion when the FDA reform bill is taken up in the next weeks. This \nraises the question of whether the FDA authorizing statute--the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act--can be said to be truly reformed if the \nDelaney Clauses are left intact.\n\n  I know how I come out on that question because I am among those who \nbelieve that the Delaney Clauses are among the most illogical, \nunwarranted laws on the books.\n  In this regard, I must salute our colleagues in the House, who voted \nlast night 417 to 0 to do away with the Delaney provision in the \ncontext of pesticide residues. Our colleagues have much to be proud of \nin their unanimous decision to reject the zero risk stranglehold of \nDelaney with the new reasonable-certainty-of-no harm test.\n  It seems to me that the Congress should act favorably on the \npesticide provision and expeditiously act on the other areas affected \nby Delaney Clauses: food and color additives and animal drug residues.\n  Frankly, Congress long ago recognized, based on the established \nscience on the issue, that the benefits of saccharin exceed the risk.\n  While saccharin in high doses caused tumors in laboratory animals, \nFDA recognized that there is no evidence that this product has harmed \nhumans. Despite this, the law would have required FDA to ban the \nproduct unless the Congress overrode this particular application of the \nDelaney Clause.\n  Subsequent to the initial congressional action on this matter in \n1977, the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act, this moratorium was \nextended by Congress 6 more times, many times at my initiative and with \nbipartisan support.\n  Because, to my knowledge, no evidence has come to light that the risk \nof saccharin is any greater than previously thought, I see no more \nreason to ban this product today than existed in 1977. In fact, I \nunderstand that more recent studies indicate saccharin does not pose \nthe cancer risk in animals that it was thought to pose 20 years ago.\n  I do see many good reasons to change the Delaney Clause.\n  As a realist, I know that some would be tempted to take to the floor \nand debate this at length, so I cannot be certain that this battle will \nbe won quickly, or even this year. For that reason, I believe that the \n5-year extension in the House bill is preferable to the 1-year \nprovision currently in the Senate bill.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators \nHatfield, Cochran, Byrd and Bumpers, for their hard work in bringing \nforward these FDA provisions and also for their diligence in making \ncertain the agency is made more accountable to the public. These are \nthe first, and most important, steps in FDA reform.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are prepared now to announce that the \nindications are encouraging, that a number of amendments that have been \npending and are to be offered have been or are being resolved. We do \nhave a couple of amendments that we had hoped could be worked out but \nwe do not think can be worked out.\n  Senators are deciding now whether to withdraw those amendments, look \nfor another vehicle to offer the amendment on later, or offer the \nmatters as freestanding legislation. Let me just say, most of these \nissues--I think maybe all of them--involve legislation and really do \nnot deal with the funding levels in the bill.\n  We also have one other problem that has arisen because, since this \nbill funds the Department of Agriculture, Senators have amendments that \ncome under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service, legislative in \nnature. And\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nthe Forest Service really is not funded in this bill. The Forest \nService is funded in the Interior appropriations bill. So we are trying \nto encourage Senators who do have amendments that cannot be accepted on \nthis bill, to consider offering them as amendments to the Interior \nappropriations bill or as freestanding bills on another day.\n  Having said that, I think it is likely we are going to proceed very \nsoon, presenting those amendments, announcing the decision of Senators, \nand voting on those that require rollcall votes.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to my good friend from \nMississippi. I have a feeling that my amendment, while it comes close \nto his description, I am hoping it is somewhat outside the pale--an \nexpression that he, with his cosmopolitan and erudite upbringing, his \neducation in another part of the world dear to both of us, would \nunderstand, the expression, ``beyond the pale.'' So, I might try to \nbring it within the pale of acceptability. Since the managers are not \ntoo pressed for time, I was thinking, perhaps to give the Reporter of \nDebates a chance to rest a bit, I may suggest the absence of a quorum \nfor just a couple of moments so that we might reason together.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, what is the current status of the \nlegislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment before the Senate is \nBrown amendment No. 5002.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that amendment \nbe temporarily set aside so that I may speak on the bill in general.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, earlier there was discussion--not \ndiscussion, a statement on this floor--by a Senator on the Medguide. \nThe Medguide issue is an issue that arose in the Labor and Human \nResources Committee discussion of the Food and Drug Administration \nreform effort.\n  Medguide is an attempt by pharmacies and pharmacists to provide \nconsumers information relative to the drugs that are prescribed by \nthose pharmacists. The industry has attempted in the last few years to \nprepare software which would allow them to prepare leaflets and \ninformation for distribution to their patients, those seeking to have \ntheir prescriptions filled at the pharmacies, which would provide those \nconsumers with information about the impact of those drugs on their \nhealth, the dosage, what contraindications might be necessary; in other \nwords, warnings as to what the side effects are, warnings to not mix \nthese drugs with certain other drugs that the patient may be taking, \nand so forth.\n  An example of these are--I hold these up. Here is one from Eckerd, \n``RX Adviser,'' for the drug Novolin. It is easily readable. It \ndescribes the prescription number, the date on which the prescription \nwas filled, the directions to the individual taking the prescription, \nand then it lists how to use this medicine. It is formatted in bold \ntype. It has cautions and possible side effects, and it is very \nconsumer friendly. It catches your eye. It grabs your attention. It is \nin different colors.\n\n  Here is one from another pharmacy, CVS for Zantac, 300 milligram \ntablet. It again tells the prescription number, the name of the \nindividual it is prescribed for, how to take this medication, what the \nuses are, side effects, precautions, notes to the consumer--very \nhelpful information.\n  I have a whole raft of these that are currently being distributed and \nhanded out by pharmacies across the country. In fact, in 1995, it is \nestimated that nearly 65 percent of all patients received this \ninformation from their pharmacist, up from just 20 percent 3 years ago.\n  Now, many in the industry believe we have gone beyond that point. I \nthink that is a conservative estimate. Many believe we have already \nreached the 75-percent level of consumers receiving this information, \nwhich happens to be the goal set by Health and Human Services Healthy \nPeople 2000 Goal Program. So we are 4 years ahead of schedule with \nprivate industry. But now along comes the FDA saying: Oh, no. No, no, \nno. We do not trust the professionals to advise those taking these \nmedicines to do a competent job to provide necessary warnings, to \nprovide appropriate consumer information. We think this is something \nthat the Government needs to step in and regulate. And so we, the FDA, \nneed to make sure that these consumer information guides which are in \naddition to, by the way, the manufacturer's required printing of all of \nthe compounds that go into the drug--all of us have seen those. You get \nyour bottle of prescription drugs, and you pull out a piece of paper \nand you extend it out 2, 3, 4 feet and the print is so small that those \nof us over the age of 20 do not have the eyesight to read that. If we \ncould read it, we would not understand what it says. And so the \npharmacies have said let us boil this down into everyday common \nlanguage and make sure the consumers get the right information. But the \nFDA says we do not trust the industry to do that; we need to make sure \nthat we have a plan that will ensure that the information given to \nconsumers fits our requirements. And by the way, we are going to have \nto approve all of these proposals of information to make sure that it \nis not violating anything that the FDA wants to check. And so they have \nput out these nice, big, thick rules and regulations called \n``Prescription Drug Product Labeling, Medication Guide Requirements, \nProposed Rule,'' issued on August 24, 1995.\n  If you thought it was hard to read and understand the drug \nmanufacturer's instructions about drugs, you ought to try reading FDA's \nproposed rule. On and on it goes for page after page--nearly 100 pages \nof fine print now that everybody is going to have to sort through, \nevery manufacturer is going to have to sort through, adjust all of \ntheir information to the Government regulated point size of lettering, \nto the Government regulated headings. They are going to tell you what \nheadings you have to use. They are going to tell you what size of type \nyou are going to have to use.\n  Interestingly enough, the samples that FDA puts out which follow \ntheir recommended guidelines are only about one-tenth as intelligible \nas the information currently being distributed to the patients when \nthey receive their prescriptions. Typical Government bureaucratic \nineptitude, mediocrity, and obfuscation that we find in Government \nagency after Government agency advising consumers as to how to use a \nproduct or how not to use a product.\n\n  And so we bring in another Government agency to tell private industry \nwhat to do, and in telling them what to do they are going to turn a \nreadable, consumer-friendly product into your typical Government, IRS, \nunintelligible form of how to do all this.\n  Let me find this section here that describes some of the \nrequirements:\n\n       Format for Medication Guide.\n       The medication guide shall be printed in accordance with \n     all the following specifications:\n       A. The letter height or type shall be no smaller than 10 \n     points.\n\n  And they point out here that one point equals 0.0138 inches. See all \nthese people measuring with a little ruler here, is this greater than \n10 times 0.0138 inches?\n\n       For all sections of the medication guide except the \n     manufacturer's name and address and revision date.\n\n  Interestingly enough, they do not say how big the manufacturer's name \nand revision date are, probably the two most important pieces of \ninformation are not described here:\n\n       B. The medication guide shall be legible and clearly \n     presented.\n\n  Well, the current industry forms are very legible and very clearly \npresented. But does that satisfy the FDA? Oh, no. Oh, no. It has to be \nprinted and legible like the FDA forms that they provide as samples \nwhich, if anybody cares to look, are illegible and unintelligible.\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\n So we are going to go to the Government format for that. On and on it \ngoes:\n\n       The words ``Medication Guide'' must appear--\n\n  So forth and so on. And then here is the killer. Here is the killer. \nAnd this is why people ought to be concerned about FDA sticking its \nhead in here where it does not need to. This medication guide has to \nhave this verbatim statement.\n\n       This medication guide has been approved by the U.S. Food \n     and Drug Administration.\n\n  And that has to appear on the bottom of every medication guide.\n  The whole purpose for FDA reform is because you cannot get anything \napproved at FDA. And so instead of consumers receiving helpful \ninformation, they are going to be sitting around waiting for month \nafter month after month after month or year after year after year for \nFDA to approve the guide that tells them how to use the medicine. Now, \nFDA says: Oh, no. We can handle this without a problem.\n  They cannot handle anything else without a problem. Consumers not \nonly are unable to get the medications they need because FDA takes \nyears to approve it, now they are not even going to be able to get the \ninformation to use the medication because the FDA once again has to \napprove all of the information.\n  On and on this goes with prescription after prescription as to just \nhow these advisories should be put together.\n  I guarantee you, anybody who has had experience with FDA, anybody who \nhas listened to drug manufacturers or medical device manufacturers tell \nthe horror stories about getting even the most simple of medical \ndevices approved or even drugs that have been tested clinically \napproved, used for years in other countries without problem, yet cannot \nreceive approval here in the United States, will quickly realize the \nproblem that we are developing here.\n  So FDA now will create a whole new bureaucracy. They will create a \nwhole new process of making sure they approve all of the Medguide \nstatements.\n  Now, we took this issue up in committee, and in committee after \nsignificant discussion it was determined by a majority of members on a \nbipartisan basis--I believe the vote was 13 to 3. Members need to \nunderstand this is not a politically partisan debate. This is a debate \nbetween those who want to hold on to the status quo of mediocre, inept \nGovernment bungling and bureaucracy and those who think that maybe \nprivate industry has a more efficient, effective way to do it and \nperhaps can even protect the consumer a little more efficiently and \neffectively than FDA has been able to protect the consumer.\n  We have gone through several decades now of denying effective \ntreatment and drugs and devices to American consumers because FDA does \nnot have the capacity to adequately and on a timely basis examine and \napprove or disapprove submittals of either drugs or devices that can \nbenefit the consumer. I have a lot of manufacturers that would simply \nsay, if they would just call us up and tell us they would disapprove \nit, they would not have to go through this year after year after year \nof inept bureaucratic bungling to determine whether or not our product \nis going to be allowed to be marketed in the United States.\n  So, here we have another Big Government stride into a brand new area \nof regulation, regulation that currently is handled at the State level. \nState pharmacy boards traditionally regulate pharmacists, have the \nauthority to regulate pharmacists. They have been providing services to \nthe patients and consumers for a long, long time in this country.\n  We have now an FDA that will, again, issue a regressive regulation \nwhich will stifle innovation and changes in pharmacy information. We \nhave an FDA which will provide a one-size-fits-all, bureaucratically \nuniform style of type, style of heading, style of verbiage. Any of you \nwho have to struggle through, as I do every year, trying to read the \nIRS instructions as to how to fill out your income tax will understand \nthat somehow Government just cannot seem to get instructions into \ncommon, everyday language. I am afraid we will see more of that out of \nFDA.\n  The most ironic thing here is that people have been pleading with FDA \nfor more focus on their necessary items. No one is saying we ought to \nclose down FDA. We are simply saying, can you focus more of your \nresources and your effort on the more essential elements of your \nbusiness here? Yet now we are going to take already scarce, depleted \nresources and shift them and divert them from their primary focus of \nproviding safety and efficacy for drugs and devices and protecting the \nNation's food supply, to making sure that the information handed to the \nconsumer, which is a duplicate, which is in addition to all the \nrequirements that the drug manufacturer has to put in the medicine, \nconsumer-friendly information--we now have to make sure this complies \nand gets approval from the Food and Drug Administration. I think they \nought to spend more time approving drugs, more time approving devices, \nand less time worrying about whether this is 10-point type or 12-point \ntype.\n  How interesting to note that the advisories that we have examples of \nhere are far more readable, far more presentable and far more legible \nthan what the FDA, in their regulation, says it ought to be. The last \nthing a pharmacist or a pharmacy wants to do is hand its own customers \nsomething that is illegible. What they really want to do is hand them \nsomething that they can read and understand, because if they do that, \nthey will come back.\n  I get frustrated over this whole process, as you probably can tell. I \nam frustrated that we cannot proceed on meaningful FDA reform when we \nhave such a bipartisan consensus on doing this. The vote in the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee was 13 to 3. We had solid support from \nboth Democrats and Republicans on the need to do this. Yet, because FDA \nreform is stalled and cannot seem to work its way before the U.S. \nSenate, the Senator from Mississippi, whose committee has jurisdiction \nover the appropriations, took this portion of the proposal, which would \nimpose some requirements and restrictions to make sure these private \nadvisories comply with what is necessary, and incorporated that \nlanguage in the agriculture appropriations bill. Suddenly we have had \nthis big holdup here over whether or not this language ought to be \nhere.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is that some agreement has been \nreached on a watered down but hopefully still effective change in the \nlanguage, which will be the subject, apparently, of a colloquy that \nwill be coming shortly between the chairman of the committee and the \nSenator from Massachusetts. I hope the agreement which is reached is \nnot one that the FDA will find another excuse not to implement, because \nmy understanding is that the agreement is subject to the approval of \nthe Commissioner of the FDA, who is probably the biggest problem we \nhave at FDA right now.\n\n  One of the amendments I offered in committee was to limit the terms \nof FDA Commissioners because I think, if there is ever an argument for \nterm limitations, it is the current FDA Commissioner and the way that \nagency is being run. Hopefully, we can move forward now with something \nthat is of great benefit to the consumers of this country--nearly 65 to \n75 percent now receive these advisories--and not grind ourselves down \ninto a bureaucratic excuse for something that does not begin to measure \nup to the advisories that are currently out there. When are we going to \nlearn that all wisdom, all professionalism, does not rest in a \nGovernment agency; that industry has its own, the private sector has \nits own motivations for protecting the consumer? Besides, States have \nthe ability, and State pharmacy boards have the ability, to impose some \nreasonable regulations on their own pharmacists and their own \npharmacies.\n  Mr. President, I wish we were debating FDA reform, because it looks \nlike we may go another session of Congress without any meaningful \nreforms in a process that denies patients and consumers in this country \nsometimes life-saving drugs.\n  The question is asked, what if FDA did not take this time to approve \nsome of these medicines? The question also has to be asked, how many \npeople have suffered, or perhaps needlessly died, because FDA was not \nable, on a timely basis, to approve life-saving drugs or devices? There \nis a backlog that is staggering at FDA. There is an ineptitude that is \nstaggering out there. I do\n\n[[Page S8611]]\n\nnot trace it to the good scientists who are working there and \nclinicians who are working there. I trace it to an inept bureaucracy \nwhich often seems to have motivations beyond the health and safety of \nconsumers. I think it is time we did something about it, and I am glad \nwe are taking this one small step to benefit the consumers. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Mississippi for working out an agreement \nhere so we can accept this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the original \nMedGuide provision that was included as part of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill. The Agriculture Appropriations bill contained the \nlanguage on the MedGuide issue that was overwhelmingly passed by the \nLabor Committee by a vote of 13 to 3 during the markup of S. 1477, the \nFDA reform bill, in March.\n  This provision in the Agriculture bill required the Secretary of HHS \nto request, within 30 days after enactment, that national consumer, \nindustry and practitioner groups work together to develop a plan for \nthe distribution of high quality, helpful consumer information about \nprescription drugs, such as adverse reactions and product combination \nproblems.\n  It provided the opportunity for the private sector to continue \nbuilding on its marked successes in this area over the last several \nyears. By FDA's own survey, the percentage of consumers receiving \nsubstantial written information about their prescription increased from \n32 percent to 59 percent between 1992 and 1994. There is no reason to \nbelieve that pharmacists will either suddenly begin to perform this \ntask more poorly, nor any reason to think that the goal of 75 percent \nby the year 2000--shared by FDA and professionals practicing pharmacy--\nwill not be voluntarily achieved, without FDA getting involved.\n  It called for an approach to public policy that is flexible, \nsufficiently specific and comprehensive so as to meet consumers' needs, \nand neither promotional nor so technical that it is of no use to the \nconsumer. The information has to be legible, comprehensible, and \naccurate.\n  This amendment did not do one thing--it did not allow the FDA to \nexpend its limited funds to implementing its MedGuide regulation.\n  The FDA cannot afford diversions from their mission to review and \napprove quality, and often life-saving, products. This is clear from \nthe numerous hearings we have held, reports that have published, and \ncomplaints we have heard from the FDA itself--``Give us more resources. \nGive us more time to do our job.''\n  The FDA regulation would require every pharmacist to provide specific \ninformation to patients each time they fill a prescription. While FDA \nclaims the regulation is voluntary, if 75 percent of consumers are not \nreceiving the formatted information by 2000, the regulation becomes \nmandatory.\n  Well, there is nothing voluntary about this regulation--pharmacists \nwill no longer be able to craft written information to meet individual \npatients' needs if this regulation is imposed. There is also nothing \nvoluntary about imposing a $121 million cost annually on pharmacists \nand manufacturers, according to the FDA's own calculation. FDA's \ncalculation determined the program would cost individual pharmacies at \nleast $1,500 to comply, equaling $106.7 million a year. Manufacturers \nare expected to spend $5,000 to $12,000 per medication guide developed, \nor at least $14.4 million annually.\n  And who do you think those costs will be passed on to? The consumer.\n  One must also consider that the practice of pharmacy has always been \nregulated at the State level--FDA may not regulate the practice of \nmedicine. FDA only has product labeling authority, not the accompanying \ninformation.\n  There is also a great deal of concern that this regulation also has \nnot taken into account the expanded liability it imposes on \npharmacists. Pharmacists not only have the ability to tailor \ninformation to suit the patient, they are able to phrase--and sometimes \nrephrase--information in a way that the patient understands. Going to a \none-size-fits-all information standard will defeat this important \npurpose of pharmacy as the pharmacist will be prevented from serving as \nthe learned intermediary.\n  The provision in the underlying bill would have had the same goals as \nMedGuide: 75 percent consumer receipt by the year 2000; a way to assess \nthe effectiveness of any consumer information distribution system; and \na measure of the quality of the information being distributed. This \nprovision would not have simply cut the FDA out of the process--\ninstead, it provided a 120-day stay of execution from the FDA rule. \nAfter that, if the private sector failed to respond, the Secretary of \nHHS could proceed with the detailed regulation proposed by the FDA.\n  This regulation is not only a poor priority for the Commissioner--he \nhas stated it is his No. 1 issue--and an inappropriate use of limited \nfunding, it is also beyond the general authority of the FDA. While we \nall would agree that it is important that the consumer get the \ninformation they need, as their circumstances call for, I don't \nunderstand how the FDA can believe it is somehow more capable of \ntelling Americans what they must, and cannot, know than the pharmacists \nserving consumers on a daily basis.\n  Mr. President, I think the FDA has enough to do already without \nbreaking new regulatory ground, especially where the private sector is \nalready rising to the task at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n                           Amendment No. 5003\n\n       (Purpose: To protect the public health)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside for an amendment that I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I want to say how pleased I am that we \nhave managed to work through our concerns with my friends from \nMississippi and\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\nIndiana on the language relating to adequate consumer labeling for \nprescription drugs that is in the Agricultural Appropriations bill. The \nchanges that they have graciously agreed to will address my concerns \nthat the provisions need to contain safeguards to ensure that the \nvoluntary plan developed by organizations representing health care \nprofessionals, consumers, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, \ndatabase companies, and other interested parties will be adequate.\n  I am concerned, however, that when this provision goes to conference \nwith the different House language, that all our hard work in coming to \nthis agreement may go by the wayside. It is critical that I have the \nword of my friend from Mississippi that the conference not limit the \nauthority of the Secretary and the FDA to assure provision of \ninformation to the public beyond the provisions of section 601 as \namended.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts, and I can \nassure him that, while I am not able to speak for the entire conference \ncommittee, I will do my best to reach a compromise on this issue that \nwill not place further limits on the authority on the Secretary and the \nFDA with regard to this important public health issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is no objection. We have reviewed \nit, and we thank very much the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Indiana and others who have worked to negotiate \nthis agreement.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say, the amendment has been \ncleared on this side. It has taken all afternoon to craft this \namendment in a form which is acceptable to all sides.\n  I compliment Senator Kennedy for his tenacity and determination in \ngetting this accomplished. It is a very, very worthwhile amendment in \nthis Senator's opinion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5003) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor. I \nappreciate the cooperation of all in working through this amendment--\nSenator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, Senator Coats and others.\n  I will not delay the Senate, but I must say, I will add a word of \ncommendation for Dr. Kessler. I have a strong difference of opinion \nabout his service in the FDA. The FDA has been a whipping boy, \nparticularly in recent times, but I do think if we look at the most \nrecent GAO reports, look at the breakthroughs of new drugs getting out \nto the people in this country and look at the assault that has been \nmade on the FDA by the tobacco industry and other groups, his service \nwill go down as a distinguished one.\n  Just a final point, Mr. President. This whole issue really is not \nabout bureaucracy, it is about information--useful, readable, \nunderstandable information about prescription drugs that can make a \ndifference in terms of an individual's quality of health.\n  Mr. President, we do it with regard to dog food, we do it with regard \nto Wheaties, we do it with over-the-counter drugs. We can do a better \njob.\n  I am very hopeful the job will be done through the voluntary systems \nthat are being set up now; that it will be given a reasonable time, \nalthough all of us are very hopeful that will be successful.\n  I am grateful to the floor managers for accepting this amendment. I \nthank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, has the Kennedy amendment been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4987\n\n(Purpose: To implement the recommendations of the Northern Forest Lands \n                                Council)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \ncall up amendment No. 4987, which is at the desk. It is the Northern \nForests Stewardship Act, which is sponsored by me and cosponsored by \nSenators Jeffords, Gregg, Smith, Snowe, Cohen, Moynihan, Kennedy, and \nKerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment, which affects \nthe Northern Forests of the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine \nespecially, makes sure the rights and responsibilities of the \nlandowners are emphasized. The primacy of our States, that means very \nmuch to each of us, is reinforced, the traditions of the region are \nprotected, but we have the advantage of using new ways of achieving our \ngoals in forestry and the use of our land and ways to do it that did \nnot even exist a few years ago. It is a case where we have had \ncitizens, landowners, foresters, and everybody else come together with \na plan that actually works.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nand others who worked with us this afternoon to get this through. I \nyield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Leahy to include a revised version of S. 1163, the Northern \nForest Stewardship Act, in H.R. 3603. I thank my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, for his hard work on this legislation, and I \nthank the other cosponsors of the bill for their efforts. I would also \nlike to thank Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and \nthe managers of the bill before us, Senator Cochran and Senator \nBumpers, for their cooperation and acceptance of this amendment.\n  Let me state at the outset what this amendment is not because I would \nlike to clear up any misconceptions that may exist. This amendment does \nnot, in any way, provide the Federal Government with new regulatory \nauthority. This amendment does not, in any way, permit the Federal \nGovernment to intrude, uninvited, upon the affairs of any State. This \namendment does not, in any way, allow the Federal Government to assume \ncontrol over private timberlands in the Northern Forest region. This \namendment does not, in any way, impose Federal mandates on the Northern \nForest States. In actuality, the amendment reaffirms the primacy of the \nNorthern Forest States in the management of their forests, and it is \nintended to help the States do what they want to do on these issues. \nThat is why the affected States support this bill. A simple reading of \nthe legislation will make these facts abundantly evident.\n  Six years ago, the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New \nYork created the Northern Forest Lands Council to study problems facing \nthe Northern Forest region, and to issue recommendations for State and \nFederal policies that would help to maintain the traditional patterns \nof land ownership and use in the region. The council was formed in \nresponse to public fears of significant conversion of the Northern \nForest Lands to nonforest uses. These fears had been stoked by the \nattempted sale of Diamond International's timberland holdings by Sir \nJames Goldsmith, who had acquired Diamond in a hostile takeover in \n1987.\n  It goes without saying that the 26-million-acre Northern Forest \nregion is an extraordinary resource. It provides the largest expanse of \nunbroken forestland east of the Mississippi River. These forests \nprovide excellent outdoor recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife \nhabitat, and breathtaking scenic vistas. But these lands also form the \nfoundation of the livelihoods of thousands of people in the region who \nharvest trees from the forest, and who convert the trees into valuable \nproducts like paper, lumber, and furniture. The Northern Forest is, and \nalways has been, a multiple use forest.\n  The council, which consisted of representatives from each State and \nfrom each of the major stakeholder groups with an interest in the \nforest, spent roughly 4 years and millions of dollars collecting and \nanalyzing data, consulting with State officials, and holding many \nmeetings and discussions with the public throughout the region. The \ncouncil completed its recommendations in September 1994, and then \ndisbanded. In its final report, the council requested that the U.S. \nCongress enact legislation to implement its Federal recommendations \nbeginning in 1995. This legislation is the culmination of the council \nprocess, a process, I might add, that fostered very beneficial new\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nworking relationships between industry, landowners, and the \nenvironmental community on the critical issues related to our forests.\n\n  The Leahy amendment embodies the latest version of S. 1163. This bill \nhas undergone a series of revisions based on numerous comments from a \ndiverse collection of individuals, organizations, businesses, and \nStates in the region. And I think this bill responds to the opinions \nand recommendations of such a diverse group as well as any one bill \ncan. The Northern Forest Lands process has always operated out of a \nstrong desire for consensus, and the legislation before us reflects the \ndesire of Senators from the Northern Forest region to maintain that \npractice.\n  At its most basic, the Northern Forest Stewardship Act is designed to \nhelp conserve the Northern Forest lands, and its many values, for \nfuture generations. But unlike some past approaches to resource \nconservation in the Congress, this bill puts States in the driver's \nseat, which is most appropriate in this case because the great majority \nof these lands are privately-owned. In effect, the legislation assigns \nthe Federal Government a role as cooperator in the region, consistent \nwith the council's recommendations. It authorizes Federal agencies, \nprimarily the State and Private Forestry division of the U.S. Forest \nService, to provide technical and financial assistance to the Northern \nForest States for activities such as developing benchmarks of \nsustainable forest management, conducting forest research, conserving \nvaluable forest lands, and assessing water quality trends in the \nregion. But the bill makes clear that this assistance can only be \nprovided if the individual States request it. If the States do not \nrequest it, then no assistance can be provided under this legislation.\n  As a region characterized by the private ownership of timberland, the \nlegislation is replete with references and provisions reaffirming \nprivate property rights. The Land Conservation section, for instance, \nprohibits the use of any Federal funds authorized by this legislation \nfor State land acquisition projects unless the owner willingly offers \nthe property for sale.\n  Recognizing the economic importance of the forest to the people who \nlive in the region, the Leahy amendment also authorizes technical and \nfinancial assistance to the States, the forest products industry, and \nlocal communities to help expand value-added production and create \nsustainable new jobs in the forest products sector.\n  Mr. President, as I said before, the basic purpose of this \nlegislation is to implement the council's recommendations, and I think \nthe bill succeeds on that account. But I want to point out that one \nvery important component of the council's report has been necessarily \nomitted from this bill, and that is Federal tax policy.\n  The council recognized that Federal taxes can create negative \nincentives that discourage landowners from maintaining their lands as \nforest, and it recommended changes to the Internal Revenue Code that \nwould help reverse these incentives and encourage landowners to keep \ntheir lands forested. The council's recommendations emphasized reforms \nof estate taxes, capital gains taxes on timber sales, and passive loss \nrules for forest management, and they have been incorporated in a \nseparate bill, S. 692, which was introduced by Senator Gregg, and which \nI have cosponsored. As a tax bill, this legislation will obviously have \nto proceed on a separate track through the Finance Committee, and, \ntherefore, we were not able to include it in this amendment. But the \nNorthern Forest Senators remain committed to it, and, in fact, we \nincluded language in the findings section of this legislation stating \nthat Congress and the President should enact additional legislation to \naddress the tax policies that negatively influence the stewardship of \nour forest lands. We hope to get these tax changes included in the next \nmajor tax bill that comes before the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to address a few specific criticisms \nof the original version of S. 1163, and describe the way in which we \nhave modified the bill language as a result. The cosponsors agreed to \nrevise the Principles of Sustainability section so that it now reads as \na sense-of-the-Congress resolution. Concern had been expressed that the \nprovision, as previously drafted, could be loosely interpreted to \nimpose a set of national best management practices for private \ntimberlands, and that was not our intent at all. The latest change \neliminates the possibility of such an interpretation in the future. We \nchanged the Congressional ``Declarations'' section to a ``Findings'' \nsection, conforming it to the traditional format for Federal \nlegislation, and making it clear that this provision does not, in any \nway, create any new legal authorities.\n  In the Land Conservation section, the legislation has been modified \nto clarify that Federal funding for land acquisition under the act can \nonly be provided as part of a State-managed public land acquisition \nprocess, which is a policy with which most stakeholders in the region \nagree.\n  What we have before us today, Mr. President, is a responsible \nproposal to encourage and facilitate the conservation of the Northern \nForest resource for its outstanding ecological, economic, and \nrecreational values. In keeping with longstanding tradition in the \nregion, the States will lead the effort on Northern Forest-related \npolicy issues, but the Federal Government should be available to assist \nthe States in their efforts if called upon to do so, and this bill will \nhelp to ensure that appropriate assistance is available. The Northern \nForest Stewardship Act offers a reasonable, constructive, and \nconsensus-oriented approach to forest management in our region.\n  This legislation enjoys the support of the four Northern Forest \nStates, a wide range of environmental organizations, the Maine Forest \nProducts Council, and major newspapers in Maine. This is one bill that \nis truly both pro-environment and pro-economy. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will support the Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me state this amendment has been \nreviewed. It has been cleared on this side. I commend and thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont for his cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4987) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5004\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration. I think this has been cleared by both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5004.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . BARLEY PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 113 of Public Law 104-127 is amended by inserting a \n     new subsection (g) that reads:\n       ``(g) Adjustment in Barley Allocation.--In addition to the \n     adjustments required under subsection (c), the amount \n     allocated under subsection (b) for barley contract payments \n     shall be increased by $20,000,000 in fiscal year 1998, and \n     shall be reduced by $5,000,000 in each of fiscal years 1999-\n     2002.''\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is an adjustment in the barley \nallocation in the farm bill. It seemed as though when we were making \nthe transition payments on all commodities and program crops, barley \nand their producers were penalized more than anybody else in making the \nadjustments. In fact, all other commodities, all other program crops \nwere adjusted just slightly lower, with the exception of rice, and it \nactually went up. The barley payment was adjusted a good whopping 30 \npercent lower, 14 cents a bushel.\n  What this amendment does is it moves money from the outyears to the \nnearby years: $20 million in this fiscal year and then taking from the \nnext 4 years, the outyears, $5 million. In other words, we are going to \nincrease\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nthe payment about a nickel this year, and then we will be subtracting \nabout a penny from the outyears in year 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n  So with that, it will make an adjustment this year. I think this is a \nshort-term solution. After talking with my colleague from Montana and \nmy friends from North Dakota, we realize this is a short-term solution, \nand I think we have to look at a longer term to make the adjustment to \nmake it fair. That is all we are asking for barley producers across \nAmerica, is fairness. I think there has to be a long-term solution \nmade.\n  Mr. President, I ask for its adoption, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support the effort of my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Burns. This is not any of our preferred solutions to \nthe problem faced by our barley producers. Very frankly, the barley \nfarmers have been left short. They were told very clearly last year \nthat if the new farm bill passed, they would get 46 cents a bushel. \nSomebody made a mistake. It is still not clear to me who did or \nprecisely how they did, but the fact is, a mistake was made. Instead of \ngetting 46 cents, barley producers are going to get 32 cents, 30 \npercent less.\n  Very clearly, farmers were told 46 cents. They were told the prices \nand amounts that were going to be paid were estimates, no question \nabout that. But they were told, and told repeatedly, that the amounts \nthat they would actually receive would be close to those estimates. I \nwas in dozens of meetings where they were told it would be close to \nthose estimates; maybe a few cents difference.\n  And, indeed, if you look at corn, they were told it was going to be \n27 cents. It turned out to be 24 cents. On wheat, they were told it was \ngoing to be 92 cents. It turned out to be 87 cents. Everybody \nunderstood those differences. But when it comes to barley, they were \ntold 46 cents, and it turned out to be 32 cents. Not a 5-percent \ndifference, not a 10-percent difference, a 30-percent difference. Is \nthere any wonder that barley producers across the country are \nwondering, is there anything straight that comes out of Washington?\n  They were told clearly and directly that if they signed up to this \nfarm bill that 46 cents is what they could expect to receive. That is \nnot what they are getting, that is not what they are receiving, and it \nis not right.\n  There ought to be an adjustment. Many of us prefer we make this \nadjustment up front, clearly, and we take it out of the EEP program, or \nwe take it out of some other approach, some other way of paying for it, \nbut that it be paid for. In discussing it with our colleagues, it was \nclear that at this stage, that was not going to be acceptable.\n  So the Senator from Montana has come up with an approach to bring \nmoney from later years up front to reduce this differential on the hope \nand the expectation that perhaps as we go through the process, we can \nget this problem solved in a more appropriate way.\n  I think on that basis this approach deserves support, because, \nhopefully, in the conference committee, we can get a better resolution. \nAgain, I think it is just a fundamental question of whether or not we \ntreat our barley producers in this country in a fair way.\n  I salute my colleague from Montana for his efforts. I thank the Chair \nand yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ever so briefly agree with my \ncolleagues. I support the efforts of the Senator from Montana. We had a \nnumber of meetings today with the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Larry Craig, Senator Conrad, myself, and \nothers. This is not the preferred solution. I do not view this as a \ndestination. I view this as a step on the way to where we want to get \nto solve this issue.\n\n  Senator Conrad said it clearly. The proposal was made that barley \ngrowers would receive fixed payments and the first year would be 46 \ncents. That turns out not to be 46 cents at all but instead 32 cents a \nbushel. That may not mean much to people, unless you raise some barley \nand discover that your expected income is now 30 percent lower than you \nanticipated when you heard about this program and developed support for \nthe program based on the representation of what the fixed payments \nwould be in the farm program.\n  So we will go to conference. This is a device and a mechanism by \nwhich this issue can go to conference. My hope is that this issue will \nbe resolved in conference the way it should be resolved. It should be \nresolved by providing for barley producers what they were told they \nwould receive as fixed payments in the farm bill. The failure to do \nthat, it seems to me, really places at risk the credibility with \nrespect to this farm program.\n  I again support the efforts of the Senator from Montana as a step \ntoward a destination that would make the barley producers whole. Mr. \nPresident, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank Senators who have been \nworking to resolve this issue for their efforts. A great deal of work \nhas gone into crafting this amendment. I compliment particularly the \nSenator from Montana [Mr. Burns]. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are going to continue to monitor this \nsituation. We hope that this is helpful. As we go into conference, we \nwill work to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the Senate. With \nthat, I know of no objections to the legislation. I hope that we can \nproceed to adopt it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5004) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for one moment so I might thank \nthe chairman and the ranking member for their patience as we worked to \nresolve this matter? We very much appreciate your assistance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator for his kind comments. \nWe appreciate his good efforts, as well.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5002, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the pending amendment \nnow is the Brown amendment, as modified. I know of no objection to the \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that we adopt the amendment and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays are vitiated. The amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5002), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4978, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know that the next amendment is the \nKerrey amendment No. 4978. Senator Kerrey has offered this along with \ntwo other amendments. Those other amendments were agreed to. I have \nbeen authorized to ask that the Kerrey amendment No. 4978 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4978) was withdrawn.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 5005 Through 5009, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I now have a series of amendments which I \nwill send to the desk en bloc and ask that they be reported and agreed \nto en bloc; an amendment on behalf of Senator Simpson; an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Hatfield; an amendment I send to the desk for and on \nbehalf of the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Kempthorne; an amendment I send \nto the desk on behalf of the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby; an \namendment by Senator Domenici which is cosponsored by Senators Helms, \nThurmond, Faircloth, and Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is nothing more precious to New \nMexico, and to the arid Southwest in general, than water. \nUnfortunately, precipitation in the Southwest this year has been, in a \nword, disastrous. Precipitation and snow melts in almost every New \nMexico basin are dangerously below average. Despite recent rains, \nstream flows in New Mexico are still predicted to be 33 to 100 percent \nbelow average through the summer, with no end in sight. If the drought \ncontinues, and there is every indication that it will, the consequences \nto New Mexico will be truly devastating.\n  No sector in New Mexico has been hit harder by the drought than its \nfarmers and ranchers. Water levels in the Middle Rio Grande have \ndropped severely, leading to radically decreased water availability for \nthe hundreds of irrigators depending on that water. Farmers in the \nsouthern part of the State are being forced to go to water wells, thus \ndepleting the already-taxed aquifer. And in northeastern New Mexico, \nwinter wheat is failing for the first time in anyone's memory.\n  Additionally, the drought has wiped out forage for New Mexico's \nlivestock producers, causing an industry already hit hard by high feed \nprices to hurt even more. In fact, this drought has devastated crops \nand livestock in my State to such an extent that every single county in \nNew Mexico is currently eligible for USDA's disaster assistance \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, one of the programs that has been crucial in helping \nthe farmers and ranchers of my State cope with this disaster is the \nUSDA's emergency disaster loan program. Funding for this program this \nyear may soon run out, however. As a consequence, the Western \nGovernors' Association has identified supplemental funding for \nemergency disaster loans as a top priority.\n  Our amendment will ensure that this much-needed emergency loan \nprogram remains funded in the event of a shortfall in this fiscal year. \nThe contingency funding will also remain available in the event of a \nshortfall in fiscal year 1997. Specifically, our amendment provides an \nadditional $25 million for the program as an emergency supplemental \nappropriation, which will allow for an additional $98 million in \nemergency disaster loans. The additional funding in the amendment would \nonly become available if the administration determines that other \nfunding sources have been exhausted.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate that this drought is one \nof the worst calamities to hit my State, and the Southwest in general, \nin the last 50 years. Our amendment for supplemental funding of USDA's \nemergency loan program will ensure that desperately needed relief will \ncontinue to be given to those people who have been hardest hit by this \ndisaster.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the eastern North Carolina \nfarmers whose crops were devastated by Hurricane Bertha, I am happy to \ncosponsor this proposal to provide emergency loan assistance to \nfarmers.\n  On July 12, Hurricane Bertha ripped through the eastern part of North \nCarolina, destroying an estimated 80 percent of the State's tobacco \ncrop and up to 90 percent of the corn crops in some counties. Cotton \nand soybeans also were damaged.\n  Bertha was particularly devastating because it hit right before \nharvest season, ravaging crops in their most vulnerable stages. \nEstimates of the total damage to North Carolina agriculture continue to \nclimb and currently stand at $188 million. Many North Carolina farmers \nsuffered total losses of their 1996 crops.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will provide emergency loans, approved \nby the USDA for farmers seeking a way to recover from the financial \nlosses imposed by the hurricane. It will enable farmers to purchase the \ninputs such as fertilizer, seed, and equipment needed to put crops back \ninto the ground.\n  The early extension of credit to qualified farmers is essential to \nmove them beyond this natural tragedy. I've been contacted by many of \nthese farmers, Mr. President; for example, Ronnie and W.C. Cox who are \nfifth generation corn, cotton, and tobacco farmers in Onslow County. \nTheir 300 acres of corn were totally destroyed along with 75 percent of \ntheir 225 acres of their tobacco crop. Cotton and other crops were \nlikewise severely damaged.\n  These farmers aren't asking for a free ride, Mr. President. The Coxes \nin Onslow County wrote to me saying, ``We do not want grants or \nhandouts. But, we do need to borrow $750,000 or $1 million for 3 to 5 \nyears at a low interest rate.''\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment will extend a helping hand to these \nembattled farmers and thereby help them to help themselves. It's the \nright thing to do--at the right time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

I especially want to thank and compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas for his strong leadership and for \nhis efforts to get a good bill passed by the Senate. We could not have \ndone it either without the capable staff assistants: Becky Davies, Hunt \nShipman, Jimmie Reynolds, Galen Fountain--all of whom worked very \ndiligently, expertly, and professionally. They reflect credit on the \nSenate. We are very proud of them.\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me echo what the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi has just said.\n  First, let me say--I do not say this to be all that gracious but to \nsimply state as fact--that the Senator from Mississippi's patience is \nmuch greater than mine. There were times this afternoon when I grew \nterribly frustrated about the pace of the proceedings, and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi kept assuring me that negotiations would pay off and \nthat we would get the bill passed in due time. Of course, he was dead \nright. But more importantly than that, he is a very gifted legislator \nand a man of great patience and intellect. And it is a real pleasure \nfor me to work with him as the ranking member on this committee. I \nthank him for his really truly magnificent work on the bill.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank Becky Davies, Jimmy Reynolds, \nand Hunt Shipman of Senator Cochran's staff; and my own staff, Galen \nFountain. If we choose to tell the truth, we will admit that is where \nmost of the work was done. We could not have done it without them. I \nwant to pay special tribute to the staff.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Mr. President, I believe the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas wishes to conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, be added as a \ncosponsor of the Burns barley amendment that passed immediately \npreceding the passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, for his outstanding work on this major \npiece of legislation. He showed real leadership once again and, of \ncourse, his colleague, the ranking member on the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, did a great job.\n  Earlier today it was not clear at all how long this was going to \ntake. But the fact of the matter is they only spent just a little over \na day getting this job done even though it spread out over 3 days. It \nis a very important major accomplishment, and I thank them for their \nwork. I commend all of our colleagues who worked through a lot of very \ndifficult issues that affect a lot of States. They came to conclusion, \nand I appreciate very much the good work that they did.\n  As a result of that our intent now is to go to the foreign ops \nappropriations bill. The manager, the chairman, the Senator from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, is here, and the ranking member is ready \nto go. We will go right to that.\n  There will be no further rollcall votes tonight. We wanted to confirm \nthat this is the last vote of tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8602-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8617-S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Congress finds that progress on the peace \n     process in the Middle East is vitally important to United \n     States security interests in the region. The Congress \n     recognizes that, in fulfilling its obligations under the \n     Treaty of Peace Between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the \n     State of Israel, done at Washington on March 26, 1979, Israel \n     incurred severe economic burdens. Furthermore, the Congress \n     recognizes that an economically and militarily secure Israel \n     serves the security interests of the United States, for a \n     secure Israel is an Israel which has the incentive and \n     confidence to continue pursuing the peace process. Therefore, \n     the Congress declares that, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, it is the policy and the intention of the \n     United States that the funds provided in annual \n     appropriations for the Economic Support Fund which are \n     allocated to Israel shall not be less than the annual debt \n     repayment (interest and principal) from Israel to the United \n     States Government in recognition that such a principle serves \n     United States interests in the region.\n\n\n   PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS AND INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION\n\n       Sec. 518.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n       Nanette K. Laughrey, of Missouri, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Eastern and Western Districts of \n     Missouri.\n       Dean D. Pregerson, of California, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Central District of California.\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF DEAN D. PREGERSON\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority and minority \nleaders as well as the Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, and \nranking member, Senator Biden, for moving an outstanding judicial \nnominee, Dean Douglas Pregerson, to the floor for confirmation to the \nUnited States District Court for the Central District of California.\n  The Central District of California includes the counties of Los \nAngeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa \nBarbara and Ventura.\n  Dean Pregerson has been a practicing attorney in California and in \nthe Territory of Guam for the past 18 years. He has tremendous \nexperience in a broad range of legal issues and a record of exceptional \nperformance in many different aspects of the practice of law. He has \nbeen a public defender, a legal aid lawyer, and a litigator of a wide \nvariety of civil and criminal matters in both State and Federal courts. \nHe is currently a partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Pregerson, \nRichman and Luna, where he has personally litigated many issues, \nincluding contract and commercial actions, intellectual property \nmatters, and personal injury disputes.\n  Mr. Pregerson has a long record of service to his community. For the \npast 5 years, he has been a board member of Bet Tzedek Legal Services, \nwhich provides free legal help to about 12,000 Los Angelenos a year. He \nis on the advisory board of the GSA/Salvation Army homeless shelter of \nBell, CA, which provides food, housing, and other services to more than \n200 men and women each day. He began his service for the Recreation and \nParks Commission of Los Angeles in 1989, and served a term as its \npresident. He has been a member of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \nCommission.\n  Dean Pregerson has garnered high praise from many colleagues and \nassociates. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, in a letter to Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Hatch in February of this year, said he, ``strongly \nsupports Dean's nomination'' and believes that he will be a judge ``who \ncombines legal talents with a firm commitment to uphold the traditional \nand proper role of the judiciary.'' Los Angeles Sheriff Sherman Block \nwrites that Dean Pregerson will be ``tough, fair-minded, and committed \nto enforcing the law'' as a Federal judge and he conveys his strong \nsupport for his confirmation.\n  Again, I commend our leaders for bringing this nomination to the \nfloor and confirming an individual who will be a great asset to the \nFederal bench and to the State of California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8617-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this year the foreign operations bill \nprovides $12.246 billion to administer our foreign assistance programs. \nThis slightly exceeds the bill signed into law last year but is more \nthan $700 million below the administration's request. Although this is \na substantial reduction, I believe we have crafted a bill which \naddresses congressional concerns about balancing the budget while \ncontinuing to serve vital U.S. national security priorities.\n  Let me briefly review both the funding levels and policy provisions \nwhich advance our common international interests.\n  In title I, we have provided $632 million for export promotion \nprograms. The Trade Development Agency and the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation are fully funded, and the Export-Import Bank is \nnear the request level.\n  Virtually all of us have learned of the direct benefit these programs \nhave had in securing new markets and opportunities for American \nbusiness. While some people have expressed concern about our \nsubsidizing American corporations, this support we offer in this bill \nis a reflection of how competitive the international market has become. \nI believe our export promotion programs are essential to our long-term \neconomic security.\n\n  If you have any doubt about the significance of this funding, there \nis one statistic which makes clear how important our competition thinks \nthese programs are. Last year the Export-Import Bank extended $2.9 \nbillion in loans. Its Japanese counterpart provided $19.3 billion in \nsupport.\n  While I am a strong supporter of the Bank, I have been deeply \nconcerned about recent management problems. Both the Office of \nPersonnel Management and the General Accounting Office investigated the \nBank's misuse of certain salary-related authorities. In a 1995 audit, \nOPM concluded that retention allowances have been granted to \napproximately 200 of the Bank's 450 employees ``contrary to law and \nregulation.'' Instead of meeting the legal requirement of establishing \nan employee's unique qualifications and intent to leave Government \nservice, the current management at the Bank treated retention \nallowances as performance bonuses.\n  While the problem was drawn to White House attention, the acting \nChairman's nomination pending before the Banking Committee was \nresubmitted as a recess appointment. This has prompted the committee to \nlimit funding for the Chairman's salary until this matter can be fully \nreviewed in the context of a nomination hearing.\n  Let me now turn to title II. We have provided $1.7 billion in funding \nfor development assistance, including child survival programs, and the \nDevelopment Fund for Africa, the Inter-American Foundation and the \nAfrican Development Foundation. This level is close to the \nadministration's request and was a high priority of Senator Leahy and a \nmajority of the members of the committee.\n  Within the bilateral aid account there are a handful of earmarks \nincluding funds for Camp David Partners, Burma and Cyprus.\n  Given our strong interest in securing the transition of free market \ndemocracies, we have fully funded the administration's request for the \nNew Independent States of the former Soviet Union. In addition to \nearmarking levels of support for Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia, the \nbill provides funding for safety programs at nuclear reactors, small \nbusiness development, strengthening agricultural productivity, and \ntreatment for children who are victims of the Chernobyl disaster.\n  While not in statute, I want to take note of important report \nlanguage regarding Russia.\n  President Yeltsin has made a lot of extravagant financial pledges on \nthe campaign trail which must be reconsidered if the nation is to stay \nwithin IMF fiscal guidelines and sustain economic reforms. The \ncommittee points out that the outcome of the elections reflects U.S. \nassistance is less important\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\nthan the political and economic choices Russia's citizens and leaders \nwill make in the coming months.\n  The report states that this is an important transition year for \nRussia. With over $10 billion in IMF loan commitments and $4.2 billion \nin United States bilateral support, it is the committee's expectation \nthat most aid will be phased out and that Russia will graduate from our \nforeign operations programs in fiscal 1997.\n  Let me now address the independent agencies which are also funded in \ntitle II. Given the strong bipartisan support for the Peace Corps, we \nwere able to come close to the administration's request and provide a \ntotal in resources of $217 million.\n  The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program has been \nincreased substantially over last year's level from $115 million to \n$160 million. I continue to be deeply concerned that the administration \nmade the decision to shift resources away from transit countries to \nsource countries. Long-term, this approach may make sense, but the \nreductions in the transit country effort seem to have been made well \nbefore the source country strategy and programs had been put in place. \nHopefully, the strong funding level will assure we can maintain an \naggressive effort in both transit and source countries.\n  Mr. President, in consultation with the House, we have established a \nconsolidated account which includes proliferation, demining and some of \nthe related international organization programs. Within this account, \nwe have provided funding to complete our commitment to Israel's \ncounterterrorism effort.\n  This account also provides funding at last year's level for the Korea \nPeninsula Energy Development Organization also known as KEDO. As the \nreport reflects, the committee supported the administration's request \nto leave the actual funding number out of last year's bill in order not \nto impede global fundraising efforts.\n  I thought we had a clear understanding as to precisely what level had \nbeen justified and was permissible. Unfortunately, the administration \ntook advantage of our effort to help them and substantially exceeded \njustified levels of spending.\n  In documents submitted last year the administration suggested we \nplanned to contribute 20 percent or $10 million toward the annual costs \nof 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. Subsequently, without submitting \nrequired reprogramming notifications, the White House announced it \nintended to provide $22 million to cover fuel oil. I think it is \nimportant that there is no further confusion on the burden the United \nStates is willing to assume, so we have included a specific level of \nfunding.\n  We have also included a requirement that oil may only be made \navailable subject to confirmation that the North Koreans are not \ndiverting it for military or other illegal uses. This is consistent \nwith the Secretary of State's pledge to the subcommittee to assure \ncompliance on oil use.\n  Turning now to our military assistance programs in title III, we have \nearmarked resources for the Camp David partners and provided sufficient \nfunds to cover the transfer of F-16's to Jordan. In other areas, we \nhave funded IMET at $40 million and provided $65 million for voluntary \npeacekeeping activities.\n  For several years, the subcommittee has been supportive of programs \nunder the Partnership for Peace and Warsaw Initiative. This year we \nmoved forward and consistent with the NATO Participation Act and \nsubsequent similar legislation, the bill designates Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic eligible for NATO admission. The committee has \nmade $20 million in loans and $30 million in grants available to these \nthree nations to improve their military capabilities. This is an \ninitiative crafted in conjunction with the former majority leader and \nin which there had been strong bipartisan interest.\n\n  Finally, with regard to title IV which funds the international \nfinancial institutions, we have done the best we could given the \nenormous size of the administration's request. In response to interest \nexpressed by a majority of the committee, we have provided $295 million \nto cover our international organizations and programs. This will allow \nthe administration to fully fund our pledge to UNICEF.\n  Our treatment of the International Development Association bears some \nexplanation. For the first time in history, this administration agreed \nto vote for an arrangement which segregated $3.3 billion in \ncontributions in a new interim trust fund to be managed by IDA. The ITF \nwill allow only corporations and suppliers from those nations \ncontributing to the fund to compete for contracts. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I oppose the administration's decision to vote to exclude \nU.S. suppliers from competition for contracts. Thus, we have provided \n$626 million as a U.S. contribution to the interim trust fund. This \nassures American companies will continue to have access to resources we \ninvest in the banks.\n  There is one further item worth drawing attention to. In the general \nprovisions section of the bill we have included sanctions legislation \nregarding Burma. I recognize this is unusual in an appropriations bill \nand expect some debate here on the floor on that issue. However, it is \nmy view, a view shared by the elected leader of Burma, Aung San Suu \nKyi, that the time has come for the United States to exercise \nleadership on this issue.\n  That basically completes my summary of the bill.\n  I would like to hear from my friend and colleague Senator Leahy. We \nwill have a couple of amendments to lay down tonight, one of which we \nexpect to be able to get a vote on at 9:30 in the morning.\n  With that overview, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am prepared to go to third reading right \nnow, if the distinguished chairman would want it, and save having to \ncome in at 9:30 in the morning, but I suspect there are some who may \ndisagree.\n  Mr. President, this is a balanced bill. It is a balanced bill only \nwithin an allocation which, frankly, does not meet our needs. Foreign \naid would never win a popularity contest. In fact, we were able to pass \nforeign aid bills in the past because the funds in the bills were \ndistributed among diverse constituencies. This year is no exception. It \nis fast becoming more difficult because there is less money to go \naround.\n  The bill is more than $700 million below the President's request. To \nput that in perspective, President Clinton has requested for foreign \naid about 40 percent less than President Reagan used to request. It is \nnot that somehow there is a Democrat foreign aid giveaway. This \nadministration is requesting about 40 percent less than either the \nReagan or Bush administrations did, but it is also $1.5 billion below \nthe level for foreign operations in fiscal year 1995.\n  Each year, what we do is we take a larger and larger share of the \noverall pie and we earmark it for the Middle East. Unquestionably that \nis a major priority of the United States. But, of course, it does leave \nless and less for the United States to carry out any policies in other \nparts of the world.\n  We should ask what that means. For example, last week the Agency for \nInternational Development laid off 200 employees. Some of these were \namong the finest in or out of government, people who had a decade, \nsometimes even two decades, of exemplary experience, exemplary and \nloyal service to the United States. Some programs, including ones that \neveryone here strongly supports--in agriculture, in the environment, in \neducation--they lost half their staff. A number of these programs \ndirectly or indirectly created jobs here in the United States through \nour export programs. They are gone--to say nothing of what it does to \nour security.\n  There is actually a crisis in our foreign aid programs that few \npeople even know about. Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats \nand Republicans, need to understand this. Both Senator McConnell and I \nhad some very difficult choices to make. This bill represents a \ndelicate compromise. Any attempt to alter that balance by shifting \nsignificant amounts of money from one account to another, I believe, \nwould seriously threaten its prospects for passage.\n  We have worked with Republicans and Democrats across the political \nspectrum, in this body, to try to use what small allocations we had to \nmake them work. In doing that, we have had\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\nto basically rob from almost every single allocation except for one \narea. And now if we try to change those, a lot of the support this bill \nhas disappears.\n  Senator McConnell has made clear what his priorities are and what the \npriorities of the Republican side are. Let me give one example. Despite \na lower allocation than last year and cuts in many programs, funding \nfor counternarcotics activities in this bill is increased. It is \nincreased by $45 million. That is a 39-percent increase for the 1996 \nlevel.\n\n  I believe the evidence is indisputable that despite huge amounts of \nmoney over the past 6 years, over $1 billion, the program really has \nnot reduced the flow of illegal drugs into this country. I know this is \na priority of my friend from Kentucky and that we do need to support \nthis effort, although other programs will have to be cut short to fund \nthe increase. I would not want to see them cut further.\n  There are many, some on the other side, who would like to cut further \nour support for international development programs. Now we shift to a \npriority on this side of the aisle. In fact, it is not only a priority \nof mine, but a priority of Senators on both sides. Some of these \nprograms were cut by as much as half this year.\n  So there is a balance. I want to preserve that balance. I know \nSenator McConnell would want to.\n  Basically, what we have been told to do by the Senate is to take an \nallocation which is way below what is necessary, but within the \nrealities it is the only allocation we could have, take a foreign aid \nprogram which is about 40 percent less than what we had in the past two \nRepublican administrations, and make it work. We have done the best we \ncan. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will refrain from \ntaking apart that balance.\n  The statement of administration policy in this bill is relative to \nwhat I have just said. The White House said they can live with most of \nthe budgetary levels in the bill as Senator McConnell and I presented \nit. If a couple of problems are solved, the President's advisers will \nrecommend he signs the bill even though it is funded far below his \nrequest levels. They know the allocation left us no alternative.\n  But understand the reality: The bill does not meet our international \nneeds and responsibilities. That is not the fault of the managers of \nthis bill. We did the best we could with too little money. We face \nenormous challenges and opportunities in a dangerous and competitive \nworld.\n  Our foreign policy has suffered from a lack of strategic thinking \nsince the cold war. We seem to lurch from crisis to crisis without a \nclear sense of where we are going or how to get there. It is a concern \nof mine and should be a concern of every Member of the Senate of either \nparty.\n  We are now the most powerful democracy history has ever known. Much \nof the rest of the world looks to us for direction and guidance, but we \nseem to determine our direction and our guidance based on what is on \nthe evening news. We must have a clear policy. We must have a clear \npolicy of our foreign policy, our foreign aid, our foreign involvement \nas we go into the next century.\n  Certainly, every other country does. Japan does. Japan spends more \nmoney in this area than we do but creates more jobs as a result of it. \nThey know where they are going. A lot of other countries do. We have \nthe world's largest economy, but our future hinges on building foreign \nmarkets in supporting democracy. If we want to create jobs for \nAmericans, export jobs in other countries, we have to help create those \njobs. They are not going to happen all by themselves. That is why Japan \nand the Netherlands and all these other countries go out and create the \njobs. We cut back the money so we don't do it.\n  If we don't want to find ourselves caught up in wars around the \nworld, we should be supporting democracies. That is what less powerful \nnations do. Yet, we cut back. We spend less than 1 percent of our \nbudget on foreign aid, and we continue to cut it. Other countries see \nan opening. Japan and others spend a lot more.\n  In fact, a dozen or more countries spend more, a higher percentage of \ntheir budget than we do on foreign aid. Several spend more money in \nactual dollars. Why? Because they figure if the United States does not \nwant to go after those jobs, if the United States does not want to go \nafter the influence in other parts of the world, they will. So they \nspend the money, their products get sold, jobs in their countries are \ncreated, we lose the jobs, they create the expertise in foreign policy, \nwe fire and get rid of the people having the expertise in this country, \nand they get the influence.\n  There are several things in this bill that concern me. None of us are \ngoing to get everything we want. Some things will be revisited in \nconference. I do want to mention one item. The bill caps the United \nStates contribution to the Korea Economic Development Corporation at \n$12 million below the President's request.\n  The administration said this could undermine our nuclear agreement \nwith North Korea. I would not want to see that agreement unravel. It is \nin our national security interest, it is in our regional interest in \nthat part of the world that that agreement go through. I hope that we \nwill resolve this, but I also compliment Senator McConnell and his \nstaff for the way they have worked with us on this bill, and I hope \nperhaps before the end of this week, we can have this bill finished.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator McCain \nand Senator Coverdell both have amendments to lay down. The McCain \namendment is the one we will be able to schedule a vote on at 9:30 in \nthe morning. It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from \nArizona would like to proceed first.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If that is agreeable with the distinguished managers of \nthe bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5017\n\n  (Purpose: To require information on cooperation with United States \n   anti-terrorism efforts in the annual country reports on terrorism)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Coats, Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Faircloth, Mrs. Feinstein, \n     Mr. Frist, Mr. Grams, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lott, and \n     Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 5017.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould like to see, however, a copy of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Does the Senator from \nVermont still reserve the right to object?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection. I understand a copy is on its way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 198, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n\ninformation on cooperation with united states anti-terrorism efforts in \n                  annual country reports on terrorism\n\n       Sec. 580. Section 140 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. \n     2656f) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (1);\n       (B) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and \n     inserting a semicolon; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) with respect to each foreign country from which the \n     United States Government has sought cooperation during the \n     previous five years in the investigation or prosecution of an \n     act of international terrorism against United States citizens \n     or interests, the certification of the Secretary--\n       ``(A) whether or not the government of the foreign country \n     is cooperating fully with the United States Government in \n     apprehending, convicting, and punishing the individual or \n     individuals responsible for the act; and\n       ``(B) whether or not the government of the foreign country \n     is cooperating fully with the United States Government in \n     preventing further acts of terrorism against United States \n     citizens in the foreign country; and\n       ``(4) with respect to each foreign country from which the \n     United States Government has sought cooperation during the \n     previous five years in the prevention of an act of \n     international terrorism against such citizens or interests, \n     the certification of the Secretary described in paragraph \n     (3)(B).''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\n       (A) by striking ``The report'' and inserting ``(1) Except \n     as provided in paragraph (2), the report'';\n       (B) by indenting the margin of paragraph (1), as so \n     designated, 2 ems; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) If the Secretary determines that the transmittal of a \n     certification with respect to a foreign country under \n     paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a) in classified form \n     would make more likely the cooperation of the government of \n     the foreign country as specified in such paragraph, the \n     Secretary may transmit the certification under such paragraph \n     in classified form.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, if it is agreeable \nwith the distinguished managers of the bill, that we will debate this \nin the morning at about 9 or 9:15, whatever is agreeable to the \nmanagers of the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, the \nleader was hoping to schedule a vote at 9:30. You graciously agreed to \nlet it be on this amendment. As to when the debate occurs, we can \naccommodate the Senator from Arizona on that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nVermont, if it is agreeable, I don't need more than 10 minutes. We \ncould start, say, at 9:10 with the amendment, if the leader insists on \na vote at 9:30, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me suggest we have the vote at 9:45 \nand start at 9:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to see the amendment. I hate \nto agree to a time, and I am sorry to upset the clerk by saying that, \nbut it is a little bit difficult to get the exact time when we might \nvote. I am not sure exactly what the amendment is. I hate to cut off \nother people.\n  Why don't we agree on an hour evenly divided? The amendment I now \nhave in my hand ends ``this transmits certification such paragraph \nin.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a better copy for the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Arizona has given me \nanother copy. He may want to send that one to the desk. I believe the \none at the desk may have had a typo. I certainly have no objection to \nhaving him substitute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a revised \nversion of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is revised.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if this is agreeable with the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky, why don't we have the vote, say, at 9:45, either \na vote on it or a vote on tabling. I expect it will be a vote up or \ndown. I just don't want to give up that right. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Arizona can understand that. And maybe have, prior to the vote, 20 \nminutes on each side. Will that be agreeable?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is certainly agreeable. I only need 10 minutes on \nthis side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont are going to discuss the amendment \nthat is currently at the desk. What we would like to do at this point \nis to have an opening statement from Senator Coverdell on the amendment \nthat he is going to be offering, which will be laid aside and will be \ntaken up subsequent to the vote on the McCain amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, the order will be, we will hopefully vote on the \nMcCain amendment sometime as early as possible in the morning and then \ngo to the Coverdell amendment which Senator Coverdell is now prepared \nto discuss. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Kentucky \nwould yield for a moment. Would it be appropriate to go ahead and lay \nthe amendment down, and then I would make an opening statement? At the \ntime they resolve that, you can set mine aside and proceed with the \nother amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest to my friend from Georgia, go on and make \nthe statement. By the time you finish, it will probably be ready to be \nlaid down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will be \nsending to the desk an amendment that deals with international \nnarcotics and law enforcement.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the President of the United States and \nthis Senator have been in extended disagreement about drug policy in \nthe United States. I have been exceedingly critical of the reduction of \nan investment in drug interdiction. I have been critical of the \nreduction of our resources available for international narcotics law \nenforcement. I have been critical of the fact that the drug czar's \noffice was virtually closed. I have been critical of the fact that the \nmessage coming from the White House has been less than clear to the \nyoung people of our country on how dangerous drugs are to them.\n  I find myself tonight in the unusual circumstance of defending \nPresident Clinton's policy for his 1997 budget request for \ninternational narcotics and law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton requested that $213 million be \nappropriated for international narcotics and law enforcement. That \nfigure is only half what the investment in this arena was in 1992, \nwhich is just another example of the downsizing of the drug role. But \nunfortunately, the House bill only appropriates $150 million in \ninternational narcotics and law enforcement, and the Senate, as we have \nit before the floor, is $160 million.\n  The purpose of my amendment will be to restore the President's \nrequest, to honor the President's request. He has requested $213 \nmillion. I think it should be more, but it certainly, in my judgment, \nshould not be less.\n  My amendment restores $53 million to this effort. Where does it come \nfrom? Mr. President, the Senate's position that is before us assigns \n$356 million to international operations and programs, a significant \nprogram. That is $31 million higher than the President's request, $31 \nmillion more than the President requested for international operations \nand programs.\n\n  So my proposal would take $28 million from this proposal and shift it \nto international narcotics and law enforcement. In other words, we are \ntaking money from an account for which the President requested less, \nbut we would put in more and shift it over to where he requested more \nbut got less. Second, we take $25 million from development assistance, \nthat is AID, which is requiring only a 2 percent reduction in the \nSenate-proposed appropriations, which is $1.929 billion. Having \naccomplished these two shifts, $28 million from international \noperations programs, $25 million from AID or development assistance, we \nwould have the effect at the end of the day of having restored--\nrestored--this very important function, international narcotics and law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. President, in the last 3 years, as an underpinning for my \namendment and for the President's request, which I am trying to \nfulfill, we have created in the United States a full-fledged drug \nepidemic. Until I had seen the figures I could not believe it. From \n1980 to 1992, drug use among our teenagers was cut in half. In the last \n36 months it has doubled. Every statistic--marijuana use, heroin use--\nwe are seeing a war flash across our country. In fact, Mr. President, \nif the casualties we are taking were from people in uniform, we would \nhave declared war in our hemisphere by what is happening across the \nboard.\n  What am I talking about, Mr. President? What I am talking about is \nthat 2 million--2 million--more teenagers are into drugs tonight than \nthere were 3 years ago--2 million. That is as large as the city of \nAtlanta, the host of the 1996 Olympics. Two million sisters, brothers, \nfathers, mothers, 2 million friends, associates, folks who live next \ndoor, somebody in the workplace, whose lives are stunted, tragically \naltered, and the line is going straight up.\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n  The drug war was shut off. It needs to be turned back on. We need to \nbe concerned about what is happening to children in our own country. \nMr. President, this is the first war that has been waged against \nchildren. In the 1960's and 1970's, the target audience was 17 to 21 \nyears old. Today the drug war is waged against kids who are 8 to 13 \nyears of age. It is a tragedy occurring right before our eyes.\n  The President has appointed a new drug czar. He has called for new \ninternational narcotics money. While we may disagree on the policies \nthat got us here, I agree with his effort to get the war back on.\n  Mr. President, I yield for a moment. Apparently the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Vermont have worked out their differences. \nI will yield and return and submit my amendment officially after they \nhave concluded their work.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5017\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the managers have agreed to a \nunanimous consent that we have a vote at 10 tomorrow with one-half hour \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the agreement was--I understand that the \nRepublican leader has a scheduling concern--that we would go to the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona at 9:30 in the \nmorning, that we would have one-half hour equally divided in the usual \nform, but obviously we could yield that back. I mean, technically we \ncould be on the vote at 9:31.\n  I say that only because I do not want the two leaders, my \ndistinguished friends from Mississippi and South Dakota, to suddenly \nhave to hear from Members, why are we having a vote at 9:30, not 10? \nBut my understanding is that the distinguished chairman will soon ask \nunanimous consent on behalf of the distinguished majority leader that \nwe would be on the McCain amendment at 9:30, one-half hour equally \ndivided, though we can yield back.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in fairness to the Members, I think it \nis better to have a time certain for the first vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that vote occur on or in \nrelation to the McCain amendment no later than 10 a.m., Thursday, and \nthat the time between 9:30 and 10 a.m., be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that would be a McCain \namendment, and that there would be no second-degrees in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also ask, if I could have unanimous \nconsent, that a modification would be in order tomorrow morning, as we \nare still in negotiations with the Senator from Vermont concerning, \nperhaps, modifications for the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to modify the amendment tomorrow \nmorning in agreement with the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the McCain \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5018\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount of funds available for international \n       narcotics control programs, offset by reductions in other \n                            appropriations)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk that \namends the bill in more than one place, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be immediately considered, and no second-degree amendments be \nin order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I did not \nhear.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say that the amendment of the Senator from \nGeorgia will be laid aside after he finishes his discussion.\n  We will vote first in the morning on the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, and no time agreement will be entered \ninto tonight for a time certain on a vote on the Coverdell amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Georgia is agreed to.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for himself, Mr. \n     Lott, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5018.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 104, line 19, strike ``$1,290,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,262,000,000''.\n       On page 124, line 20, strike ``$160,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$213,000,000''.\n       On page 138, line 5, strike ``$295,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$270,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have basically concluded my opening \nstatement on the proposal, and explained that we are restoring funding \nto the President's request in the arena of international narcotics.\n  I did misspeak when I said we were taking $28 million, the figure is \n$25 million for international narcotics; and I said $25 million from \ndevelopment and assistance, and it is $28 million. I got them reversed.\n  Just to reiterate, we are in the midst of a drug epidemic. This is \nnot a time to undercut the Presidential request for direct funding to \nthe war on narcotics and the war on 8- to 13-year-olds in America--8 to \n13 years of age. They are the target. The havoc that we would pay for \nthis is immeasurable and indescribable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend the Senator from Georgia for his amendment. \nI support it.\n  As far as I know, there is no further business to be conducted this \nevening, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8629-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8633-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 19, the United States imported 7,800,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,100,000 barrels more than the 6,700,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in \nthe 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers?

Mr. President, people all over my State of Alabama are \ndeeply saddened by the death of E.R. ``Bob'' Morrissette, Jr., who \npassed away on Sunday, July 21 in Mobile. Bob, who had served for many \nyears on my State staff working out of the Mobile office, was a trusted \nfriend, loyal ally, and close adviser. He was the kind of dedicated \npublic servant who was a natural at the art of forging agreement and \nbuilding bridges. He truly loved people and prided himself on being \nable to get along with just about anyone with whom he came in contact. \nPeople responded and warmed up to him because of his gentlemanly \nmanner, his humor, and his genuineness. Two of his great passions were \npeople and politics. He enjoyed politics in any shape or form.\n  Another of his passions was the newspaper business. Before joining my \nstaff, he spent over 3 decades covering the news as a reporter, editor, \nand publisher. After serving in the Army during World War II, Bob \nearned a journalism degree at the University of Alabama. This is where \nI first met and became close friends with him some 50 years ago. After \ncollege, he embarked on a career in journalism at the Baldwin Times \npaper in Bay Minette, AL. He took over the Atmore Advance in Atmore, a \nsmall town in South Alabama, in 1959, serving there as owner, editor, \nand publisher of the paper for the next 20 years. He plunged into civic \nlife, always wanting to do his very best for the community he served. \nBob always considered himself a newspaper man in the traditional sense \nand saw to it that he knew everything and everybody in his community.\n  In 1976, Bob received the Distinguished Alumnus in Journalism Award \nfrom the University of Alabama. Two years later, he was named president \nof the Alabama Press Association. Shortly after I came to the Senate, \nhe sold the Advance and I persuaded him to accept a position as my \nexecutive assistant for southwestern Alabama, heading up my Mobile \noffice. He was an indispensable and energetic member of my staff who \nrepresented me at various meetings and events and handled many projects \nover the years. He served right up until the time of his death. I will \nalways fondly remember the many barnstorming trips we went on together \nin Mobile and surrounding counties.\n  The importance of family and relationships was something he \nunderstood fully. I was present at Bob and Joyce Henley Morrissette's \nwedding many years ago. They loved each other intensely and constantly. \nThey were so close they knew intuitively the thoughts of the other; \nthey could communicate without speaking. Each brought out the best in \nthe other. They were spouses, best friends, superb parents, and \ntireless workers for the public good.\n  Unfortunately, Joyce became ill and was not able to continue doing so \nmany of the things she loved and enjoyed. But Bob was always devoted to \nher and cared for her in many different ways. His devotion to Joyce \nnever wavered. His loyalty to her reminds me of a line from Elizabeth \nBarrett Browning's ``Love Song from the Portuguese'': ``Chance cannot \nchange my love nor time impair.''\n  Bob was an outstanding family man. He had an unqualified love for all \nof his family and a reverence for his roots. Not only did he show this \nby his love for Joyce and his two daughters, Martha and Lulie, but he \nloved to talk about his relatives--close and distant. He loved to tell \nstories about members of his family. I believe he had more cousins than \nany one man in all of Alabama. He was extremely proud of his heritage. \nFrom my perspective as an office seeker, I could not have hoped for a \nbetter friend and campaign worker who could persuade so many kissing \ncousins.\n\n  Bob Morrissette had an enormous number of friends across the State \nand his familiar presence will be sorely missed. His life was a \ntestament to the very best qualities to be found in the journalism \nbusiness and in government. He proved that people can be involved in \nthese fields and be highly successful while still maintaining a level \nof civility, friendliness, integrity, decorum, and respect that is \noften absent from the public sphere today.\n  He derived a great deal of satisfaction from helping others. He was \nan optimist by nature, always believing we can find the way to a better \nworld and that each of us can be a valuable participant in the process. \nI cannot begin to list the ways that Bob improved the lives of others \nor to discuss the numerous people he touched and how he promoted the \npublic good. Only those of us fortunate to have been the closest to him \ncan begin to appreciate the thoughtfulness and kindness he displayed on \na daily basis for so many people. He touched an infinite number of \nlives through his words, whether they were delivered over the phone, in \nwriting, or in person. He had a rich and colorful south Alabama accent \nthat had a way of putting people at ease and even disarming those who \nwere upset or angry about something. Happiness was an integral part of \nhis life because he was always doing things for other people. He knew \nthat one does not become happy by pursuing happiness for its own sake. \nBob understood that genuine happiness is a byproduct of living a \nmeaningful and productive life. He was a genuinely happy man who used \nhis talents fully and wisely and shared them generously.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Joyce Morrissette and her entire \nfamily in the wake of this tremendous loss. This is not only a loss for \nhis family, but for his community, State, and Nation as well. We are \nall infinitely better off for having had his service, his friendship, \nhis dedication, and his spirit over the course of these many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8634-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8634-S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PIONEER DAY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is July 24--an ordinary day to \nmillions of Americans and 98 percent of this body.\n  But to Utahns, July 24, Pioneer Day, is a big State celebration. \nOffices and businesses are closed; there are parades and pageants in \nmost Utah communities; and families gather for picnics and games.\n  Mr. President, July 24 was the day in 1847 when Brigham Young stood \natop a rise in Emigration Canyon, gazed at the Salt Lake valley below, \nand announced to the Mormon pioneers who had followed him across the \nPlains and across the Rocky Mountains that ``This is the Place.''\n  Today is the 149th anniversary of Pioneer Day. It is a day Utahns \ncelebrate so enthusiastically because it commemorates the determination \nand faith that brought our ancestors into the place Mormons call Zion.\n  It commemorates the triumph over the hardships inherent in such a \njourney. It commemorates the sense of community that kept them together \nas a people.\n  And, it commemorates the fact that the religious persecution suffered \nby my Mormon ancestors did not achieve its purpose. Prejudice and \nbigotry may have forced the early members of the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-day Saints out of the Midwest, but the faith could not be \nkilled.\n  Today, Utah stands as a shining example of commerce, the arts, \nscience, and education. It is an example of solid work ethic, sound \nmanagement, and good stewardship in both public and private arenas. It \nis also a model of tolerance. All of these blessings and present-day \nvalues are manifestations of the character and achievements of the Utah \npioneers.\n  That is why today Utah celebrates the ``Days of '47.'' I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and Senator Bennett in observing this seminal \nevent in Utah history.\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8634-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS FOR CALENDAR YEAR \n                1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 165\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit herewith a report of the activities of the \nUnited States Government in the United Nations and its affiliated \nagencies during calendar year 1995.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to require a 10 percent reduction in certain \nassistance to a State under such title unless public safety officers \nwho retire as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty \ncontinue to receive health insurance benefits; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       the alu-o'hara public safety officers health benefits act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, almost 1 year ago today, Officer \nJoseph Alu and Detective James O'Hara responded to an emergency hostage \nsituation.\n  When the officers had arrived at the scene--they found that the \nassailant had cordoned himself off in a bedroom of a house and had \ntaken two teenaged girls for hostages.\n  The officers broke down the bedroom door, only to discover that the \nassailant had doused himself, the hostages, and the entire house in \ngasoline.\n  At that moment, the assailant dropped a lighter on the floor, setting \nthe room ablaze, killing himself and the two hostages. Officers Alu and \nO'Hara were critically wounded--receiving severe burns over most of \ntheir bodies.\n  Both officers remained in the hospital for the better part of a year \nfighting for their lives.\n  Officer O'Hara was so badly burned that while he struggled for his \nlife in the intensive care unit for over 6 months, his wife was told to \nexpect and prepare for his imminent death.\n  Miraculously, Officer Alu and Officer O'Hara survived. But, while \nstill in the hospital, the city of Plantation Police Department \nnotified the officers that since they would not be physically able to \nreturn to work--they and their families would lose their health \ninsurance benefits.\n  Imagine fighting for your life in a hospital, in excruciating pain, \nknowing that your family is going to be left unprotected.\n  When these heroes returned home--that is exactly what they found: no \njob, disability payments of approximately $1,200 a month, prohibitively \nexpensive COBRA insurance which would run out in 18 months, and no \nprivate health insurance for them and their families.\n  For over 5 months, Officer Alu's wife, Sheila, stayed home to care \nfor her husband during his rehabilitation--herself unable to work to \nbring in badly needed extra income.\n  Further complicating their situation was their 5-year-old daughter \nChristina, who was battling chronic asthma without health insurance.\n  Detective O'Hara's family was in a similar situation. In fact, his \nwife still must care for his everyday needs almost 1 year later.\n  But instead of giving up hope, officers Alu and O'Hara fought hard. \nThey brought their case to the Florida Legislature--and won.\n  The legislature, with a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, \nunanimously passed this legislation at the State level--requiring that \nlocalities continue whatever health insurance benefits the officer had \nprior to the injury.\n  Mr. President, although they have won personal victories, officers \nAlu and O'Hara have continued their fight--taking their case to \nCongress--asking us to make sure that other officers not go through the \nsame pain, uncertainty, and feelings of shame as they did when they \nwere unable to provide for their families.\n  Across the Nation, unlike veterans who have risked their lives to \nprotect our national security, those who protect our homes and streets \nhave their insurance canceled by municipalities or States when they can \nno longer do the job.\n  Mr. President, my legislation, endorsed by all major police and \nfirefighter organizations, would create a safety net for injured \nofficers by requiring municipalities that receive Federal crime dollars \nto continue to maintain the same level of benefits that an officer had \nprior to being injured in the line of duty.\n  If a locality chooses not to offer health insurance to these public \nsafety officers, it would only be able to receive 90 percent of its \nfull complement of community-oriented policing services funding.\n  Mr. President, the scope of this bill is extremely narrow. It would \napply only to a handful of public safety officers, estimated at \napproximately 100 nationwide per year.\n  And it is not costly. CBO has already stated that this bill is not an \nunfunded mandate.\n  But its message is unmistakeably clear.\n  We need laws which protect our valiant men and women on the front \nlines. When they go down in the line of duty protecting us, we have a \ncorresponding duty to care for them.\n  Mr. President, this bill would provide only the most basic package of \nbenefits. It does not grant any enhanced or increased benefits over \nwhat the officer had at the time of the injury.\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\n  The bill requires State and local governments to offer only the \nminimum level of health insurance necessary to maintain the health \ncoverage the officer had prior to the disabling injury.\n  For instance, if an officer or firefighter did not have family \ncoverage prior to the injury, he would not be entitled to family \ncoverage after the injury.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of my State of Florida. But it should not \ntake a terrible incident like this to make sure that our public safety \nofficers are protected.\n  We can prevent this situation from ever happening to officers like \nAlu and O'Hara by passing this legislation this year, in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, allow me to conclude by commending both Officer Alu \nand Detective O'Hara and their families for their bravery, sacrifice, \nand dedication to public service.\n  Without their perseverance we would not be here today discussing this \nmost critical issue.\n  I know that police officers and firefighters across the Nation share \nmy gratitude for their courage and selflessness.\n  Mr. President, in passing this bill, we will honor our commitment to \nall of our public safety officers: to protect and care for them after \nthey have done so much to protect and care for us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1985. A bill to increase penalties for sex offenses against \nchildren; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            The Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today for two reasons. First, I \nwant to talk about two little girls whose short lives have had an \nimpact far beyond their youthful imaginings. Unlike their families and \nfriends, we do not know them for the love they gave, nor do we know of \nthem for their academic ability or artistic talents. Sadly, unlike \ntheir families and friends, we did not know them while they were \nalive--we know them only because of their tragic deaths.\n  The second reason I rise today is to introduce legislation with \nSenator Hutchison which is designed to prevent other children from \nsuffering their fate, the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996. \nI ask that a copy of the bill be printed in full following my remarks. \nAn earlier version of this bill was introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Martin Frost of Texas.\n  The first little girl I want to tell you about is Polly Klaas. Many \npeople throughout our Nation have come to know about this 12-year-old \ngirl from Petaluma, CA, a small, close-knit community north of San \nFrancisco, and the tragic circumstances of her death.\n  Polly was kidnaped from her bedroom on October 1, 1993, by a bearded, \nknife-wielding man who tied her up and threatened to slit her friends' \nthroats as her mother slept in a nearby room. Polly and her friends--\nwho were over for a slumber party--were playing a board game at the \ntime of the abduction.\n  Immediately after the assailant had fled with Polly, her two friends \nawakened her mother, Eve Nichols, and she called 911: ``Apparently, a \nman just broke into our house,'' she said, her voice rising in panic, \n``and they say he took my daughter.''\n  Richard Allen Davis, a 41-year old parolee with two previous \nkidnaping convictions and a history of psychotic behavior, was arrested \non November 30, 1993, and 4 days later, police say, he led them to her \nbody, dumped beside a highway. Next to Polly's body, police found a \nspecialty condom identical to one Davis had bought at the adult novelty \nstore Seductions a day or two before the kidnapping, according to the \nstore's former owner. Polly's clothes were pushed up to her waist.\n  At Davis' trial, prosecutors presented expert testimony that Davis' \nabduction of Polly was motivated by a desire to gratify his sexual \ntastes for bondage.\n  Last month, Davis was convicted of all ten counts against him, \nincluding attempting a lewd act with a minor.\n  The second little girl I want to tell you about, Amber Hagerman, was \nvisiting her grandparents on January 13 of this year, the day she was \nkidnaped. An eyewitness later told police that he saw a white or \nHispanic man pull the child from her pink tricycle and drag her into a \nblack pickup truck.\n  She was found dead 4 days later--her clothes stolen from her lifeless \nlittle body--in a creek behind an apartment complex. Police have made \nno arrests for the murder of Amber Hagerman, but are continuing to \nfollow every lead.\n  Amber's killer is still free and her family continues to feel the \npain caused by the loss of their beloved daughter. Just a few weeks \nago, Amber's grief stricken mother, Donna Whitson, released an open \nletter to her daughter's unknown assailant. In it, she said:\n\n       [I]t has now been 122 days since I last saw my daughter \n     alive. One hundred twenty-two days since I felt her happiness \n     in my life. One hundred and twenty-two days ago, you tore my \n     baby girl from her family's love * * * [Y]ou destroyed \n     forever the happiness, harmony and dreams that my children \n     and I had been working so hard to bring to fruition. Our \n     plans for the future altered because of you.''\n\n  Imagine if you can, trying to comprehend what your own child's last \nmoments of life were like, or trying to fathom the pain and fear felt \nby your own flesh and blood as they lived them. Donna Whitson has \nprobably done so every day since the loss of her daughter. In her open \nletter, she asked her daughter's killer:\n\n       At what point between the time you stole my baby and the \n     time she was returned did you murder my child? Why had you \n     drained the life from her body? How could you steal the \n     clothes from her lifeless body and dump her like trash thrown \n     along the wayside?\n\n  Mr. President, it is for these two children and their families that \nwe must join with Donna Whitson to say loud and clear that \nthe abduction of children and child sexual abuse will not be tolerated \nby this society.\n\n\n                             The Crime Bill\n\n  Two years ago, Congress acknowledged that action must be taken to \nstop child sexual abuse when it passed the President's crime bill.\n  The Violent Crime Control Act contained several tough provisions to \ncombat child sexual abuse. More specifically, the crime bill:\n  Established guidelines for State programs that require persons \nconvicted of crimes against children, including sexual misconduct with \na minor, to register their addresses with an appropriate State law \nenforcement agency for 10 years after their release from prison;\n  Sexually violent predators must remain registered until a court \ndetermines that they no longer suffer from a mental abnormality that \nwould make a predatory sexually violent offense likely.\n  The crime bill also doubled the maximum prison term for offenders who \ncommit a sexual abuse or sexual contact offense under Federal law after \none or more prior convictions for a Federal or State sexual abuse or \nsexual contact offense.\n  I strongly believe that this landmark legislation will go a long way \ntoward protecting our Nation's children.\n  Earlier this year, the President signed Megan's Law, which requires \nthat State law enforcement agencies release information that is \nnecessary to protect the public from convicted sex offenders in their \nmidst. This change in the law was part of the Amber Hagerman Child \nProtection Act as it was introduced in the House.\n  Yet, much more needs to be done.\n\n\n                The Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act\n\n  Clearly, too many children suffer the physical and emotional impact \nof kidnaping and it must be stopped before more kids like Polly Klaas \nand Amber Hagerman fall victim to its tragic effects.\n  Child sexual abuse must be stopped by taking sexual predators off our \nstreets. Swift, sure action must be taken to stop child sexual abuse, \nand penalties must be increased for those who commit this heinous \ncrime.\n  The Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act will help accomplish this \ngoal in several ways:\n  The heart of the bill is a tough ``two strikes and you're out'' \nprovision for child sex offenders. First, the bill adds \nlife imprisonment for a second offense where the second offense is a \nFederal one. Second, this legislation also reduces Byrne grant funding \nby 10 percent to States which do not pass a similar two strikes \nprovision to ensure that all States take this important step to help \nsave our children from sexual abuse.\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n  This legislation expands Federal child sexual abuse statutes to cover \ninstances when the perpetrator crosses State lines with the intent to \ncommit the offense, or commits the offense in interstate or foreign \ncommerce.\n  Lastly, the bill establishes a national database for sex offenders \nand child kidnappers to be maintained by the FBI; and makes that \ndatabase accessible to appropriate State law enforcement officials.\n  The bill that we are introducing today differs from the House bill in \ntwo ways. First, because enhanced community notification has, \nfortunately, been enacted into law as Megan's Law, that provision is no \nlonger necessary. Second, the House bill contains an explicit death \npenalty for killing a child in the course of a Federal sex offense. I \nagree that such an evil and perverted act deserves the death penalty; \nhowever, I believe that the death penalty which already exists in \nFederal law, and which would apply to this heinous act under our bill, \nis preferable, as it is slightly broader than the penalty in the House \nbill.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the sick, tragic deaths of Polly Klaas and Amber \nHagerman serve as stark reminders that from tragedy and grief can come \nconstructive action and effective solutions, such as the crime bill's \nthree strikes initiative to incarcerate for life the most dangerous \ncriminals in our society.\n  We have much work to do to ensure the safety of our children from \nabduction and sexual abuse; passing this bipartisan legislation is a \nvital part of that effort. As a banner across the building in which the \nPolly Klaas Foundation is headquartered says: ``We ache. We grieve. \nWe're angry. We're not done.''\n  I urge all of my colleagues to give their support to the Amber \nHagerman Child Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and myself, I send the \nbill to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and \nmyself, I have just sent to the desk the Amber Hagerman Child \nProtection Act. The purpose is to try to provide a Federal response to \nthose who molest children.\n  Recently, a study showed about 40 percent of the child molesters are \nrecidivists. I, frankly, think that could well be even higher than \nthat.\n  In virtually every community throughout the United States, there is a \nstory to tell. Senator Hutchison will speak in a moment about a story \nfrom Texas. I can speak about a story from California. I can speak of \nPolly Klaas, and the person who was just convicted of abducting, \nkidnaping, raping and killing her had a prior record.\n  The bill we are proposing today attacks the problem of sex offenders \non both the State and Federal level. The purpose of the bill is to \nrequire life imprisonment for a repeat, two-time child sex offender and \nto provide an opportunity for the second offense to be heard in a \nFederal court.\n  The purpose of this bill is that if an individual is convicted of \nchild molestation and repeats that felony, either on Federal land or in \nthe crossing of State lines, that it will become a Federal offense and \nsubject to life imprisonment.\n  This is a harsh bill. It is a tough bill. It has been introduced in \nthe House by Representative Frost. It is my hope, and I believe Senator \nHutchison's hope, that tomorrow in the Judiciary Committee I will offer \nit as an amendment to the child pornography bill. If it fails there, we \nwill try at a later time to offer it as an amendment on the floor to a \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1985\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I yield to my colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for working \non this bill, for putting it together, for carrying it through the \nJudiciary Committee on which she serves, because this is something that \nwe can truly do in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I know that when our Dear Colleague letter goes out to all of the \nSenators that we will have probably 75 or 80 cosponsors, because this \nis a bill that I think everyone will see the need for and want to \nsupport.\n  In fact, as Senator Feinstein mentioned, this bill is named for the \n9-year-old victim of a tragic killing that was so unnecessary and, \nunfortunately, is still unsolved. Nine-year-old Amber Hagerman was \nabducted while riding her bicycle outside her grandparents' home in \nArlington, TX, earlier this year. She was kept alive for at least 48 \nhours before being murdered. Her nude, slashed body was found in a \ncreek bed behind an Arlington apartment complex on January 17, 4 days \nafter she was snatched away from her friends and family by a man \ndriving a truck.\n  The killer of this much-beloved and innocent child has never been \nidentified. Her family and friends still are not comprehending why this \ncould have happened to such a child. The entire community remains \nstunned, saddened and enraged. They have the chilling certainty that \nthere is a child killer on the loose in their community, in our State, \nin our country.\n  Although we do not know the name of this monster who kidnaped, \nmolested, and murdered this 9-year-old child, we do know several \nunpleasant\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nfacts about sexual predators who prey on children, like Amber, in \ncommunities across this country.\n  Twenty percent of those in State prisons convicted of violent \ncrimes--65,000 people--report having victimized a child. More than half \nof these victims were 12 years old or younger, 75 percent of them were \nfemale.\n  Thirty percent of these sexual predators report having committed \ntheir crimes against multiple victims. Sixty-six percent of prisoners \nconvicted of sexual assaults committed their crime against a child.\n  The repeat crime rate for sex offenders is estimated to be as much as \n10 times higher than the recidivism rate of other criminals.\n  Mr. President, we know that more than 40 percent of convicted sex \noffenders will repeat their crimes. We must begin to act on the \ninformation that we have. The revolving doors of our criminal justice \nsystem have to stop sending violent criminals out on the streets and \nback into our neighborhoods to prey on those least able to take care of \nthemselves--our children.\n  Justice must be made to serve the young and most vulnerable among us, \nas well as those who repeatedly violate the law. So it is in Amber \nHagerman's memory that I am cosponsoring Senator Feinstein's \nlegislation today to protect this Nation's children from sex offenders.\n  As Senator Feinstein said, the purpose of the bill is tough. It is to \nrequire life imprisonment for two-time child sex offenders when their \ncases are heard in Federal court, and it encourages States to do \nlikewise.\n  It provides for a nationwide system of tracking sex offenders to be \nadministered by the FBI.\n  This legislation would establish new Federal jurisdiction over sexual \noffenses against children when a person commits a crime after crossing \nState lines with the intent of committing a sex offense.\n  So, Mr. President, I think Senator Feinstein told us what is in the \nbill. I will not go into it any further. But I do want to say that it \nis a primary responsibility of our Government to protect our citizens, \nand especially the youngest and most vulnerable citizens.\n  We are going to send a message today to the monsters in our society \nwho would murder children that there is going to be a price to pay. \nHopefully, we will get these people off the streets, out of our \nneighborhoods, out of our parks and begin to get serious about personal \nsecurity in this country, especially for our children. Thank you.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein for working on this bill and for allowing \nme to be the cosponsor of it in honor and memory of my constituent, 9-\nyear-old Amber Hagerman, so that her legacy will be that she will be a \npart of protecting children like her from meeting her fate. Thank you, \nMr. President. I thank Senator Feinstein. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Texas. It is a great pleasure to work with her. I hope we \nhave success in this measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the \nfloor.\n       By Mr. HATFIELD:\n\n  S. 1986. A bill to provide for the completion of the Umatilla Basin \nproject, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               The Umatilla Basin Project Completion Act\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, almost 20 years ago, I traveled \nto Pendleton, OR, to hold a hearing on longstanding water disputes in \nthe Umatilla River Basin. These disputes were somewhat typical of other \nwater conflicts throughout the western United States, in that, I was \nlucky to get out of that hearing room alive. The tension between all \nsides at that 1977 hearing was so high, I was almost certain that a \nsmall war would break out right there in the room. Fortunately, that \nmeeting was the low point in the effort to resolve water conflicts in \nthat northeast Oregon river basin. Since that time, we have experienced \nmany high points.\n  In the ensuing 11 years since that fateful meeting of 1977, local \nleaders were successful in bringing irrigators, Indian tribes, \nenvironmentalists, elected officials and government bureaucrats \ntogether on one of the most successful fishery restoration projects \nthis Nation has ever seen, the Umatilla Basin project. In 1988, \nCongress enacted the Umatilla Basin Project Act in an effort to develop \na pragmatic, least-cost approach to meeting the Federal Government's \ntreaty obligations in the basin without devastating the area's valuable \nagricultural economy. This project has truly been a model of \ncooperation between those seeking to utilize water for agricultural \npurposes and those whose historical way of life and culture hinged on \nthe restoration of healthy fish runs in the Umatilla River.\n  The Umatilla Basin project has been a product of years of debate and \ngrassroots consensus building. Its two main purposes have been to \nrestore a healthy anadromous fishery to the Umatilla River and to \nprovide irrigated agriculture with a predictable water supply. On both \ncounts, the project has been a tremendous success.\n  Under the 1988 act, new pumping facilities were authorized to allow \nthree irrigation districts, which previously withdrew their water from \nthe Umatilla River, to leave the water instream for fish. In exchange, \nthe irrigation districts received an equal volume of water from the \nadjacent Columbia River to irrigate their crop lands. The project has \nhad no impact on Columbia River flows and has restored strong, healthy \nfish runs to the Umatilla River for the first time in decades. In fact, \nin the first 6 months of 1996 already, over 4,000 fish have returned to \na river that in the 1960's lost its native salmon. In fact, prior to \nthe authorization of the Umatilla Basin project, irrigation withdrawals \nfrom the Umatilla River literally dried the river up during the summer \nmonths.\n  While the Umatilla Basin project has been a huge success for all \nparties involved, the 1988 act provided Columbia River exchanges for \nonly half of the Umatilla River irrigation withdrawals. In order to \nmake the project whole and satisfy the Federal Government's treaty \nfishery obligations to the Umatilla Tribes, the remainder of the \nproject must be built. Today, I am introducing legislation which \nachieves this goal, while at the same time, resolves a longstanding \ndispute regarding the delivery of water to lands not officially within \nBureau of Reclamation project boundaries.\n  The bill I am introducing today, entitled the ``Umatilla Basin \nProject Completion Act,'' incorporates the key components of a general \nagreement reached last April in meetings between the Confederated \nTribes of the Umatilla, irrigation districts, State water resources \ndepartment, locally elected officials and Federal agencies. My bill has \nthree major provisions. First, it calls for the construction of the \nthird and final phase of the Umatilla project, which will exchange \nColumbia River water for an equivalent amount of irrigation water now \ntaken out of the Umatilla River. This final phase, known as phase 3, \nwill cost $71 million and will fully satisfy all obligations of the \nFederal Government to provide the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla \nIndian Reservation with water for fishery needs in the Umatilla River \nbelow the mouth of McKay Creek, as recognized by their 1855 treaty with \nthe United States. The 1988 Umatilla Basin Project Act authorized the \nconstruction of phases 1 and 2. Phase 3 alone will provide almost as \nmuch water to the fishery resources of the Umatilla River as did the \nprevious two phases.\n  Second, my bill adjusts the boundaries of three of the four \nirrigation districts in the Umatilla project to include lands irrigated \nwith project water prior to 1988. The three districts for which these \nboundary adjustments will be legislatively granted, are already \nexchanging Umatilla River for Columbia River water, as authorized under \nphases 1 and 2. The fourth district, Westland Irrigation District, was \nnot included in phases 1 and 2 of the 1988 Act and is still withdrawing \nwater from the Umatilla River. My bill does not grant a boundary \nadjustment for Westland until the phase 3 Columbia River water exchange \nis fully up and running.\n\n  Finally, my legislation calls for the preparation of a comprehensive \nwater management plan for the Umatilla River Basin. As a followup to \nlast\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nApril's meetings, all of the affected parties--the State, Federal and \nlocal Governments, the tribes, and the irrigation districts--agreed to \ncooperate in preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the \nUmatilla Basin. The Plan would serve as a guide in allocating water to \nmaximize the fishery benefits while recognizing valid existing uses. My \nbill authorizes $500,000 to assist this most promising and valuable \neffort.\n  It should be noted at this time that not all of the items identified \nin last April's consensus process were included in my legislation. \nWhile I felt that each of these items had merit, fiscal realities and \nthe short time frame remaining prior to sine die adjournment of the \n104th Congress precluded me from including them in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that large authorizations for new \nconstruction projects are not particularly popular at this time. This \nbill, however, is far preferable to the traditional mode of meeting our \nNation's treaty fishery obligations to Indian tribes. To date, the \nstandard mode of operation has been protracted litigation and \nadjudication of rights, followed by construction of costly projects. In \nthe Yakima River Basin, for example, the Federal Government and \nirrigators spent nearly 20 years and $50 million just adjudicating the \ntribe's treaty fishery rights. During that time, the Yakima River \nsalmon runs continued to decline, and Congress passed legislation \nauthorizing another $150 million to restore the Yakima River fishery. \nUnfortunately, similar sad tales reverberate throughout the Pacific \nNorthwest. Our experience in the Umatilla River Basin, to date, has \nbeen more positive and successful.\n  The bill I am introducing today reflects the general consensus \nreached by Tribes, irrigation districts, local communities, \nenvironmentalists, and State, local, and Federal governments. These \ngroups came together in the same cooperative spirit that characterized \nthe 1988 Umatilla Basin Project Act to reach agreement that the final \nphase of the Umatilla Basin Project should be completed and that, once \nand for all, the longstanding debate over authorized water deliveries \nfor irrigation purposes should be resolved. I am proud of the work \nthese groups have done and look forward to working with them to resolve \ntheir remaining issues and concerns with this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       Section 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman, Abraham, Lott, and Hatch the District of Columbia \nEconomic Recovery Act. The social, administrative, and fiscal problems \nof our Nation's Capital are well documented: High crime rates, poor \nschools, deteriorating infrastructure, and inadequate delivery of basic \npublic services, just to name a few. The District of Columbia is facing \nits greatest economic crisis since it was established in 1790. Congress \nhas taken major steps, including the creation of a financial control \nboard, to assist the city during this current financial crisis. But \ndespite these efforts, the city has a long way to go to achieve \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n  The root of the District's problems is an ever-eroding middle class. \nSince 1950, Washington's population has declined by nearly 250,000 \nresidents: In fact, 68,000 people left between 1988 and 1993 alone. The \nvast majority were middle-class families whose taxes funded the city's \noperations. So far, D.C.'s response to this decline has been misguided: \neven-higher taxes. But this has only led to even more residents leaving \nthe city in search of lower tax rates, better schools, and safer \nstreets.\n  We believe that the best way to help the District is to promote \neconomic growth, and the best way to promote economic growth is to \nsignificantly reduce the tax burden on its residents. Economic growth \nwill mean more jobs, more opportunity, greater private sector \ninvestment, and ultimately a better quality of life in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  There is a large and growing consensus that our current income tax \nsystem has become a tremendous obstacle to economic growth and an \nimproved standard of living. After eight decades of misuse by \nlawmakers, lobbyists, and special interests, today's tax system is \nunfair, complex, costly, and punishes work, savings, and investment.\n  Therefore, we as a nation need to fundamentally rethink the manner in \nwhich income is taxed in order to construct a system that is equitable, \nefficient, and can support economic growth. This effort, which perhaps \nappropriately begins in the Nation's Capital, is an important first \nstep.\n  In order to achieve genuine tax reform, we must take the blinkers \noff, special interests must give way to the overriding national \nconcerns, partisan class warfare must end, and the defenders of the \nstatus quo must step aside to make way for positive change. Mere \ntinkering with the Tax Code, or simply reshuffling the existing tax \nburden is not genuine tax reform. We must create a new tax structure \nthat allows everyone to benefit from economic growth. The flat tax \nencompasses this new thinking and fundamental change needed to create a \nfair, simple, and pro-growth tax system.\n  The D.C. Economic Recovery Act is an important step in luring middle-\nclass taxpayers back to the District of Columbia. It provides tax \nincentives, including a 15-percent flat income tax rate for all \nDistrict residents and deductions of $15,000 for individual filers; \n$25,000 for head of household filers; and $30,000 for married filers.\n  This will benefit everyone, especially the poor and middle class. Our \nbill includes a $5,000 first-time home buyers provision designed to \nassist middle-class families in purchasing homes within the District of \nColumbia. Second, we have established a zero capital gains tax rate on \ninvestments within the District, to help spur investment in the \nDistrict, so middle-class residents won't be hurt by onerous capital \ngains taxes when they decide to sell their homes. In addition to these \nincentives, we have included a brown-fields provision that is sure to \nimprove the city's quality of life by encouraging companies to clean up \nenvironmentally damaged District land.\n  This bill also provides the opportunity for all Americans to \nparticipate in the economic revitalization of the District of Columbia \nby extending to everyone a zero capital gains rate for all investments \nmade within the District. We believe the American people want to take \npride in this city, and want it to represent all the best this Nation \nhas to offer. For too long, the city's economy has been locked into the \ngrowth and declines of the Federal Government. Our bill offers the \nchance to spur nongovernmental economic investment in the District of \nColumbia.\n  The District of Columbia is not only home to the people who live \nhere, it is truly the Nation's city. Historically, Congress has \nrecognized this fact, and assured the financial integrity of the \nDistrict. However, we now realize that simply throwing money at the \nproblem is not the answer. We must find a way to fundamentally improve \nthe city without demanding additional financial commitments from \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  We believe that these incentives, along with responsible and sensible \nfinancial management, are just what the District needs to become self-\nsufficient.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senator \nMack as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, the \nDistrict of Columbia Economic Recovery Act of 1996 [DCERA].\n  The District of Columbia belongs to each and every one of us. As \ncitizens of the United States, we have a stake in the successes, and a \nstake in the failures, of Washington, DC. It is America's city.\n  For a variety of reasons, not all of them easily explained, \nWashington is in desperate financial straits. The here and now \nfinancial prospects are grim for the city and the future gets grimmer. \nThis is largely because middle-class families, the backbone of any \nsuccessful community, are fleeing the District in alarming numbers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would instantly transform \nour\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\nNation's capital, making it a more appealing place to live, to invest, \nto build, to buy, and to work. This bill is designed to reverse the \nflow of middle-class residents and businesses, who are currently \nfleeing the city for the suburbs. Those still in the District would \nhave new incentives to stay. And many others now living elsewhere would \nhave a very strong incentive to move into the District with their \nfamilies and with their businesses.\n  We cannot make the schools better in the District overnight. We \ncannot promise crime-free streets overnight. What we can do is provide \nmiddle-class tax relief in the District, as a way to lure these middle-\nclass taxpayers to the District as a way to reestablish a tax base in \nthe District. And once we bring these people back, safer streets and \nbetter schools can follow.\n  Surely we can wait. We can wait until the situation in the district \nis so dire, when nearly all of the tax base in the District has fled \nand we will be asked to take over the city altogether. Waiting strikes \nme as penny wise and pound foolish.\n  Instead of waiting, we should consider the merits of the DCERA which \nwe are introducing today. This legislation is modeled on legislation \nwhich has been introduced in the House with broad, bipartisan support, \nby Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. Both the House and the Senate \nversion of the DCERA establish a maximum Federal tax rate of 15 \npercent. Both bills double the personal exemption which would eliminate \nFederal income taxes for single residents who make up to $15,000 a year \nand married couples filing jointly who make up to $30,000 a year. At \nthe same time, the bill retains the mortgage and charitable deductions \nand would allow a taxpayer to file under the old system, if preferred.\n  In contrast to Representative Norton's bill, our legislation \nestablishes a zero capital gains rate for D.C. investments held by D.C. \nor non-D.C. residents for 3 years. Representative Norton's bill \nrestricts this capital gains treatment to investments held by \nD.C. residents only. In crafting our version of this legislation, we \nwere concerned this would limit potential investment in the District. \nFor this reason, the Senate treatment is broader.\n\n  Also in contrast to the House DCERA, our bill includes a $5,000 \ncredit for first time District home purchases and includes a provision \nto clean-up abandoned brownfields within the District. Members of \nCongress not representing the District could not take advantage of the \ntax incentives in the bill and we are working toward an explicit \nunderstanding that the District would not take advantage of the Federal \ntax incentives in this bill by raising local taxes.\n  I very much see this bill as a first step. Some of the urban problems \nWashington faces are unique to Washington because Washington has no \nState, no broader tax base, to draw on. At the same time, many of \nWashington's problems are problems that are faced by cities all across \nthis country. If this approach works in Washington, I hope we can try \nit in Bridgeport, New Haven, and Hartford as well.\n  I should note that, unlike some proponents of this legislation, I am \nat best an agnostic on a flat tax. I believe progressivity in our tax \nrates is inherently fair and am pleased that the legislation we are \nintroducing today has elements of that progressivity by providing such \na generous personal exemption. At the same time, a good number of our \ncities are facing the loss of their middle-class population and the \nonly way to rebuild that base may be through bold measures like a flat \ntax which has clear and compelling benefits for the middle class. The \npeople we are really anxious to bring back to our cities are the 28 \npercenters. Under the current Tax Code a typical family in the 28-\npercent bracket would be a couple with two children who make roughly \nbetween $39,000 and $95,000 after deductions. Our bill would create a \nvery favorable tax incentive for these people to stay in, or move to, \nthe District.\n  Mr. President, the most important thing there is to say about urban \npolicy in this country is that we really do not have an urban policy. \nWe know what has not worked; today we are introducing legislation that \nwe believe will work and there is no better place to start than in \nWashington, DC, a city that belongs to all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Mack and \nLieberman in sponsoring legislation designed to spur economic growth in \nthe District of Columbia. The economic circumstances in the District \nhave eroded so significantly that they can no longer be casually \ndismissed. Failure to act now with investment incentives would cost the \nDistrict even more in lost financial opportunities--financial \nopportunities the District, and indeed our entire Nation, cannot afford \nto miss.\n  Opponents of this legislation may be critical of the special \ntreatment given to the District of Columbia as opposed to other areas \nof the country. Yet, this should be the greatest city in the world--\neast of Salt Lake City.\n  In all seriousness, however, I believe that it is imperative that the \nCapital of our Nation stand for democracy, economic development, and \nsecurity. It is difficult for the District of Columbia to represent \nthese qualities when it has become nearly unmanageable and is on the \nbrink of financial ruin. Something must be done to breathe new life \ninto Washington, DC. Otherwise, I've got some ghost towns in Utah I can \nshow you.\n  And, I want to emphasize that we are not talking about an infusion of \nFederal funds. We are talking about encouraging private sector \ninvestment in the city. We are talking about incentives for people to \nlive here. This legislation provides a way to bring both the capital \nand stability needed to start the healing process.\n  The components included in this bill are specifically designed to \nrevitalize our Nation's Capital. First, the bill would tax all D.C. \nresidents at a flat rate of 15 percent and significantly increase their \nstandard deductions, yet retain both the charitable contribution \ndeduction and the home mortgage deduction. This provision would give \nthe middle class who left because of rising taxes a new incentive to \nreturn to the District and once again call it home. In fact, this \nrecovery plan also establishes a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home \nbuyers for residences purchased within the District of Columbia. These \ntypes of incentives would have a real and immediate impact on the \nDistrict and would help replace the middle-class base that has slowly \nbeen eroding.\n  In addition to these provisions, Mr. President, this legislation \neliminates the capital gains tax on any investment made within the \nDistrict of Columbia by residents and greatly reduces it for \nnonresidents. This part of the bill provides the District access to a \ntremendous source of capital, otherwise unavailable.\n  Not only would this proposal begin to restore the financial viability \nof our Nation's capital city, it would also provide a testing ground \nfor studying the effects of the basic principles of fundamental tax \nreform. Our current system of taxation has been much criticized over \nthe past year and a half, and I agree that steps should be taken toward \na fairer, simpler, and more efficient tax system. However, while change \nmay be necessary, it must also be done carefully and deliberately. \nInitiating a flat tax system in the District of Columbia could give \nlegislators much-needed insight into tax reform on a national scale. \nSuccess in the District would result in ideas that could be applied \nnationwide. Thus, this legislation would benefit the District of \nColumbia, as well as every citizen of America.\n  Mr. President, this bill is far from perfect. It is a bold idea \ndesigned to reverse the fall of a once-great city. Legitimate concerns \nabout the impact of this bill have been raised in recent days by \nmembers of the House Ways and Means Committee and other. For one thing, \nskeptics of this idea worry that the provisions of this bill would give \ncurrent residents of the District of Columbia a windfall. Other \nconcerns that have been expressed include taxpayers moving into the \nDistrict for only a short period to take advantage of the benefits of \nthis proposal, then moving out again. Other critics contend that the \nroot of the District's problems is not the lack of money, but poor \nmanagement of the resources already present and that therefore, an \ninfusion of new money and new residents would not change things \nsignificantly.\n  I agree that the bill we are sponsoring today will not, by itself, \nsolve all of\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\nthe problems of the District of Columbia. I also agree that much work \nneeds to be done in further crafting this bill as it goes through the \nlegislative process to ensure that concerns about loopholes and \nunintended benefits are met. And, I also completely agree that the \ncitizens of the District of Columbia must hold its elected leaders \naccountable for waste and mismanagement.\n  It is important, however, that the general concepts of this bill are \nput before the Congress. This bill is certainly not set in stone, and I \nwould anticipate that many Members of Congress and outside groups will \nhave a number of good ideas on how it can be improved. My goal is that \nCongress start taking a serious look at ways to solve the problems of \nour Nation's capital. One of these ways must include expanding the \nlocal economy and, therefore, the local tax base. And, serious problems \noften require bold solutions.\n  Washington, DC is the capital of the United States of America. Every \nday there are buses of people who come to view the monuments, study the \nhistorical treasures, and participate in their Federal Government. \nEvery day there are people from foreign nations who may get their first \nand, in some cases, only taste of America from visiting our capital. \nUnfortunately, a city rife with pot holes, dilapidated police cars, and \ndrug dealers and prostitutes openly offering their wares is not the \nimpression of our country most Americans wish to leave with visitors \nfrom foreign countries, let alone tolerate themselves.\n  I quote Washington Post columnist James Glassman when I say that it \nis time to act courageously and adopt a proposal that could help save \nthis city. I urge my colleagues to become actively involved in the \ndebate and in searching for ways to revitalize and reinvigorate a city \nthat is as important to Floridians as it is to Utahns, as important to \nCalifornians as to Pennsylvanians.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this bold effort to jump start \nboth the economy and civic pride of the District of Columbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8636-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the names of the Senator from Utah \n[Mr. Bennett] and the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 684, a bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for programs of research regarding Parkinson's disease, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 864\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Pryor] was added as a cosponsor of S. 864, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for increased medicare \nreimbursement for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists to \nincrease the delivery of health services in health professional \nshortage areas, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 949, a bill to require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the 200th \nanniversary of the death of George Washington.\n\n\n                                S. 1675\n\n  At the request of Mr. Biden, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nHarkin] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1675, a bill to provide for the \nnationwide tracking of convicted sexual predators, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1965\n\n  At the request of Mr. Biden, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Daschle] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1965, a bill to \nprevent the illegal manufacturing and use of methamphetamine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8643-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8643-S8645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 282 RELATIVE TO THE DAY OF NATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT \n                     YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Frist, Mr. \nLevin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Akaka, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nMoynihan, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Reid, Mr. Simon, Mr. \nKohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Bennett, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Coats, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Burns, Mr. Graham, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Roth, Mr. \nDorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nFaircloth, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Thompson, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Robb, Mr. Kempthorne, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Mack, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nGrams, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Campbell, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Heflin, Mrs. Frahm, Mr. Exon, Mr. Abraham, \nMr. Ford, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nHatfield, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nNunn, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Warner, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Pell) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

The President is authorized and requested to \n     issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the \n     United States to observe such day with appropriate \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Specter and Senator Wellstone, who initially joined me to serve \nas original cosponsors, to submit a resolution designating October 10, \n1996, as a day of national concern about young people and gun violence.\n  This resolution has enjoyed broad bipartisan support over the last \nseveral days. I have been asking other Members of the Senate if they \nwould like to join as original cosponsors of this resolution. As of \ntoday, the date of its introduction, there are 81 additional cosponsors \nof this resolution to declare October 10 as a national day of concern \nabout young people and gun violence.\n  Mr. President, we are in a crisis in this country. America is losing \na generation of young people to crime and violence. Last July, Cindy \nVillalba, a 20-year-old Rutgers University student, was slain in \nPaterson, NJ, when a bullet from a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol \ncareened into her chest. The assailant, Corie Miller, was 17 years old.\n  The murder was a senseless tragedy. Ms. Villalba was sitting in a car \ntalking to a friend, Julissa Vargas. Miller, along with two other \nteenagers, aged 19 and 18, approached the vehicle and demanded money. \nWhen the two women insisted they did not have any money and began \nscreaming, Miller cocked the pistol and struck Vargas in the back of \nthe head. The pistol then discharged, and a bullet struck Villalba in \nthe chest, killing her instantly. Villalba, a catechism teacher at St. \nJohn the Baptist Cathedral, had just returned from Costa Rica, where \nshe was teaching English to schoolchildren as a part of a Rutgers \nUniversity program.\n  A few months after the murder of Ms. Villalba, Desmond Carberry, then \n12 years old, took a loaded gun and pointed it at his 10-year-old \nneighborhood playmate's head. He squeezed the trigger, killing Noel \nDaRoja. The children were playing unsupervised with a .22-caliber \nhandgun at a third friend's house in Berkeley Township, NJ, on a day \nwhen school was let out early because of teacher conferences. They had\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\na dispute, and use of the gun resulted from the dispute.\n  Mr. President, the common theme in the murders of Cindy Villalba and \nNoel DaRoja is that children are killing and being killed at an \nalarming rate in this country. The number of juveniles murdered in 1994 \nwas 47 percent greater than the number in 1980.\n  Mr. President, juvenile homicides involving firearms tripled from \n1980 to 1994. Ask any police chief of any major city in this country, \nand they will tell you the problem in violence is that now the weapons \nare more powerful and they are used more frequently.\n  Teenage violence is skyrocketing. In 1994, one in five murdered \njuveniles were known to be killed by a juvenile offender. Juveniles \nwere responsible for 14 percent of all violent crimes cleared in 1994, \nand young people were 17 percent of all persons arrested for murder \nthat same year. Among young African-American males, murder is the No. 1 \ncause of death.\n  Mr. President, young people in this country are understandably \nfrightened. In 1993, 42 percent of students in grades 6 to 12 reported \nknowing of weapons in their school. That same year, nearly 75 percent \nof students were aware of incidents of physical attack, robbery or \nbullying. Almost one-third of the students had witnessed such attacks, \nand at least one-fourth were worried about being the victims of such \nattacks.\n  Mr. President, this is not simply an urban problem. It is a national \nproblem. During the 3-month period between December 1995 and February \nof this year, 31 teenagers were murdered in the largely suburban New \nJersey counties of Monmouth, Ocean, Middlesex, Somerset and Union.\n  In January, 18-year-old Torrance Turner of suburban Lakewood, NJ, \ndied after being shot in the face after a confrontation outside an \napartment complex.\n  In September 1994, 20-year-old George Corbett biked to a park in \nsuburban Old Bridge with a .22-caliber rifle swung over his shoulder. \nOnce at the park, he shot 14-year-old Christopher Shrimpton in the \nhead, killing him instantly. This deadly confrontation resulted from a \ndispute between the boys after the Old Bridge police caught them trying \nto break into a car the summer before the shooting.\n  Mr. President, the epidemic of violence is ensnaring our children at \nan alarming rate. I could go on and I could go on and on with story \nafter heartbreaking story about kids killing kids and being killed. It \nis time to reverse this deadly trend because, if we do not, the future \nof America will perish before our eyes.\n  It is time to make it unfashionable to carry a gun to school. It is \ntime to make it unacceptable to resolve a dispute with a gun. It is \ntime to give young people in this country a chance to stand up and \nretake their schools and their neighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, the resolution that I am introducing today is designed \nto give American young people a chance to stop the carnage that is \ntaking place on the streets that they often frequent. The resolution \ndesignates October 10, 1996, as a day of national concern about young \npeople and gun violence.\n  October 10 will mark a national observance, giving young people \nthroughout the country the chance to sign a voluntary pledge. On this \nday young people will be asked to sign the pledge. Across this country, \nthey will be asked to raise their hand in urban centers and small towns \nalike. They will be asked to raise their hand and say, ``I pledge that \nI will never bring a gun to school; that I will never use a gun to \nsettle a dispute; and that I will use my influence with my friends to \nkeep them from using guns to settle disputes.''\n  That is the pledge.\n  Mr. President, by taking individual and collective responsibility for \ntheir decisions and actions, American young people can help chart a \nless violent future. Through the power of their collective voices, \nyoung people can demonstrate that the country, through their initiative \nand resolve, has come to terms with a crisis.\n\n  A couple of years ago there was something called Hands Across \nAmerica, where on one day, at one time, literally millions of Americans \njoined hands to make a very important point. It is my hope that every \nlocal television station, that local radio stations, that local \ninstitutions on that day, October 10, will cover young people in \nschools, raising their hand, and take this pledge.\n  Mr. President, the distribution of the national pledge will give \nlocal communities and residents of those communities the power to \ncontrol their own destiny. Instead of looking to Washington to stop the \nscourge of violence, young people will take the pledge, and they \nthemselves, by their action, will stop the violence.\n  Mr. President, this resolution does not concern the issue of gun \ncontrol. It does not prevent someone from becoming a police officer, \njoining a State patrol, using a gun in hunting. It is designed simply \nfor one purpose, and one purpose only. That is to curb the epidemic of \ngun violence and its deadly consequences for America's young people.\n  This bipartisan resolution is supported by the American Federation of \nTeachers, who frequently are the targets of some of this gun touting, \nthe National Education Association, the Council of Great City Schools, \nthe National League of Women Voters, Mothers Against Violence in \nAmerica, the National Parent Teachers Association, Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, the American Association of School Administrators, the \nPresbyterian Church of the USA, United Church of Christ Office for \nChurch in Society, the National School Board Association, the United \nMethodist Church and the General Board of Church and Society.\n  Mr. President, young people are our most important resource. As a \nsociety, we have a vested interest in helping people survive, free from \nfear and violence, and survive into healthy adulthood. It is my hope, \nmy sincere hope that all 84 Senators who have supported this resolution \nand cosponsored it, will share in their communities and States on this \nday of October 10, 1996, and oversee and participate with young people \ntaking this pledge.\n  Some people say, well, what is a little resolution, a little \nresolution designating a day? It is a focus, that is what it is. It is \na focus. It is a focus that allows young people, wherever they are, to \ntake some control over their school, to give those who want it to be a \nsafer place a chance to organize around an action, a simple pledge. ``I \npledge never to tell a lie''--we have all heard that before. It has \nsome impact when it is taken seriously. ``I pledge never to take a gun \nto school, never to use a gun to resolve a dispute, and to use my \ninfluence to keep my friends from using a gun to resolve a dispute.'' A \nvery simple idea. If adhered to, a very positive and successful idea.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are here today simply to ask \nstudents to sign a pledge declaring that they will never bring a weapon \nto school, they will not use a weapon to settle disputes, and they will \nuse their influence to prevent their friends from using weapons to \nsettle disputes.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed that homicides and suicides are \nthe leading causes of death for young people in Minnesota's largest \ncounty, Hennepin County. For teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19, \n77 percent of the homicides involve guns.\n  I am deeply disturbed that juvenile aggravated assaults tripled in \nMinnesota in the 10 years between 1980 and 1990. Half of these crimes \ninvolve guns. I was horrified to find out that, of the 105 school-\nassociated deaths between 1992 and 1994, 75 percent were committed with \nguns, according to the National School Safety Center.\n  Mr. President, I was dismayed to read in the Minneapolis Star \nTribune, ``More children in Minnesota are going to school angry and \narmed.'' More than 3,700 students reported carrying a gun to school at \nleast once during the month the survey was taken by the Department of \nChildren, Families and Learning. One Minnesota official said that they \nare ``swimming upstream when it comes to growing violence among young \npeople.''\n  Every State in the Nation, every school district whether rural, \nsuburban or urban has these kinds of stories, these kinds of \nstatistics. That's why we have got to urge students to sign a pledge \ndeclaring that they will never bring a weapon to school, they will not \nuse a weapon to settle disputes, and they will use their influence to \nprevent their friends from using weapons to settle disputes.\n  Clearly, the pledge is only a small step in preventing gun violence. \nBut we\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\nhave got to start with changing children's perceptions and helping them \navoid crime and violence. If kids are using guns, if kids are bringing \nguns to school, those are signs of much deeper crises we have got to \nwork hard to address.\n  One effort we have tried with great success is the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools initiative. This helps schools become safer, more disciplined \nand drug-free. Parents, teachers, and law enforcement officials tell us \nit is one of the most effective programs they have seen.\n  However, the extremist Republicans in the House want to spend $99 \nmillion less in 1997 nationwide, and $1.08 million less in Minnesota \nalone, than the President wants to spend to keep schools safe and drug \nfree.\n  Earlier in June, I met with Chuck Anderson. He is a violence \nintervention trainer at Black Hawk Middle School in Eagan, MN. He has \ntaught since 1970. The program that he coordinates, which is funded \nunder Safe and Drug Free Schools, trains both teachers and students to \neffectively resolve conflicts in the school as an alternative to \ndisciplinary policy. This program Mr. Anderson directs provides \nappropriate proactive plans for students to learn means by which to \navoid violence and fighting through peaceful intervention. Along with \nthis gun pledge, we have got to support teachers like Chuck Anderson if \nwe truly want to reduce violence in our schools and our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8643-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8645-S8646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BROWN AMENDMENT NO. 5002\n\n  Mr. BROWN proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 3603) making \nappropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and related agencies programs for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

Mr. President, yesterday we debated a welfare \nbill that will have far-reaching impacts, and I'd like to draw your \nattention to the words used in the debate, and to a handful of them in \nparticular. One word you heard is the word ``children.''\n  For quite a while now, I have been amazed at how many debates happen \non the Senate floor in which we do not hear this word, and do not spend \nenough time considering the actual children the word represents. It's \nironic to me that so much of our attention in the welfare debate has \nbeen focused on children. I know everyone here cares; I know we have \nall strived, and tried to protect children. I want to be able to say \nwe've done everything we can--and we almost have gotten over that line, \nbut it is with great personal regret that I say I think we could have \ndone just a bit more.\n  The bill we sent out yesterday will change the lives of all children \nin this country, and could have dire implications for many of them. All \nof us were children, many of us have children, and some of us are \ncurrently raising children--I know this word is not exclusive or \npartisan.\n  I just hope after today each of us will continue to use this word in \nother debates, and always keep children in our thoughts.\n  Another word you've heard quite a bit is welfare. I think people in \nthis country have varying levels of understanding about all the \nservices we call ``welfare'' and what they do. But it's obvious from \nthe bill we considered that many Americans these days share a wish to \nend welfare programs.\n  In my view, the welfare reform debate here in the Senate will \nofficially end with the final passage of this bill. I hope that it will \nfinally be a bill we can all support. However, a whole new discussion \nmust now begin--a discussion about the needs of children in families \nfrom any income category, and about how we as adults will create new \nopportunities for them.\n  I think the welfare reform debate we've been having is really part of \na larger discussion about something people often mention here--personal \nresponsibility.\n  I am in favor--and I've said this many times before--of asking \nAmericans to remember not only their rights, but also their \nresponsibilities. What we are asking from people in this country who \nare on public assistance, is to do every thing they can to contribute \nto our society and economy, in exchange for the help all other \ntaxpaying citizens are making possible. Whether it's work, or training \nfor work, we need people to end their own dependency on outside \nassistance and contribute to the work of this great Nation.\n  But when we talk about personal responsibility, all Americans must \nrecall those eloquent words from President John F. Kennedy on this \ntopic. Each of us in this country must think about our own \nresponsibility, whether we are on public assistance, or are calling for \nits reform.\n  Whether you ask the American public generally, or people on public \nassistance themselves, you will hear about the problems with welfare. \nWelfare has created a cycle of dependence. Welfare sets up perverse \nincentives, which actually discourage work. Welfare has been around \nlong enough for everyone to see its effects, but though it has helped \nmany people, it has not turned around the prospects of thousands of \npoor people living in a rich Nation.\n  As long as we all know what we mean by welfare, I agree with these \nstatements, and I think we are obligated to change this system to \naddress these problems.\n  When I say we need to agree about what welfare is, I'm thinking of \nthe many stereotypes, attacks and characterizations we hear. I think \nwelfare has become a negative word in this country people use to beat \nup on poor women and children. And, if this week we have stopped \nsupporting programs that create that kind of thinking, and started to \nsupport individual people in ways that will make them more independent, \nthen we've made a good first step.\n  I'm also thinking about the real picture--at least in my State--of \nwho is on welfare. In my State, the most common profile is a single \nmother, age 29, with two children. Three-fourths of the time she is \nwhite, more than half of the time she became a mother as a teenager. \nAlmost 60 percent of the time, her youngest child is more than 3 years \nold.\n  We know that getting a woman who fits this description into a job is \na little easier in my State than many others, but we also know we need \ndifferent strategies to get many different types of people back into \nwork, or into work for the first time.\n  We know that each of these women has prior experiences that affect \ntheir reliance on public assistance. We know their experiences with \nwork are important, as are their experiences with education and skill \ntraining, and other factors such as literacy, learning disability, and \ndomestic violence. We need to remember this as localities design \ndifferent strategies, or it just won't work.\n  Despite all we know about our welfare system and people who are on \npublic assistance, I think most of us still agree that what we have now \nisn't doing the job.\n  So, the people of this country are demanding new tools that work \nbetter, and the demand has been heard here. The will of the Senate is \nto change, fundamentally, the way public assistance will work. I just \nworry that we have not adequately protected the ones who are not making \nthe decisions--the kids.\n  The effect of last night's Senate action will be to put the brakes on \nour current system of public assistance, so we can embark in a new \ndirection. This will be difficult. People will need all of our help \nmaking this transition.\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\n  This is not an ending; it is a beginning. We must remember that \nprevious Senates designed our current system in response to problems of \nchronic poverty and joblessness in our past. Those problems have not \ngone away. But we need new solutions. We need to end welfare, or at \nleast the negative welfare debate, as it stands. But the basic health \nand educational needs of children don't go away, just because of the \nvotes we take here.\n  The Senate debated many amendments, some of which passed, and some of \nwhich did not. As we debated these, I was preparing to support the \nbill. I wanted to amend the bill to improve it the point I could lend \nmy support. As it turned out, each time we were able to pass an \namendment, we seemed to lose another that had far-reaching impacts.\n  I will highlight some of these amendments now because they are very \nimportant to whether we ultimately send a bill to the President he can \nsign. Some things that we fought for yesterday we should keep and \nimprove as the bill moves forward:\n  First, I have fought very hard along with my Democratic colleagues to \nstave off repeal of American's guarantee of health services under \nMedicaid. In my State, over a third of the people who get medical \nassistance aren't on welfare--they're in low-income working families.\n  I want all people who are served by Medicaid to work, or be in \ntraining, or contribute what they can. We have many people in this \ncountry who are not on public assistance, who don't get health \ninsurance where they work. I want to make that easier. All children, \nregardless of income, should be free from worry about health care \ncoverage.\n  But, in this bill as it came to the floor, the Senate put at risk the \nhealth care of hundreds of Washington State citizens, just as they are \ntrying to get into the work force--where they face the prospect of \nminimal or no health insurance coverage.\n  Fortunately, the Senate supported the Breaux-Chafee-Murray amendment \ncontinuing this health coverage. We need to support people, so they can \nmake the transition, and can add to the economy instead of subtracting.\n  Second, when this bill came to the floor, it still had potential to \nseriously damage the nutrition of many children and families in my \nState. About 250,000 children in my State now receive some food stamp \nbenefit--and today we passed the Conrad-Murray amendment so that we do \nnot to jeopardize the nutrition of these families while they make the \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  Third, when we think of child nutrition, we frequently think of our \nimportant program that helps provide school lunch and breakfast. A \nrelated program makes sure kids who need it also have access to meals \nin the summer--at their community center, at a school, or wherever \nchildren and adults gather for summer activities. This is the Summer \nFood Program. Under this bill, these children faced a 23-cent-per-meal \ncut to this service, which could have forced 60 percent of the programs \nin my State to close their doors.\n  We know that children's hunger doesn't stop just because it's summer \nand they can't get school lunch. Children who rely on school lunch get \nfrom one-third to one-half of their daily nutrition from that meal. So, \nI offered and passed an amendment to seek improvement for the Summer \nFood Program. My goal is to keep more of the 25,000 children in \nWashington State in line for a nutritious meal.\n  Fourth, we must provide educational opportunity to people if we are \ntrying to get them off public assistance. To send people who cannot \nread out looking for jobs that are not there is just too much to \nexpect. We must allow adults to complete their basic education or \nG.E.D. We must allow people to stay in training for 24 months--that's \nthe length of most training programs. And we must let States have a \nlarger percentage of people in training. The Simon-Murray literacy \namendment does these things, and I'm happy the Senate chose to include \nit.\n  I was also glad we held off amendments and efforts to use lack of \neducation as an excuse to penalize people on public assistance. We've \ngot to get them educated. States know how to do this and will achieve \ngreat things.\n  Fifth, we must give parents the peace of mind that when they have \ntaken their daughter or son to the child care center, that at least the \nminimum health and safety requirements are being followed. Also, \nparents want quality in child care, not just safety, so I'm glad the \nSenate bill's deficiencies on these two topics were remedied through \namendments.\n  There are other improvements, made by the majority party, made in \ncommittee, and made yesterday on the floor. I hope the final bill \nretains them. I hope I get a chance to support them out of the Senate, \nso the President can sign a bill that is very close to wide bipartisan \nagreement. Such a bill won't be overly detrimental to children.\n  Unfortunately, there are other areas where this bill still just did \nnot meet my internal test. With the kids in mind, I simply could not \nsupport the following:\n  Item A: We are trying to shift from reliance on cash assistance. In \nWashington State, 186,000 children receive basic assistance under AFDC. \nUnder a 5-year time limit, 60,203 children would be eliminated from the \nprogram, and that number would increase to 118,915 under a 2-year \nlimit.\n  What we do for these children instead of AFDC will make the \ndifference in their well-being, because they are still going to need \nhelp after this welfare bill is signed. By rejecting attempts even to \nallow States to provide non-cash assistance to kids, we made this bill \nimpossible to support. I want the conference committee, when looking to \ncreate a bipartisan bill--at a minimum--to include provisions to allow \nStates the flexibility denied them by one vote in the Senate yesterday.\n  Item B: Even with the Conrad-Murray amendment on food stamps, this \nbill cuts $4 billion deeper than the Senate-passed bill I supported. \nWe've got to get people off public assistance, but the children must \nhave food to eat, especially if the parents are in a struggle to change \ntheir entire way of life. The reality is, any deep cut to food stamps \ndirectly affects the children.\n  Item C: The bill's effects will fall on women 75 percent of the time.\n  Item D: Even legal immigrants face enormous challenges under this \nbill, and our communities will face similar challenges in assuring the \npublic health because of it. These are people who are working toward \ncitizenship, like all of our parents or ancestors. We should be firm \nabout what we ask of people striving for American opportunity. But \nwhatever we ask of these adults, we should have made allowances for \ntheir children, and so far, we have not.\n  Item E: As many as 300,000 American children with disabilities will \nlose social security income assistance under this bill.\n  Item F: The administration sent Chairman Roth a letter predicting as \nmany as 1.5 million children could be thrown into poverty under last \nyear's bill. We don't know the exact number for this bill, but we can \nassume it would be a bit lower and in the same ballpark. I have asked \nthe administration for updated figures. I just could not support doing \nthis when we did not have very clear answers about what will happen for \nthose children whose parents cannot find success under the new system. \nWe need to provide a few more handles for the kids of those Americans \nstruggling to end this dependence.\n  All of these facts are why this Senate must remain vigilant in talks \nwith the House. I go on record saying that provisions in these \nessential areas--of noncash assistance, of child nutrition, of child \nhealth, of child care, of adult education and monitoring are make-or-\nbreak issues for ensuring a workable final product. I support welfare \nreform. I thought yesterday's bill was going to be it. But, I could \nnot, and cannot vote for a bill that fails children in this way.\n  Many of you know that I supported the Senate welfare bill last year, \nand I wanted to do it yesterday. I am in favor of welfare reform, and I \nthink we are very, very close. Let me emphasize this one more time. We \nhave not debated the merits of limiting the time a person can be on \nwelfare, because we agree there should be strict limits. What we have \nbeen debating is what we do while someone is on welfare to prepare that \nperson to enter the work force. At the end of this debate, the answer \nis not clear one bit.\n  The Senate must remain vigilant about the effects of this bill in the \nreal\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\nworld outside these walls. The States, localities, and individual \npeople in this country who have asked for this fundamental change \nmust now take on the hard work and the responsibility they have \ndemanded.\n\n  States and local governments and--best of all--community groups of \nregular American citizens, are showing that much of the best work of \ngovernment is done locally, with direct input from the people served.\n  I have no doubt that States will work to get people on the path to \nsuccess. Just to be sure, I am glad the Senate adopted the amendment \nSenator Kerry and I worked on, requiring States to take corrective \naction as soon as indicators show effects from this bill that increase \nchild poverty.\n  I just want to make sure we all understand--inside and outside this \nbuilding today--exactly what we are doing here as we move ahead with \nthis bill, and what that will mean. This bill today only tells the \npeople what the Federal Government is not going to do any more. In its \nwake, we will be left with a clear picture of how much work all of us \nhave left to do.\n  Localities are clearly the best places to make many decisions in our \nGovernment. The Federal Government should be the place where national \nstandards are set--so that a child in any State in this country gets \nwhat she or he needs to grow up healthy, educated, and able to \ncontribute to society as an adult.\n  Every child needs these things, and our country's economy and \nheritage cannot afford not to make this so. As we sent this bill out of \nthe Senate, we have tried to retain as many national standards as \npossible, and even though we have had some success, we have failed on \nothers--and we are going to have to come back here in January and get \nto work on new ways to improve the standards we have.\n  If you ask any CEO of any company what this country needs to thrive, \nthey will tell you we need more highly skilled, highly educated people \nmaking good decisions in the workplace, and we need less people out on \nthe street doing crimes.\n  I met with a high school assistant principal last week who has spent \nyears working with children and young people with behavior problems, \nwho do not do what adults want them to do. He has found successful ways \nof helping these students to learn how to behave in accordance with our \nexpectations of them.\n  But he said to me, and I think he is absolutely right: ``You can pay \nme now, or you can pay them later.'' Because our young people would \nmuch rather be an asset to our country than a liability, and the vast \nmajority of them are. But, they are bright young people, all of them. \nAnd if they do not find success in school and the economy, they will \nfind it by getting really good at breaking into your house.\n  To avoid this, we must keep the Federal Government in the business of \nassuring standards, and must improve the ones we have today. On top of \nthis, each and every American must invest the time and energy it takes \nto make sure every child is healthy enough to learn, and educated \nenough to contribute to her or his community.\n  So, since we have passed this welfare reform proposal, we must be \naware that America had problems before we voted yesterday, and we will \nhave problems afterward, and that this is only the first step. If we \nreally want a country where every child's well-being is secure, where \nevery person can be a contributing member of our society and economy, \nwhere the world around us is healthy and beautiful and a great place to \nlive--then we must start a discussion in every community and around \nevery dinner table--a discussion that just has not happened lately in \nthis Nation.\n  What is important to us as Americans? What do we hold dear? What do \nour children mean to us, and what is each of us committed to do about \nit?\n\n  Every American must be part of the discussion to determine what we \ncan each do, now, to make things better in this country. What can each \nperson, in front of each television set, or in each car, or in the \nstands at each sporting event, do to get America on the right track? \nWhat can each person who gets any assistance from her or his \nGovernment--be it a welfare check or a paved road or a tax incentive or \na safe hamburger or a bank that will not one day close its doors--what \ncan each person do today to join us in making this country great?\n  People on this floor often talk about the old days, a simpler time, \nwhen things were better. Well, I am here to tell you that Americans \ntoday are just as capable of solving problems as any past generation--\nit is the American spirit that is going to make this happen.\n  People at home are now watching the Olympics, where the best athletes \nin our Nation will compete against athletes from the rest of the world. \nAnd they will win gold medals for their efforts, and for our Nation. \nThese people are heroes, and we should all rally around them. But we \ncan not forget the other heroism in this great country that we have \nseen in the old days and that we see today--the heroism of the American \nspirit.\n  Thousands of people in this country grew their own food during World \nWar II, in victory gardens, to diminish the drain on our resources. \nThey collected every piece of metal they could find, so our brave men \nand women could have the best tools with which to win the war. They \nwent, especially the women, out of their homes and into the factories \nto work for this country.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Americans, like my parents and grandparents, \ngave of themselves, through the Great Depression, through war, through \nthe war on poverty in the sixties, for our shared future.\n  Many of them have not stopped giving. There are senior citizens in my \nState who go to school every week to help children and to help each \nother to learn about and work with computers. There are hundreds of \nyoung people, sixth-graders and college students, going into the \ncommunity with hard work and good ideas. There are also kids who are \ntruly heroic for just making it to school each day, or for not letting \na bad family situation crush their hopes for the future.\n  I want to caution you all that the American people have spoken and \ndemanded change to public assistance, but they still want Government to \nplay a role in helping people when they need help, and the American \npeople are capable of speaking again, loudly and angrily, if we do not \nmake this work.\n  We have sent a bill out of the Senate. We put the House on notice \nthat this bill needs to be bipartisan, and needs to be the best bill \npossible under the circumstances, when it comes to children. I have \nmade several attempts to improve this bill, and I will tell you, it can \nstill use improvement.\n  I appreciate that the majority party has sought compromise in some \nareas, that they have made some improvements. But again, it is the \nnature of this debate that we are not foreseeing all the possible \neffects of this bill. We are entering uncharted territory. We must \nremain vigilant. And we here in this body must call upon every one of \nour constituents to join the fight to make this work for the people \naround them.\n  We are leaving the discussion about welfare reform. We are entering a \ndiscussion about different ways to make sure all children are healthy, \ndespite the income of their family. Poor health, illiteracy, antisocial \nbehavior--these are not the exclusive domain of the poor--all Americans \nare subject to the ravages of these problems, especially our children.\n  We are entering a time when we need to focus on creating opportunity \nfor our children, and meeting their basic needs--health, nutrition, \neducation, so as adults they will contribute positively to the economic \nand social structure of this country.\n  Our country, compared to other industrialized nations does a very \nshabby job of assuring the basics. If we are no longer going to do it \nthrough public assistance in the same way we have done--then we need to \nfind new ways to do it.\n  I do not think this bill brings promise for the people it will \naffect. We have improved it for sure, but it could be better. But the \nfact is, the bill will soon be the law of the land. In the face of \nthis, I challenge each American to help us put something in place to \nprotect children, as we tear apart this system that has created such \ndependency.\n  Especially where children are concerned, this bill cannot be allowed \nto come back worse from the conference committee. It is our moral \nobligation\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nto hold the children as harmless as we can, no matter what we are \nasking of their parents.\n  After yesterday, I expect that all Senators will join in this new \ndiscussion--of what we must do to assure basic standards of health, \neducation for children and all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8668-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MRS. GERTRUDE RAMSAY CRAIN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGertrude Ramsay Crain. With her passing on July 20, America's \npublishing industry lost one of its most accomplished members. After 4 \ndecades of dutifully covering the Detroit business community, Mrs. \nCrain's presence will certainly be missed.\n  In 1916, G.D. Crain, Jr., Mrs. Crain's late husband, founded Crain \nCommunications. Eighty years later, this company employs 900 people \nworldwide. A leader in the area of business reporting, Crain \nCommunications publishes 29 business newspapers and magazines. Among \nthe most popular of these are Crain's Detroit Business, Automotive \nNews, Auto Week, and Detroit Monthly.\n  This company is a testament to the American Dream. Crain \nCommunications demonstrates that those who work hard and are passionate \nabout their product can succeed. Prior to her retirement earlier this \nyear, Mrs. Crain held a variety of positions within Crain \nCommunications, from secretary to assistant treasurer to chairman.\n  During her tenure, Mrs. Crain's commitment to her craft did not go \nunnoticed. In addition to being the first woman inducted into the \nJunior Achievement of Chicago Business Hall of Fame, Mrs. Crain \nreceived an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the \nUniversity of Detroit, and was the 1993 recipient of the Magazine \nPublishers of America Henry Johnson Award, the highest honor given by \nthe advertising and communications industry.\n  Although Mrs. Crain made Chicago her home, Detroit can consider \nitself a fortunate beneficiary of her life's work. An invaluable asset \nto both communities, the value of Mrs. Gertrude Crain's contributions \nwill live on for quite some time. We in Michigan are fortunate, indeed, \nto have had this woman and her family's company in our midst.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8671-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REHOBOTH BEACH, DE, BEACH PATROL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, many Members of this House and \nthousands of residents of this city are familiar with Rehoboth Beach, \nDE, as the Summer Capital of the United States--and there's more to \nthat expression than merely a nickname.\n  The Delaware seashore resort has for decades welcomed vacationing \nPresidents, Cabinet Secretaries, Members of Congress, representatives \nof the diplomatic community, and thousands of other Washingtonians of \nevery description. Rehoboth Beach's attractions include its sparkling \nAtlantic surf; broad beaches; a lively, multi-lingual boardwalk echoing \nlanguages from all over the world; a faithfully family-oriented \natmosphere; and safety in the water for younger and older visitors \nalike.\n  Next Saturday, in fact, the Rehoboth Beach Patrol--the courteous and \nskillful young women and men who protect the resort's ocean swimmers--\nwill hold its first lifeguards' reunion, celebrating not only 75 years \nof service to the community and its visitors, but a remarkable three-\nquarter-century record of perfect safety of the swimmers under their \nprotection. Since 1921, when the Rehoboth Beach Patrol was established \nwith just two lifeguards, until today, when as many as 37 guards are on \nduty during peak periods along the mile and a half of protected beach, \nthe Rehoboth Beach lifeguards have never lost a swimmer.\n  That is a record any beach patrol would be proud of, and it was not \nachieved by accident. Guarding a crowded ocean beach is a constant \nchallenge--every summer the Rehoboth Beach lifeguards pull scores of \ntroubled swimmers from the surf, treat hundreds of injuries, and \nreunite more than 400 lost children with their parents. It is a task \nthat requires ceaseless alertness, well-conditioned bodies and highly \ntrained skills, and unflinching personal courage when the ocean \nattempts to claim a victim.\n  It is more than just a job to those who undertake it. It is a valued \ntradition that has sustained Rehoboth Beach as a desirable ocean resort \nfor 7 decades and has called to its service generations of families--\nfathers, brothers and, since the late seventies, sisters--from \nDelaware, from its neighboring States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and \nfrom this very city.\n  These young men and women are athletes who thrive on competition, and \ntheir competitive instincts pit them every day against the sea, and \noften, to heighten their morale and sharpen their skills, against other \nbeach patrols in national and international contests. They train \nconstantly; they dedicate their days to the safety of others, often at \nthe risk of their own; and their service is vital to the pleasure and \nthe security of the hundreds of thousands of vacationers who visit \nRehoboth Beach every summer.\n  Mr. President, we Delawareans are very proud of the Rehoboth Beach \nPatrol and its 75-year record of perfect safety. We believe these brave \nyoung women and men represent the best that Delaware and the Nation \nhave to offer in the way of idealism, energy and a willingness to risk \nall in the service of others. And we invite our neighbors in the Middle \nAtlantic States to join us in congratulating the Rehoboth Beach Patrol \nand its Alumni Association for calling together for the first time \nlifeguards who have served the resort over the past 75 years, including \na 91-year-old who last mounted a guard stand in 1926 as well as the 46 \ncurrent members of the patrol.\n  They deserve our admiration and our thanks, and we all wish them a \nsuccessful and rewarding reunion this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8671-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8671-S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF CAPT. JOHN ``JACK'' KENNEDY UPON THE RETURN OF \n           HIS REMAINS TO THE UNITED STATES ON AUGUST 1, 1996\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, many of my colleagues may remember an \nAir Force lieutenant colonel named Dan Kennedy who served in an \noutstanding fashion a number of years ago in the Senate Liaison Office. \nSome of us may also recall that Dan had a brother, Jack, who was an Air \nForce pilot who lost his life in the war in Southeast Asia.\n  Jack's remains returned to the United States in June of this year \nending years of uncertainty and frustration for his family and loved \nones. I think it is most appropriate that we pause for a moment to \nremember Capt. Jack Kennedy's sacrifice.\n  Some 25 years ago this August, Capt. Jack Kennedy was lost while \nflying a reconnaissance mission over South Vietnam. Jack was a forward \nair controller with the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron based in Chu \nLai in support of the 23d Infantry Division.\n  On August 16, 1971, he failed to check in during normal radio \ncommunications checks. Unfortunately, there were no radio calls from \nhis aircraft and there were no eye witnesses.\n  There were, however, reports of a North Vietnamese regiment operating \nin the area over which Jack was flying that day. Although there was no \ncrash site found, Jack was listed as missing in action, a status he \ncarried until the Air Force moved to change it to presumed killed in \naction in July 1978.\n  In 1992, after several visits and discussions with Vietnamese \nvillagers, a joint United States/Vietnamese team identified a possible \ncrash site. At that time, no conclusive evidence was available to \nspecifically identify the site as the one where Jack Kennedy's plane \nhad crashed. In 1993, several bone fragments, reportedly from the pilot \nof that aircraft, were provided by villagers.\n  Recent advances in medical science fostered the development \ntechniques that permit the comparison of DNA extracted from bone \nfragments with DNA from another family member for the purposes of \nidentification.\n  In May of this year, the Air Force advised Jack's family that the \nbone fragments recovered at the crash site in 1992 had been positively \nidentified as being Jack's.\n  Capt. Jack Kennedy's remains arrived at Travis Air Force Base in \nCalifornia in late June, and will be flown to\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nWashington, DC, on August 1. A funeral is scheduled for August 2 at 11 \na.m. in the Old Post Chapel on Fort Myers followed by an internment \nwith full military honors and flyover at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Throughout this long ordeal, Jack's family has persevered. Jack's \nfather, Daniel Kennedy, Sr., died in 1986--10 years before his son's \nremains would be returned to the country he loved so much.\n  Jack's brother, Dan, whom I mentioned earlier, his wife Tamara, and \ntheir six children reside in Dumfries, VA. Jack's mother, Mrs. Sally \nKennedy, lives in Lake Ridge, VA. Today, I would like to offer her our \nmost sincere appreciation for the sacrifice her son Jack made in the \nservice of his country, and for the steadfast faith with which she has \nendured the tremendous sense of loss, the unparalleled uncertainty and \nthe incomprehensible frustration that, in some small measure, will be \nlessened in the very near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8671-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LITERACY; ONE TOOL FOR ENDING WELFARE DEPENDENCE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the welfare bill recently passed by the \nSenate provides that families may be denied cash assistance after \nreceiving benefits for a cumulative period of 5 years. States are also \nrequired to have 15 percent of welfare recipients involved in work \nparticipation. By 2002, this percentage must increase to 50 percent of \nthe people on assistance. The bill as it entered the Senate, however, \nwould clearly have failed to prepare these people for the jobs that \nthey are required to obtain.\n  The facts are clear--you are highly unlikely to get off assistance \nand into work if you are unable to read.\n  Vocational education under the bill as it came to the floor was \nlimited to no more than 12 months for any individual. Most education \nand training programs have a 2-year duration, and therefore, cannot be \ncompleted within the bill's time allowance.\n  In addition, States are unable to incorporate adult basic education \nactivities into the training programs. This, at a time when we know \nmore than ever about the link between adult education and literacy and \ndependence on the welfare system.\n  Analysis by the Urban Institute shows that of people who have been \nAFDC recipients of less than 25 months, 34.8 percent have not obtained \na high school degree or a GED. But, among recipients who receive AFDC \nassistance for 60 months or more, this number jumps to 62.8 percent. \nThe less educated a person is, the longer he or she is likely to remain \nreliant on the welfare system.\n  A 1995 report released by the Policy Information Center at the \nEducation Testing Service also notes that welfare recipients with \nhigher literacy levels worked more weeks and earned higher average \nweekly wages in comparison with other recipients during the previous \nyear. All this simply reinforces the importance of education and \nliteracy in helping people get off, and stay off, the welfare system.\n  This bill as it came to the Senate did not provide enough \nflexibility, and did not allow the necessary education and training \nrequired to produce successful employees. In order to correct the \ninflexibility of this welfare bill, Senators Simon, Jeffords, Kerry, \nSpecter, and I yesterday proposed and passed a literacy amendment that \nwill let states do what is needed.\n  This amendment has three basic provisions. The length of allowable \neducational training will be extended from 12 to 24 months; extending \ntraining period to permit the completion of training programs. The \namendment also expands the definition of vocational training to include \nadult basic education, such as a GED completion course.\n  Without basic educational and literacy levels, people cannot perform \njob duties nor can they expand their skills through more advanced \neducation. The amendment also allows States to increase people in \neducational programs from 20 to 30 percent of their participation \npercentages. States with high unemployment rates might otherwise find \nit difficult to place workers who have virtually no skills.\n  This amendment provides solutions to get people learning, and \nbuilding skills. I want to thank Senators Simon and Jeffords for their \nleadership on these efforts. With the adoption of this amendment, \npeople on public assistance will be able to gain the basic skills they \nneed to become productive workers and remain off the welfare \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8672-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8672-S8736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, like so many of my colleagues, I \nwould like to reform the Nation's welfare system. I believe that able-\nbodied people should work and that our Nation's safety net should be \njust that: a safety net. But I cannot let my desire to vote for welfare \nreform cloud my judgment about the bill that the Senate passed \nyesterday. I have several major concerns about this bill:\n  First, this bill eliminates welfare as an entitlement and replaces it \nwith a block grant. To some, the term entitlement has come to mean an \nexpectation that some people have of support from the Government with \nno effort on their part to achieve self-sufficiency. Defined in those \nterms, I agree that any sense of entitlement must end. But what the \nword entitlement actually means here is that this Nation will respond \nto anyone in great need--that we will not cut off people in need simply \nbecause there are too many people in line before them. A block grant is \nalmost guaranteed to cut off people in need, with children suffering \nthe greatest harm. And while I reluctantly voted last year for the then \npending welfare bill, which included a block grant, I did so primarily \nto strengthen the Senate's position in conference against a far more \ndamaging House-passed bill.\n  Second, I believe that instead of giving people a hand up and out of \nthe welfare system, we have limited their options and their \nopportunities further. For the most part, we have simply shifted this \nserious national problem to the States, and we have done so without \nproviding them with adequate support to address the problem.\n  Third, I am concerned about the bill's harsh treatment of legal \nimmigrants. More often than not, these individuals are hard working, \ntaxpaying individuals who deeply appreciate and value the freedom and \nopportunity of the United States. I cannot agree to deny them so many \nof the benefits that they might legitimately need as they build a life \nhere.\n  Finally, my deepest concern is for the children. No matter what the \nfaults of the parent, we as a society must do all we can to protect and \nnurture the next generation. Otherwise, no matter how tough our welfare \npolicy or how good our toughness makes us feel, we will raise a \ngeneration of children who are incapable of functioning in society, \nmuch less leading it. I simply cannot believe that eliminating an \nentitlement which ensures that all poor children get the food, \nclothing, and shelter that they need can move us individually or as a \nsociety down the path we all want to go.\n  Mr. President, it is with real regret, then, that I cast a ``no'' \nvote on this welfare reform legislation. I know that the will of the \npeople demands action, and I very much want to be part of an effort to \npass a quality welfare reform bill. And I have joined with many of my \nSenate colleagues in voting for amendments that, had they been \napproved, might have made the bill acceptable. But looking at the final \nproduct, I cannot say that what we have adopted is better than what we \nnow have. The risk to our children's future is too great. I will not \npunish a child to teach its parent, and I believe that this is what \nthis legislation, in the end, will do.\n  I regret that the Senate did not approve the work first proposal \nintroduced by Senate Daschle. And I continue to support its emphasis on \ntransitioning welfare recipients to work, its understanding that \nproviding childcare is a linchpin of successful reform, and its premise \nthat--despite very real abuses of the current system by some welfare \nrecipients--most people want to get off welfare and work at a job that \nprovides a living wage. In any effort to pass this kind of welfare \nreform legislation, I will cast a sure and solid ``yea'' vote.\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\n\n\n PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n  The text of the bill (H.R. 3734) to provide for reconciliation \npursuant to section 201(a)(1) of the concurrent resolution on the \nbudget for fiscal year 1997, as passed by the Senate on July 23, 1996, \nis as follows:\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 3734) entitled ``An Act to provide for reconciliation \n     pursuant to section 201(a)(1) of the concurrent resolution on \n     the budget for fiscal year 1997'', do pass with the following \n     amendment:\nStrike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.\n       (2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful \n     society which promotes the interests of children.\n       (3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is \n     integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of \n     children.\n       (4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with \n     children had a child support order established and, of that \n     54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. \n     Of the cases enforced through the public child support \n     enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a \n     collection.\n       (5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families \n     with dependent children (in this section referred to as \n     ``AFDC'') has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-\n     thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent \n     of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in \n     which no father is present.\n       (A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving \n     AFDC benefits--\n       (I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;\n       (II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;\n       (III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and\n       (IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.\n       (ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits \n     increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total \n     number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has \n     declined by 5.5 percent.\n       (B) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits \n     within 10 years.\n       (C) The increase in the number of children receiving public \n     assistance is closely related to the increase in births to \n     unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage of \n     live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, \n     from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.\n       (6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births \n     is well documented as follows:\n       (A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen \n     pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 \n     unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The \n     overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from \n     90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in \n     both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate \n     for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and \n     1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 \n     to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.\n       (B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and \n     1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if the \n     current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the year \n     2015 will be out-of-wedlock.\n       (7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must \n     address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory \n     rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage \n     pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe \n     and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are \n     significantly older.\n       (A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's, the rate for \n     girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.\n       (B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born \n     to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data \n     suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls \n     are fathered by men over age 20.\n       (C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority \n     of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, \n     primarily with older adult men.\n       (8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on \n     the mother, the child, the family, and society are well \n     documented as follows:\n       (A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of \n     marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to \n     spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined \n     effects of ``younger and longer'' increase total AFDC costs \n     per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.\n       (B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially \n     higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low \n     birth weight.\n       (C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to \n     experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more \n     child abuse, and neglect.\n       (D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have \n     lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a \n     greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\n       (E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the \n     chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.\n       (F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely to \n     be on welfare when they grow up.\n       (9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes \n     were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that \n     of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced \n     (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, through \n     divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing \n     the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, \n     the negative consequences of raising children in single-\n     parent homes are well documented as follows:\n       (A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with children \n     under 18 years of age have income below the national poverty \n     level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households \n     with children under 18 years of age are below the national \n     poverty level.\n       (B) Among single-parent families, nearly \\1/2\\ of the \n     mothers who never married received AFDC while only \\1/5\\ of \n     divorced mothers received AFDC.\n       (C) Children born into families receiving welfare \n     assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they \n     reach adulthood than children not born into families \n     receiving welfare.\n       (D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest risk \n     of bearing low-birth-weight babies.\n       (E) The younger the single parent mother, the less likely \n     she is to finish high school.\n       (F) Young women who have children before finishing high \n     school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a \n     longer period of time.\n       (G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to \n     teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent \n     children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid \n     program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.\n       (H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a \n     negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.\n       (I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cognitive \n     scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater \n     likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\n       (J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely \n     to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children \n     from intact 2-parent families.\n       (K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times \n     more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.\n       (L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged 12 \n     through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent \n     households have higher rates of violent crime.\n       (M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the \n     State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived \n     primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these \n     incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children \n     in the Nation's resident population were living with both \n     parents.\n       (10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the \n     crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that \n     prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-\n     of-wedlock birth and protection of teenage girls from \n     pregnancy as well as predatory sexual behavior are very \n     important Government interests and the policy contained in \n     part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (as amended by \n     section 2103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the \n     crisis.\n\n     SEC. 2102. REFERENCE TO SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.\n\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided, wherever in this \n     chapter an amendment is expressed in terms of an amendment to \n     or repeal of a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to that section or other \n     provision of the Social Security Act.\n\n     SEC. 2103.

STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE \n                   AND IMMIGRATION.\n\n       The Congress makes the following statements concerning \n     national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:\n       (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United \n     States immigration law since this country's earliest \n     immigration statutes.\n       (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public \n     resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own \n     capabilities and the resources of their families, their \n     sponsors, and private organizations, and\n       (B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an \n     incentive for immigration to the United States.\n       (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have \n     been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, \n     State, and local governments at increasing rates.\n       (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and \n     unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly \n     incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the \n     public benefits system.\n       (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new \n     rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to \n     assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n       (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the \n     incentive for illegal immigration provided by the \n     availability of public benefits.\n       (7) With respect to the State authority to make \n     determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens \n     for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to \n     follow the Federal classification in determining the \n     eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be \n     considered to have chosen the least restrictive means \n     available for achieving the compelling governmental interest \n     of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with \n     national immigration policy.\n\n             Subchapter A--Eligibility for Federal Benefits\n\n     SEC. 2401.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 1627 which was received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1627) to amend the Federal Insecticide, \n     Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Today, the Senate takes final action on the Food Quality \nProtection Act. The legislation before us today passed the House on \nJuly 23 by a vote of 417 to 0.\n  I commend our colleagues in the House for this bipartisan compromise \nto reform the Delaney clause. Chairman Bliley, Representative Dingell, \nand Representative Waxman are to be commended for their efforts. I also \nwant to thank my counterparts on the House Agriculture Committee, \nChairman Roberts and Representative de la Garza.\n  This bill represents a carefully crafted compromise. A large list of \nconsumer groups, environmental organizations, food industry \norganizations, and farm groups support the bill. The administration has \nindicated the President will sign the bill.\n  The bill reforms the scientifically outdated Delaney clause enacted \nin 1958. The Delaney clause ignores the concept of risk. As science \ncontinues to develop new means of detecting even the smallest amount of \nsubstance in food, the Delaney clause would force more and more safe \nproducts off the market.\n  The compromise bill sets a ``safe'' standard for both raw and \nprocessed food. Safe is defined as ``a reasonable certainty that no \nharm will result from aggregate exposure to pesticide chemical \nresidue.''\n  The bill also allows for the consideration of benefits when setting \ntolerances, but limits how much additional risk is acceptable as a \ntradeoff for benefits. As recommended by the National Academy of \nSciences in 1993, EPA is required to give special consideration to \ninfants and children when setting pesticide residue tolerances. For \npesticides with threshold effects, an additional tenfold margin of \nsafety shall be applied for infants and children, except EPA may use a \ndifferent margin of safety on the basis of reliable data.\n  National uniformity of tolerances is maintained with some exceptions. \nUniformity does not apply to warning labels like Prop 65.\n  The bill contains provisions to encourage development of new minor \nuse pesticides without compromising food safety or adversely affecting \nthe environment.\n  The bill also addresses antimicrobial registrations by expediting \nregistration procedures for antimicrobial pesticides.\n  The bill extends EPA authorization to collect $14 million annually in \nreregistration fees--a provision strongly endorsed by the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Finally, I want to commend Senator Pryor for his efforts to reform \nthe Delaney clause and his strong support for the legislation we \nintroduced. Senator Kassebaum, chairman of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, has been a strong supporter of Delaney reform as \nan original cosponsor of S. 1166 and is supportive of our efforts to \nmove forward. I also want to thank Senator Leahy for his support of \nthis compromise and his willingness to work to move this bill through \nthe Senate.\n  I am pleased that we have a compromise bill before us that will \nreform the outdated Delaney clause and help ensure the continued \navailability of a safe, affordable and abundant food supply in our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record three letters \nfrom Dr. Lynn Goldman, Assistant Administrator, Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to clarify some questions \n     your staff has raised concerning certain provisions of H.R. \n     1627 as unanimously approved by the House of Representatives.\n       The first issue relates to the tenfold additional margin of \n     safety when assessing risks to infants and children during \n     tolerance evaluations. We have clarified this issue through a \n     letter dated July 23, 1996 to Chairman Bliley (enclosed), and \n     would like to clarify one more point:\n       Under this provision, as an uncertainty factor, we would \n     require an additional tenfold margin of safety if the Agency \n     does not have complete and reliable data to assess pre or \n     postnatal toxicity relating to infants and children, or if \n     the data indicate pre or postnatal effects of concern. When \n     the data are incomplete, we use an additional uncertainty \n     factor between three and ten based on how much information is \n     incomplete. The data EPA would consider include data \n     submitted in compliance with EPA testing requirements, \n     available data published in the scientific literature, and \n     any other data available to EPA and meeting general \n     scientific standards. Where reproductive and developmental \n     data have been found acceptable by EPA, and the data do not \n     indicate potential pre or postnatal effects of concern, the \n     additional tenfold margin of safety would not be applied.\n       The second issue regards administrative hearings. With \n     respect to hearings under section 408 (g)(2)(B), EPA will \n     determine whether there are issues of material fact on which \n     a public hearing should be held. Issues of material fact may \n     include, for example, issues as to the magnitude of risk or \n     whether an effect is a threshold or non-threshold effect. \n     Where issues of material fact are raised, and relevant \n     factual information is at issue, the Administrator is \n     required to grant a request for a public hearing.\n       The third issue regards the classification of certain \n     chemicals as threshold or non-threshold effects. For purposes \n     of the determination of safety under Section 408 \n     (b)(2)(A)(ii), chemicals which currently are classified as \n     Category C carcinogens with no quantification of risk would \n     be treated under the standard applicable to threshold \n     effects.\n       The Office of management and budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lynn R. Goldman, M.D.,\n     Assistant Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your \n     question concerning the Agency's Special Review of the \n     pesticide atrazine. As you know, atrazine has been in Special \n     Review since November 1994, and currently we are reviewing \n     the additional information submitted by the registrant and \n     the public comments.\n       Specifically, you have asked whether possible changes in \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) might \n     obviate the need for completion of the atrazine Special \n     Review under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \n     Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).\n       H.R. 1627 as enacted by the House of Representatives \n     contains numerous provisions changing the way we assess \n     tolerances for pesticide residues on food. However, should \n     the bill become law, the Special Review of atrazine would \n     continue as we assess the data submitted by the registrant \n     and others. Our plans for completion of the next step in the \n     Special Review process, the issuance of what we call \n     ``Position Document 2/3,'' remains unchanged. Completion of \n     this document is now planned for late 1997.\n       We would not expect to examine the tolerances associated \n     with the current uses of atrazine until the later stages of \n     the Special Review process, that is at the ``Position \n     Document 4'' stage.\n       Commonly, as part of our Special Review process, the Agency \n     discusses risk reduction measures on a continuing basis with \n     the registrant and affected grower community. These are often \n     a valuable part of the pesticide regulatory decision process. \n     Obviously, if the risk issues are resolved through this \n     process, we would terminate the Special Review.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lynn R. Goldman, M.D.,\n     Assistant Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                U.S. Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas Bliley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to clarify questions \n     regarding the provision in H.R. 1627 as passed by the \n     Committee on Commerce concerning the ten-fold additional \n     margin of safety when assessing risks to infants and children \n     during tolerance evaluations. We believe that this language \n     when applied with the general safety standard, would provide \n     EPA with an important tool to implement the recommendations \n     found in the National Academy of Sciences' report, Pesticides \n     in the Diets of Infants and Children.\n       We believe that this provision is consistent with the \n     recommendations found in that report (see attached), and \n     would allow the Agency to ensure that pesticide tolerances \n     are safe for children in those situations where an additional \n     margin of safety is necessary to account for inadequate or \n     otherwise incomplete data. This language provides the Agency \n     with discretion, based on\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n     sound science, to set the margin of safety at an appropriate \n     level to protect infants and children.\n       This provision is consistent with current Agency risk \n     assessment practices. We have the been actively working to \n     implement the NAS recommendations, and are using the best \n     available science to assess risks to infants and children in \n     a manner consistent with those recommendations. In doing so, \n     EPA scientists exercise their best judgment, based on \n     reliable data, to determine whether studies accurately \n     reflect the risk to children or if an additional margin of \n     safety of up to ten is required. When the data are \n     incomplete, we use an additional uncertainty factor between \n     three and ten based on how much information is incomplete.\n       We believe that the language passed by the Committee on \n     Commerce strikes the proper balance in setting a strong \n     standard to protect children while giving EPA the discretion \n     to use the best available science. We are pleased that the \n     children's standard will allow us to assure the public that \n     all foods are safe for children.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lynn R. Goldman, M.D.,\n     Assistant Administrator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children\n\n         (National Academy of Sciences Recommendations, page 9)\n\n       Uncertainty factors.--For toxic effects other than cancer \n     or heritable mutation, uncertainty factors are widely used to \n     establish guidelines for human exposure on the basis of \n     animal testing results. This is often done by dividing the \n     no-observed-effect level (NOEL) found in animal tests by an \n     uncertainty factor of 100-fold. This factor comprises two \n     separate factors of 10-fold each; one allows for uncertainty \n     in extrapolating data from animals to humans; the other \n     accommodates variation within the human population. Although \n     the committee believes that the latter uncertainty factor \n     generally provides adequate protection for infants and \n     children, this population subgroup may be uniquely \n     susceptible to chemical exposures at particularly sensitive \n     stages of development.\n       At the present, to provide added protection during early \n     development, a third uncertainty factor of 10 is applied to \n     the NOEL to develop the RfD. This third 10-fold factor has \n     been applied by the EPA and FDA whenever toxicity studies and \n     metabolic/disposition studies have shown fetal developmental \n     effects.\n       Because there exist specific periods of vulnerability \n     during postnatal development, the committee recommends that \n     an uncertainty factor up to the 10-fold factor traditionally \n     used by EPA and FDA for fetal developmental toxicity should \n     also be considered when there is evidence of postnatal \n     developmental toxicity and when data from toxicity testing \n     relative to children are incomplete. The committee wishes to \n     emphasize that this is not a new, additional uncertainty \n     factor but, rather, an extended application of an uncertainty \n     factor now routinely used by the agencies for a narrower \n     purpose.\n       In the absence of data to the contrary, there should be a \n     presumption of greater toxicity to infants and children. To \n     validate this presumption, the sensitivity of mature and \n     immature individuals should be studied systematically to \n     expand the current limited data base on relative sensitivity.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today marks the conclusion of a monumental \neffort by numerous individuals and organizations to finally update food \nsafety laws of this country. With the help of the Clinton \nadministration, members of both the Agriculture and Labor Committees--\nparticularly Senator Lugar, the chief sponsor of the bill in the \nSenate--as well as our colleagues in the House, passage of the Food \nQuality Protection Act has finally become a reality.\n  This legislation at long last updates the famed Delaney Clause which \nwas first enacted in the 1950's, but became obsolete with the advances \nin science and technology. Although the provision served a very useful \npurpose in its day, we have recently found ourselves in a situation \nwhere the outdated law was working against the ability of the crop \nprotection industry to find safer alternatives for our farmers and \nranchers to use in the production of food and fiber.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to complement the Clinton administration \nfor helping find a bipartisan solution to a problem that has plagued \nfarmers and consumers for a number of years. The result is consumers \ncontinue to have a safe and abundant food supply and that farmers and \nagribusiness will be treated more fairly by government regulators. It \nis a clear victory for both farmers and consumers and proves once again \nthat when we work in a bipartisan fashion we're all the better.\n\n\n                     consumer right to know section\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. As we prepare to vote on H.R. 1627, I wish to seek \nclarification on the consumer right to know section if Chairman Lugar \nwould be kind enough to respond.\n  Mr. LUGAR. What clarification is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is my understanding that under the consumer right to \nknow section, the administrator of EPA in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nwill develop and distribute to large retail grocers information \nrelating to the risks and benefits of pesticide residues in or on food \nitems that are purchased by consumers.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In turn, under this section, grocers are expected to \ndisplay or make available this information in whatever manner best \nworks for that retail store.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, the legislation makes this type of information \navailable for display.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is also my understanding under this section that a \nsupermarket would not be held liable for any civil or criminal \npenalties in the event that the store were to be depleted of its supply \nof brochures or whatever information is provided by EPA, USDA, and FDA. \nNor would a grocer be held liable or have products deemed misbranded if \nthe information is not always available, or in the event the Government \nfails to provide the information to supermarkets.\n  Mr. LUGAR. It is clearly not the intent of Congress to penalize \nsupermarkets for failure to display the information. It is our intent, \nhowever, for grocery stores to serve as a conduit for the display and \ndissemination of this information to the greatest extent practical in a \nmanner that will be determined by each store. In other words, we do not \nintend to impose an unfair burden on grocery stores that would subject \nthem to fines or seizure of products simply because the information is \nnot always available.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate this clarification on the consumer right \nto know section of the legislation.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, it would be my understanding that with \nregard to the authority given the administrator to require a period of \nnot less than 60 days for public comment after issuing a regulation \nunder section 408(e)(1) of the Act that this would apply only to those \ntolerance petitions submitted after the effective date of the Act.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator from Alabama is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to this measure appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1627) was deemed read a third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8736-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8738-S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 429, H.R. 3235.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3235) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of \n     1978, to extend the authorization of appropriations for the \n     Office of Government Ethics for three years, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass H.R. 3235, the \nOffice of Government Ethics [OGE] Authorization Act of 1996. OGE was \ncreated by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to provide overall \ndirection to the executive branch in developing policies to prevent \nconflicts of interest and ensure ethical conduct by executive branch \nofficers and employees.\n  Senator Levin and I have long been proponents of strong ethics laws. \nWe serve as the chairman and the ranking minority member on the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the District of \nColumbia\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nwhich has jurisdiction over ethics matters within the executive branch. \nSenator Levin and I have made many changes to strengthen the ethics \nlaws since OGE was created. We authored the Independent Counsel \nprovisions of the Ethics in Government Act which provides for the \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of \ncriminal wrongdoing by top level executive branch officials, and we \nworked together to strengthen the revolving door and lobbying \ndisclosure laws.\n  Last year, I, along with Senator Levin, introduced S. 699, a bill to \nreauthorize OGE. The bill was reported out of the subcommittee with no \namendments and approved by the full Committee on Governmental Affairs \nlast August. It is nearly identical to legislation which passed the \nSenate last Congress.\n  The legislation makes a number of technical changes to the ethics \nlaws and, for the first time, grants OGE gift acceptance authority to \naddress the problem that arises when Federal Government facilities are \nnot adequate either in terms of size or equipment resources to \naccommodate OGE's ethics education and training programs which are held \naround the country. This authority is intended to enable OGE to accept \nthe use of certain non-Federal facilities, such as an auditorium that \nmight be offered by a State or local government or a university, which \nmay be better suited for OGE's needs.\n  Federal agencies are not permitted to accept gifts unless they have \nspecific statutory authority to do so. While OGE has not had this \nauthority in the past, 23 agencies and departments do have some type of \ngift acceptance authority. The bill requires the Director of OGE to \nestablish written rules to govern the exercise of this authority to \nsafeguard against conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts \nin the acceptance of gifts.\n  Currently, other agencies that have gift acceptance authority do not \nhave to prescribe regulations governing its use. While other agencies \nwould not be required to follow the example of OGE's regulations in \nmaking their own determinations about their gift authority, OGE's \nregulations would provide useful guidance to other agencies.\n\n  OGE has been without an authorization since September 30, 1994, when \nthe previous authorization expired. In April, Congressman Canady, \nChairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, introduced a bill very \nsimilar to the legislation Senator Levin and I introduced. In an effort \nto complete action on this measure as quickly as possible, my staff has \nbeen working with Congressman Canady's staff. I am pleased to say that \nSenator Levin and I support H.R. 3235, the reauthorization bill which \nhas come over from the House.\n  There are a few differences between the bill that is before us today \nand the bill Senator Levin and I introduced last year. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to outline these differences for my colleagues. \nFirst, the House bill reauthorizes OGE for 3 years opposed to the 7 \nyears proposed in the Senate bill. While OGE has been reauthorized for \n5 or 6 years in previous years, the House felt this was too long. The 3 \nyear authorization continues to ensure that reauthorization does not \noccur during the first year of a Presidential term when a large portion \nof OGE's resources are devoted to the nominee clearance process. I \ncontinue to support a longer reauthorization than what has been \nproposed by the House, and while I will not be here when OGE needs to \nbe reauthorized again, I hope that the Congress will once again move \ntoward a long reauthorization.\n  Second, the House bill includes a provision to correct an unintended \neffect of the 1989 Ethics Reform Act with respect to the post \nemployment or revolving door rules applicable to high level executive \nand legislative branch employees who leave Government to work on \npolitical campaigns. Under current law, senior executive and \nlegislative branch employees are subject to a 1-year cooling-off period \nduring which they cannot contact their former offices on behalf of \nanother party. There are some exceptions to the current ban, for \nexample, if a Federal employee leaves to work for a State or local \ngovernment or for an international organization like the U.N. However, \nthere is no exception for employees who leave to go work for a \npolitical campaign. So, if an administrative assistant or legislative \ndirector takes a leave of absence from a Senator's staff to work on the \nSenator's reelection campaign, the former staffer is prohibited from \ncontacting the Senator or his or her staffers with the intent to \ninfluence official action.\n  There is a consensus that the current post-employment law doesn't \nmake sense as it applies to campaign work. In drafting the post-\nemployment rules, no one had the campaign example in mind. Moreover, \nleaving Government service to work on a campaign doesn't involve the \nkind of abuse the revolving door rules are intended to address, that \nis, individuals trading on Government information and access for \nprivate gain.\n  In 1991, there was an effort to fix this problem by adding a new \nexception to the post employment law for staff who leave Government to \nwork on campaigns. The Bush administration supported this legislation, \nand it passed the House as part of the honoraria reform bill. A \ncompanion amendment was circulated in the Senate, but the provision \nnever became law because honoraria reform stalled in the Senate.\n\n  The language contained in the House bill is identical to an amendment \nSenator Levin offered to the OGE bill last Congress which was passed by \nthe Senate. It provides that executive and legislative branch employees \nwho would otherwise be subject to the 1-year cooling-off period are not \nbarred from communications with their former offices on behalf of a \ncandidate, political committee, or political party. To guard against \npotential abuse of the exception or the appearance of impropriety when \nformer employees represent multiple clients, such as when someone works \nfor a consulting firm rather than directly for a campaign, the \nexception would apply only to individuals who work, No. 1, solely for \ncandidates, campaigns, or political parties, or No. 2, for entities \nwhose only clients are candidates, campaigns, or political parties. The \nexemption would not apply to FEC employees because of their duties in \noverseeing the campaign process and would go into effect when the bill \nbecomes law. Therefore, an employee who left Government within the last \nyear, and is still subject to the 1-year cooling off period, can take \nadvantage of this exception.\n  Finally, the bill addresses another unintended problem with the post \nemployment restrictions. The 1-year cooling-off provisions apply to \nsenior employees of the executive branch. Senior officials are defined \nas those serving in positions listed on the executive schedule, \npositions in the uniformed services ranked 07 or above, particular \npositions within the White House Office, or a position which the pay is \nequal to or greater than executive level V. This has included SES \nemployees at levels five and six.\n  Congress has frozen the executive level pay levels for a number of \nyears. However, the pay levels for SES employees are set by the \nPresident through Executive order and have continued to increase. As a \nresult, the pay level for SES level four employees has increased above \nthe pay level of executive level V. What this means is that these SES \nlevel four employees will now be treated as senior executive branch \nemployees and be subject to the 1-year cooling off restrictions even \nthough they have not taken on any additional duties or \nresponsibilities. It was not Congress' intent to have SES level four \nemployees subject to these post employment restrictions. H.R. 3235 \nfixes this problem by amending the statute to read that these \nrestrictions will apply to SES levels five and above not executive \nlevel V and above.\n  In closing, OGE is a small office with large responsibilities. Over \nthe years, we have imposed more responsibilities on OGE and we have not \nalways provided the necessary staff or resources to carry out those \nresponsibilities. Specifically, I would note the additional functions \nOGE had to perform when it became an independent agency in 1989 and in \ncomplying with the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. Congress moved to make \nOGE a separate agency because it was believed that OGE was not \nindependent enough. In addition, Congress wanted to enhance the \nagency's prestige and authority within the executive branch given its \nimportant and sensitive responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\n  While OGE's budget has increased rather significantly since we last \nreauthorized the agency in 1988, OGE still has a lean budget with which \nto operate when you consider the critically important responsibilities \nof the agency. That said, in light of looming budget deficits, OGE, \nlike all agencies will be called upon to meet its responsibilities in \nthe most cost-effective manner possible.\n  Mr. President, OGE's mission is critically important in ensuring \nstrict ethical standards in Government. I hope my colleagues will move \nexpeditiously to pass this important measure reauthorizing OGE. \nFinally, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Levin for his \nefforts on this legislation and his many years of service on Government \nethics issues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased we are considering today, H.R. \n3235, the Office of Government Ethics Authorization Act of 1996. This \nis the same as S.699, the bill sponsored by Senator Cohen and myself \nand reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee. H.R. 3235 would \nauthorize the appropriation of funds necessary for the Office of \nGovernment Ethics to carry out its mission from fiscal years 1997 \nthrough 1999.\n  The Office was first established under the Ethics in Government Act \nof 1978. Since then, it has been the centerpiece for implementing laws \nand policies governing the executive branch to ensure that Federal \nagency officers and employees operate free from conflicts of interest.\n  Unfortunately, this bill would reauthorize the office for only 3 \nyears. I would have preferred 7 years, but we were told by the House \nthat they wouldn't accept a longer reauthorization. Given the fact that \nthe office has been without a reauthorization since September 30, 1994, \nand that its work is of fundamental importance to the operations of the \nexecutive branch, I think the position of the House is unfortunate. \nSuch a short reauthorization will require more of the valuable time of \nthe OGE staff directed to the legislative process and away from the \nimportant work of managing their ethics responsibilities. Because it is \nso short, it is also likely to result in an authorization gap similar \nto the one we are experiencing now.\n  The bill contains a provision which would solve an unintended problem \nwith respect to congressional and Presidential staff leaving office to \nwork on reelection campaigns. In 1989, when we strengthened the post \nemployment restrictions, we prohibited all senior executive branch and \ncongressional staff from contacting their former offices on behalf of \nsomeone else for 1 year from the time they left office. What we \noverlooked at the time was the situation where congressional staff and \ntop executive department officials may leave their Government positions \nto work on the reelection campaigns of the persons for whom they worked \nwhile in the Government. For example, the administrative assistant of \none of our colleagues may take a leave of absence and work on the \nreelection campaign for that same Member. If that happens, that \nadministrative assistant should not be barred from contacting the \nMember or his staff on behalf of the campaign, since the interests of \nthe campaign and the Member are really the same. Such a bar, which was \nnever intended, would basically make such employment impossible.\n  The bill would correct this error and permit contacts by a former \nstaff person working for a Member's campaign with the Member and the \noffice of the Member if such contacts are on behalf of the campaign. \nSuch contacts would not be permitted if they were made on behalf of \nsomeone or some entity other than the campaign. Should the former staff \nperson work, for example, part time for the campaign and part time as a \nlobbyist, this bill would not permit that former staff person to \ncontact his or her former office during the 1 year cooling off period \non behalf of a client for whom he is serving as a lobbyist. The \nexception this bill makes is only for contacts by former staff on \nbehalf of the campaign organizations of the Member or President-Vice \nPresident for whom the staff person previously worked. This limitation \navoids giving an otherwise reasonable exception an unintended \nconsequence.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Cohen, Chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Oversight Subcommittee, for his support on this \nissue; and my colleagues for their support in getting this bill to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that bill be deemed read the \nthird time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements be placed in the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3235) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/24/senate-section/article/S8738-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 25, 1996\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
