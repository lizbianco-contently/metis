The Senate will resume \nconsideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13.\n  The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the U.S. Government for the fiscal \n     years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Roth Amendment No. 1121, to express the sense of the Senate \n     that the number of Federal full-time equivalent positions \n     should be further reduced.\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, thank you. I simply say that as we open this \nvery important day, it will be a very long day on the budget \nresolution. I would simply say that as usual at this particular time we \nhave an inordinate number of amendments that have been suggested from \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  I simply say that we very likely--if we are going to finish this up \ntomorrow some time, which we must, given the time constraints that we \nare under--are going to have to have some give and take today. We will \nhave to begin the process very early today of trying to come to some \nspecific time agreements. With the large number of amendments that we \nhave to offer, we obviously are heading for one of those traditional \nsituations that we do on the budget resolution where a great number of \namendments to the bill are going to be offered and we are not going to \nhave time to debate those.\n  Under the rules, all amendments that are offered can be voted on if a \nrollcall vote is ordered, which indicates to me very clearly that \ntomorrow afternoon sometime we are going to have a great number--and I \nmean a great number, maybe 2 to 3 hours--of successive votes on many \namendments that will not have been thoroughly discussed or debated at \nall in the U.S. Senate.\n  Therefore, I would hope that we could all conserve time as best we \ncan. Last night, the Senate completed debate on an amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Delaware, on that side of the aisle. Under the usual \nprocedures, the next amendment would be offered from someone on this \nside of the aisle.\n  I see Senator Bradley is here to offer an appropriate amendment that \nhad been scheduled for some time. Depending on what the acting majority \nleader would like to do, we are prepared to offer the amendment that \nhad been scheduled to be offered by the Senator from New Jersey, unless \nthere is intervening business.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe the plan is to move forward with \nthe amendment by Senator Bradley.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am, therefore, pleased to recognize the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Would he please indicate to me about how much time he thinks would be \nnecessary?\n[[Page S7138]]\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I say to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska I \nexpect that we would need several hours on this amendment. I know there \nare many people who want to speak, and I will just have to see how many \npeople come to the floor.\n  Under the rules, we are allowed 2 hours equally divided, an hour on \neach side. We could start with that and see if there are others who \nwant more time.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from New Jersey, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1122\n\n(Purpose: To lessen tax increases on working families by using amounts \n                        set aside for a tax cut)\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], for himself, Mr. \n     Breaux, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 1122.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 74, strike lines 12 through 24 and insert the \n     following: ``budget, the appropriate budgetary allocations, \n     aggregates, and levels shall be revised to reflect \n     $16,900,000,000 in budget authority and outlays of the \n     additional deficit reduction achieved as calculated under \n     subsection (c) for legislation that restores the full current \n     law earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n       ``(b) Revised Allocations and Aggregates.--Upon the \n     reporting of legislation pursuant to subsection (a), and \n     again upon the submission of a conference report on such \n     legislation (if a conference report is submitted), the Chair \n     of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may submit to \n     the Senate appropriately revised allocations under sections \n     302(a) and 602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     budgetary aggregates, and levels under this resolution, \n     revised by an amount that does not exceed the additional \n     deficit reduction specified under subsection (d).''.\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, the amendment that I have sent to the \ndesk makes one simple point: Although we need to balance the Federal \nbudget, we should not do it on the backs of America's working and \nmiddle-class families.\n  The budget resolution before the Senate attempts to claim that it \nwill balance the budget without raising taxes. However, buried deep in \nthis budget proposal is a $20 billion tax increase--a $20 billion tax \nincrease--on America's working families.\n  The amendment that I have introduced on behalf of myself, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Murray, and others, would correct the numerous problems \nposed by the current earned income tax proposal in the budget \nresolution.\n  The amendment would repeal the worst aspect of the $20 billion tax \nincrease on working families. Specifically, the amendment would repeal \nthe $12.8 billion tax increase on working families with children and \nthe $4.1 billion tax increase on working Americans without children.\n  At the same time, however, the amendment would ensure that we \ncontinue to improve the program's administration to fight against any \npotential fraud or abuse and to ensure that the benefits of this \nprogram go to those for whom it was intended.\n  Mr. President, since its creation in 1975, the earned income tax \ncredit has been one of the most important sources of support for \nworking and lower-middle-class families. In 1996, the earned income tax \ncredit will provide a tax cut for over 21 million workers and their \nfamilies.\n  In my own State of New Jersey, the earned income tax credit provided \n372,000 taxpayers with families with an average of over $1,000 in tax \nrelief in 1993, a $1,000 tax cut for over 300,000 New Jersey families.\n  The EITC helps families move off the welfare roles and into the work \nforce. The incentive only goes to working families. No one on welfare \ngets this. These are working families. If you do not work, you do not \nqualify for the tax cut. It is as simple as that.\n  Social Security taxes and various means-tested programs create \ndisincentives for welfare recipients to work. Without the EITC's \noffsetting tax reduction, the working poor lose benefits and pay higher \ntaxes for each extra dollar that they earn.\n  The historic 1993 deficit reduction package expanded the earned \nincome tax credit. Just as a point of reference, in my State about \n40,000 people ended up paying higher income taxes because of that \ndeficit reduction package and nearly 400,000 ended up paying less taxes \nbecause of the earned income tax credit. So, as a result of that \ndeficit reduction package, nearly 10 times more people in my State got \na tax cut than got an income tax increase.\n  When fully phased in, the credit will be available for families with \ntwo or more children, earning up to approximately $28,500. Two children \nand family, up to $28,500, that is roughly half the median income for a \nfamily of four. So what we are saying here is roughly a fourth of all \nfamilies with two kids will qualify for the earned income tax credit. \nThese are working families.\n  Because the minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation, without \nthese changes in the EITC many working families have fallen deeper into \npoverty as a result of higher taxes and lost benefits. The EITC works \nin a very important way for working families. For every added dollar a \nlower income working family earns, payroll taxes take 15.3 cents and \ncertain other benefits drop. For example, food stamps drop 24 cents for \nevery additional dollar. The EITC was intended to offset some of these \ndisincentives by providing a tax reduction of 40 cents for every dollar \nearned by a working family with two children. In other words, that \nmeans the EITC can make a big difference in people's lives.\n  Most eligible families earning between $5,500 and $15,500 will \nqualify for at least $1,000 in credits. That is another $1,000 in \nsomeone's pocket that can go to pay for food, for utility bills, for \ntuition to parochial school, for health insurance, or for mortgage \npayments.\n  Not only does the EITC help families work their way out of poverty, \nthe EITC is good for business. It puts more purchasing power in low-\nincome consumers' pockets and lets them keep more of what they earn. It \nalso increases the effective wage rate paid by employers, providing the \nneediest Americans with an even greater incentive to go to work. By \nhelping these families we also ease the burden on public services \nprovided by State and local government.\n  Even President Ronald Reagan recognized the value of the earned \nincome tax credit. At the signing of the 1986 Tax Reform Act he stated \nthat the bill's expanded EITC provisions were a very important thing. \nRonald Reagan called the EITC provisions ``the best anti-poverty, the \nbest pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of \nCongress.''\n  In addition to President Reagan, the EITC has received widespread \nbipartisan support, including that of Presidents Ford, Carter, Bush, \nand Clinton. However, the current budget proposals would repeal many of \nthe gains realized under this bipartisan group of leaders during almost \ntwo decades.\n  So, what is the impact of this tax increase on working families? In \nthe face of declining real wages and Republican proposals to cut \nimportant aid programs, more and more American families are going to \nface increasingly tough times. These are working families who need \nevery penny of the wages they earn just to make ends meet. We simply \nshould not tax these families into poverty by cutting the earned income \ntax credit.\n  The goal of the 1993 expansion of the EITC was to ensure that \nindividuals who work full time do not have to raise their children in \npoverty. Achieving this goal is just as important today as it was 2 \nyears ago. By the year 2000, roughly 17.8 million taxpayers, 80 percent \nof the total recipients, would feel a tax increase as a result of the \nproposals that are embodied in this budget. On average, taxes would be \nraised for affected working families by over $600 each.\n  In New Jersey, working families will face a $452 million tax \nincrease. Over the next 7 years that amounts to about $1,500 for the \n297,000 recipients of the [[Page S7139]] earned income tax credit who \nare working families.\n  The tax increase on working families with children amounts to $329 \nmillion. On an average, that would raise taxes by $1,733 over 7 years \non 190,000 New Jersey families with children. So this is a significant \ntax increase in the middle of a budget proposal that purports to have \nno tax increase.\n  Who are the people who receive the earned income tax credit? Let me \njust give you a snapshot of a couple of people.\n  Michael Thompson from Newark, NJ, is 32 years old, married, with two \ndaughters. He earns $7.75 per hour working in a warehouse for the \nCommunity Food Bank in New Jersey. His wife worked over 5 years for a \nlarge health insurance company but was laid off in 1994 and has been \nunable to find new work. Last year the Thompsons received an earned \nincome credit that they used to pay the rent and to make up back \npayments on their utility bills.\n  How about Deborah Hammerstrung from Barnegat, NJ, a clerical \nsupervisor for the Visiting Home Care Service in Ocean County. When \nMrs. Hammerstrung and her ex-husband separated 2 years ago, she could \nnot afford to move into an apartment on her own. Instead, she was \nforced to move back with her mother. By providing her with a small \ncredit against the taxes she has paid, the EITC is helping Ms. \nHammerstrung pay the utility hookups for her own apartment.\n  And last year, Ms. Linda Bailey, of Elizabeth, NJ, received a small \nearned income tax credit. Ms. Bailey worked as a registration clerk at \nSt. Elizabeth's Hospital and is the mother of two children aged 6 and \n14. She used the $1,000 credit she received to help pay her gas and \nelectric bills.\n  These are only a few examples. I could give you countless other \nexamples in my own State of New Jersey where the earned income tax \ncredit has allowed struggling families to send a child to parochial \nschool, to begin to make a payment on college tuition, to fully pay the \nutility bills, and on and on. These are struggling working Americans. \nThe earned income tax credit has put a little money in their pockets so \nthey can get by. This is not the time to increase taxes on these \nworking Americans.\n  Like most other working Americans, the recipients I have described \nlive from paycheck to paycheck. As a credit against taxes they paid, \nthe EITC provides these families with a little breathing room.\n  They are not using the EITC to pay for fancy meals out or hire high-\npaid lobbyists. No, they are not using it for that. Instead they use \nthe EITC to help buy clothes for their kids, to pay utility bills, and \nto put meals on the table.\n  The higher taxes this budget will impose on them will make it \nincreasingly more difficult for New Jersey families to meet these basic \nneeds and work their way out of poverty. Of course, working families in \nNew Jersey are not the only ones who will suffer as a result of the \nRepublicans' proposed tax hike.\n  Almost 30 percent of all taxpayers in Mississippi will lose under \nthis budget. There taxes will go up. Twenty percent of the families in \nTexas will face a larger tax burden as a result of these proposals. And \nin Oklahoma, almost 215,000 working families will find it harder to \nmake ends meet after the proposed tax increase by the changes in the \nearned income tax credit.\n  Recently, I have heard statements that these cuts in the EITC are not \nreally a tax increase because recipients do not have an income tax \nliability. Critics of the EITC would have us believe that just because \nsomeone receives a tax refund that person could not be paying more tax.\n  Mr. President, if the Federal Government owes you a $1,000 tax refund \nand we change the Tax Code so you end up getting only a $500 refund, \nthen we have raised your taxes, notwithstanding the fact that you still \nget something back.\n  In addition, there are claims that this budget is not increasing \ntaxes because some of the EITC recipients do not owe any income tax. \nThat claim ignores all the other taxes that working families have to \npay. When working families receive their paychecks, the stub does not \njust show how much they pay in income tax withholding. It also shows \nwhat was subtracted for Social Security taxes, for Medicare taxes, for \nState taxes, and others. The EITC is intended to help offset these \ntaxes, as well as Federal income tax.\n  Let me demonstrate this point by an example. Imagine a young married \ncouple with two children. If this family earned $16,500 per year, they \nwill be just above the poverty level. Although they would not owe any \nindividual income tax, they would incur $2,525 in Social Security \ntaxes. That is what they would have to pay. Under current law, they \nwould qualify for an EITC that offsets practically all of that Social \nSecurity tax, $2,532, just enough to offset the Social Security tax \nliability. But under the proposal that is in this budget the EITC would \nfall, and their taxes would go up by over $300, a tax increase.\n  Mr. President, it is important to recognize that the proposal in this \nbudget is a straight tax increase on working families. None of the \nproposals do anything, beyond what the administration has already \nsuggested, to reduce errors in the program.\n  The amendment that I offer would implement the compliance provisions, \nsuch things as matching Social Security numbers, et cetera--there are \nmany different elements of the compliance provision--and thereby build \non our past efforts to eliminate tax fraud and ensure that the EITC \ngoes on only to those most in need.\n  Further, the Republican attack on the EITC stems from reports of \nfraud in the program. In a small January 1994 study the IRS found 13 \npercent of all EITC refunds could be in error. It is important to note \nthat many of these errors result in ordinary mistakes that taxpayers \nmake on all kinds of tax returns. We have already taken a number of \nsignificant steps to eliminate fraud and to focus the benefits of the \n1993 tax cut on those most in need. We have also made some additional \nchanges in the last year or so to narrow eligibility for the EITC.\n  In the Uruguay round legislation, for example, we prohibited the EITC \nfrom going to undocumented aliens. We deny the tax break. Also, we \nallow the IRS to use simpler procedures with certain types of \nquestionable returns. We deny it to individuals who have $2,350 in \ninvestment income. So the eligibility has been narrowed.\n  Then there are people who argue about the planned growth of the EITC. \nThey are claiming that the EITC is expanding. To bolster these claims, \nsome critics have carted out graphs and charts--and we will probably \nsee some here today--that show the growth of the EITC since the early \n1990's. Of course, these graphs present only a snapshot of the EITC and \nignore the fact that the increases in the EITC are a result of a \nconscious effort by Congress and Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nto expand the program and to provide a modicum of tax relief to \nAmerica's working families.\n  Mr. President, if I could, as this chart demonstrates, once these \nchanges are fully phased in, once you make eligibility, up to $28,500 \nfor a family of four, the EITC will grow only at the pace of inflation \nand population growth, a straight line.\n  So people on the other side who say this program is out of control \nbecause we tried to help lower middle-class families--and when you help \nlower middle-class families, you provide a bigger tax cut to more \npeople; it is going to increase--they want to raise taxes on these very \nsame people. But once the eligibility is fully phased in, it is a \nnational revenue loss. In fact, beginning in 1996, if you simply took \nthe EITC relative to the rest of the economy, it is on the way down.\n  So, Mr. President, at the same time that we have listened to the \nother side's attempts to explain why we need to raise taxes on working \nfamilies in order to balance the Federal budget, we have not heard a \nsingle word about the truly uncontrolled growth in so many other areas \nof the budget.\n  Take, for example, one of the provisions in the Tax Code called \nsection 29. Section 29 refers to a little known provision in the code \nthat gives a handful of oil and gas producers billions of dollars' \nworth of subsidies at the cost of other taxpayers. Between 1989 and \n1994, section 29 tax subsidies grew by over 1,000 percent. This \nuncontrolled growth--uncontrolled 1,000-percent growth in 6 years--\ndwarfs the planned, [[Page S7140]] controlled, and short-term growth of \nthe EITC.\n  So why does the Republican budget raise taxes on millions of American \nfamilies without touching a single penny in special interest loopholes \nlike section 29, that went up 1,000 percent in 6 years? The answer I \nthink is fairly simple. The supporters of section 29 and a lot of the \nother special interest corporate loopholes--loopholes that are used by \nthe wealthy--like these subsidies and they spend millions of dollars \neach year to hire lobbyists to insert their special provisions in the \nTax Code.\n  Mr. President, working families are too busy with their kids, trying \nto make ends meet, holding down two or three jobs, to have either the \nmoney or the time to come down to Washington and lobby for their \nprovision in the Tax Code. As a result, taxes are raised on working \nfamilies while special-interest loopholes proliferate.\n  In 1996, spending through the Tax Code will total $380 billion. It is \nthe second fastest increase of the deficit, beyond entitlements, $480 \nbillion, more than double the size of the projected deficit. Between \nnow and 2002, tax expenditures will total more than $4 trillion.\n  I support, like many Members of the Senate, some of these provisions: \nHome mortgage interest deductions, property tax deductions, charitable \ndeductions. These are valuable tools. However, for every one of these \nprovisions, there are numerous other loopholes, such as section 29, \nthat simply benefit one industry or a few taxpayers over the large mass \nof taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, reducing the budget deficit will require shared \nsacrifice. However, raising taxes on millions of working Americans \nwhile consciously ignoring the billions of dollars that we give away \neach year through special interest tax loopholes is not my definition \nof shared sacrifice.\n  So this amendment is really just about setting priorities, \ndetermining how we should share the burden of balancing the budget. \nThere is no serious disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on \nthe need to balance the budget. In fact, this amendment would reduce \nthe deficit by the exact same amount as the original budget proposal. \nThe real question that this amendment raises is how we should balance \nthe budget. 3\n Either we can balance the budget by raising taxes on working families, \nas contemplated in the Republican budget proposal, or we can forgo a \nsmall proportion of proposed tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, \nas this proposal would do. I believe the choice is clear: Tax cuts for \nlower-middle-class working Americans and no tax giveaways to corporate \nand wealthy Americans. That is what this amendment is all about.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator yield back \nthe floor?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as we go forward with this debate, each day starts in \nabout the same way: We should balance the budget but we should not do \nit on the backs of--fill in the blank. Every day it is a different one. \nDo not balance it on the backs--fill in the blank.\n  For example, let me talk just a minute about the earned income tax \ncredit. Under the Republican proposal, the budget proposal that we are \ntalking about, the EITC is not cut. It is a slowing in the rate of \ngrowth. The EITC proposal contained in the budget plan simply reins in \nthe explosion in Federal Government spending in this program. Under the \nSenate budget plan, the cost of EITC will increase from $28 billion in \n1996 to $32 billion in the year 2002. Under the current law, EITC costs \nwould go to $36 billion in 2002, not exactly the flat leveling off the \nSenator had mentioned a moment ago.\n  In general, the EITC is one of the fastest growing programs in the \nFederal Government. The 1994 cost was $21.8 billion, eclipsing the \nFederal cost of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC, and the \nprogram is fully indexed to inflation.\n  Unfortunately, errors and fraud are rampant. In 1988, the IRS found \nthat 42 percent of the EITC recipients received too large a credit and \n32 percent were not able to show they were entitled to any credit at \nall. Something does need to be done about it. Given the generosity of \nthe program, it is not surprising the number of recipients has grown \nfrom 6 million in 1975 to 18 million today, and that growth continues.\n  Another way to increase the number of people eligible for the EITC is \nto raise the qualifying amount. For families with one child, the \nqualifying amount will rise from in 1995 $24,396 to $30,000; families \nwith two children will rise from $26,000 to $33,000 to qualify in this \nparticular program.\n  So, Mr. President, certainly it is hard to call this a cut when it \ngoes up at this rate.\n  The baseline, if we leave it, will increase 48 percent between now \nand the year 2000, from $20 billion to $30.8 billion. Instead, under \nthe chairman's mark, it grows at 31 percent from $20.8 billion to $27.2 \nbillion.\n  Also, it is interesting to point out that the chairman's mark accepts \nthe proposal of President Clinton's to deny EITC to undocumented \nworkers and targets EITC to working poor with children.\n  Mr. President, we will go forward again today with our budget \nproposal, and we will cite, as we have in the past, the difference of \nphilosophy in terms of approaching this business of cutting spending. \nAnd that is legitimate, to have a different view. It is appropriate to \nhave a different view. The Republicans want to transform Government to \nmake it more efficient, more responsible, less expensive. On the other \nhand, the other side of the aisle supports the status quo: No plan to \nbalance the budget, no options to save Medicare, no welfare reform \nproposal.\n  So, Mr. President, we will see a difference of opinion, and that is \ngood. That gives us a choice, whether we want more Government and more \nspending or whether we want less Government and less spending.\n  We should take a look, I suppose, at the track record as to how we \ngot here, raising taxes and expanding Federal Government. In 1993, of \ncourse, we had the largest tax increase in history, $259 billion. \nPresident Clinton talks about only raising taxes on the rich.\n  Let me tell you that gas taxes increased in my State of Wyoming, \nwhere we have more miles to drive than any other State other than \nAlaska, it was not a tax increase on the rich, it was a tax increase on \nthose least able to pay for it. The increase in Social Security taxes \nwas another change that hurt more than just the rich.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes he yielded himself \nhave expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if my time has expired, I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is yielded 7 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. And I thank my colleagues, the \nSenator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], and the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux], and many other Senators who are submitting this amendment \nto help correct one of the troubling aspects of the budget resolution \nbefore us, the tax increases on working American families.\n  By cutting the earned income tax credit, by taking away a tax break \nfor working families, this resolution will raise taxes an average of \n$270 for low-income families next year. That is wrong.\n  Mr. President, frankly, I am amazed by this Republican proposal. The \nEITC has always received bipartisan support because it is a commonsense \ntax credit. It rewards work. It provides a real incentive, and it gives \npeople the means to move from the welfare rolls to the work force.\n  In 1986, Ronald Reagan praised the earned income tax credit. As you \nknow, I was not here in 1986. I was at home serving on my local school \nboard in the State of Washington, but I remember watching the debate \nsurrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We might forget sometimes under \nall these television lights that the actions we take and the words we \nsay matter a great [[Page S7141]] deal to average Americans across this \ncountry. I cannot forget that because I remember when Congress approved \nthe tax reform package that included an expansion of the EITC, and I \nremember President Reagan signing that bill into law, saying the EITC \nis the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job-creation \nmeasure to come out of Congress. These were important words then, and \nthey are important words today.\n  Mr. President, many hard-working American families are just trying to \nmake ends meet, send their kids to school and provide some hope for the \nfuture.\n  Average Americans are worried about their jobs. They are anxious \nabout the cost of education. And, there is genuine concern out there \nabout the costs of health care. So, how does this budget respond to \nthese legitimate and real concerns? It creates more fear and more \ninsecurity. It takes away hope. And taking away this tax credit adds \ninsult to injury.\n  Mr. President, the EITC keeps people off welfare. It offsets other \nforms of Federal assistance. It gives American parents the security \nthey need to enter the work force. It is astounding that the other side \nhas chosen this time to cut the EITC. Cuts to Medicaid; cuts to \neducation; taxes on working Americans who can least afford them.\n  In my home State of Washington, more than 224,000 families earned the \ntax credit in 1993. This budget resolution will raise taxes on those \nfamilies in my State by $1,468 over the next 7 years.\n  Maybe this increase is not a big deal to some of our colleagues here \nin the Senate, Mr. President. But, believe me, these are real increases \nto average Americans. I know what it is like to drive to work every \nday, worrying about doctors' bills and school clothes. I know how it \nfeels to be squeezed between caring for elderly parents and young kids. \nMaybe that is why I understand how nasty this cut is.\n  Mr. President, recently, there has been a lot of talk about tax cuts \non Capitol Hill. The House of Representatives has already passed a tax \nplan that cuts taxes on capital gains and expands IRA deductions, and I \nexpect we will hear a debate on a tax cut this week in the Senate.\n  A tax cut is a great idea as long as we pay for it in a sensible way, \nbut a tax cut is a terrible idea if we pay for it by raising taxes on \nlow-income Americans, or by raising the Medicare payments of our \nNation's elderly.\n  Mr. President, we cannot balance the budget on our working poor, our \nelderly or our children. And, we cannot justify cutting taxes for the \nwealthy while increasing taxes on our poor.\n  Mr. President, I have said it many times in the past 2 weeks and I \nwill say it again now, this budget has no conscience. This budget hurts \nthe little guy--those who need help, those who are struggling to make a \nliving and provide for their children, and, it rewards the rich. This \nbudget gives Goliath an advantage.\n  Let us put things back in perspective. Let us help those who really \nneed our help. Let us not go back to the days of the Industrial \nRevolution; Back to survival of the fittest. Mr. President, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. It tells working families that we \nare fighting in their corner. It says we are against increasing their \ntaxes and we for ensuring their financial security. I urge all our \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, does the other side wish to make their \ncase? We are anxious to hear their defense of this tax increase. Would \nthe other side at any point like to argue the tax increase?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just in response to the Senator, I will make a few \ncomments in just a couple of moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by my \ncolleague from New Jersey. I think it is an extremely important \namendment.\n  You know, if we were to assign music to some of our proposals here on \nthe Senate floor, I think a good theme song for this particular \namendment would be ``Bridge Over Troubled Waters,'' because what this \namendment does is to say that those who are in trouble economically, \nthose lowest on our economic scale get a helping hand. It is a bridge \nover troubled waters for those people on welfare into productive jobs \nin a productive society.\n  And for people who are paying taxes, too. That is who it is for. It \nis not just for people who are on welfare. They do not get this. It is \nfor the people who are trying to get up the ladder. They are the \npoorest of the poor who may once in awhile even get more than they are \npaying in taxes because it encourages them to work, to job train, to \ntry to get up that economic ladder instead of just sitting on welfare \nwith little incentive to get off.\n  In early April, the Governmental Affairs Committee held 2 days of \nhearings on EITC. During those hearings, I heard all of the arguments \nfor and against the EITC. I left those hearings more convinced than \never that this tax credit is one of the most important parts of our Tax \nCode.\n  It has suffered from abuse and mistakes and we have to crack down on \nfraud and be tough on the error rates. I am happy to report that IRS \nhas taken on this issue, and they are making progress with this. They \nhave made improvements, and are continuing to crack down on those who \nabuse the system. Unfortunately, the cuts we are talking about in the \nbudget resolution have nothing to do with improving this important tax \ncredit.\n  Instead, the cuts seem to be all about trashing the credit. Instead \nof addressing fraud, we are going to decimate the EITC and effectively \nraise taxes on the working poor.\n  I cannot imagine that any Government that says, yes, we are family \noriented; yes, we want to help the least advantaged in our society, is \nabout to raise taxes on the working poor.\n  Let us not throw out the baby with the bath water. It is like cutting \nyour arm to get rid of a wart on your finger. The earned income tax \ncredit is too important for that.\n  The EITC has enjoyed bipartisan support since Russell Long helped \ncreate it in 1975. Republicans and Democrats alike have viewed the EITC \nas a nonbureaucratic way to make work/pay better than welfare.\n  President Reagan called the EITC ``The best anti-poverty, the best \npro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of the \nCongress.''\n  That is not someone on this Democratic side of the aisle or this \nadministration, that is President Ronald Reagan.\n  Senator Packwood said in 1991 that the EITC is ``a key means of \nhelping low-income workers with dependent children get off and stay off \nwelfare.''\n  Senator Domenici said in 1990, ``The EITC is a great way to help low-\nincome families with the cost of raising their children. It sends \nassistance to those in need, to those who work hard and yet struggle to \nmake a living and provide for their children.''\n  And I agree with Senator Domenici in that statement.\n  Others who have expressed especially strong support have included \nSenators Dole, Hatch, and Grassley; Representatives Armey and Petri; \nand former Representative Kemp.\n  The less fortunate of our society too often find themselves fighting \njust to feed their families, pay their bills, and stay off public \nassistance. They are not crooks. They are not tax cheats. They are \nworking hard to earn their tax credit. It is not some sort of a \nhandout. They do not get it if there is no earned income. And it is one \nof the best tools we have to bridge the gap--bridge the gap, a bridge \nover troubled waters--between welfare and work. We all talk about \nmaking work. We\n all talk about making work affordable. Well, the EITC is doing just \nthat. In my home State of Ohio, more than half a million working \nfamilies are getting a little extra back from their paycheck to help \nmake ends meet. I would like to share some of their stories. I think \nthey will shed some light on just what the EITC is all \nabout. [[Page S7142]] \n\n  Brenda Manders is a divorced mother of a 3 year old who lives in \nColumbus, OH. She has earned the credit for 3 years. Brenda, who works \nfor Legal Services and has been training to become a legal secretary, \nthis year received a total refund of $2,740. This was very fortunate, \nbecause after a separation from her husband, Brenda and her child were \nleft with no place to live. Faced with homelessness, she was able to \nuse her tax credit to pay for a security deposit and rent on an \napartment for her and her child. Without it, Brenda and her child may \nwell have wound up on the street.\n  And Zorida Hart of Cleveland, OH, is a single parent who works as a \nswitchboard operator at the Council for Economic Opportunities. She \nreceived a credit of $1,978 which she is using to pay for day care. And \nshe's put $900 of that credit in the bank to save it for a rainy day. I \nwish the U.S. Congress were as pennywise as Zorida. Over the past few \ndays, I have heard from a lot of Ohio parents who rely on the EITC to \nhelp them with child care so that they can have a job. This is a tax \ncredit that is working for Americans. More importantly, it is keeping \nAmericans working.\n  We have heard several complaints about the EITC. I would like to \naddress these one at a time, because I suspect we might hear them again \nand again. I hope we can put them to rest. First, the problems of fraud \nand error. This is a critical issue.\n  I think if we learned any lesson from the hearings that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee held in April, it is that we had better \nkeep pushing to prepare the IRS for the 21st century through projects \nlike compliance initiative.\n  Senator Simon and I will be offering an amendment on this shortly to \nensure that this important antifraud program continues. As one of the \nwitnesses at the April hearings said, the IRS is seeking to crack down \non fraud but is hampered by antiquated systems. We need to change that \nto uphold public confidence not only in the EITC, but in our Tax Code \ngenerally.\n  We have heard dramatic statistics about the EITC error rates. We are \ntold that according to a 1994 IRS study they are as high as 35 to 45 \npercent. Well, those figures are very deceiving. They deal with those \nfilers whose tax returns were off by just a few dollars and filers who \nincorrectly claimed too small an amount. Mr. President, I think that \nbears repeating. These large percentages include those who actually \nclaimed too little.\n  The more important statistic involves not such small discrepancies, \nbut rather whether the EITC was claimed in error. The IRS study found \nthat about 25 percent of the EITC benefits claimed were claimed in \nerror. While there was fraud, most erroneous claims were found to be \nunintentional. But this 25-percent figure still overstates the problem. \nIt deals with what was claimed, not what was actually paid out, and \nthat is the bottom-line question. The IRS detected many of those \nerroneous claims, corrected them, and avoided making any overpayments. \nUnfortunately, the 1994 IRS study did not determine the actual EITC \noverpayment rate.\n  The error rate figure is deceivingly high for another reason. The \n1,000 returns examined in the study were not representative of the EITC \nreturns filed in 1994. They were only the returns filed electronically \nduring the first 2 weeks of the filing season. Error rate is likely to \nbe higher among early electronic returns than among EITC returns \noverall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what is most important is that the IRS, in \nresponse to the 1994 study, has initiated tough measures to scrutinize \nEITC returns. Before sending a payment, the IRS now verifies not only \nthe Social Security numbers of all adult claimants, but also the \nnumbers of all children in the EITC families to make sure that the \nclaims are valid and that no child is claimed twice. Also, the GATT \nlegislation enacted last fall included a provision requiring for the \nfirst time that Social security numbers be provided for all infants. \nSeveral million returns have been delayed this year because of \ndiscrepancies with Social Security numbers.\n  In addition, the IRS now pulls all EITC returns falling into error-\nprone categories, sends the families a questionnaire and requires the \nfamilies to provide additional documentation.\n  So Mr. President, all the figures that we have heard, and are about \nto hear, are outdated. And given the new IRS compliance measures, they \nare not entirely relevant to the current debate. The IRS has recognized \nthe problem, and its seeking to correct it.\n  Do not get me wrong. I am not saying that fraud and error rates are \nOK. I am the last one who would imply such a thing. But I believe that, \ninstead of seeking to reduce working people's tax credit, we should \ninstead work with the IRS to reduce error rates. The IRS is making a \nlot of headway here. And we should all work to make sure it continues. \nThat is progress. Increasing the tax burden on our lowest income \nworking families is not something that we want to sponsor.\n  Next, we have heard that the EITC is simply out of control. Well, I \nam here to tell you--it is not. The increases that we have seen in this \ntax credit have been mandated very specifically by Congress. We have \nscheduled increases by law and phased them in several years at a time.\n  The first major increase in this tax credit took place under \nPresident Reagan in 1986. The second was initiated under President Bush \nin 1990.\n  And in 1993 under President Clinton, the Congress approved this \nbudget reconciliation act which very specifically sets forth the years \nthat program increases will take place. These expansions took place to \nmake work pay. They were done in recognition of the fact that other \npolicies to assist the working poor--like the minimum wage--have become \nmuch weaker. And they were done so that a parent who works full time \nthroughout the year would not have to raise his or her family in \npoverty. In fact, the 1993 increase was designed to do just that--it \nwas designed so that a family of four in which the parent works at the \nminimum wage would be lifted to the poverty line.\n  But even with these planned expansions, the disposable income of a \nworking mother with two children will be up to $3,000 lower, after \nadjusting for inflation, than in 1972 before the EITC was even created.\n  Mr. President, after the three expansions specifically enacted under \nPresidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, the tax credit will return to its \nnormally low rate of growth. In fact, after 1997 it will grow at a rate \nless than the GDP. I am sure there are not many provisions you could \nsay that about in the tax package that the House put together.\n  We have also heard allegations that 80 percent of the EITC goes to \nthose with no income tax liability at all. Well, the truth of the \nmatter is that the EITC was intended to offset not only income taxes, \nbut also payroll taxes and excise taxes. More than 80 percent of the \nEITC goes directly to offset all of these taxes which are being paid by \nworkers who are fighting to get out, and stay out, of poverty.\n  Some also say this program discourages work. The argument is that--\nbecause the credit phases out as family income increases spouses will \nbe discouraged from getting jobs. It's an interesting theoretical \nargument. But what I find more persuasive is the way the tax credit has \nenabled people to work by helping them pay for things like child care, \ntransportation or work clothes. I have heard from a lot of people who \nhave used the credit for these things. But I have not heard from anyone \nwho turned down job opportunities because it would affect their tax \ncredit. Let me give another example from Ohio. Carol and Roy Wilmonts \nof Columbus, OH received the EITC for the past 2 years. They used it to \nhelp pay bills. And Carol has had the flexibility to care for their \nkids--Amber, Ashley, Autumn, and Nicholas. You see, that's part of the \nequation people ignore. Some use the EITC to pay for child care. Others \nuse it to provide the financial flexibility for one spouse to stay at \nhome and care for the kids. It is not a work disincentive for Carol. \nRoy received a promotion and is now manager at a Muffler King. He and \nCarol no longer receive a tax credit. But they are glad that they got \none when they really needed it most. [[Page S7143]] \n  We have also heard that you get the credit even if you work just a \ntiny little bit. Well--what do you know--then you get just a tiny \nlittle credit.\n  And we heard that those with little earned income but a lot of \ninterest income can take advantage of the system. Well, at the request \nof the Clinton administration we are putting an end to that through \nlanguage in the self employed health care deduction bill that has now \nbecome law.\n  Then we heard about the so-called marriage penalty. But no one \nbothered to mention that the EITC can also encourage marriages. Without \nthe EITC, there is a great deal of financial risk for a mother on AFDC \nwho does not work and is considering marrying someone with low \nearnings. If she marries, she and her children will become ineligible \nfor AFDC and also lose some of their food stamps, not to mention the \nloss of Medicaid.\n  The EITC helps to offset those losses. By tying the knot, the couple \nwill gain an EITC benefit of up to $2,157 if they have one child and up \nto $3,564 if they have two or more children. This will partially, and \nin some States fully, make up for the loss of AFDC benefits. \nEncouraging single mothers who are on welfare to marry into working \nfamilies is certainly worthwhile in my book.\n  Some people may view the amount of credit that we are talking about \nas of little consequence. But let me offer an illustration provided by \nDan Grunberg in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nFor someone who has a weekly take home pay of less than $200, the \naverage EITC payment of $1,500 is almost 8 weeks pay. That makes a big \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to escape the harsh irony that we are \ndiscussing tax increases on those fighting to escape poverty, while at \nthe same time the House is proposing a massive package of tax cuts that \nwill benefit the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations. Since I \ncam to the Senate, I have worked for fairness and progressivity in the \nTax Code. The majority's EITC proposal, especially in the face of the \nHouse tax cut package, is neither fair nor progressive. It is Robin \nHood in reverse.\n  So, Mr. President, count me as a supporter of the EITC. We can sit \naround here all day with fancy charts, graphics, and statistics. But \nnothing will substitute for the personal experiences of real people \nlike Roy and Carol Wilmonts. They are working hard to get by. They \nneeded that little extra help that EITC offers. And they worked hard \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support the Bradley \namendment and oppose tax increases on the working poor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. I appreciate the time.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, we will withhold further comment on this \nside until the other side has a chance to state their case as to why \nthey want a tax increase on working Americans. That is the basic \nquestion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Who controls the time on the other side? Does Senator \nBradley? How much time have they used so far?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has used 40 \nminutes, and has 20 minutes left. The Senator from New Mexico has 55 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, \ndesires to speak for how much time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I designate Senator Nickles to be the manager of the \ntime remaining on this amendment in my behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nI was struck by the arguments presented by the Senator from New Jersey \nin favor of this amendment about this Republican budget being a tax \nincrease.\n  Let me just first state, again, this goes without saying, all of the \namendments that are being offered by the other side of the aisle are, \nin a sense, bogus because they take us off the path to a balanced \nbudget. As a result, this money that they draw from, this $170 billion \nthat is being used to pay for this amendment, does not exist because \nonce you put the tax credit back in, you then throw us off the line to \nget us to a balanced budget which then, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, gets us the $170 billion.\n  So by putting this amendment on, the budget is no longer balanced, \nthere is no $170 billion and, guess what? We do not have a balanced \nbudget, we have no $170 billion, and we are back to the same place as \nbefore, which is adding to the deficit, not getting to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Anyone who believes that there is money here for this program--there \njust is not money here for this program. This blows the whole deal. \nThis is another attempt by the other side to say we do not want a \nbalanced budget because if we pass this we do not have a balanced \nbudget. So let us put all this tax cut or no tax cut--that is a red \nherring. This proposal destroys the balanced budget, period. It \ndestroys it, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I found it absolutely amazing that the Senator from New Jersey \nwould talk about all these tax cuts or tax benefits or tax \nexpenditures, $480 billion in tax expenditures and then, admission \nagainst interest, he admitted most of those tax expenditures he \nsupports. Of course, the lion's share of them, the biggest is health \ninsurance; second is home mortgage deduction; and third is property \ntaxes and income tax deduction.\n  I am sure he does not oppose any of those. That is, by far, the \nlion's share. What does he point out as the big one? Section 29. \nSection 29. This little provision in the Tax Code for tight sands \ndrilling of oil and natural gas.\n  Now, let us look at section 29, this big glaring one that makes \neverything else illegitimate. Section 29 applies only to wells drilled \nprior to 1993. This thing has been phased out. It is not even around \nanymore. It is only for old wealth. This was taken care of a few years \nago. So he is arguing we should get rid of a provision we have already \ngotten rid of.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Does the Senator deny that the provision in the \nRepublican proposal will increase the tax on working families?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator will admit that by reducing the rate of \ngrowth in this program, people will not get the tax breaks that were \nintended under the Clinton 1993 budget, yes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Yes. So it is a tax increase on working families.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is not a tax increase. What it says is that people \nwho are--I find it absolutely amazing to suggest that people who get a \nrefund, and 90 percent of the people in this program do not pay any \nincome tax. Let me repeat that, almost 90 percent of the people who get \nthe earned income tax credit pay no Federal income taxes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have not yielded.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me finish my point. I do not know how you can say \nthat it is a tax increase if 90 percent of the people receiving this \nmoney do not pay taxes. To me, when you are giving money back, in fact \nyou are giving a negative income tax to a group of people and you are \nsaying you are not going to let that increase so they can get more \nnegative income tax. I do not know how you consider that a tax \nincrease, an increase in taxes. What we are saying is we are not going \nto give you more money that you have not paid already.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Does the Senator agree that these working families pay \nSocial Security taxes?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is a tax credit for Federal taxes. That is what \nthis program is.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I am sorry. We will hear later from the Senator from \nLouisiana, who can address the purpose of the originator, Senator Long \nof Louisiana. The point the Senator misses, and I think the other side \nadmits this consistently----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nexpired.\n[[Page S7144]]\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Can I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will just suggest 90 percent of the people in this \nprogram do not pay any Federal income taxes, and that when you have a \nprogram, as the Senator from Oklahoma I know is going to point out, \nthat is fraudulent to the point of--the Senator from New Jersey said 13 \npercent. There are reports it is as high as 45 percent.\n  I know myself, I am waiting for my tax return to come back, and the \nreason the Internal Revenue gave me, in writing, why I am 2 months \ndelayed in getting my tax return back is because they are having so \nmany problems in trying to track down the fraud in the earned income \ntax credit provision of the Tax Code.\n This program has a lot of problems.\n\n  I want to get back to the original point the Senator made, how we \nhave all these terrible provisions in the Tax Code that benefit \ncorporate America. He points out, one, section 29, which has been \neliminated, he supports programs like section 936.\n  It is funny, the Senator from New Jersey did not comment on the \npreferential tax provision for drug companies in New Jersey, and in \nfact supported that provision as recently as the last budget go-around \nwhen the Clinton administration cut that program back and there was an \namendment on the floor of the Senate to eliminate that program, and the \nSenator from New Jersey refused to eliminate it.\n  Now, we can play this double standard. Because they do not have oil \nin New Jersey, they are against section 29; but if there are drug \ncompanies in New Jersey, they are not against section 936.\n  That is the demagoguery that goes on around here. We will point to \ncorporate tax cuts, unless of course, the corporation is in your State.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I have been very generous in yielding.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The Senator is wrong. In 1993 we cut that provision by \n40 percent. If the Senator is arguing that we should cut every other \ncorporate provision by 40 percent, his argument would be consistent. I \ndo not think he is arguing that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional 2 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, 30 seconds, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If we look at the amendment on the floor to eliminate \nsection 936, the Senator from New Jersey voted against it. He voted to \nkeep section 936 for drug companies, many of whom are based in New \nJersey.\n  So we can look through the entire Tax Code. There are lots of \nprovisions in there that benefit specific industries, some of them for \nvery good reasons, others not so good. To suggest that the entire Tax \nCode is one big loophole for corporate America belies the numbers. No. \n1, where most of the tax expenditures are, in fact, for the earned \nincome tax credit, health insurance, property taxes, local income \ntaxes, and the home interest deduction.\n  I would just suggest, as the Senator from Oklahoma will talk about, \nthis program has problems with fraud, is a very harsh program as far as \nwork disincentive, and there is a lot of information out there how the \nfolks in this program are, in fact, not full-time workers who are just \nabove the poverty level, but in fact only part-time workers who get a \nsubsidy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I find it ironic that the Senator from \nPennsylvania is aggressively defending all the special interest \nprovisions in the Tax Code, while at the same time he is for a flat \ntax.\n  How can the Senator be for a flat tax and want to eliminate all the \nspecial interest tax provisions.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for yielding.\n  There is a great country and western song. I think country and \nwestern writers are some of the best philosophers that we will ever see \nin society. In one of the songs this guy is singing, he says, ``After \nthe breakup, she got the gold mine and I got the shaft.''\n  If you are a working family in America that makes $28,500 a year--\nwhich I would point out is most of the people in my State of Louisiana \nby a huge amount--you are getting ready to get the shaft; somebody else \nis going to get the gold mine.\n  Budgets are about priorities. There is no clearer priority than what \nwe are talking about right now. What the budget that is pending says, \n``If you are a working family that works every day, works hard, pays \nyour taxes, follows the law, and does what society tells you to do, you \nare getting ready to get the shaft.''\n  We can argue about whether this is a tax cut or a tax increase, but \nthe facts are very clear: What the budget proposal says, for a family \nthat makes $28,500 or less with two children in this country, that \nfamily is getting ready to have to pay a lot more to Uncle Sam. That \nfamily is getting ready to have to dig into their wallet at the end of \nthe year and send money to Washington that they did not have to do last \nyear because of this budget.\n  Now, somebody can say that is not a tax increase. But I must say, if \na person has to pay more than they paid last year, that ``ain't'' fun. \nIf a person has to pay more than they paid last year, call it anything, \nbut that person is going to be hurt.\n  Now, we have heard people talk about what people said, and Senator \nDomenici is on the floor, who talked about this program in the past. My \npredecessor in the U.S. Senate, Senator Russell Long, a person I have \ntremendous amount of respect for, says we have to start making work \nmore attractive than welfare.\n  How many times have we heard speeches on the floor, ``The problem is \npeople don't work enough. We have too many people on welfare.''\n  Ronald Reagan said this program, when it was passed, was ``The best \nantipoverty, the best profamily, the best job-creation measure to ever \ncome out of the Congress.''\n  Today, this budget says we are going to slash it, and we are going to \ngive the shaft to the people of this country who are hard-working \nAmericans who are trying to make ends meet, trying to send their kids \nto school, trying to make sure they do not go on welfare. We will make \nit a lot harder. That is one thing.\n  Again, budgets being about priorities, what are they doing with the \nmoney? It is one thing to cut people who work every day really hard and \nare barely making it, can barely afford to pay the rent, and say ``We \nwill take this money away from you, that we are trying to help you \nwith,'' and we are going to try and give a tax cut to families that \nmake up to $200,000 a year--a tax cut of about $5,000 over the next 5 \nyears--and wealthy taxpayers earning up to $350,000 get a tax cut of \n$20,000 when all of their tax cuts are fully phased in.\n  Now, people say we do not want to get into class warfare. I am not \ntalking about class warfare. I am talking about something called \nfairness. Is it fair to say to someone making $28,000, ``We will make \nyou pay more,'' in order to say to people who make $200,000, ``You will \npay less.''\n  What are our priorities? Budgets are about priorities. It is one \nthing to say this program is not working exactly like it was supposed \nto. I would suggest it is. I would suggest the Senator from \nPennsylvania who says that it only applies to offset income tax knows \nnot of what he is speaking, because it is clearly not correct to say \nthat. It is clearly not correct.\n  This program was expanded by a bipartisan effort, I would point out, \nto include not only income taxes. We know people making that amount of \nmoney do not pay a lot of income taxes. But we have increased a payroll \ntax five times. These people get hit with a payroll tax, get hit with a \ngasoline tax Congress passed, get hit with excise tax, and alcohol and \ntobacco and other products. All of these taxes can be used to offset \nthe earned income tax credit, not just the income tax.\n  We know the figures, that a lot of the people do not pay income \ntaxes, but everyone pays payroll taxes, excise taxes, gasoline taxes, \nand all the other things that get hit and keep them in the bowels of \npoverty.\n  Again, who is getting the shaft and who is getting the gold mine? I \nthink it [[Page S7145]] is pretty clear that this suggestion says we \nwill repeal any of the increases.\n  What else do they do with regard to this proposition? I think it is \nvery important to know.\n  Here is what the proposal does: No. 1. It repeals the 1996 increase \nin deductions that people who are working and making 28,000 a year get. \nIt repeals it outright. It also repeals the workers who do not have \nchildren, the credit that they would get.\n  Is it not fair to have people who do not have children to not be able \nto benefit in the program? In 1993 Congress added this section. In a \nbipartisan effort, under that credit, taxpayers without children would \nbe eligible for some credit.\n This budget says they are out of here, forget them, we are not going \nto help them. I do not understand that. Well, you can say that is not a \ntax increase but, by golly, they are going to pay more money to the \nFederal Government. And I do not think it helps them or makes them feel \nbetter to say those people in Washington told me this was not a tax \nincrease, but I am paying more money than the last time. How can that \nnot be a tax increase? It definitely comes out of their back pocket at \na time when Congress is saying: Get off the dole, go to work, support \nyour family, follow the law and, by the way, we are going to make you \npay more so we can give a tax cut to people making $200,000 a year. \nPriorities. It is a question of priorities.\n\n  Now, I know some people are going to say, well, this program has \nincreased so much and we have this huge increase, and it is just going \nout of control. Let me suggest that the growth rate is not explosive \nand it is not out of control. It is doing exactly what Congress \nintended it to do. It is growing because it was designed to grow \nbecause of expansions in the bill that were signed into law. The charts \nare going to show something that goes up like that. That is because \nCongress said, in a bipartisan manner, that in addition to income tax, \nwe are going to cover things like payroll tax, which is the most \nregressive tax of all; we are going to cover the gas tax, which we have \nincreased; the payroll tax, which is increased; the excise tax on \nproducts, which has increased several times. Of course, it has \nincreased and it is starting to level off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friends on the other side of the aisle because we need to \nrestrain the growth of the earned-income tax credit. I want to make \nseveral comments, and I am going to insert several charts and figures \ninto the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my statement, these \ncharts be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleagues are certainly entitled to \ntheir own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The \nfact is that this program is growing rampantly out of control. It has \nbeen, without a doubt, the fastest growing entitlement program in \nGovernment. It is also probably the most fraudulent program we have in \nGovernment. I want to refute the statement I have heard almost all of \nmy colleagues on the other side say--that this is a tax increase on the \nworking poor. They are totally wrong.\n  The changes we are talking about making in the EITC program are not a \ntax increase on anyone. What we are doing is reducing the rate of \ngrowth of a program that is growing in cost by leaps and bounds. We are \nnot talking about tax credits. We are talking about reducing the amount \nof checks that we are writing--outlays. This is a cash benefit program. \nEighty percent of the money in this program is written in a check at \nthe end of the year.\n  It is not a reduction in somebody's taxes. It is a payment; it is a \nnegative income tax. In almost 99-plus percent of the cases, it is a \ncheck paid as a refund to people in a lump sum payment. These lump sum \npayments have been rising dramatically. My colleagues need to be aware \nof the exploding costs in this program. The numbers on this chart are \nwhat the Federal Government is actually spending. I will have this \ninserted into the Record so my colleagues can see it. The growth in \nthis program is astronomical. I heard a couple colleagues saying Ronald \nReagan and others were supporters of this program. Let us put their \nsupport in context.\n  In 1980, this program's outlays were $1.4 billion. In 1986, they were \n$1.5 billion. So in 5 or 6 years, the outlays almost had no increase. \nSo it was very, very small, program. In 1986, we had some increases, \nand by 1990, this program's outlays were $5.3 billion.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to make a significant statement, and I will yield \nat a later time.\n  That is a pretty significant growth, from $1 billion to $5 billion. \nLook at this chart to see what happened since 1990, because now we are \ntalking about a program that is going to be 30 billion dollars plus. \nAgain, I am just talking about outlays, what the Federal Government is \nwriting a check for. I am not talking about a tax credit that somebody \nhas to reduce their taxes. I am talking about what the Government is \nwriting the check for--outlays where the Government is writing a check.\n  These figures are exploding. In 1990, outlays were $5 billion. In \n1992, they doubled and went to $10 billion. By 1995, the outlays went \nto $20 billion, and they continue to escalate. In 1997, outlays for the \nEITC will be $23.8 billion. Again, I will have these inserted into the \nRecord. The growth rate for the last several years in EITC outlays, \nbeginning in 1990, was 14 percent, 55 percent, 22 percent, 21 percent, \n42 percent in 1994, and 18 percent in 1995.\n  Those are increases in outlays where we are writing checks, not \nreducing someone's tax liability. Uncle Sam is writing a cash payment \nbenefit. Again--this is 10 times the rate of growth of inflation over \nmost of these years.\n  The cost of this program now exceeds the cost for Aid for Families \nwith Dependent Children. We are going to talk about welfare reform very \nsoon. Senator Bradley, myself, and others are going to be working on a \nwelfare markup tomorrow. We will focus on AFDC because it has been the \nlargest cash assistance program for welfare dependents. The EITC \nexceeds AFDC. It did not a couple years ago.\n  This chart maybe is a little more confusing, and thus needs \nexplanation. You see the red, which is the outlays. The green here is \nthe credit portion. So the total cost of this program, estimated by the \nyear 2002, is going to be $36.2 billion. That is an unbelievable \nexplosion of a program that only cost a couple of billion dollars back \nin the late 1970's and even in the early 1980's. The total cost of the \nprogram in 1986 was $2 billion. The total cost of the program in 1990 \nwas $6.9 billion. The total cost of the program in 1994 was $21.8 \nbillion. It tripled between 1990 and 1994--tripled; it went from less \nthan $7 billion to $21.8 billion. By 1996, it goes up to $28.4 billion. \nAgain, the growth rate in the total cost of this program, outlays and \ncredits, is astounding. In 1991, it went up 60 percent; in 1992, 17 \npercent; in 1993, 20 percent; in 1994, 40 percent; in 1995, 16 percent; \nand in 1996, 12 percent.\n  Now, the cost of the EITC is growing for a lot of different reasons. \nOne, Congress has increased the amount of money people are eligible \nfor. But I will give you some figures. The maximum credit in 1990 for \ntwo or more children was $953. From 1976 through 1978, the maximum \ncredit anybody could receive out of this program was $400. In 1979, all \nthe way through 1984, it was $500. Then, in 1985 and 1986, it was $550. \nThen it has increased substantially every year. In 1990, a person could \nreceive $953. So it basically doubled from 1979 to 1990--the maximum \namount of credit that anybody could receive for two or more children.\n  Again, keep in mind that 99 percent of the people who file returns \nfor this receive a lump sum payment. So $1,000 is not a bad deal. More \nand more people found out about it and thought, hey, this is a pretty \ngood deal. They can file an income tax return even though most of these \npeople have income such that they are not going to pay any Federal \nincome tax. Maybe they will pay some Social Security tax, but they will \nfile a return and get $953. Then more and more people became eligible. \nCongress increased eligibility and people became [[Page S7146]] aware \nthat it could be very easily cheated.\n  The maximum amount went up dramatically. In 1995, it was $1,511. It \nwent up another 50 percent over that period of time. From $953 in 1990; \nand in 1993, $1,511. In 1994, Congress made some changes in a tax bill \nthat not any Republican voted for. I do not remember anybody saying we \nare going to increase the maximum amount on the income tax credit from \n$1,511 to $2,528 in 1 year. The maximum tax credit went from $1,511 to \n$2,528. In 1995, the maximum tax credit is $3,110. In a few years, we \nwent from less than $1,000 to $3,110. It has tripled. No wonder the \ncost of this program is climbing up out of control.\n We went from a maximum credit for a family with two or more children \nof less than $1,000 to $3,000 in 5 years. You can see why there was an \nexplosion in cost.\n\n  Unfortunately, there was also an explosion in fraud. For my \ncolleagues to defend a program that has had this kind of fraud and \nerror rate I think is unbelievable. I am just looking at a GAO study \nthat was given to the Senate in March 1995. It says, ``The most recent \ntaxpayer compliance measurement program shows that about 42 percent of \nEIC recipients receive too large a credit and 32 percent were not able \nto show they were entitled to any credit.''\n  Think of that, 32 percent of those surveyed could not show that they \nare entitled to receive any credit. One-third of the beneficiaries were \nnot able to show that they were entitled to any credit? And we are \nexpanding it on this kind of scale? People can receive $3,100 and one-\nthird could not even defend that they were entitled to receive it and \n42 percent showed an error? Maybe some of those errors were small, \nmaybe some of them were large, maybe some of them were intentional, \nmaybe some of them were not, but about 34 percent of EIC paid out was \nawarded erroneously.\n  Mr. President, 34 percent was awarded erroneously? Wow, think of \nthat. We are talking about a program that is bigger than AFDC, a \nprogram that is growing at this kind of rate, and it has that kind of \nfraud and error rate.\n  What are these radical Republican proposals that I keep hearing about \nthat we are taxing working poor? That is false. I just totally deny \nthat accusation. That irritates me. What we are trying to do is stem \nthe tide of a program that is totally out of control. Republicans think \nwe should control it. As my colleagues know, we are not passing tax law \non the floor of the Senate. We are not rewriting the program. We are \nsaying we have a program that is out of control and we ought to contain \nits growth.\n  Under the Republican package, let me mention, the total cost of this \nprogram grows from $25 billion in 1995 to $28 billion in 1996. It \ncontinues to grow about $1 billion a year to $32 billion by the year \n2002. In other words, under the proposal we are suggesting to the \nFinance Committee, EITC would continue to grow, but it would grow about \n$1 billion per year, a little over 3 or 4 percent per year, whereas \nunder current law it continues to grow much faster than that.\n  Let me give a couple of specific examples. As I mentioned, right now \nunder the earned-income tax credit, a person with two or more children \nis able to receive $3,110. Under the plan that some of us are \nproposing, next year that person could receive $3,119 and that figure \nwould continue to increase every year so by the year 2000 a person with \ntwo or more children could receive $3,560. So, again the maximum credit \nallowed would increase every single year. Granted, it will not increase \nas fast as provided under current law. A person could receive, again, \nlump sum payments under current law from $3,110 in 1995 to over $4,000 \nby the year 2000. We allow the increase to go from about $3,110 in 1995 \nto $3,560 by the year 2000. So we have smaller increases.\n  The current law says let us take it up to $4,000. Again, keep in mind \nmost people are receiving this as a lump sum payment. I think that is a \ngreat incentive for fraud. If you cheat on your tax return, not only do \nyou reduce your taxes, which is what happens in most cases, but Uncle \nSam is going to write you a check. Right now the check is $3,110. We \nfound a lot of fraud when people were getting just $953. What are they \ngoing to do when they can get $4,000? So we think we need to curb this \nabuse. We need to eliminate the fraud. We need to slow, not expand, \nthis program. We did not even freeze the program. Maybe we should have.\n  A program this fraudulent probably should have been frozen. We did \nnot do that. Actually, if you had frozen the program for 7 years I \nthink you save $50 billion. We did not do that. We just slowed the rate \nof growth. For my colleagues to insinuate that is a tax increase on the \nworking poor, I beg to differ. I think that is totally false.\n  If we are ever, ever going to balance the budget, we have to curtail \nthe growth of programs that are growing a lot more rapidly than \ninflation. I have already given the figures of the rapid cost of this \nprogram. We are trying to constrain it in our proposal. If we allow \nUncle Sam to continue writing checks that grow from $953 in 1990 to \n$3,110 in 1995 to $4,000 in 2000, this program will not be contained. \nThese numbers will continue to climb off the charts and we will have \ndeficit spending. Not only will we continue to have deficit spending \nbut we are going to find that too many people are eligible for this \nprogram--I have read in one case where 30 to 40-some-odd percent of the \nDistrict of Columbia is now eligible for this program.\n  You are going to continue to have rampant, rampant abuse, I am \nafraid, because the dollars are so large. And that would be a serious \nmistake. So I will send a second degree amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  I will postpone that. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT--TWO OR MORE CHILDREN

                                                             \nSource: CBO.                                                                                                                                            \n\nMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. This amendment \nmakes sense. It restores $21 billion in cuts over the next 7 years in \nthe earned income tax credit in the Senate Republican budget \nresolution. Like their cuts in Medicare and education, the Republican's \ncuts in this tax credit are short-sighted and wrong.\n  At a time when many working Americans are struggling to make ends \nmeet, the Senate Republican budget plan would hike taxes on low-income \nworkers by as much as $350 a year. It would repeal the final phase of \nthe earned income tax credit expansion enacted as part of the 1993 \nbudget act, and it would repeal the earned income tax credit for \nworkers without a child\n  I do not understand the desire to cut the earned income tax credit. \nRonald Reagan, a President that I did not always agree with, had it \nright when it came to the earned income tax credit. President Reagan \ncalled the earned income tax credit: ``the best antipoverty, the best \npro-family, the best job-creation measure to come out of Congress.''\n  President Reagan was right. This tax credit does reward low-income \nAmericans for working. It makes a huge difference for families \nstruggling to pay the rent and buy food for their kids.\n  The tax credit is available to low-income workers only. If you do not \nwork, you do not get the credit. The credit starts phasing out at \n$11,000 for families with children and at $5,000 for workers without \nchildren. It ends for families with two children at $25,296, families \nwith one child at $23,755, and workers with no children at $9,000.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the earned income tax credit has been a \nbig success making work pay for low-income workers.\n  In 1993, 25,279 working Vermonters benefited from the earned income \ntax credit. Under the Senate Republican budget resolution, however, the \nearned income tax credit in Vermont would be cut by $29 million over \nthe next 7 years. The Treasury Department estimates this cut would \nincrease taxes on 20,156 working Vermonters by an average of $1,433 per \ntaxpayer over the next 7 years.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that these \ncuts are necessary because of some fraudulent claims involving the \nearned income tax credit. But that argument is more than a little \ndisingenuous.\n  An IRS study has found some error rates in the credit, but the \nClinton administration has responded aggressively to address this \nproblem. Specifically, the administration has developed 12 measures to \nensure simplicity and verifiability of the earned income tax credit. \nAnd the IRS is now matching social security numbers with tax returns to \nfurther verify credit takers.\n  The Senate Republican budget resolution, however, contains only one \nof the administration's antifraud proposals. Instead of adopting the \nadministration's antifraud proposals or other antifraud measures, this \nbudget resolution simply cuts the tax credit. In fact, this budget \nresolution cuts the earned income tax credit by $21 billion over the \nnext 7 years because it's a quick way to collect budget-cutting dollars \nat the expense of a constituency that rarely votes--the working poor.\n  Cutting the earned income tax credit and raising taxes on the working \npoor is exactly the wrong thing to do now. Unfortunately, we are \nsuffering through an era of stagnant wage growth. Just last month, the \nDepartment of Labor reported that median weekly earnings of \nnonsupervisory workers rose just 1.9 percent over the past year. While \nat the same time, consumer prices rose 2.8 percent.\n  And last year just continued the losing trend of the 1980's. During \nthe 1980's, the gap between the rich and poor grew faster in the United \nStates than anywhere else in the Western world. According to an April \n1995 study by Prof. Edward Wolff of New York University, three-quarters \nof the income gains during the 1980's and 100 percent of the increased \nwealth went to the top 20 percent of families. The remaining 80 percent \nof U.S. families lost in real wage power.\n  Workers are treading water or worse against the rising tide of \ninflation. Now is not the time to cut a tax credit that rewards the \npoor for working, Instead, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to restore the earned income tax credit.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Bradley to restore funding for the earned income tax credit. \nThe Bradley amendment would restore the EITC by redirecting $16.9 \nbillion of the proposed $170 billion budget surplus to working lower \nincome Americans. Simply stated, the Bradley amendment offers a clear \nchoice to the Members of this body: We can impose a $16.9 billion \n[[Page S7148]] tax increase on working Americans or we can ask well-to-\ndo people to bear some portion of the economic sacrifice necessary to \nrestore our Nation's economic vitality.\n  Mr. President, tax expenditures are one of the fastest growing items \nin the Federal budget. Over the next 7 years, the U.S. Government will \nspend in excess of $4 trillion--that's right, trillion--on tax \nwriteoffs, loopholes, and hidden breaks. And while there are some tax \nexpenditures that help middle- and lower-income Americans, most of our \ntax expenditures end up benefiting the upper end of the economic \nladder.\n  The budget before us today does not touch tax benefits for the \nwealthy and powerful. We all know that situation exists because the \nspecial interests that benefit from our current tax scheme have both \nthe resources and ability to protect their advantages. On the other \nhand, Americans who rely on the EITC are too busy working--or worrying \nabout their childrens' health or education--or struggling to make ends \nmeet in these challenging and difficult times--to know that the \nCongress is about to hit them with a hidden tax increase. Because that \nis just what a reduction in the ETIC is--a tax increase.\n  Mr. President, the EITC provides a tangible economic incentive to \nlower income Americans to work for a living. In my own State of \nWisconsin, 2,294,126 returns were filed for the 1993 tax year. Of this \ntotal, 189,831 returns contained earned income tax credit refunds, and \na total of $182,548,000 in EITC refunds were paid to Wisconsin \ncitizens. The average refund in Wisconsin was $961.63. Now that might \nnot sound like a lot of money to some people from other parts of the \ncountry--or even to some in this Chamber. But make no mistake about it, \nto the Wisconsin taxpayers who qualified for those refunds, they made \nthe difference between work and welfare; between hard work and a hand-\nout; and between self-worth and self-doubt.\n  Mr. President, I also recognize that few things in this world are \nperfect, and that includes the earned income tax credit. As a number of \nmy colleagues have correctly observed, there are deficiencies in the \ncurrent administration of this credit. In particular, Senators have \nidentified problems associated with electronically filed tax returns \nthat contain EITC claims. And while there is some disagreement over the \nseverity of the problems, it is clear to all concerned that remedial \naction is required. The choice that we face today is whether we will \nretain the EITC and effect bipartisan reforms or whether we will \ndrastically reduce one of the few tax expenditures that helps working \nclass Americans.\n  I would urge my colleagues to continue the bipartisan approach that \nhas been the hallmark of the EITC. My colleagues may recall that \nPresidents Reagan and Bush worked with Democratic Congresses to develop \nand expand the EITC. I hope that this Congress will continue that \nbipartisan spirit.\n  Mr. President, we are at an important crossroad in our history. We in \nGovernment have finally heard the message of the American people: That \nit is time to put our fiscal house in order. We must now decide whether \nwe share the burdens that confront us equally or whether we exacerbate \nthe growing disparities that exist within our society. I believe that \nthe Bradley amendment is a step in the right direction. Senator \nBradley's amendment is a fair and reasonable proposal that helps \nworking Americans. I therefore urge my colleagues--on both sides of the \nasile--to support his amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nearned income tax credit [EITC], and Senator Bradley's amendment to \nrescue one of this country's clearest incentives and rewards for hard-\nworking families.\n  We are forced to offer this amendment to fix one of the worst parts \nof the budget offered by the other side of the aisle. Believe it or \nnot, the architects of this budget are trying to cancel tax relief for \nthe families in this country struggling every day to make ends meet so \nthe funds--$21 billion in all--can be redirected to households and \ncorporations in the upper tiers.\n  They justify their attack on tax relief for working families by \nclaiming that the credit--the EITC--is growing out of control. That is \ntotally misleading, and deliberately so. Yes, the EITC is growing. \nThat's because an economic and deficit reduction plan enacted in 1993 \nincluded an initiative to increase this tax credit for very logical \nreasons. There is nothing to hide or apologize for. Those of us who \nvoted for that budget, with $600 billion in deficit reduction and many \ncuts in spending, put our priority on hard working Americans who are \nworking to make ends meet and raise their children. We wanted the EITC \nto grow because of its fundamental role in helping parents who are \nteetering on the economic edge to be able to choose work over welfare, \nindependence over dependence, dignity over the indignities of the \nwelfare system.\n  I am proud of my vote to expand the EITC because it is needed tax \nrelief for more than 100,000 West Virginia families. That may be \nanother statistic, but it stands for real people and families across my \nState working as hard as they can to make it each day.\n  The McCumbers of Frametown, WV, count on the EITC to make ends meet. \nShe works full-time as a receptionist at the Mountaineer Food Bank, and \nher husband works full-time as a maintenance worker. They have two \nchildren, ages 8 and 10. For the past 4 years, the McCumbers have \ngotten tax relief thanks to the EITC. And let me tell you how they used \nthat money. Three years ago, their EITC helped them make a down payment \non a home. They also have used it to pay property taxes and homeowners \ninsurance. Another year, it covered glasses for their daughter, and a \nnew bed for their\n son. The McCumbers family is like many of our neighbors next door. \nParents who work hard, but struggle to pay the bills each month.\n  Let me tell you about another West Virginia family that relies on the \nEITC--the Helmicks of New Milton. He works full-time driving a truck \nfor Mountain View Construction. She is a full-time homemaker caring for \nsix children, ranging in age from their 15-year-old twins to a 4-year \nold. The first time this family used the EITC was when the twins were \nborn and they needed extra baby furniture and twice as many supplies. \nOver the years, the EITC has helped the family buy a used truck to \nensure Mr. Helmick had reliable transportation for work. It has helped \nthem paint their home, put a concrete floor in their basement, and even \nput up a home basketball court so they could keep their teenagers close \nto home.\n  Hard working families like the McCumbers and the Helmicks deserve our \nadmiration and support. We should not pull the rug out from under them \nand their children by eliminating the tax relief promised to them. And \nwe certainly should not take tax relief away from hard working people \nwho are struggling in order to give a bonus to wealthy Americans. \nThat's what this budget resolution proposes to do, believe it or not. \nThat's why we should pass the Bradley amendment, and reject an idea as \ndumb and unfair as robbing struggling families to give something more \nto the well off.\n  If the proponents of the Republican budget get their way on the EITC, \nit will mean that more than 80,000 West Virginia families will lose \nabout $1,494 over the next 7 years that they would have gotten for \nplaying by the rules and doing something called work. That would renege \non a promise to 12 million families in West Virginia and across our \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleague to support the Bradley amendment and the men and \nwomen who work hard every day, struggling to provide for themselves and \ntheir children.\n  The other side wants to focus on all the excuses for backing away \nfrom a policy of rewarding work and discouraging welfare. They talk \nabout error rates, fraud, other problems. Where these problems need to \nbe fixed, let's fix them. Let's not hide behind excuses to walk away \nfrom families who deserve every reward possible in a country that says \nit values work and children above all. The McCumbers and the Helmicks \nare my guidepost in this debate. They should serve as a reminder to \nevery one of my colleagues that a growing EITC is exactly where our \npriorities should be.\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\n  opposing cuts to the earned income tax credit and the repeal of the \n                            davis-bacon act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the budget \nresolution, I am concerned about Republican spending proposals that \nwill balance the budget on the backs of children, middle-class \nfamilies, the working poor, and the Nation's veterans. The more I study \nit, the more I realize that the majority's budget resolution will be a \nvery bitter pill for hard-working American families to swallow. The \nbudget resolution preserves special interest tax loopholes and other \nforms of corporate welfare. The wealthy will continue to receive \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks and the proposed budget promises an \nadditional $175 billion in future tax relief.\n  The most troubling feature of the Republican budget proposal is the \n$21 billion cut in the earned income tax credit. During the past \ndecade, working families suffered a slow, steady erosion in their \nstandard of living. Families simply had to work harder and longer to \nmake ends meet. Despite their hard work and long hours, the number of \nworking poor families and individuals living at or below the poverty \nline continues to grow.\n  The most effective way to improve the economic well-being of the \nmiddle class and working poor is to promote policies that reward work \nand lessen dependency. That is why the earned income tax credit was \nestablished. The earned income tax credit helps parents in low-income \nfamilies remain in the work force. It also acts as a safety net for \nmiddle-class families confronted with a sudden loss of income.\n  Despite long-standing bipartisan support for policies that make work \npay, the majority budget resolution would cut the earned income tax \ncredit by $21 billion over 7 years. Congress recently expanded the \nearned income tax credit to lift a family of four with a full-time \nworking parent to a level at least equal to the poverty line. The \nRepublican budget proposal abandons this policy. Their proposed cut in \nthe earned income tax credit would increase Federal income taxes on \nmillions of low-income working families with children. Under the \nmajority proposal, the Treasury Department estimates that 7.8 million \nworking families with more than one child will see their earned income \ntax credit reduced by $270. A working family with two children earning \n$20,000 would see a $290 reduction in their credit.\n  Mr. President, only $1 billion of this $21 billion cut would result \nfrom the adoption of the Clinton administration proposal to deny the \nearned income tax credit to undocumented workers and implement \nprocedures to reduce errors and fraud in the program. The remaining $20 \nbillion cut represents a tax increase for millions of working families, \nmany of which live just above the poverty level. Why raise taxes on \nindividuals who are struggling\n to work, make ends meet, and avoid welfare? What message are we \nsending to America's working men and women? The last thing we need is a \nbudget that raises the income taxes on Americans who are committed to \nwork, rather than collecting welfare.\n\n  To add insult to injury, the Republican budget proposal cuts job \ntraining assistance by 25 percent. This cut will make it more difficult \nfor our youth and adults to receive the technical training and job \nassistance necessary to gain employment in a technology-driven, global \nmarketplace. Without job training and education programs, displaced, \nfirst-time, and entry-level workers will be relegated to low-wage, low-\nskill service sector jobs with no chance for economic or educational \nadvancement. Has any consideration been given to the impact of a 25-\npercent cut in job education and training on long-term productivity and \nprosperity or on blue-collar families and their communities? I don't \nthink so. These cuts will deprive workers of educational opportunities \nwhich could increase their earning power and productivity, along with \nthe productivity and prosperity of businesses and the country. A rising \ntide lifts all boats, but only if the boats are seaworthy.\n  Mr. President, the budget plan also calls for the repeal of the \nDavis-Bacon Act. Repeal of Davis-Bacon would jeopardize the provision \nof fair, prevailing wages and labor standards on construction projects. \nFor over six decades, the Davis-Bacon Act has assured local \nconstruction workers and contractors a fair opportunity to bid \ncompetitively on Federal construction projects. I believe dismantling \nthe act would adversely impact local workers and contractors, and as a \nconsequence, reduce the quality of construction on Federal projects.\n  In addition, Davis-Bacon ensures that workers on low-skill, low-wage \njobs can participate in training programs to improve their skills and \nqualifications for better paying positions. Repeal of the law would \nremove most incentives for contractors to provide these workers such \ntraining opportunities.\n  Programs and agencies that promote safe and healthy working \nconditions and procedures also face drastic cuts. The Occupational \nHealth and Safety Administration and other workplace safety agencies \nface a 50-percent reduction in funds which are necessary to ensure a \nsafe working environment for working men and women.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget dismantles the safety net for \nmillions of working Americans and eliminates or cuts programs that are \ninvestments for a brighter, more competitive, and prosperous future for \nAmerican families and our country. It is nothing more than a promise of \na golden parachute for our wealthy.\n           targeting the poor under the gop budget resolution\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate, in debate on the Fiscal Year \n1996 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, is in the process of \nconsidering many necessary spending reductions to achieve a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. There is a consensus in the Senate--on both \nsides of the aisle--on the need to balance the budget, and this Senator \nis committed to eliminating the Federal deficit. However, as expected, \nthere exists much less unanimity on the appropriate spending cuts for \nreaching the goal of a balanced budget.\n  As approved by the Budget Committee, the Budget Resolution would \nreduce funding for the earned income tax credit (EITC) by $21 billion \nover the next 7 years. Senator Bradley has proposed an amendment to the \nBudget Resolution that would restore $16.9 billion in funding for the \nEITC. Senator Bradley would fund this restoration of the EITC with \nmoney earmarked by the Budget Committee for a future tax cut. In \nessence, Senator Bradley's amendment seeks to repeal a tax increase on \nAmerica's working, low-income families by reducing a future tax cut \nthat--if similar to the House-passed tax-cut measure--would primarily \nbenefit upper-income families. A future tax cut is promised in the \nBudget Resolution if the ``fiscal dividend'' from deficit reduction is \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, it is important that the Senate consider the primary \nbeneficiaries of the EITC, which is a refundable Federal income tax \ncredit created in 1975 to supplement the earnings of low-income \nworkers. The EITC primarily benefits low-income, working families--\nthose with incomes below $28,000--with one or more children. In light \nof the upcoming debate on welfare reform, can we in the United States \nSenate expect to provide viable alternatives for families receiving \nwelfare benefits if we do not reward work for low-income families? The \nEITC does exactly that. It rewards work.\n  Critics of the EITC have pointed out that the program is subject to \nfraud and that it is too expensive. In response to these and other \nconcerns, President Clinton included two legislative proposals in his \nFiscal Year 1996 Budget that seek to reduce the cost of the EITC. \nFirst, the President proposed denying the tax credit to otherwise \neligible recipients if they have substantial investment income. Earlier \nthis year, the Senate approved and the President signed legislation \n(Public Law 104-7) that addressed this problem. Secondly, the President \nproposed requiring a valid Social Security number for all EITC \nrecipients. The Budget Resolution includes the President's proposal and \nI support it. I do not support, however, the tradeoff proposed in the \nBudget Resolution that cuts the EITC over the next 7 years to pay for a \nfuture tax reduction for the wealthiest [[Page S7150]] in our society. \nIt is interesting, even tendentious, that the only tax expenditure \ntargeted by the Republican Budget Resolution is a program that benefits \nour Nation's low-income, working families. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates the total cost of the more than 120 tax expenditures \nto be $453.0 billion for Fiscal Year 1995. The EITC, by comparison, \nwill cost approximately $18.6 billion this year.\n  Mr. President, the Administration has estimated that a total of \n12,200,000 working taxpayers in the United States receive benefits from \nthe EITC. In West Virginia alone, an estimated 101,229 families \nreceived approximately $99,323,000 in EITC benefits in 1994. That \nrepresents 14.6 percent of all West Virginia tax filers. As an elected \nrepresentative of the people of West Virginia, I support the Bradley \namendment because it seeks to repeal the effective tax increase on low-\nincome working families by reducing the Republican-promised tax cut for \nthe wealthiest in our society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the floor?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Budget Committee's mark would in effect \nraise taxes by some $21 billion for people who make less than $28,000 a \nyear. That is a fact. About 7.8 million people who would benefit from \nthis program, and their children, would be affected. Families with two \nor more children would be the hardest hit by the proposal that is \ncoming from the other side of the aisle. Under the Budget Committee \nmark that we received, this would result in a tax increase for over 12 \nmillion Americans.\n  As the senior Senator of Nevada, I am concerned what effect this tax \nincrease would have on the State of Nevada. The increase in taxes would \naffect almost 100,000 people who live in the State of Nevada. Nevada is \na State whose large numbers of people are employed in the service \nindustry. It would have a tremendous impact on them.\n  Over the next 7 years, these families in Nevada can expect to pay \nover $100 billion more in taxes because of this policy. This results in \na tax of about $1,500 more per family. It would increase the taxes of \nfamilies with children, it would result in a dramatic increase in \nannual taxes of $250.\n  This tax increase is being carried out for one purpose. That is to \nproduce the crown jewel in the so called Contract With America. An \nenormous tax break for the wealthiest of this country courtesy of an \nenormous tax increase on working Americans.\n  In the budget proposal we are now debating, the tax cut is \ncamouflaged. In fact, it took the press a few days to pick up the fact \nthat there was a $170 billion earmark in this budget proposal that \ncould only go to the Finance Committee and could only be used for tax \ncuts. This is not a fiscally sensible policy and it is not morally \nright either.\n  There has been some talk about fraud. It is really too bad we are \ntalking about fraud as it relates to the poorest people who benefit \nfrom our tax policies. Why are we picking on people who are working, \nmaking under $28,000 a year?\n  I think we should make sure there is no fraud or abuse in this \nprogram. There is no question about it. But why do we not look at some \nof the other problems we have. They are too numerous to mention, but \nlet me talk about 73 percent of foreign corporations who do business in \nAmerica that pay no taxes--none. We are losing tens of billions of \ndollars a year because they are not paying their fair share. Why do we \nnot talk about doing something about that?\n  I think it is important we talk about policies and how they affect \nindividual human beings. We talk about numbers but they become just \nstatistics. What would this do to people in the State of Nevada? Let us \ntake, for example, a woman by the name of Denise Mayfield. She is a \nsingle mother with four children. She lives in Las Vegas. She began \nworking at a program called Head Start in Las Vegas in 1985 as a \nteacher's aid at the lowest possible salary, minimum wage.\n  She is now director of that program. Before she worked at Head Start \nshe worked at the YWCA, and received welfare--Aid to Families With \nDependent Children. This year, 1994, she received an earned-income tax \ncredit of $1,530.\n  She used this money to buy a washing machine for her family and \nclothes for her four children. That does not sound too unreasonable to \nme.\n  Kanna White is a single mother, has one daughter, and also lives in \nLas Vegas, is going to school, has a full-time job, and she is working \ntoward a degree in child development. She received $1,000 this year in \nearned income. She is using some of this money to pay for summer day \ncare services. This earned income allows her to pay her bills on time \nand to do things that her daughter can now do that other families take \nfor granted.\n  Kyle Estrada lives in Henderson, NV, and has three young children. \nShe teaches parenting skills and job preparation skills at the Head \nStart Program. She has health coverage for herself, but like many \nAmericans, is underinsured. She has no insurance for her children. She \nhas three. She received a $1,300 earned income tax credit in 1994. She \nhas used this money to cover her rent. This program, she said, has kept \nher off welfare. How much money did she get from the earned income tax \ncredit? She got $1300. She would get this much perhaps in 2 months if \nshe went on AFDC. But she chose to continue working, like millions of \nAmericans have done and thousands of Nevadans have done--to continue \nworking rather than going on welfare. That was the purpose of this \nprogram. It is working well.\n  I conclude by saying that these three people are just a few of the \nthousands in Nevada of hard-working people who would rather work and \nsupport their families than go on welfare.\n  This is an example of three people in Nevada who are representative \nof tens of millions of people in America who are now working instead of \nbeing on welfare. We need to continue this program.\n  For me, this illustration represents the difference of philosophy \nbetween this side of the aisle and those on the other side of the \naisle. We do not live in a Darwinian society. We cannot expect all \nAmericans to succeed and make millions, like Bill Gates in the computer \nbusiness or Forrest Mars in the candy business. They are good, there is \nno question about it. I applaud them for being entrepreneurial \nbillionaires. But they were also a little lucky. Not everyone can be \nlike them. We cannot expect everyone to be like Bill Gates or Forrest \nMars. But we can expect everybody to continue to try.\n  That is what earned income is all about. On the other side of the \naisle, they lecture about the need to eliminate handouts. What we do is \ndo something to eliminate handouts.\n  Mr. President, earned income reflects the Democratic philosophy \nbecause it involves giving a hand-up, not a hand out.\n  It is unfair to raise taxes on 12 million hard-working Americans, and \nthat is what this budget proposal would do.\n  I think this amendment should be adopted in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I ask the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, is it his \nintention to offer the amendment at the conclusion of all time on this \namendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. At which point there would be, under the rules, an hour \nof debate on the second-degree amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). That is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. It does pertain to the earned income tax credit?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, other speakers will be able to speak in \nthat half hour. I would simply like to make a few points in the \nremaining minutes we have before this amendment will come to the point \nof second degree.\n  First, the argument that we are having is that there is an explosion \nin this program, that this program has exploded, says the opponent of \nthis [[Page S7151]] amendment. Do you know why it has exploded? It has \nexploded because in 1975, if you earned over $8,000, you could not get \nthis benefit. You could not get any tax relief from this. Now you can \nearn up to $28,000. There are millions more Americans that are now \neligible for this tax cut. There are millions of Americans eligible for \nthe tax cut. And, indeed, we have broadened it, as the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma has pointed out, from a few hundred dollars in \nthe mid-1980's to $2,500 today, heading up to $3,000.\n  So it is a bigger tax cut. So lo and behold, a ray of insight, a \nstroke of wisdom; if you give a bigger tax cut to more people, it will \ncost more money. That is the explosion that the Senator is talking \nabout. I thought giving tax cuts was a good idea. That is all we have \nheard from the other side. We want a tax cut, a tax cut, a tax cut. \nHere is a tax cut. But no. For families earning under $28,000 a year, \nwe want a tax increase. Oh no, no, no, they say. They do not pay any \nincome tax.\n  Just for the record, 48 percent of the people who receive the earned \nincome credit with children pay income tax; just for the record, the \nfacts. But that is not the point. The point is the earned income credit \nis meant to offset not only income tax but other taxes, such as Social \nSecurity tax, and also the loss of certain benefits as you earn more \nmoney so that you are not pushed farther down the ladder.\n  So the fact of the matter is that this is a significant tax cut. It \noffsets not only income tax, if you pay income tax, and 48 percent of \nthe families with children who are eligible for this do, but it offsets \nthe Social Security tax. That is the cruelest tax on families, and it \noffsets the loss of certain benefits as you earn more income going up \nthe scale.\n  So there is no dispute that under the proposal before us on the other \nside, that families earning under $28,000 a year will pay more in \ntaxes. They will pay more on the Social Security taxes that they do not \nhave offset with this, or they will pay more in income taxes.\n  Let us make a point about the Senator's data. ``Oh, what a terrible \nerror rate; oh, what a terrible fraud, a waste.'' Of course, all of his \nnumbers are from 1988. Well, a few things have happened since 1988 that \ntightened this program up. In fact, many things have happened since \n1988.\n  For example, we repealed the supplemental credit for health \ninsurance. We repealed the supplemental credit for children under the \nage of 1. We denied it to nonresident aliens. We denied it to anybody \nwho is a prisoner. We required a taxpayer identification number. The \nDepartment of Defense is required to report both the IRS and the \nmilitary personnel nontaxable earned income credit paid.\n  We also said if you have investment income over $2,500 you do not get \nit. We said that now you have to have a Social Security number provided \nfor children, as well as adults, and on and on.\n  We have made major steps to correct this. This is not the time to \nincrease taxes on working families.\n  I am really surprised that that is the position, inconsistent as it \nis with the espousal of the other insight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the time of the proponents has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 31 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It will be my intention to yield the balance of my time \nas soon as we have our amendment ready.\n  I continue to hear the proponents of this amendment say that our \nefforts to reduce the growth rate of EITC is a tax increase on working \npoor. I want to say that is flatly wrong. Eighty percent of the money \nin this program is going to people in lump sum, cash payments.\n  My friend from Nevada gave some excellent examples of people who \nqualified for the credit. I heard him say that one person received \n$1,000, and another received $1,200.\n Under the assumptions in this budget resolution, they could receive \nmore than they received last year.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Under our proposal, they could receive more than \nthey received last year. No one's payment, if they received an earned \nincome tax credit and their income was the same, would be less. We did \nnot roll back the program. We did not lower the credit or income \neligibility amounts.\n  Again, here are the growth rates of this program, and it has \nexploded. For its first 10 years, the EITC cost less than $2 or $3 \nbillion. Now the program has outlays of over $20 billion in the last \nfew years. Even under our proposal, it continues to increase about $1 \nbillion per year.\n  Granted, that is about a 3-percent growth instead of a growth rate \nthat was at 20 and 40 and 55 and 60 percent. So it grows a lot more \nslowly.\n  I am putting all these tables into the Record. People right now, in \n1995, can receive a $3,110 lump sum; 99 percent of the people who \nqualify for this receive the benefit in a lump sum.\n  Now, my colleagues call this a tax increase, even though next year we \nwould give them slightly more $3,110. We say next year the maximum \namount under our proposal would be more than that but it would be only \nslightly more than that. My colleagues on the other side say, well, \nwait a minute, next year we want to increase that to $3,500, and in a \nfew years we want to take it to $4,000. We are saying that, no, we are \ngoing to be more conservative; we are going to increase it to $3,560. \nSo instead of giving somebody $4,000, we are going to say we will give \nyou $3,560. Every year we are going to give you more than last year \nunder our proposal, but our colleagues are calling this a tax increase.\n  I disagree. The handouts will be a little less. The cash payments \nwill be a little less under our proposal. They will be more than last \nyear, but they will not continue to grow at this unaffordable rate. We \ncannot afford this. Our Government cannot afford it.\n  And again I was surprised to find that the cost of this program now \nexceeds the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the largest cash \nwelfare benefit program in our Nation's history.\n  The earned-income tax credit is a great name, but it does not fit \nthis program. This is a negative income tax program. I have heard my \ncolleagues say this affects anybody who makes under $26,000--I will put \ntables in the Record on this subject. In 1995, the figure is $26,673. \nThat is the maximum amount of income you can make and still receive \nsome EITC. But that figure increases. Under current law, by the year \n2000, you can receive EITC if you make up to $32,596. Under the so-\ncalled radical assumptions in this budget, you can receive EITC if you \nmake up to $31,656.\n  So the EITC still goes to the same people, but we just have just \nslowed the growth of the maximum credit amount.\n  What we have done, in my opinion, is respond to the studies of GAO. I \nheard my colleague say it was an old study. The IRS in 1994, in a 2-\nweek study on electronic returns, said that 29 percent of those audited \nreceived too much earned income credit. That is a total of $358 \nmillion. They said 13 percent were judged to have intentional errors, \noutright fraud. That was $183 million.\n  That was just a short, little 2-week study. In 1988, another tax \ncompliance measure showed that 42 percent of EITC recipients received \ntoo large a credit and 32 percent were not able to show they were \nentitled to any credit. That was when the program was much smaller, and \nthat was when the incentives to cheat were much less. Now we have \ntripled the amount of money that individuals can receive. Now people \nhave found out that you can get a big check if you make $12,000--and it \ndoes not make any difference if you made $12,000 working 40 hours a \nweek or if you made $12,000 working 100 hours a year. Maybe for some \nreason you are working part time, whatever. You can qualify for this \nbenefit and be able to receive $3,110 dollars. And when people find \nthat out, there is a lot of incentive to cheat a little bit. In the \npast people cheated to reduce their tax liability, and now we find that \npeople have other incentives; if you cheat a little bit now, we are \ngoing to give you a check, and the check is not just a few hundred \ndollars as this program used to be. It is not just $953 as it was in \n1990. Now it is $3,110 and growing to $4,068.\n  We think that is too rapid a growth. We think this program is too \nfraudulent. We think we should curtail the growth of that program. I \ntell my colleague from New Jersey, I will share with him a copy of the \nsecond-degree amendment I have. We are trying to [[Page S7152]] make \nsure it conforms with his amendment, and I will give that to him in \njust a moment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator withhold the request?\n  How much time remains?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reclaim the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just recap and then I would like \na quorum call charged to our side where I can talk with Senator Nickles \nfor a minute.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield just for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. If the Senator still has time that will be unused, I \nhave people on my side who do want to use time, and while Senators are \nin conference, does the Senator mind if they speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I do not think I \ncan do that because we are running up against a real shortage of \noverall time to get a lot of amendments in. We both get charged 50-50, \nor we benefit 50-50 on that time. I do not get the benefit of the whole \n20 minutes. That side gets 10 of it in the overall, but I do not think \nI would do that yet.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Following up on this, it is pretty obvious we are coming \ndown to crunch time. I am just going to make the suggestion now without \nasking for any commitment now of the chairman of the Budget Committee. \nIt seems to me that after the Gramm amendment is offered, which I \nunderstand will be the next one up--and I am not trying to limit debate \non that--I would suggest that we at least consider getting a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on both sides that after the Gramm amendment all \namendments to follow would be limited to some timeframe, I do not know, \nhalf an hour, 15 minutes, equally divided, or something of that nature, \nand possibly eliminate second-degree amendments. Otherwise, we are \ngoing to run into a real train wreck tomorrow about noon.\n  I just make the suggestion if we could consider contemplating after \nthe Gramm amendment to enter into a unanimous-consent agreement on all \namendments that would follow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the Senator's usual way of helping \nthings along, the Senator has made a good suggestion. Clearly, I cannot \nagree to that at this point,\n  Mr. EXON. I cannot either. I have not cleared it on this side. But we \nhave to provide some leadership if we are going to allow any time at \nall to the whole stack of amendments that the Senator and I know are \nwaiting on each side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator asked that we contemplate it and we will \ncontemplate it.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are spending a little time, Mr. President, \nincidentally, trying to find out what the President's plan is. I saw in \nthe paper today he may have a plan. I have never heard of it until I \nread it in the Post today. I do not expect any Democrat on the \nSenator's side has seen it yet. But in any event, we are working a \nlittle bit here to see if we can find out what that might be.\n  I just would like to recap this argument and then I will yield the \ntime back to Senator Nickles after a brief discussion with him.\n  Let me talk about this earned income tax credit this way. We would \nseek to return the earned income tax credit--that is the name it is \ngiven so that is the name I will use--to its original intention. Its \noriginal intention was that it should go to families with children, so \nit was not just an earned income tax credit. It was a family earned \nincome tax credit. We return it to that: working families are entitled \nto this tax rebate in some cases or this check from the Federal \nGovernment in most cases.\n  The concept was a good one. It still is a good one. We have expanded \nit. We think it should be returned to the concept that came about when \nPresident Reagan was in office, about which I have been quoted in the \nChamber as being a strong proponent. That is for working families to \nget an incentive to work instead of quitting work.\n  Now, what will happen if the assumptions in the budget resolution are \nultimately adopted--families with one qualifying child in 1995, the \nmaximum credit amount--that is, the check they get back--$2,094. That \nis the maximum. In 2002, it will be $2,630. That is a plus change, a \npositive change of $536. The maximum income eligibility for that family \nwith one qualifying child is $24,396 now.\n  It will increase to $30,659. That is an increase in maximum income \neligibility of $6,263.\n  Now let me just move to families with two or more qualifying \nchildren, remembering we are returning it to families, as was \noriginally intended. So that single wage earners who are not earning \nsufficient money do not get a tax check back from the Government. This \nis intended for working families.\n  For working families with two or more children, the maximum credit \ntoday is $3,110. In the year 2002, the tax credit will be $3,806, an \nincrease of $696, almost $700. The maximum eligibility, Mr. President, \nhow much money you can earn--and this all has to be earned income--\n$26,673 in 1995; $33,845, for an increase of $7,172, in the year 2002.\n  Frankly, there are some who might say that is not enough. There are \nsome who would say it should be more because current law says it should \nbe more. Well, we passed a law and now we find ourselves with a new \nresponsibility and it is a very simple responsibility. And it is to \nbalance the budget of the United States. That is the responsibility.\n  If we were saying this good program should stop, we should take it \nout of the budget, cause it to cease and desist, then obviously we \nwould be saying to working families, ``We no longer want to give you an \nincentive to stay at work.'' We are not saying that. We are saying this \nis more like what we can afford. We think it is a pretty fair increase, \nnot a cut, an increase.\n  Now, just to put it in perspective that this is not just a little \nprogram that indeed we came upon and Republicans helped put it in \nplace, a President who supported it named Ronald Reagan, to say that it \nis not a significant program even after we asked for a little restraint \nin getting at a little bit or a lot of fraud--which I did not even \nmention, the Senator from Oklahoma did--this earned income tax credit \nwill be a $193 billion program for the years 1996 through 2002.\n  We will spend, in taxpayers' dollars--that is, we will collect money \nfrom taxpayers--we will give checks back to the working poor families \nin the amount of $193 billion between 1996 and 2002; hardly abolishing \na program; hardly taking away the basic concept of a program; hardly \nincreasing anybody's income taxes.\n  It is taking income taxes and saying we want to help people to the \ntune of $193 billion in checks we will give back. Those are the numbers \nwhen we are finished, I say to my friend.\n  The Senator would like it to be $230 billion.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I do not dispute the numbers, but to argue that this is \nnot a tax increase is a little bit like arguing that when Ronald Reagan \nwanted to phase in tax cuts over 3 years, if we did not phase in the \nthird 10 percent of the tax cut, that would not have resulted in higher \ntaxes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The question is, does the Senator dispute that under the \nproposal offered in the budget resolution working families will pay \nmore in taxes? Does he deny that working Americans would end up paying \nmore income tax or have less relief for Social Security taxes than \nunder the amendment that is offered by the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, if I might respond, I do not \nagree at all. We have decided in our wisdom to say we are going to give \nmoney back to certain American taxpayers. We are going to give them a \ncheck. We did not equate that with income taxes. We just had a whole \nlitany of things saying we just would like to relieve your burden.\n  You choose to call that raising the income tax. I choose to say that \nwe are [[Page S7153]] not going to give a single individual a paycheck \nfrom other taxpayers of the United States because he does not have a \nfamily. We are not going to give him a $500 check.\n  We are just saying this is for working families. It is an idea that \nwe put some flesh into the law. Now today you are saying if we are not \ngoing to give it to that single person, we are taking a paycheck away \nfrom him. But it really is not income taxes rebated to him that he \nalready paid. It is other people's income taxes that we collected and \ngive to him in a paycheck. You can call it what you like. That is my \ndescription of it as best I understand the program.\n  So we choose to do that. For those who want to spend more and give \nthat person I just described either $300 or $400 or $500, fine. We \nchoose to say the working family continues to get the money. And we \njust gave the numbers.\n  And for those who say it goes down, the number that we intend, if the \nFinance Committee passes it--and that is the irony; they may not even \npass it. The Senator is on the Finance Committee. You may choose to do \nsomething else.\n  But we were compelled in the Budget Committee to tell you how we \nmight get there, and this is one way we might get there.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. You do something else. You mean to equal the amount of \nrevenues that the Finance Committee will be asked to raise under this \nproposal. You mean to raise other kinds of taxes as opposed to raise \ntaxes on these working people. That is what you mean.\n  So, by the Senator's own admission, this is a tax increase. It is a \nrequirement of the Finance Committee to raise taxes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is not what I said. I say the \nFinance Committee has a lot of options, and they can choose to do this \nthe way it is scheduled here or they can choose to do it a different \nway. That is in their hands.\n  We show one way to get to a balance. And this is part of the one way \nto get to a balance.\n  Now, frankly, I do not believe the American people would believe that \nwhat we have talked about today means we are raising taxes. We have the \nprerogative and responsibility to change a program that is rampant with \nfraud that we find we cannot now afford, but we want to keep its basic \nconcept.\n  And for those who run to the floor on the other side, who say, \n``Well, you are cutting the millionaire's tax,'' that is not true, \neither.\n  The budget resolution before us says it is the sense of the Senate--\nit passed by every single vote of the Budget Committee except one--that \nany tax cuts, if they occur, will go 90 percent to people with $100,000 \nworth of income or less. So speaking of red herrings, that is one. That \nis all we hear.\n  Frankly, we just, every now and then, have to remind people they can \ntake the budget resolution and read it and they will find it right in \nthere. Senators Boxer and Brown were the proponents of it and it passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have some time left.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum on our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to Senator \nNickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a couple comments I want to \nclarify for my friend from New Jersey, I was hoping we could get some \ntime reduction. I understand that he was not able to get that. My guess \nis that a point of order will be made when time expires on this side.\n  A couple points on this amendment. Right now we are spending a total, \nfor the so-called earned income tax credit of $25.3 billion per year. \nUnder the budget proposal we have before us, if you add up the next 7 \nyears, that total will be $204 billion. A freeze would be $176 billion. \nSo we are spending about $30 billion more than a freeze. So the total \namount of money that we spend on this cash payment program still goes \nup. Most of the beneficiaries receive a lump sum. I am tired of hearing \npeople talk about tax cuts and tax increases. The EITC is primarily a \ncash payment, a lump-sum cash payment to a lot of individuals, and the \ncost of the program is going up every year. It goes up even under our \nproposal. I wanted to make that perfectly clear.\n  I also want to inform people that if they received an earned income \ntax credit last year of $3,110, next year they will receive, even if \nthe Finance Committee passed this as we proposed, a little more. It \nwill not continue to escalate as rapidly as it has. It cannot continue \nto escalate as rapidly as it has.\n  I might mention, if we do nothing, if we follow the guidelines of \nsome people, the status-quo type budgets as they propose, this \nentitlement program will continue to explode, and it certainly has \nexploded. We will be spending $226 billion over the next several years.\n  How can people call a program where 80 percent of the money is handed \nout in cash payments, where 99 percent of the benefits are received in \nan annual lump-sum payment, a tax cut.\n  I might mention, I am going to put in the Record a chart for the \nearned income tax credit for two or more children. I also have one for \npersons with one child. The figures I was using before were two or more \nchildren. When a lot of people find out they are eligible for this, \nthey are going to start filing. A lot of people are going to start \nworking to have their income come in right on that level.\n  You say, how can you do that? I tell you, in the private sector, I \nused to hire some people who were retired from other companies, and \nthey wanted to work just enough so they could make a little money \nbefore they started losing Social Security. So people can adjust their \nincomes; they can be paid just about that much. That happens.\n  Or they can work part time until they make this amount of money, and \nyou do not have to work 2,000 hours to receive the maximum credit. \nThere is no hour limitation. As a matter of fact, the average number of \nhours people worked in this program is 1,300. That is about 24 hours a \nweek. That is not 40 hours a week. You could actually be a lobbyist or \nsomething and work 100 hours in a year, and if you happen to make about \nthe right amount of income, you could receive a $3,100 check from Uncle \nSam.\n  We are talking about reducing the growth of these checks. We are not \neven reducing the amount, but we are saying they will not be growing as \nfast. I think that is important. Some people call that a tax increase. \nIt means we are going to write smaller checks, these checks will not be \ngrowing as fast. It is not affecting anyone's tax cuts, tax rebates, or \nanything like that. Most of these people are receiving cash payments, \nso we are trying to curtail a program that has been growing seriously \nout of control.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not quite yet. The growth in this program has been \nunsustainable. The people advocating this amendment want that growth to \ncontinue. We cannot afford it. If you are going to balance the budget, \nyou are going to curtail the growth of entitlement programs. This is an \nentitlement program. This is one of the fastest growing entitlement \nprogram.\n  I mentioned before the cost of the program totally exceeds the cost \nto Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Aid to Families with \nDependent Children in 1995 cost $18 billion. This program in 1995 cost \nus $25.3 billion. It is past AFDC big time. AFDC provides cash \npayments; this program provides cash payments. This program provides \ncash payments for a family with two children of $3,110. With one child, \nit provides for a maximum credit of $2,094. So you get an extra $1,000 \nif you have two or more children.\n  Some people who are talking about changing the welfare program say \nthey want to take some of the incentives away from having more \nchildren. This program is a big incentive for people to say, ``We want \nour income to be at this [[Page S7154]] particular level so we can get \na nice big check from Uncle Sam.''\n  I have also found that in some cases, 20, 30, maybe even 40 percent \nof the people living in a particular area could be eligible for this \ncash payment program. Then you start finding con artists who will sign \npeople up who do not pay taxes and have not filed returns in the past. \nThey will go on a recruiting trip and encourage people to have their \nincome fall into this category, file an electronic return and maybe \nsplit it with them because they weren't going to do a return in the \nfirst place.\n  There has been a lot of fraud in this program. I am quoting these \nfigures from a recent GAO report. The most recent study shows 42 \npercent of EITC recipients receive too large a credit, and 32 percent \nwere not able to show they were entitled to any credit--wow, 32 \npercent, the study showed, were not entitled to any credit. And then in \n1994, the IRS did a 2-week study on electronic returns and showed 29 \npercent received too much EITC and 13 percent----\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. And 13 percent were judged to have intentional errors. \nThat is a fraudulent program.\n  I will tell my colleagues, Senator Domenici wants to save an hour of \ntime so that we can consider more amendments. I do not blame him. He \nhas a lot of amendments pending.\n  I will tell my colleagues, I had hoped to offer a Sense-of-the-Senate \namendment in the second-degree to tell the Finance Committee, ``Reform \nthis program and in the process we think you can save some money.''\n  This happens to be a program that needs to have some waste, fraud, \nand abuse taken out of it. That was the essence of the Sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment I had intended to offer, saying to the Finance \nCommittee, ``Preserve this program in a way that you eliminate the \nwaste and the abuse and the fraud that we see now and as reported by \nthe GAO.''\n  That is what we should be doing. I think the Finance Committee can do \nit. GAO says one-third of this program is fraudulent. We did not even \ncut it that much. We maybe should have frozen the program until we \neliminated the fraud. We did not do that. We allowed the program to \ngrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The Senator said one-third fraudulent. Could the Senator \njustify that? Could he give us some documentation that says one-third \nfraud?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator hold a second?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I make a request before he answers \nthe question? How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Exon, I have discussed \nwith Senator Nickles, and the Senator from Nebraska has discussed with \nSenator Bradley an arrangement that we might make. I am shortly going \nto make a point of order, and I understand either Senator Exon or \nSenator Bradley will move to waive it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when I make the point of order and \nSenator Exon or Senator Bradley seeks to waive it, that the time be \nlimited on the motion to waive to 10 minutes a side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. There is no objection on this side, and just so I \nunderstand what the Senator is suggesting, the Senator from New Mexico \nwill move to waive, we will object to that and then we will limit \ndebate to 10 minutes on this side and 10 minutes on that side on that \nmotion to waive; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Nebraska or the Senator from New \nJersey will be making the motion to waive. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time, \nwhich is a minute and something.\n  Pursuant to the pending amendment, the pending amendment is not \ngermane to the provisions of the budget resolution. And pursuant to \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act, I raise a point of order against \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305 of that act for the \npurposes of the pending Bradley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the debate is 20 \nminutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for a rollcall vote on the motion to waive at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is pending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7137-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7154-S7198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to waive with \nrespect to the Bradley amendment be set aside after the debate and that \nthe vote occur at a time to be determined by the two leaders, which is \nthe way we have done the other ones.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield our 10 minutes to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield the 10 minutes on our side to be controlled by the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma says this is not \na tax cut that I am trying to save, but, instead, that this is a \nspending program. And he continually refers to AFDC. Then why are you \ntelling the Finance Committee to raise an additional $20 billion? In \neffect, the budget resolution tells the Finance Committee to increase \nrevenues by $20 billion--that is what this does, by $20 billion. Now, \nthe Senator thinks he will do it by increasing taxes on families with \nunder $28,000 in income. The Finance Committee might choose to do \nsomething else. But make no mistake, this results in increased taxes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Certainly, on your time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be brief. I would like to point out to my \ncolleague that I think he is totally incorrect. The revenue numbers in \nour budget are the CBO baseline revenues. We did not change revenues. \nWe did not direct the Finance Committee to change revenues. They have \nto reduce outlays. We do not raise revenues, we reduce outlays.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The effect of this will be to increase either the offset \nfor Social Security taxes or, for 48 percent of the people receiving \nthe earned income tax credit, income tax increases. That increases net \nrevenues.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the Bradley \namendment. It is amazing to me that the Budget Committee could review \nthe totality of tax expenditures, $480 billion, and yet has selected \nthe one area that is for working people, working men and women. Who are \nthe people that are going to benefit from the earned income tax credit? \nThey are the construction workers, the secretaries, the janitors, the \nhard-working backbone of this country and its economy. They have been \nsingled out.\n  The Budget Committee could have said we are going to take care of the \nbillionaires' tax loophole, that benefits people who reject their \ncitizenship in order to take their bounty and go to another country. \nBut oh, no; they didn't go after the billionaires.\n  You do not get the earned income tax credit unless you work. We are \ntrying to reward work and particularly, the work of men and women that \nhave children. They are the group of Americans that are falling \nfurthest behind over the period of the last 15 years. This is the one \nprogram that helps and assists them.\n  I do not know what it is about the Budget Committee that wants to \nsingle out working men and women who are making less than $28,000 a \nyear to raise their taxes. They are the ones who are going to be \ntargeted by this budget resolution--having their sons and daughters \nthat go to college paying more in [[Page S7155]] terms of the \nguaranteed loan programs. They are the ones whose kids are not going to \nhave the summer jobs. They are the ones who are going to find out that \nthe support and assistance for school-aged children that go to the \npublic schools have been cut, that they are not going to get the \nGovernment's help.\n  What in the world is it about the Republicans to want to put that \nkind of burden on the working families of this country? That is wrong.\n  The Bradley amendment addresses that, and it deserves our support. \nThe Budget Committee should have found, out of $480 billion, some other \nway to make up that difference without targeting the working families \nin this country.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to \nrestore a portion of the cuts to the earned income tax credit \nenvisioned by this budget.\n  This program is such a great example of the kinds of public policies \nwe should be pursuing. We have spent countless hours in this Chamber \ntrying to figure out ways to get people to work and get them off the \nwelfare rolls. That debate is sure to continue. But in the meantime, \nour Tax Code always contains the incentive for the working poor in this \ncountry to keep on working. It helps these people stay above the \npoverty line and off the welfare rolls which is just where each and \nevery one of us in this Chamber would like them to be. And as if all of \nthat were not enough, in a time when Americans demand less Government, \nthe EITC accomplishes all of this without a new Government agency, \nwithout an elaborate bureaucracy, without creating a new payroll for a \nnew program.\n  I have made it clear that I believe the Senator from New Mexico has \nengaged in a noble and honest effort in presenting the budget we have \nbefore us today. While I do not agree with all of the priorities \nrepresented by the budget before us, I very much appreciate the effort \nand admire the bottom line. Which is why I am so puzzled by the EITC \ncuts. In the quest for a leaner, more efficient Government, I believe \nthat cutting the EITC is an odd choice. The budget before us proposes \nto reduce the EITC by $13 billion by the year 2000 and by an additional \n$2 billion by the year 2002. These rollbacks in the program will come \nfrom repealing the final phase of the 1993 expansion of the EITC and \nthe repeal of the EITC for workers without children.\n  In practical terms, this rollback of the EITC will mean an increased \ntax burden of $21 billion over the next 7 years on more than 12 million \nAmerican households. In my home State of Connecticut alone, this would \nmean an average tax increase of $1,408 over 7 years on 67,660 working \nfamilies. This increased tax burden on the very sector of the \npopulation that can least afford to sustain it, the working family, \njust does not make sense. It is a policy that takes us further from, \nnot closer to, our goal of encouraging work and self-sufficiency.\n  The EITC encourages people to work toward a higher standard of \nliving. Specifically, it supplements the earnings of eligible lower- \nand moderate-income workers and families with a Federal income tax \ncredit that increases their disposable income. Families move off \nwelfare dependence to full-time work because EITC makes work pay. Thus, \nparents who work full time are not forced to raise children in poverty.\n  And I know that one of the stated purposes of these cuts is to \neliminate fraud in the EITC program. That is a noble goal but I am \nafraid, that like the news of Mark Twain's death, fraud in this program \nmay be greatly exaggerated. The President has proposed denying the EITC \ncredit to illegal aliens and I am pleased that the proposal before us \nincorporates that idea. It also makes sense to require a Social \nSecurity number in order to qualify for the credit. The IRS is making a \ngood faith effort to ensure that this\n credit is going to the people who need it the most.\n\n  I also think it is wise to adopt the President's proposal to deny the \nEITC to otherwise eligible tax filers with interest and dividend income \nexceeding $2,500. If your investments are generating that much income, \nit is hard to argue that you really need the EITC. For that reason, I \nam pleased that we moved forward with this proposal as a way to offset \npart of the cost of reinstating the self-employed health insurance \ndeduction.\n  Historically, the EITC has enjoyed bipartisan support. My colleagues \non the other side of the aisle have had many positive things to say \nabout the EITC. They have described the program as a key means of \nhelping low-income workers with dependent children get off and stay off \nwelfare and a great way to help low-income families with the cost of \nraising their children. It sends assistance to those in need; to those \nwho work hard and yet struggle to make a living and provide for their \nchildren.\n  Jack Kemp, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan have all been strong \nadvocates of the EITC. President Reagan described the EITC as ``The \nbest anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure \nto come out of the Congress.''\n  The Republicans other budget proposals regarding the EITC are \nidentical to those in the President's fiscal year 1996 budget. They \ninclude a proposal to roll back the EITC by denying the credit to \nillegal aliens, and the denial of the EITC to otherwise eligible tax \nfilers whose interest and dividend income exceeds $2,500. I strongly \nsupport these two proposals.\n  First, I agree that with the President that compliance measures must \nbe strengthened. A prerequisite to EITC eligibility should be the \npossession of a valid Social Security number. This would create a \nsimple and efficient screening process which would allow the IRS to \ndeny the credit in the absence of a valid Social Security number.\n  The Republicans second proposal to deny the EITC to eligible tax \nfilers is another Clinton administration proposal. I agree with the \nPresident's position that taxpayers with $2,500 of taxable interest and \ndividends do not need the EITC. Indeed, this proposal has already been \nincluded in H.R. 831 to offset a portion of the cost of reinstating the \nincome tax deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self \nemployed.\n  In closing I'd like to take a few moments to stress the emphasis that \nthe EITC places on work. The EITC is a work incentive and by law it is \nonly available to working families. If you are not working, you are not \neligible for the EITC. It is just that simple. Additionally, for those \nin the lowest income levels, the EITC increases with each dollar of \nearnings. Therefore, if an individual in the eligible income bracket \nworks longer hours, he will receive a larger EITC. This is tax \nfairness.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against any rollbacks in the EITC by \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the debate on this amendment is about priorities since \nthis amendment does not affect the bottom line of this budget \nresolution. The amendment leaves intact the substantial, I would say, \nhistoric, feat of balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n  This amendment says we do not want the earned income tax credit funds \ncut. The reason is that this is a program that rewards work. It is a \nlow-bureaucracy, low-overhead program. It has worked by rewarding work \nand it is a program that has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support. \nThe Democratic Leadership Council, which I am pleased to chair, has \nlong supported this program as has former Presidents Reagan and Bush as \nwell as Jack Kemp.\n  The budget before us has an impact on the program. It would reduce \ntax relief for 12 million American families by $21 billion. In my home \nState of Connecticut, this would mean a reduction in tax relief over \nthe next 7 years of $1,400 for more than 67,000 working families. As a \nmatter of priority, I do not want the bulk of these reductions.\n  Mr. President, the cost of this program has grown. But that is not \nbecause it is out of control. The cost of this program has grown \nbecause we in Congress have directed that it grow because we believe in \nthis program.\n  My friend from Oklahoma says that the EITC is costing more annually \nthan the AFDC. I say that is good [[Page S7156]] news. That means we \nare finally spending more to reward work than to reward those who do \nnot work. I hope the gap between these two programs continues to grow \nas time goes by.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note here, finally, that the \nincrease in the program in recent years is not by fraud and deviousness \nin the program, it is by congressional design and congressional intent. \nWhen the changes we made to the program in 1993 are fully phased in at \nthe end of fiscal year 1996, this program, the EITC, will actually grow \nby a very modest rate of 4.5 percent a year.\n  So as a matter of priority, as a matter of sustaining a bipartisan \nconsensus on supporting those who are poor and work and need our help \nand encouragement so they not go onto welfare, I support this \namendment.\n  Finally, I would like to quote former President Reagan who described \nthe EITC as ``the best antipoverty, the best profamily, the best job \ncreation measure to come out of the Congress.'' That is absolutely \nright. That is why I support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes remain.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the earned income credit is called the earned income \ncredit for a very specific reason. You do not get it unless you earn \nmoney. You do not get it as a gift. You get it because you work. You \nget it because you work and have earned money. You do not earn much \nmoney, but you do earn some money. And you also frequently are eligible \nfor various benefits. As you earn more money, you lose those benefits. \nAs you earn more money, you pay more Social Security.\n  What the earned income tax credit is supposed to do is to give that \nworking family that earns money some break for the Social Security and \nother taxes they pay and for the benefits that they lose as they earn \nmore money. It is a very simple concept in terms of the Social Security \ntax. It could have the same impact as a tax credit against Social \nSecurity. But we do not have a credit against Social Security taxes. \nThe earned income credit is essentially giving people who pay \nsignificant Social Security taxes some of that back. So it is clearly a \nreduction of an overall Federal tax burden,\n both income tax and Social Security tax. While people who are at \n$16,000 or $17,000 a year do not pay in a lot of income tax, they pay \nin over $2,000 in Social Security taxes. With the earned-income tax \ncredit, because they work, they get a break for those Social Security \ntaxes.\n\n  They get a refund from the Government so they pay less Social \nSecurity tax, in reality.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to try and clarify some of the \nstatements that have been made.\n  In the first place, I will repeat what I told Senator Bradley. This \nbudget resolution does not direct the Finance Committee not to raise \ntaxes. We do not have a tax increase in this budget.\n  I know many of my colleagues on the other side want to have a tax \nincrease. We do not have a tax increase. This says reduce the outlays.\n  My colleague from Connecticut said we are saving $21 billion. We \nreduced the rate of growth in this program. That is our direction or \nsuggestion to the Finance Committee to reduce the growth by $21 billion \nover 7 years. If we froze the program, we would have $50 billion in \nsavings.\n  Frankly, I think we probably should freeze it because it is so \nrampant with abuse. It is so fraudulent. There are so many people \ntaking advantage of this program. The more people find out about it the \nmore they like it, especially if they find out that their neighbor or \nsomebody else is taking advantage of it, and received a nice cash lump \nsum of $2,000 or $3,000.\n  Unfortunately, the amount of dollars are so significant more people \nwill be filing fraudulent returns. That is what the IRS has told \nCongress. The IRS has made some interesting statements. They said 13 \npercent of returns they judge to have intentional errors. In other \nwords, fraud. They said 29 percent, in a 1994 study, 29 percent \nreceived too much earned-income credit. Regarding illegal aliens, the \nIRS suspects that more than 160,000 receive earned-income credits in \n1994.\n  I am afraid we spent a lot of money for GAO to do some homework for \nCongress, and then we do not pay any attention to their work. Maybe we \nshould not in some cases. In this case, they have clearly shown this is \na fraudulent program that needs to be reformed.\n  Some of our colleagues are saying, no, no, keep the status quo, keep \ngoing as usual. So what if 30-some percent have abused the program. So \nwhat if it went from a few billion dollars a year to a $30 billion \nprogram. Allow it to continue.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we can afford to. We can achieve every \nbit of the savings, and allow the program to go by eliminating the \nfraud in this program. If we do not, we ought to be ashamed of \nourselves.\n  GAO says look at a wealth test. We enacted an EITC wealth test \nearlier this year, but its thresholds are too high. A person can have a \nlot of assets and receive a lot of income from those assets and they \ncan still qualify for the earned-income credit. For hours of work, \nthere is no minimum. People can work 100 hours and qualify for $3,000 \nbenefit in this program. People do not have to work 2,000 hours. The \naverage recipient last year worked, I think, 1,300 hours. Some people \ncould work 100 hours and still receive it.\n  This program is set up for abuse. The GAO has done a pretty \nsignificant study. This is recent study, in March 1995. I encourage my \ncolleagues to look at it. It is available. We paid for it. We should \nlook at that information.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side supported this massive \nincrease in 1993, and they are very proud of it. They have gone back \nand quoted Ronald Reagan who stated it was a good thing. However, the \ntotal cost of this program in 1980 was $2 billion; in 1986 it was still \n$2 billion.\n  This program did not grow very fast, initially. By 1988 it grew to \n$5.9 billion. Then its cost really exploded. I heard a couple of my \ncolleagues say it is primarily for families, but in 1993 their tax bill \nopened the program up to people who do not have children.\n  Originally, as conceived by Senator Russell Long and others, the EITC \nwas for families. Senator Long has written an op-ed piece saying he \nsupported the earned-income program, but he said Congress went too far \nin 1993 when they expanded this program to apply to people without \nchildren. Originally, people had to have one or two kids to qualify for \nthe program. Now you do not. Again, we make a lot more people eligible \nand we increase the amount of money they are eligible for.\n  In 1990, the maximum amount anybody could receive out of this program \nwas $953. In 1995, the maximum that someone can receive with two kids \nis $3,110. In the year 2000, that maximum amount under current law will \nbe $4,068. We have millions of people that are eligible. So we are \nsaying, no, we do not think we can afford that. So we allow the maximum \nto increase every year but at much smaller levels. So we say by the \nyear 2000 the maximum amount that someone could receive with two or \nmore children would be $3,560, over $450 more than what they are \nreceiving today, but not going all the way to $4,068.\n  Granted, the EITC is not growing as fast under our proposal. It \nshould not because the program is so rampant with fraud and abuse. It \nis growing too fast. We need to curtail it. We need to have some \ncontainment on entitlement programs or we will never, ever, get to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Then, Mr. President, I want to mention one other thing. That is the \nway our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to pay for this. \nThey will take it from the so-called reserve fund that we are setting \naside, if we balance the budget, to give back to the American taxpayer.\n  This is about the third or the fourth amendment, and I am sure we \nwill receive more, where our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare saying how they want to spend the so-called economic dividend. They \nwant to spend it before we get there. That is, in a nutshell, the \nreason why the Democrats have never had balanced budgets. They want to \nspend it before we get it. They want to spend more than we take in. \nThey are more popular spending money than taking it away.\n  When we call this program an earned-income tax credit, it makes \npeople [[Page S7157]] think we are reducing taxes. We are not. This \nprogram is a negative income tax. We ought it call it what it is. It is \na negative income tax.\n  George McGovern campaigned on a negative income tax in 1972, and now \nwe have it in law. Perhaps it has maybe a better title, but for 80 \npercent of the people, it is a lump sum negative income tax. It is a \ncash payment. It is a cash payment that is growing a lot faster than \nAFDC.\n  We should be discussing this when we get into welfare reform. I am \nall for trying to create incentives to get people to work, but this is \na lump sum payment that discourages work. There are a lot of people \nthat might work just enough to maximize this payment, by either \nreporting income, or not reporting income.\n  We had some people on this case that might report income they did not \nreceive so they could get into this level, and others might not report \nincome that they received, cash or otherwise, so they could stay at \nthis level.\n  I do not even want to get into the confusing stuff about the marginal \ntax rates this program creates, but we find people in the phase-out \nside of this program that will end up paying 80 percent or 90 percent \nof their additional, marginal income in taxes. Think about that. I do \nnot want to get too confusing with facts, but they can have the highest \nmarginal tax rate of anybody in America. And that is not fair, either.\n  That is a real disincentive to earn more income. I do not think we \nshould have that.\n  The direction of the Finance Committee and the direction of this \nbudget is to limit the growth of this program. It is growing too fast. \nIt is out of control.\n  GAO says--not just Don Nickles and Bill Roth who had a hearing on \nthis in the Governmental Affairs Committee--that the cost of this \nprogram is exploding. I compliment Senator Roth for his efforts. We \nneed to respond. The Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee \nneeds to respond. We need to get this program under control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute \nremaining, and 1 minute is remaining on the other side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the 1 remaining minute.\n  Mr. President, let the Senate think about who we are talking about \nhere. We are talking about Americans who are working. If they are \nmaking the minimum wage and if they are getting food stamps, and they \nare getting EITC, they are still below the poverty line. Still below \nthe poverty line.\n  Now, that is what the issue is. Four trillion dollars in tax benefits \nor tax expenditures over the length of this measure, $4 trillion, will \nbe accumulated. But the only place that the Republicans could find a \nplace to collect money was $20 billion from these working families. If \nthey are working full time for minimum wage, are getting food stamps, \ngetting the EITC, these people still do not have enough, to bring up a \nfamily. And still they are trying to take that benefit away. It is \nwrong.\n  I hope the Bradley amendment will be successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute.\n  Mr. EXON. If I understand it correctly, we have finished debate and \nunder the previous agreement we will have the vote on this at some \nsucceeding time, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 remaining \nminute.\n  Mr. EXON. I thought the Senator has yielded back. He has not yielded \nback? I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. We have one minute \nremaining and we will be voting at a time designated by the two \nleaders.\n  It is vitally important we pass the budget. We have a chance for the \nfirst time in history to pass a budget that is going to call for a \nbalanced budget. Many of us thought we should do that whether we passed \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget or not. It is not \npossible to pass a balanced budget unless we curtail the growth of \nexpensive programs. This program has been growing out of control. This \nprogram cost a few billion dollars a few years ago. It cost $25 billion \nthis year. It will be costing $36 billion by the year 2002. We cannot \ncontinue that rate of growth. We have to slow it down.\n  Under this proposal it continues to grow about $1 billion a year, not \nas rapidly as proposed under current law. We cannot sustain current law \ngrowth. We cannot sustain 55 percent growth per year, so this is an \neffort to curtail it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, has all time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on both sides.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield a maximum of 45 \nminutes to my great friend and colleague, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, off the minority side's time allotted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, the ranking manager of the bill.\n  Mr. President, both Houses of Congress waited for weeks beyond the \ntime when budget resolutions are normally brought before the House and \nSenate. In fact, as Senators are aware, section 301(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act requires that on or before April 15 of each \nyear the Congress shall complete action on a concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of such year. \nNevertheless, Congress has often missed this deadline, so the lateness \nof this particular budget resolution is not extraordinary.\n  It is particularly understandable that this year's budget resolution \nwould be late, in light of the fact that it contains more deficit \nreduction than has ever been proposed in any budget resolution. I \nbelieve the figure is nearly $1 trillion in deficit reduction that \nwould purportedly be achieved over the next 7 years if this budget \nresolution is agreed to, and if all of its reconciliation instructions \nwere enacted into law. That is what the Congressional Budget Office's \ncurrent projections show.\n  At the end of that 7 years, according to table 1 on page 6 of the \nBudget Committee's report, under this budget resolution we will have \nachieved a budget surplus of $1.3 billion. Apparently that surplus \noccurs only under a unified budget. For those who are not intimately \nfamiliar with budget terminology, a unified budget is one that allows \nthe use of trust fund surpluses to mask the true size of the deficit.\n  For this particular budget resolution, the use of such trust fund \nsurpluses, and particularly the Social Security surplus, is necessary \nto achieve the $1.3 billion surplus in the year 2002. If one turns back \none page in the Budget Committee's report to page 5, one will find \nanother table. This table, table 1, sets forth the projected deficits \nrecommended by the Budget Committee through the year 2002 without using \nthe trust fund surpluses. This table shows that even if we adopt this \nbudget resolution lock, stock, and barrel, we will still have a \ndeficit--according to the Budget Committee--of $113.5 billion in 2002. \nIn other words, if we do not apply the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus against the deficit, the budget will not balance in the year \n2002 under this budget resolution. Instead, there will be a deficit of \n$113.5 billion.\n  Having said that, I am quick to acknowledge the tremendously \ndifficult work that has been done by the able chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Mr. Domenici. He has spent months on this budget resolution \nand, having worked closely with him on appropriation and budget matters \nfor many years, I know that he is thoroughly familiar with virtually \nevery item in this budget resolution. I would expect no less from this \nvery able and distinguished Senator. It cannot have been easy to \nrecommend the difficult choices that were necessary to achieve $1 \ntrillion in deficit reduction without including any additional revenues \nand without cutting military spending. I would note, however, that the \ntask would have been even more difficult had not the 1993 \nReconciliation Act [[Page S7158]] been enacted. So let us not lose \nsight of that fact. That measure, at the time of its passage, was \nestimated to cut the deficit by $433 billion below the CBO baseline \nover 5 years.\n  President Clinton deserves a great deal of credit for having proposed \na major deficit reduction package shortly after he assumed office in \n1993. Subsequently, Congress enacted the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of \n1993, which resulted in reducing 5-year deficit projections by $433 \nbillion. Not one Republican, not one in either House, voted for the \npackage, but, as I said, the Budget Committee has benefited from that \n1993 deficit reduction package. Without that package that we enacted in \n1993, the committee would have had to come up with another $433 billion \nin deficit reduction in this resolution in order to reach their target \nin 2002.\n  Mr. President, despite the rhetoric to the contrary--let me say this. \nI hope all Senators will hear it. Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, \nthis is not the first budget resolution that has projected a balanced \nbudget. I hear many Senators say, ``For the first time we have a budget \nresolution here that projects a balanced budget.''\n  That ain't so. This is not the first budget resolution that has \nprojected a balanced budget. In fact, it is not even the second, or \nthird budget resolution that has done so. That this is so is supported \nby the Budget Committee's report accompanying this year's resolution. \nIn Mr. Exon's minority views, on page 314, the following statement is \nmade:\n\n       Contrary to Republican statements, this is not the first \n     budget resolution to achieve balance. It is the fifth in \n     line. The 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1991 budget resolutions were \n     in balance. In the 1991 budget, Democrats did not use the \n     Social Security trust fund surplus to reach balance. This all \n     goes to demonstrate that the universe covered by a budget \n     resolution can change in the course of the years.\n\n  That is the language, that is the committee report, and I quoted from \nMr. Exon's statement there.\n  So, there have been four other occasions when budget resolutions have \nprojected a balanced budget. We have done this before. This is not the \nfirst time. In fact, I recall that President Carter's fiscal year 1981 \nbudget contained a deficit of something like $15.9 billion. We in the \nSenate found that to be intolerable, and as majority leader at that \ntime, I convened a session at which the chairman and ranking members of \nthe Budget, Appropriations, and other relevant committees sat down for \nseveral days including an entire weekend to come up with the necessary \nchanges to balance President Carter's 1981 budget. We accomplished our \npurpose and the fiscal year 1981 budget resolution, therefore, showed a \nbalanced budget. but, as with all other budget resolutions, including \nthis one, as we shall see, changes in economic and technical forecasts \ncaused the actual 1981 budget to be out of balance. The latest such \nbudget resolution prior to the pending one was that for fiscal year \n1991. Some Senators will recall that the\n 1991 budget resolution was adopted subsequent to the 1990 Budget \nSummit. That Budget Summit was requested by President Bush in May of \n1990. I participated in it, as did a number of other Senators, \nincluding Mr. Dole, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Gramm, to name a few--Mr. \nHatfield and Mr. Bentsen, who was a Senator at that time. From the \nHouse side, the summit participants included Mr. Gephardt and Mr. \nGingrich, among a number of others.\n\n  We spent literally weeks and weeks and weeks, and even months \nnegotiating a bipartisan deficit reduction package which, it was agreed \nby all, should be no greater than $500 billion over five years. The \nfear was that anything over $500 billion would throw the economy into \nrecession. We had the best Democratic and Republican brains in the \nNation sitting around that summit table at Andrews Air Force Base. In \naddition to Members of Congress and their staffs, we had the benefit of \nthe wisdom of Mr. Richard Darman, President Bush's OMB Director; Mr. \nJohn Sununu, the President's Chief of Staff; and even the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Mr. Nicholas Brady. Also present was the CBO Director, \nDr. Robert Reischauer, and several of his key staff. I should mention \nthat Leon Panetta was there. As anyone can see, we did not suffer from \na lack of expertise at the 1990 bipartisan Budget Summit. Well, after \nall those months of intense negotiations, which often ran into the \nnight and included Saturdays and Sundays, we finally reached an \nagreement.\n  That agreement cut the projected 5-year deficits for fiscal years \n1991-95 by $500 billion. When first presented to the House, in the form \nof a budget resolution, the summit agreement was voted down. After some \nmodifications were made, however, a budget resolution was agreed to by \nthe House on October 8, 1990, and by the Senate the next day.\n  I have here the fiscal year 1991 budget resolution conference report. \nIt is numbered report 101-820, and was submitted by Mr. Panetta, who \nwas the House Budget Committee chairman at the time. On page 2 of this \n1991 budget resolution conference report, we see a heading entitled \n``Recommended Levels and Amounts.'' Under that heading in section \n3(a)(4), one will find the on-budget deficits for fiscal years 1991-94 \nand an on-budget surplus for fiscal year 1995.\n  Specifically, the conference report itself reads as follows:\n\n       Sec. 3. (a)(4)(A) The amounts of the deficits are as \n     follows: Fiscal year 1991: $143,700,000,000. Fiscal year \n     1992: $100,900,000,000. Fiscal year 1993: $62,000,000,000. \n     Fiscal year 1994: $14,700,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of the surplus is as follows: Fiscal year \n     1995: $20,500,000,000.\n\n  So there you have it. The budget resolution for fiscal year 1991, \nwhich incorporated the budget cuts agreed to at the 1990 Budget Summit, \nshowed an on-budget surplus of $20.5 billion in the fifth year; namely, \nfiscal year 1995. That surplus was to be achieved under that budget \nresolution without using the Social Security surplus. In fact, if one \nturns to page 21 of the 1991 budget resolution conference report, there \none will find a table which, among other things, shows that if the \nSocial Security and other trust fund surpluses are used to reduce the \ndeficits, then there were supposed to be surpluses, not deficits, for \nfiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995. In fact, the surpluses were to be: \nfor fiscal year 1993, $44.8 billion; for fiscal year 1994, $108.5 \nbillion; and for fiscal year 1995, $156.2 billion.\n  My purpose, Madam President, in raising these matters is to put to \nrest the misconception that somehow the Republican leadership in the \nCongress has come up with the first budget resolution ever that \nprojects balance; and the further misconception that past Congresses \nfailed to bite the bullet and make the tough choices to balance the \nbudget. The fact is that we thought we had enacted the necessary \nspending restraints in 1990, on a bipartisan basis, to achieve a \nbalanced budget by 1995. The experts told us we had done so. But, as is \nthe case now, and, as I have said many times, there is no earthly way \nthat any human being can accurately predict what the deficit will be 5 \nyears from now.\n  We all know what happened to those 1991 budget resolution \nprojections. They went south. No sooner was the ink dry on the Summit \nAgreement, and its accompanying reconciliation act, than CBO changed \nits projections.\n  I have here a CBO document entitled ``CBO Papers--The 1990 Agreement: \nAn Interim Assessment'' dated December 1990. On page 8, this paper lays \nout major changes in the 1991-95 deficit calculations upon which the \nCongress and President Bush had just depended when they enacted the \nprovisions of the Summit Agreement, which was supposed to achieve a \nbudget surplus by fiscal year 1995. Here is what CBO had to say about \ntheir changed projections, only 1 month after enactment of the Summit \nAgreement:\n\n       The October interim economic assumptions increase the \n     projected deficit by $41 billion in 1991 and by about $60 \n     billion per year thereafter, compared with CBO's summer \n     baseline. The October forecast reflects significant signs of \n     weakness that appeared in the economy after CBO completed its \n     summer forecast in June. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in \n     early August has caused a sharp increase in oil prices, which \n     has boosted inflation. In addition, the revision of the \n     national income and product accounts for the past three years \n     suggests that the economy's potential rate of growth is lower \n     than previously thought.\n       Taken together, these economic developments reduce \n     projected revenues by about $30 billion per year. Higher \n     inflation increases cost-of-living adjustments for Social \n     Security and other benefit programs, as well as discretionary \n     inflation adjustments for defense and non-defense \n     appropriations. Higher unemployment raises spending for \n     unemployment compensation and for income-assistance programs. \n     Finally, lower revenues and higher spending increase federal \n     borrowing requirements and debt service [[Page S7159]] costs, \n     by amounts growing from $2 billion in 1991 to $17 billion in \n     1995.\n       During the final months of fiscal year 1990, the Resolution \n     Trust Corporation (RTC)--the agency charged with resolving \n     insolvent savings and loan associations--spent $10 billion \n     more than CBO projected in July. This surge in spending \n     suggests that the RTC is resolving cases more quickly and \n     needs more working capital than previously thought. As a \n     result, CBO has increased its estimates of deposit insurance \n     spending in 1991 and 1992. Together with the resulting \n     increase in debt service costs, deposit insurance reestimates \n     increase the projected deficit by $16 billion in 1991 and $42 \n     billion in 1992, have little effect in 1993, and reduce the \n     deficit somewhat thereafter.\n\n  So, Madam President, it became obvious, rather quickly then, that \nbudget balance would not be achieved without further major deficit \nreduction packages. President Bush chose not to undertake further \nbudget summits, nor to propose further deficit reduction for fiscal \nyears 1992 or 1993.\n  It was left up to President Clinton to propose further deficit \nreduction. He rose to the challenge in his ``Vision For America,'' \nwhich was submitted to Congress on February 17, 1993. President Clinton \nlaid out a blueprint for improving the lives of Americans and for \nreducing the Federal deficit, while at the same time, addressing the \nNation's investment deficit in both human and physical infrastructure. \nThe 1993 Omnibus Reconciliation Act was subsequently enacted and \nresulted in $433 billion in deficit reduction--and it had to be done \nwithout a single Republican vote.\n  That brings me to the pending budget resolution, which, as I stated \nat the beginning of my remarks, calls for some very difficult budget \ncuts which, according to OMB, will total $961 billion below a baseline \nwhich already assumes a non-defense discretionary freeze for the next 7 \nyears. From this baseline, this budget resolution would cut: $256 \nbillion from Medicare; $175 billion from Medicaid; $209 billion from \nother entitlements; $190 billion from nondefense discretionary spending \n(as measured from a 1995 freeze extended through 2002; defense is \nincreased by $25 billion); and $155 billion from reduced debt service.\n  For nondefense discretionary spending, this budget resolution would \ncut $190 billion below a 1995 freeze; the equivalent of a $300 billion \ncut below the levels in the President's budget. By the year 2002, \nnondefense discretionary spending will be cut by nearly one-third, \ndeclining to 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product, and that would \nbe a record low.\n  For military spending, on the other hand, this budget resolution \nproposes no cuts to the President's budget, as opposed to its proposed \n$300 billion in cuts below the President's nondefense budgets, over the \nnext 7 years. That is preposterous. If we accept this budget \nresolution, we will cut by one-third--provided the instructions are \ncarried through--we will cut by one-third that portion of the budget \nwhich funds education, the National Institutes of Health, environmental \ncleanup, health and safety programs to ensure the safety of food and \nwater for our citizens, research and development, School-To-Work and \nother job training programs, NASA, aviation safety (including air \ntraffic control), civilian and military retirement, agriculture, \nhighway and bridge construction and maintenance, transit assistance, \nthe Small Business Administration, the judiciary and the courts, \nnuclear waste cleanup, our national parks, law enforcement, and the \noperating costs of every department and agency of the Federal \nGovernment.\n   These and all other nondefense programs--all other nonmilitary \nprograms--will suffer devastating cuts over the next 7 years.\n  But not the military; not the military. No cuts are proposed for the \nmilitary over the next 7 years.\n  Does anyone believe that the military budget cannot be cut? Does \nanyone believe that the military budget ought not be cut? Does anyone \nbelieve that there are not items in that military budget that can be \ncut, ought to be cut, and still maintain the kind of security for our \ncountry that we expect?\n  Well, apparently some of our friends on the other side of the aisle \ndo believe that. Not only that, this budget resolution will reestablish \na wall so that military spending will have its own separate caps for \nthe next 7 years. This will prohibit Congress from cutting military \nspending and using those cuts to ease the pain on nonmilitary spending. \nThis means that we will limit our ability to set priorities by removing \nfrom the budget-cutting pot the entire military budget. It is off \nlimits.\n  Furthermore, this budget resolution will eliminate the hold-harmless \nprovisions of the Budget Enforcement Act for discretionary spending. \nThis means that discretionary caps will no longer be adjusted for \neconomic and technical miscalculations which are beyond the control of \nCongress.\n  I fought for that in connection with the 1990 summit and the budget \nresolution that flowed therefrom. I fought for that. I sat right down \nin my office and discussed that with Mr. Darman. I said, ``There's no \ngive on that. Nondefense discretionary has got to be held harmless.'' \nAnd we were, and we have been held harmless since. But that is out now \nwith this budget resolution.\n  Finally, this budget resolution will create a new requirement that, \nin order to not be charged against discretionary spending, emergencies \nwill have to achieve a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.\n  So if we have a disaster in Texas, get ready to produce 60 votes, or \nelse it will be charged against discretionary spending. And where do we \nhave the money? Discretionary spending is on the block. The ax is going \nto fall, as it has fallen time and time again in recent years.\n  It is clear that nondefense discretionary spending will suffer the \ngreatest harm of any area of the Federal budget under this budget \nresolution. And the American people will not have to wait for \nreconciliation to feel the effects of the nondefense, nonmilitary, \ndiscretionary cuts. Those cuts will be coming to the House and Senate \nfloors very soon after the adoption of the budget resolution conference \nagreement. Each of the 11 nondefense discretionary appropriation bills \nwill contain a large dose of reality as to what is being asked of the \nAmerican people in the way of cutbacks in government services. And \nthese cuts will keep coming each and every year for the next 7 years. \nThere will be no relief. If the caps are exceeded, then automatic cuts, \nor sequesters, will occur to bring nonmilitary spending back within \neach year's cap on both budget authority and outlays. Rest assured, if \nthis budget resolution is agreed to, and I have no doubts that it will \nbe agreed to, these cuts will occur. We will no longer have to \nspeculate about the pain that will occur. It will have arrived.\n  For the entitlement portion of the budget, this budget resolution \nalso calls for tough medicine. As the debate has already brought out, \ncuts of $256 billion for Medicare; $175 billion for Medicaid; and $209 \nbillion from other entitlements will be very harsh upon those in our \nsociety who, in many cases, are the least\n able to afford to pay more for their benefits. The changes called for \nin the budget resolution for entitlements will be taken up later this \nyear in a massive reconciliation bill. Only if enacted by Congress and \nsigned into law by the President, will these entitlement cuts take \nplace.\n\n  So there will be another day to make that decision.\n  Page 5 of the committee report, Madam President, contains this \nstatement:\n\n       The committee's recommendations are real, enforceable, and \n     achieve the fiscal policy goal of a comprehensive, unified \n     balanced budget in 2002.\n\n  I ask Senators where is the enforcement on entitlement spending in \nthis resolution? Let me read again page 5 of the committee report. I \nquote:\n\n       The committee's recommendations are real, enforceable, and \n     achieve the fiscal policy goal of a comprehensive, unified \n     balanced budget in 2002.\n\n  I ask the committee, where is the enforcement on entitlements? The \ncommittee report says these are enforceable. Where? Where is the \nenforcement on entitlement spending in this resolution? I have asked my \nstaff to find that. My staff has searched in vain to find caps on \nentitlements and sequesters to enforce the caps. There are no such \nprovisions. Despite the committee's claim, there is no enforcement on \nentitlement spending for the next 7 years. Yet, as any knowledgeable \nobserver knows, entitlements are where the growth in Federal spending \nis occurring. The cuts in discretionary spending will occur--you can \nbet--they will occur because there are caps every [[Page S7160]] year \nand automatic, across-the-board cuts discretionary spending within \nthose caps.\n  Yes, they are enforceable, those cuts in nonmilitary discretionary \nspending. Cuts in nonmilitary discretionary spending will occur because \nthere are caps every year and automatic, across-the-board cuts to keep \nthe nonmilitary discretionary spending within those caps. Yet, for \nentitlements, this resolution contains no caps and no other enforcement \nmechanisms.\n  Similarly, for revenues, there is nothing in this resolution to \nensure that each year's revenue projection will be achieved. What if we \nhave a recession? What if we have a recession, as we probably will? How \nwill the shortfall be accounted for?\n  The only way in this resolution is by increasing the deficit.\n  For entitlement spending and revenues, this budget resolution is no \ndifferent--no different--from any of the other budget resolutions in \nthe past. In fact, the proposed balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution suffers from the same flaw. We pointed that out time and \ntime again in the debate. That amendment suffered from that flaw. Human \nbeings simply cannot accurately forecast budgets 7 years, or 5 years or \n4 years or 3 years or 2 years, or even 1 year in advance. This budget \nresolution is no different from the budget resolution for fiscal year \n1991 which, as I have already pointed out, was not worth the paper it \nwas written on. When all is said and done, it was not worth the paper \nit was written on. It took CBO just 1 month--1 month--to change the \nrevenues downward and the entitlements upward. The pending resolution \nwill not improve the negative effects of those misestimates for \nrevenues and entitlements at all.\n  This brings me to a final area of the pending resolution, which is \ndisturbing to me, perhaps as much as any of the other matters I have \nraised, if not more. That is the portion of this budget resolution \nwhich states that after enactment of reconciliation, the Congressional \nBudget Office will provide the Senate with a revised estimate of the \ndeficit for the years 1996 through 2005, and if there is any additional \ndeficit reduction, the ``surplus'' can be used for a cut in revenues. \nThe resolution would not allow the surplus to be explicitly used for \nadditional deficit reduction or to lessen the impact of proposed \nMedicare or Medicaid cuts.\n  CBO has already indicated that if the deficit is eliminated by the \nyear 2002, there will be a ``bonus surplus'' gained from a reduction in \ninterest rates and an improvement of one-tenth of a percentage point in \nthe growth rate. The mark requires the fiscal dividend to be limited to \nthe amount CBO certifies is the additional deficit reduction that \nresults from the enactment of reconciliation legislation based upon the \nRepublican mark.\n  Madam President, first of all, I do not believe there will be any \nwindfall if this budget resolution is agreed to and if its accompanying \nreconciliation measure is signed into law. This budget resolution \nassumes there will be no recessions over the next 7 years. Furthermore, \nany objective review of the past history of CBO's 5-year deficit \nprojections would lead one to find highly suspect the 7-year \nprojections contained in the pending resolution. I do not believe the \nchances are any better than 1 in 1,000 that, if we accept this budget \nresolution to carry out its entire contents without change, we will \nachieve a balanced budget in 2002.\n  Regarding the tax cut provided in this resolution, I am frankly \namazed. For all the talk--all the talk--about balancing the budget and \nall the mighty effort expended, we turn right around again in the same \nbudget balancing document and spend $170 billion that we do not have \nand will, in all likelihood, never have on a tax cut. It is folly. Here \nwe go again. Like the old song says: ``Livin' on money that we ain't \nmade yet.''\n  ``Livin' on money that we ain't made yet.'' That money is not going \nto be there when the day rolls around.\n  In case I am wrong, I do not support the use of any resulting \nwindfall for tax cuts. And I do not care who recommends the tax cuts. \nIt can be President Clinton, if he wants to. I am not going down that \nroad with him. I do not think he should have gone down that road. I do \nnot think anybody ought to be recommending tax cuts at this time. I am \nnot supporting Mr. Clinton and I am not supporting the Republicans on \nany tax cuts.\n  If there are any windfalls, we should apply them toward the deficit \nrather than give them away in tax cuts. That is what we wanted to do. \nWe want to balance the budget. It is the height of ridiculosity to \npropose tax cuts for the wealthy which total over $350 billion over the \nnext 7 years, while at the same time we are devastating domestic \ndiscretionary programs that are investments in the Nation's future and \nin the people's future.\n  I believe that the other side of the aisle would do well to tone down \nthe partisan rhetoric and the blame game. Democrats did not put us in \nthis downward spiral. We all had a hand in it. We had a Democratic \nHouse, but we had a Republican President and we had a Republican \nSenate. Democrats have done their best to lead the efforts to eliminate \nthe Federal deficit in the past. We recognize it has to be done. We did \nnot ignore the problem in the past. We did not ignore it in 1993, and \nwe stand ready to do our part again to do what is necessary to achieve \nbudget balance. But it is obvious that we cannot do this if all we are \ninterested in is partisanship.\n Virtually every substantive amendment that was offered by Democrats in \nthe Budget Committee markup was rejected on a party line vote. Here on \nthe Senate floor, the same partisan approach has been used by the \nRepublican majority.\n\n  I, therefore, do not kid myself by holding out any hope that there \nwill be any attention paid by the Republican side to the suggestions or \nproposals made by this side of the aisle. That is unfortunate. We are \nall here to do our solemn duty in, once again, making tough choices \nwhich affect the lives of virtually every American in order to balance \nthe budget. None of us shy away from that duty. But, I submit that the \nSenate and the American people would be far better served if, at some \npoint during this year's budget and reconciliation battles, we put \naside partisan and Presidential politics, and vote for the best \npossible legislation in all instances--no matter whose idea it may be.\n  I close by congratulating again, Mr. Domenici, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He is an extremely capable and bright and dedicated \nSenator, and he has demonstrated a great deal of courage in bringing \nthis resolution forward.\n  But I like to look at history in a situation like this, just as in \nmany other situations. I have related some recent history to show that \nbudget resolutions have a way of being overly optimistic and that there \nare conditions that occur in the economy which, in the final analysis, \nresult in changing the expected and hoped-for outcomes of the budget \nresolutions.\n  I also compliment Senator Exon, who has done a fine job, a dedicated \njob on the Budget Committee. It is not easy. And all of the members on \nthat committee are to be complimented. I am not on the committee, and I \ndo not envy those who have worked so hard. They have spent hours and \ndays and weeks, and they have done their best. I know they have done \ntheir best.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico has done his best. He believes in \nthis product. But he has no control over the future. Nobody has any \ncontrol over tomorrow. ``Boast not thyself of tomorrow, for thou \nknowest not what a day may bring forth.'' Recessions can occur, \nmilitary conflicts may arise. There are things we cannot foresee. We \ncannot foresee what inflation will be, what the unemployment rate will \nbe, what the gross domestic product will be, what interest rates will \nbe.\n  In closing, I compliment the managers and I hope that what I had to \nsay today will be of some benefit and that it will at least cause us to \nlook back over the road we have traveled in the past and possibly to \ntemper what we may have to say with regard to the future's optimist \nprojections.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back my 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute off my side. \nBefore he leaves the floor, I thank Senator Byrd very much for his \nremarks. [[Page S7161]] I know we do not agree on the details, but I \nthank him very much for the way in which he described the Budget \nCommittee, as hard-working people. It is very hard to get people \ntogether on such diverse issues. I compliment Senator Exon for his hard \nwork. Again, I thank Senator Byrd for his remarks.\n  There is no question that if we could predict with specificity \nexactly what will happen 3 years, 7 years, 20 years\n from now, we would be greater than the Roman Senate. But in any event, \nwe cannot do that. I understand we are doing our very best. But I think \nthe assumptions and expectations of this budget are realistically \nconservative in terms of economics and the like, even more so than the \nPresident's budget, which did not do much to the deficit but had less \nconservative estimates in the next 4 years. I thank him for his \nremarks.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, let me take a moment and thank my friend \nand colleague, the chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, with \nwhom I have worked for a long, long time. I have saluted him during \nthis debate before and I do so again now.\n  I also want to take a moment to compliment my very dear friend, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, for his outstandingly considerate \nand thoughtful remarks. I just hope that the Senate will be wise enough \nto recognize and realize that someone with the wisdom, dedication and \nthe evenhandedness that has been part and parcel of Senator Byrd's \nlengthy and very distinguished career would give us pause for \nconsideration. I think sometimes we get carried away, and I can think \nback and make talks on several measures that have been introduced in \nthe U.S. Senate to solve the deficit problem. I voted against most of \nthem because I did not think they held water.\n  I simply say that there are many concerns that we have on both sides \nof the aisle. Some of the sharp debate we have had on this measure is a \nvery legitimate process of the consideration--the debate and \ndeliberations that the U.S. Senate has been known for a long time.\n  As a personal aside, let me say that I have often said with my \nexperience in politics, the great reward has been the people that I \nhave met and have been associated with that would have never come my \nway had I not been chosen by the great people of the State of Nebraska \nto represent them as Governor and then as a U.S. Senator. One of the \nfinest things that has happened to this Senator, with all of the \noutstanding people that I have met and been associated with and worked \nwith, Senator Byrd has always been a pillar of what I think a U.S. \nSenator should be all about. And I think the remarks that he just gave \ndemonstrate better than I could have said it how important he has been \nand remains as a Member of this body. I thank my friend from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank both managers of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Gramm of Texas is going to offer an amendment. \nTechnically, under the rules, I am supposed to manage the opposition. \nBut I choose today to designate, if he will assume the responsibility, \nSenator Exon as the manager in opposition to the Republican amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate those remarks by Senator Domenici. We are \nprepared to cooperate as he has outlined. If I understand it correctly, \nwe are now moving back and forth, and we are now prepared to listen to \nthe beginning of the debate on what I understand is called the Gramm \namendment. We are prepared for that if the Chair is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nTexas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1123\n\n(Purpose: Setting forth the congressional budget for the United States \nGovernment for the fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and \n                                 2002)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself, Mr. Coats, \n     Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n     Helms, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n     McCain and Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 1123.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent further reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have offered an amendment which will \nreduce government spending from the level recommended in the Senate \nbudget, that will include the heart of the tax cuts contained in the \nContract With America, and that will, for all practical purposes, bring \nthe budget which is now under consideration in the Senate into line \nwith the budget that has already been adopted in the House.\n  In short, if the amendment that I have offered is adopted, we can \nvirtually guarantee that the tax cuts which Republicans across the land \ncommitted to in the 1994 elections will become the law of the land.\n  I would like to outline what this debate is about. I would like to \ntalk about the amendment. I would like to outline what the amendment \ndoes, and then I would like to talk about the issue that we are going \nto decide when we cast a vote on this amendment.\n  In September of last year on the north plaza of the Capitol Building, \nRepublican candidates for the U.S. Senate, in fact, every Republican \nchallenger in the country that was running in an open seat or against a \nDemocratic incumbent except one who could not be there on that \noccasion, gathered to issue to America, a statement that we called ``7 \nmore in '94.''\n  I want to read the opening part of that statement, and then I want to \nrefer to a couple of things in it. We said, ``We pledge to the American \npeople that if they empower us as a majority in the U.S. Senate on \nNovember 8, 1994, we will dedicate ourselves to the adoption of these \nlegislative priorities.'' Among those priorities, we had a tax \nexemption for children, we had the reestablishment of individual \nretirement accounts for families, we had the reduction of the capital \ngains tax rate, and the indexing of capital gains, and we pledged to \nrepeal the earnings test under Social Security.\n  One week later, as everyone in America now knows, Republican \ncandidates for the House of Representatives gathered on the west front \nof the Capitol and presented their Contract With America which outlined \ntwo goals as it related to the budget.\n  One goal was to balance the Federal budget, a commitment we also had \nmade 1 week earlier on the northern approach to the Capitol; and also \nthey outlined a comprehensive program to cut taxes, to let families \nkeep more of what they earn, to provide incentives for people to work \nand to save and to invest.\n  That was in September 1994. We all know that the American people on \nNovember 8 changed American Government in the most sweeping \ncongressional election since 1932. We won a majority in both Houses of \nCongress. The House of Representatives, good to its word, not only made \npromises in the campaign but they fulfilled each and every one of those \npromises. They adopted a budget last week that balanced the Federal \nbudget over a 7-year period and that mandated tax cuts as they had \noutlined in the Contract With America.\n  Now, that brings the Senate to this point in the debate. Where we are \ntoday is that we have a budget before the Senate that fulfills half the \nfiscal commitments we made that September day. We have before the \nSenate a budget that over a 7-year-period limits the growth of \nGovernment spending to 3.3 percent a year, down from an average of \nabout 5.5 percent a year growth over the previous 5 years, down from \nabout 7.5 percent growth in Government spending since 1950.\n  As a result of constraining the growth in Government spending, the \nbudget that is before the Senate is a budget that will achieve balance \nover a 7-year-period. [[Page S7162]] \n  I want to congratulate Senator Domenici. I want to congratulate my \ncolleagues for having achieved half of the commitment that we made \nprior to the elections in 1994.\n  My amendment today seeks to achieve the other half of those \ncommitments. Now, what is the difference at this moment between the \nHouse budget and the Senate budget? Stated in its most simple terms, \nthe budget that we are considering in the Senate spends $175 billion \nmore on nondefense spending programs over the next 7 years than the \nbudget which was adopted in the House. That is the first difference. \nOur budget spends a lot more money than the House budget spends, on \nnondefense expenditures.\n  The second difference is that the budget in the Senate does not \nmandate a tax cut, whereas the budget in the House does.\n  My amendment is a very simple amendment. What my amendment does is \nmake two changes in spending. No. 1, it phases in the reductions in the \ngrowth of spending under Medicaid so that while Medicaid expenditures \ngrow every year over the next 7 years, and while Medicaid grows faster \nthan Government spending is growing, we slow down the rate of growth in \nMedicaid more quickly under the substitute which I have offered than \nunder the budget that is currently pending before the Senate.\n  Many people believe that those savings are not only achievable but \ndesirable.\n  The most significant change in spending that I have proposed in this \namendment reduces nondefense discretionary spending below the level \ncontained in the budget that is before the Senate, so that overall we \nare spending $142 billion less under my amendment than we are spending \nin the budget that is currently before the Senate.\n  If we look at this chart, Mr. President, it shows basically what the \namendment does to spending. The red line is a line that shows the \ngrowth of Government spending under the Domenici budget; that growth \naverages 3.3 percent a year.\n  What my amendment does, by reducing the growth of discretionary \nspending, and by phasing in savings in Medicaid more quickly, rather \nthan growing at 3.3 percent a year, Government spending would grow at \napproximately 3 percent a year. Government is still spending more each \nyear than it spent the year before, but not spending as much as it \nwould have spent had this amendment not been adopted.\n  This amendment then provides for tax cuts for the American people. \nThese tax cuts basically contain the following items: A $500 tax credit \nper child; cutting the capital gains tax rate by 50 percent and \nindexing it for inflation; estate tax relief for small business and \nsmall farms; faster depreciation through expensing for small business \nto encourage investment in small business in America; beginning the \nprocess of phasing out the so-called marriage penalty, this perverse \nprovision in the Tax Code where if two people with incomes meet, fall \nin love, and decide to get married, they pay the Government as much as \n$4,500 a year--for the right to be married--in additional taxes; this \namendment reestablishes individual retirement accounts for all \nAmericans; it allows spouses working in the home to have an individual \nretirement account on exactly the same basis as if they worked outside \nthe home; it allows the deduction with a credit for expenses in \nadopting a child; it raises the threshold for the earnings test under \nSocial Security so that if senior citizens need to work to supplement \ntheir income, if they have the ability to work, they can do it without \nlosing Social Security in the process; and finally, if someone takes \ncare of an elderly person in their home, they are allowed a credit for \npart of those expenses.\n  This, in essence, is the tax cut that is contained in the House \nbudget and is the heart of the Contract With America.\n  Now, let me take on the issues that are going to be raised. There are \ngoing to be some people who will say, ``Look, let us balance the budget \nbefore we talk about tax cuts.''\n  That is very easy to respond to. We are both balancing the budget. \nThe Domenici budget balances the budget, certifies the savings, locks \nthem in with enforcement mechanisms, and so does the amendment I have \noffered. In terms of balancing the budget, both amendments will balance \nthe Federal budget.\n  What my amendment does is spend less money, and by reducing spending \nby $142 billion over the next 7 years, my amendment makes it possible \nfor us to adopt as part of the reconciliation process a tax cut, \nfulfill the commitment we made in the campaign, and to do something \nmore: To begin the process of not only balancing the budget but \nchanging who is doing the spending in America.\n  The debate here is really between those who say we want the \nGovernment to spend $142 billion more, in the Senate, than Government \nspends in the House budget, and those who support my amendment and say \nlet us have the Federal Government spend $142 billion less so families \ncan spend more of their own money on their own children, so that \nbusinesses can invest more of their own money in their own businesses.\n  I know there are those who will say this is a debate about how much \nmoney we spend on children, this is a debate about how much money we \nspend on education, housing, and nutrition. But this is not a debate \nabout how much money we spend on children. It is not a debate about how \nmuch money is spent on nutrition or housing or education. It is a \ndebate about who is going to do the spending.\n  In the budget that is before us, the Government is going to continue \nto do the spending. In the amendment that I have offered, the family \nwill do the spending. I know Government and I know the family and I \nknow the difference. I believe if the American family is allowed to \nhave a $500 tax credit per child so parents can spend more of their own \nmoney on their own children, on their own future, that they will do a \nbetter job in spending that money than the Federal Government is doing.\n  In the House they propose eliminating public funding for public \ntelevision. In the House, they propose eliminating the Federal \nDepartment of Education. And they give part of that money back to \nparents, to let parents decide how it is spent. I believe that is a \nclear choice and I want to be absolutely certain that people know that \nwe can make that choice in this amendment. If you want families to \nspend more of their own money rather than having the Government spend \nit, you want to be for this amendment.\n  Second, this amendment cuts the capital gains tax rate, provides \nincentives for investment, and I know there will be those in this \ndebate who will say this helps rich people. ``If you cut the capital \ngains tax rate, rich people are going to exploit the situation because \nwhat they are going to do is mobilize their money; they are going to \ninvest it; they will create jobs. But if they are successful, they will \nearn profits.''\n  Welcome to America. That is how our system works. If we want people \nto create jobs there has to be an incentive to do it. I do not \nunderstand people who love jobs but hate the people who create them. I \ndo not understand how we can expect people to make investments and take \nrisks, and yet somehow resent allowing them to benefit when they are \nsuccessful from the investments they make and the risks they take.\n  As I listen to all this talk about rich people versus poor people, it \nhas started me thinking about my own life's experience. I have been \nblessed in having a lot of jobs in my life, especially when I was \ngrowing up. I worked as a peanut processor, I worked in a cabinet shop, \nI worked in a boat factory, in addition to all the jobs we all had \nworking in a grocery store, throwing a newspaper. No poor person ever \nhired me in my life. Every job I ever got in my life, I got because \nsomebody beat me to the bottom rung of the economic ladder, climbed up, \nsaved his money, invested it wisely, and made it possible for someone \nlike me to get my foot on the bottom rung of the economic ladder.\n  What my amendment seeks to do, by cutting the capital gains tax rate \nand by providing incentives for people to work and to save and to \ninvest, is to guarantee that tens of millions of additional young \nAmericans will get an opportunity to put their foot on the bottom rung \nof the economic ladder and start climbing up themselves. By cutting \ndiscretionary spending we have the opportunity to cut programs where \nGovernment is subsidizing business [[Page S7163]] and, instead, cut the \ncapital gains tax rate and provide investment incentives so that \ninvestment decisions are not made by the Government but where \ninvestment decisions are made in the private sector of the economy.\n  Some people are going to say, ``Look, we ought to forget this $500 \ntax credit per child because it is not enough money to make any \ndifference.'' For a two-child family, this $500 tax credit is going to \nmean that family is going to get to keep $1,000 more every year of what \nthey earn to invest in their own children. That may not be much money \nin Washington, DC, but in Texas, where I am from, the ability of a \nfamily to spend $1,000 more of its own money on its own children is \nreal money. The fact that that is not real money in Washington, DC, \ntells you something about the problems that we have in Washington, DC. \nI think these are changes we need to make.\n  So here is the choice we are about. The choice is this. The House of \nRepresentatives has controlled Government spending, and using the words \nwe use in Washington, cut Government spending. Even though spending \ngrows every year in their budget, it just does not grow as fast as it \nwould have grown had they not changed policies. But in the House, they \nspent roughly $175 billion less on nondefense spending than the budget \nthat we are now considering in the Senate. My amendment simply cuts \nspending by roughly that amount and gives that money back to parents to \ninvest in their own children, cuts the capital gains tax rate, \nencourages savings and investment by changing the tax code so that \nrather than the Government spending this $175 billion, it can be spent \nin the private sector, where families and businesses are making the \ndecisions instead of the Government.\n  This is not a debate about balancing the budget. Both budgets balance \nthe budget. This is not a debate about spending money on children or \ninvesting in businesses. Both budgets do that. But it is a debate about \nwho is going to do the spending. Under my amendment, families will do \nmore spending and the Government will do less spending. Under my \namendment, Government will make fewer investment decisions and private \nbusiness will make more investment decisions.\n  Not only do I believe this is good policy, I think it is important \nfor two reasons. One is economic and one is political.\n  Economically, I think the economy is beginning to soften. \nEconomically, I think we are beginning to feel, now, the impact of the \ntax increase that was adopted 2 years ago.\n  I think the impact is being felt on the American economy, and I think \nwe are beginning to see troublesome signs in the economy. I think it is \nvery important, as part of this budget, because we want it to work and \nwe want to balance the budget, that we as part of this budget provide \nincentives for private investment. As Government does less, it is \nimportant that we give parents the ability to do more by letting them \nkeep more of their own money. It is important, as Government does less, \nthat we provide incentives for business to do more in creating jobs and \ngrowth and opportunity.\n  I think that is especially true given that we are going to reform the \nwelfare system and we are going to ask millions of people to get out of \nthe welfare wagon and help the rest of us pull. Cutting the capital \ngains tax rate, providing incentives for investment and growth I think \nis a vital part of this.\n  Finally, we had an election. We all see the results of that election. \nWe have a Republican majority. We have 54 Republicans in the Senate. We \nhave a Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years. \nWe won that election based on commitments that we made to the American \npeople, and in terms of the budget we committed to do two things. No. 1 \nto balance the Federal budget. That is a commitment on which we are \nclearly going to deliver. But we also committed to reduce spending \nfurther so that families can keep more of what they earn and so that \nbusinesses can make more investment decisions to create more jobs, more \ngrowth, more opportunity for our people. That is a commitment that we \nare not going to fulfill unless we adopt this amendment.\n  Finally, before I yield the floor and allow the opposition to speak \nand begin to recognize our colleagues who are cosponsors to the \namendment, let me say this. I know there are others who are talking \nabout cutting a deal--compromising, coming up with a temporary tax cut. \nI think if we are going to change America, if we are going to change \nGovernment policy, we have to stop cutting deals in Washington, DC. We \npromised that we would do this in the election. As chairman of the \nRepublican senatorial committee, I went all over the country and with \nRepublican candidates everywhere committed to this program, and so did \nothers of our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Now we come down to the moment of truth. There are many who say, \nlook, it was hard enough balancing the budget. This was excruciatingly \npainful. This was difficult. We do not want to go the final step to \nlive up to what we committed in the election.\n  I think that is a mistake. I think America will be richer and freer \nand happier if we do it. It is not only the right thing to do \neconomically, it is the right thing to do because we committed to do \nit.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have spent a lot of time discussing the \nbasic unfairness of the tax cut proposed by some Members on the other \nside of the aisle. The American people are wise to Republican tax \nshenanigans that benefit the wealthiest in this Nation. The amendment \nthat has just been offered by the Senator from Texas embraces the \nunworkable and unrealistic tax cut described by Speaker Gingrich as, \n``The heart and soul, the crown jewel of the Contract With America.''\n  It is a phony jewel at best and a very deceptive one, I hasten to \nsuggest. The plain fact is that we cannot afford a tax cut, and there \nshould not be one in this budget if we are going to balance the budget. \nOur primary goal, the goal that the American people overwhelmingly \nendorse, should be to reduce the deficit. A tax cut like the one in the \nHouse Contract With America would only add to the problem by forcing us \nto make even deeper and more painful spending cuts.\n  Poll after poll has shown that voters want Congress to get the \nNation's fiscal house in order by balancing the budget, not by cutting \ntaxes.\n  Mr. President, we have just spent the majority of Friday and Monday \ntalking about the draconian impact of the Republican budget cuts. Those \ncuts are in Medicare, and lower income beneficiaries are all going to \nsuffer. We also talked about Medicare cuts and the cuts to education, \nthe cuts to the EITC program, the cuts to veterans programs, and the \ncuts to agriculture. But no matter how the deficit is eliminated, the \nfact is that achieving balance is an extraordinarily difficult and \npainful task. It requires more than $1 trillion in spending cuts--cuts \nthat have a real impact on real people. Adding tax cuts to the mix \nwould only ensure that the pain goes even deeper. And in this budget \nthat translates to even harsher treatment for our seniors, our schools \nand education, our children, and the least well off in our society.\n  There has also been a great deal of talk in this Chamber especially \nabout the so-called economic bonus that will magically occur if this \nbudget is enacted. According to CBO, it would be possible for a total \nof some $170 billion over the next 7 years and balloon to $356 billion \nover 10 years if those figures work out--if those figures work out. The \nbonus has become the financing source for the tax cuts being advocated \nby our friends on the other side of the aisle. If this bonus does \noccur--and I think that point is very debatable--I submit there are \nmany better purposes to which it could and should be put. In fact, the \ndriving force behind the Democratic amendments center on this very \nissue.\n  The question is very simple: Should any economic bonus be reserved \nfor tax cuts for the best off in our society or should it be used to \nsoften the blows of some of the extraordinarily harsh cuts that will be \nmeted out under the plan? Our position is very simple: we cannot afford \na tax cut. It makes the job of [[Page S7164]] balancing the budget just \nthat much more difficult and disproportionately unfair.\n  Furthermore, in the event that an economic bonus or surplus should \naccrue as a result of the painful choices that are being made, this \nbonus should be used to lessen the pain of those cuts rather than a tax \ncut and thus better assuring a realistic balanced budget by a day \ncertain.\n  That is where we stand, Mr. President, and that is where the American \npeople stand, too. That is where realistic and reasonable people stand. \nI certainly strongly recommend that we disapprove the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if we go back and forth----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond very briefly and then I would yield to \nSenator Grams.\n  Mr. President, let me first say that the amendment I have offered \ncuts spending by another $142 billion to make it possible for us to let \nfamilies keep more of what they earn and to provide incentives for \nbusinesses to invest their own money in their own future and generate \njobs.\n  I hear our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle talking \nabout difficult choices. I am not aware that a single one of them plans \nto make a single difficult choice, and these are difficult choices \nbeing made by Republicans. Their proposal is that if we make the \ndifficult choices so that we balance the budget, if any benefit should \naccrue from that we allow Government to spend the benefits. Our \nproposal is that if we make the tough choices and benefits accrue as a \nresult of those tough choices in lower interest rates and higher growth \nbecause we have balanced the budget, because the Government is not \nborrowing half of all the money that is loaned in America, we give that \nmoney back to the people who earned the money to begin with, the people \nwho do the work, pay the taxes, and pull the wagon.\n  So I do not think the distinction between the two visions for the \nfuture that we are debating here could be any clearer.\n  I do not think the American people believe that the tax cuts adopted \nin the House of Representatives are unreasonable or unworkable. I do \nnot think the American people think that the idea of letting families \nspend more of their own money by having Government spend less of it is \nan unrealistic or unworkable idea. In fact, it has worked in reverse \nfor 40 years. The average family in 1950, with two children, sent $1 \nout of every $50 it earned to Washington. Today, it is sending $1 out \nof every $4.\n  I am just proposing to take a very small step back in the right \ndirection for a change.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Grams.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator very much. And I want to thank him \nvery much for giving me the time on this amendment, and also give a lot \nof credit to the Senator from Texas for bringing this amendment to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, we have heard strong and passionate statements from my \ncolleagues on the subject of the $500 per-child tax credit and other \ntax reductions.\n  But there is one thing we have not heard.\n  We have not heard from the people themselves, those who would benefit \nmost from tax relief, those who pay the bills--that is, the middle-\nclass Americans who work every day--and a lot of nights and weekends, \ntoo--just trying to make a better life for themselves, their children, \ntheir families.\n  And they do it at the same time they are paying more and more taxes \nto the Federal Government.\n  Who is speaking up for them? Who is speaking up for the taxpayers?\n  As their elected representatives, it is supposed to be us. But \nsometimes I am not so sure we are.\n  November was only 6 months ago, but in a city where the headline-\nmaking political promises of yesterday too often end up lining the \nbottom of the bird cage, the message of November already seems to have \nbeen forgotten by many of us in the Senate.\n  And so, if not us, who is speaking up for the taxpayers?\n  Believe me, Mr. President, they may not be here to speak for \nthemselves, but they have a voice in this debate, and they have a right \nto be heard today.\n  Fortunately, the taxpayers in my State of Minnesota are prolific \nletter-writers. And, thanks to their letters, some of which I have \nbrought with me to the floor, they will be heard today.\n  And this is just a very small sample but a representation of what I \nhave received in the mail.\n  Listen carefully--their thoughtful words reflect a deep \ndissatisfaction with the status quo in Washington.\n  Listen to Ralph Krasky of Minneapolis:\n\n       We are just being killed in taxes. We both work and all we \n     do is save for April 15. Let us keep what we make. After all, \n     it is not the government's money. It is our money.\n\n  Or listen to Elaine Haataja, 53 years old and living in Menagha.\n  She lost her husband to cancer a year ago:\n\n       I am very angry at our Federal and State tax system. I had \n     no choice but to go to work for $5 an hour to support myself \n     and keep up the taxes and insurance on my house and car.\n       ``I receive $700 a month from my husband's pension, which \n     isn't enough a month to pay utilities and insurance plus the \n     upkeep on the house and my old car. And now I have to pay \n     $1,100 for Federal and State taxes.\n\n  The frustration is real, Mr. President, in Minneapolis, in Menagha, \nand every town in between. People feel as if their own Government has \nlet them down; that somehow Government has gotten off the right track.\n  ``I urge you to continue to cut taxes and cut spending and cut the \nFederal bureaucracy,'' writes Ralph Grant of Rockford, MN.\n  ``There is more than enough waste and fraud and pork and duplication \nin the Federal budget to sustain a severe reduction without affecting \nany necessary and required services.''\n  Minnetrista residents Kathy and Gary Hejna agree:\n\n       We believe this country was built with hard work and \n     sacrifice, not sympathy and handouts.\n       We also believe that we can spend this money more \n     effectively than the Government, who has only succeeded in \n     creating a permanent, dependent welfare class with our money \n     over the last 40 years.\n       Any bill that takes money away from the Government and \n     gives it to the families, the basic unit of society, can only \n     benefit everyone in this country.\n\n  With seven children, Kathy and Gary would receive a tax credit of \n$3,500 every year under the Gramm amendment.\n  Think what a difference an extra $3,500 could mean for a family.\n  It could mean health insurance, a special education for a gifted \nchild, or simple necessities like groceries and clothing.\n  Think how the $500 per-child tax credit could strengthen the American \nfamily.\n  Kathleen and William Bart of Roseville have given it a lot of \nthought. ``A $500 Federal tax credit for each dependent is not a \nFederal hand-out,'' they write, ``but would allow parents to keep more \nof the money that they make and to use it to care for their own \nchildren.\n  ``A $500 Federal tax credit for each dependent would unquestionably \nstrengthen many families--especially middle-class and economically-\ndisadvantaged families.''\n  Lori Brandt, who lives in Plymouth, MN, has thought about it, too. \n``Families desperately need a break today,'' she says, ``and tax relief \nis long overdue.''\n  From Duluth came this letter by Justin Black. ``So many families \nstarting out these days are as poor as dirt because they have to pay so \nmuch taxes when they haven't had the time to barely start their lives.\n  ``They need a break like this tax bill so they can afford to raise a \nhealthy family. Remember: they're the hope for the next generation and \nthey need to have a strong family life to take over where the last \ngeneration left off.''\n  ``My husband, Jay, is an executive with a small manufacturing \nbusiness and I am a mother and homemaker, as well as teacher to our two \nsmall children,'' says Patty Meacham of Audubon, MN, in her letter to \nmy office.\n  ``We are helping to support Jay's 69-year-old-mother, because we \ndon't feel the government should be responsible for every person within \nour borders. [[Page S7165]] \n  ``Tax cuts would enable us to do much more Grandma, and perhaps she \ncould get off the rolls of people accepting rent assistance.\n  ``It is no source of pride for us that she has to go to a government \nagency for help, but how can we do what is right for her, when we are \nso greatly strapped by the tax burden placed upon us?''\n  A young couple from Coon Rapids tried to but a new home to fulfill \nthe American dream, only to learn after meeting with their realtor that \nthey simply could not afford to do it on their own.\n  ``I have finally reached the point of complete frustration and anger \nover the amount of taxes being deducted from my check each month,'' \nsaid their letter.\n  ``When we got home that evening my husband and I sat down with our \ncheckbook and our bills and tried to determine what we were doing \nwrong. After taking everything into consideration we determined that we \nweren't spending our money foolishly.\n  ``The only real problem we found was when we looked at our paycheck \nstubs and actually realized how much of our income was going to pay for \ntaxes.\n  ``It saddens me to think of how hard my husband and I work and how \nmuch time we have to spend away from our daughter to be at work * * * \nand we still cannot `reach the American dream.'''\n  The $500 per-child tax credit would help families like Natalie's \nrealize their dreams. And Minnesotans know it will help the economy, \ntoo.\n  David Clark, a taxpayer from Eden Prairie writes: ``Taxation is an \nawesome burden in the U.S. today, and it is sucking away resources from \nthe economy that could be used to create jobs and opportunities for \neveryone, including the poor.\n  ``I urge you to use the new Republican majority to enact the \nlegislation needed to get the Government off our backs.''\n  Walter Wilder, a doctor from Edina, writes: ``Tax cuts will help to \nbalance the budget by stimulating growth, bringing in more income, \nincluding from the high-income people.''\n  And J. Randy Brown of Oakdale says: ``I agree with your position that \ntax cuts are also a necessary part of the overall budget solution. \nReduced taxes will result in renewed growth, job-creating, and the \nresult of that would be increased revenues.''\n  Mr. President, if it were up to the American people, we would have \ntax relief, and the vote would not even be close.\n  The House heard the people and passed its budget last week, with the \n$500 per-child tax credit as its centerpiece.\n  But now it is our turn. The American people are not sure we are up to \nthe task. And I am afraid they may be right.\n  ``I just finished my '94 taxes. What a disappointment,'' writes Tim \nHulst of New Hope.\n  ``The government can't seem to get enough of my money. Last year, I \nworked two jobs--seven days per week--and my wife worked full time to \ntry and support ourselves and three children.\n  ``After all we've paid in, we still owe $1,000 more. Please convince \nyour fellow Senators how important it is to cut taxes. I wonder \nsometimes if the Republicans in the Senate really get it.''\n  Dean Fairbrother of Minneapolis has the same concerns. ``The status-\nquo, too-cautious approach exemplified by many of the senior members of \nthe Republican Senate caucus is unacceptable. Keep pushing for family \ntax relief,'' he urged.\n  ``Ignore the tired lamentations coming from the Old Bulls. They are \nwrong--you, me, and the majority of Americans pleading for such relief \nare dead right.''\n  The letter-writer who leveled the harshest criticism at this Chamber \nis Folkert Breitsma of Maple Grove, who writes:\n  ``It is a disgrace to see billions of our money squandered by \npoliticians who are out of touch with real life and have the audacity \nto say that the national government can be entrusted with the money--\nthat they know what is good for us.\n  ``I have watched the Senate stonewall most of the initiatives brought \nforth by the House. It is defended by the Senators as being `more \ndeliberate' and `take time to study the initiatives.'\n  ``However it is promoted, I see it as stonewalling by a group of \npeople that do not have a clear vision of what they want to achieve and \nhave the arrogance to claim they know what is best for the country.''\n  Those are strong words--not my words, but words in which I find a \ngood deal of truth.\n  But there is hope, Mr. President--the hope offered by the $500 per-\nchild tax credit we debate today.\n  Mr. President, look what the $500 per-child tax credit could do for \nthe Minnesotans who wrote asking for our help:\n  We would return $1.4 million to the people of Wadena County, home of \nElaine Haataja; we would return $48.7 million to the people of Ramsey \nCounty, home of the Bart Family; $3 million to Becker County, home of \nthe Meacham Family; $20.8 million to Washington County, home of the \nBrowns; and $101.5 million would be returned to Hennepin County, which \nthe Brandts, the Breitsmas, the Kraskys, the Hulsts, and the \nFairbrothers call home.\n  By passing the $500 per-child tax credit, we would return $500 \nmillion to Minnesota families--$25 billion annually to families across \nAmerica.\n  We have heard what the people have to say. I think the question, \nagain, is who is speaking up for the taxpayers?\n  As I close, Mr. President, I want to remark that the senior Senator \nfrom Nebraska said a few moments ago the tax cut would more deeply \nincrease the pain to balance the budget. The pain of the tax burden on \nthis country's families is growing more and more, and they are \ndemanding and asking for tax relief.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support and adopt the Gramm \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Minnesota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what I am hearing in the Senate today is \nalmost word for word what I heard in the early 1980's: Give the people \na tax cut and do not worry about the deficit. We are for tax cuts, too, \nbut only after we get our deficit under control.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nNebraska, and I want to say I admire how straightforward the Senator \nfrom Texas is with his amendment and his approach. He lays it right on \nthe line. He believes we can afford at this point a $350 billion tax \ncut and still balance the budget.\n  In fact, I appreciate the candor of the whole Republican contract in \nadmitting that this really is the centerpiece, this is the crown jewel \nof the Republican contract, as stated by the Speaker and as stated by \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  I was amazed when they first came up with that formulation. Of all \nthe different things you could pick from the Republican contract: \nregulatory reform, trying to get the Government off our back; line-item \nveto; the balanced budget amendment--for a moment I thought that was \nthe crown jewel of the Republican contract--the issue of unfunded \nmandates we already dealt with; issues having to do with Congress, \nliving by the rules that it creates for others. All of these things are \napparently swept aside when it comes to the importance of delivering a \ntax cut at this time even though this country has reached a $5 trillion \ndebt and a deficit that has only recently been brought down through the \nefforts of the Clinton administration.\n  So I agree with the Senator from Texas. This is the key amendment on \nthis whole issue. The Senator says that the tax cut is the heart of the \nContract With America. Well, this is the test: Is your heart with the \ntax cuts or is your heart with deficit reduction? You cannot have it \nboth ways, and this is the test and this is what the American people \nare looking for.\n  What is very unfortunate is that the Senator from Texas fails to tell \nwhat this amendment really does. It takes [[Page S7166]] $170 billion \nthat is already in the budget resolution, adds that much again, makes \nthe cuts deeper for the various programs that are going to be cut, and \nyou know what, Mr. President, it still does not balance the budget in \nthe year 2002, unless you take the money of Social Security.\n  This is not a balanced budget in the first place, Mr. President, and \nthis amendment will only make it worse. Do not let anyone on the \nRepublican side kid you, this budget resolution does not balance the \nbudget in the year 2002, unless you take the money from Social \nSecurity. So this amendment cannot possibly solve that problem.\n  The Senator from Texas talks about two visions. He sees this as all \nabout whether we are going to return the money to the people. But that \nis not what the November 8 election was all about. I think both in 1992 \nand 1994, the American people spoke with a very clear voice. They did \nnot call for tax cuts. They said get rid of the Federal deficit, get \nrid of the huge interest payments we have to pay on the debt, do not \nsaddle our children and our grandchildren with this deficit. That was \nthe message in 1992 and it was the message in 1994. It is not a \npartisan message. People are just saying, clean up the mess that was \nmade in the 1980's that the Senator from Nebraska just referred to.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Texas would make the mess much \nworse. It would say that even though all these deep cuts are being made \nin so many important human programs, we still have $350 billion in \nspare change around for tax cuts. I do not think anyone out there \nreally believes that.\n  Let me agree with the Senator from Texas that this should not be \nabout class warfare. I support neither the Senator's proposal nor the \nproposal for a tax cut in the budget resolution, nor do I support the \nPresident's proposal for a much tinier tax cut. I say we cannot do any \nof it, and there is a moderate bipartisan coalition in this body of \nRepublicans and Democrats alike who say just get rid of all the tax \ncuts; whatever we have to reduce spending with, let us use that money \nto reduce the deficit.\n  You know, Mr. President, my biggest concern is not this amendment. \nThis amendment is going down to defeat, I am happy to say. The crown \njewel of the Republican contract will be soundly defeated on the floor \nof this Senate in a very short while. The Speaker's crown jewel will be \ngone. The $350 billion is not going to be voted by this body. We will \ndefeat the crown jewel of the Republican contract. But I will say, Mr. \nPresident, that this is a stalking horse to make the $170 billion that \nis already in the budget resolution look moderate. We also cannot \nafford that, and we will have amendments later to deal with this. If I \nmay have 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. EXON. Thirty seconds. If I give you another minute, there will \nnot be enough. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the ranking member very much.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, more than anything else, offends the \ncommon sense of the American people--they know better than we do--if we \nvote for this. It offends them because they know darn well you cannot \nbalance the budget and spend $350 billion on tax cuts and tell them it \nis going to work. It does not work. It is phony and it should be \ndefeated.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Wisconsin has \nexpired. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know it breaks the hearts of our \ncolleagues, but in this amendment, I am proposing cutting Government \nspending, their precious programs, so that families can spend their own \nmoney on their own children on their own future, and invest in their \nown businesses. If that violates common sense, I think it says there is \na difference between common sense in Washington, DC, and on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate as compared to common sense around every kitchen \ntable in the kitchen of every working family in America.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my fellow Senator from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, for yielding, and I rise today in very strong support of \nhis amendment, which has the courage to confront an issue that I \nbelieve is essential to our future: The preservation of the American \nfamily.\n  The amendment before us strengthens--not weakens--strengthens the \nbudget resolution by recognizing that cutting budgets and cutting taxes \nare part of the same movement in America, a movement to limit our \nGovernment and empower our people.\n  These twin goals, I contend, are not inconsistent. They are \ninseparable, and we can prove our commitment to both if we are willing \nto cut Federal spending just an additional three-tenths of 1 percent. \nLet us understand that. These two goals are not incompatible if Members \nare willing to take three-tenths of 1 percent more in Federal programs \nand apply it as a return to the American taxpayer.\n  While I support the progrowth and savings provisions provided in this \namendment, in the limited time I have, I would like to focus my remarks \non the profamily elements of this amendment.\n  Opponents have argued that the only way to help children is to \nmaintain record high levels of Federal spending on every Government \nprogram. But there is a better way. What we are asking today is simply, \nwho is better informed and who is more compassionate to make choices in \nthe interest of our children, the Federal Government or America's \nfamilies? Can there be any serious debate on how that question is \nanswered?\n  The lessons that we have learned from decades of social spending are \nclear: Government programs have proven incapable of fighting social \ndespair and disorder. But strong families can, and it is time to admit \nthat when families fail, so does our society. It is also time to \nunderstand that when our families are involved and favored and \nsupported, they construct a hopeful future for America.\n  This Congress today is presented with a choice between the failed, \ndiscredited compassion of Government and the proven power of strong \nfamilies to build hope in their children and order in our society.\n  I believe, Mr. President, it is a transparent ploy to say this is \nsimply a matter of rich versus poor. Rather, it is a matter of where \nresources and authority should rest: in Government or in our families \nand our communities?\n  Much of the opposition to tax relief seems to be based on a myth, a \nmyth that tax cuts somehow waste the Government's money.\n  The Government produces nothing. It has no resources of its own to \nspend. Tax cuts are not a waste of Government funds; they are simply a \nmethod to allow Americans to keep their own money. They are a method to \nbuild working independence as an alternative to Government paternalism \nwhich has proven so destructive, despite the honorable intentions of \nits proponents.\n  It is tax cuts that are the best form of social investment, an \ninvestment in the ability of people to care for themselves. In 1993, \nthe Bipartisan Commission on America's Urban Families found that, ``The \ntrend of family fragmentation drives the Nation's most pressing social \nproblems--crime, educational failure, declining mental health, drug \nabuse, and poverty. These, in turn, further fragment families.''\n  One of the key policy recommendations of the commission was to \n``increase the self-sufficiency and economic well-being of families by \neither significantly increasing the personal exemption or a child tax \ncredit for all children through age 18.''\n  Those were the conclusions of the Bipartisan Commission on American \nUrban Families, and I think we should listen to their words. The \nfindings on the National Commission of Urban Families were remarkably \nsimilar to the findings advocated 3 years ago by the Democratic \nProgressive Policy Institute; in an impressive report entitled \n``Putting Children First,'' a progressive family policy for the \nnineties, this group found, ``There are some things that only families \ncan do, and if families are placed under so much stress that they \ncannot raise children effectively, the rest of the society cannot make \nup the difference in later years.'' [[Page S7167]] \n  Mr. President, the time of political change is the time to reassess \nour national priorities. We need to redirect our focus and our funds to \nstrengthen the family. While Government's role in preserving the family \nis limited, it is not insignificant. Perhaps the single most important \nthing Government can accomplish for families is to lift the economic \nburdens that can cripple the family.\n  Over the last 50 years, we have had a lousy track record in doing \nthat. The personal exemption is now just 12 percent of income, where it \nused to be at 42 percent in 1948 when it was first introduced. Since \nthe end of World War II, it is families that have borne the burden of \nincreased taxes. That burden increased more than 200 percent for \nfamilies with two children.\n  Their average after-tax income is below that, even of elderly \nhouseholds, single persons, and couples without children. In my home \nState of Indiana, the median family income for a family of four is \n$30,000 and, of that, nearly $11,000 is devoted to Federal, State, and \nlocal taxes. The average family in Indiana pays more in taxes than it \ndoes in housing, food, and clothing expenses combined.\n  The Gramm amendment completes the budget resolution by addressing not \nonly the Government's budget deficit, but also the deficit and the \nresources of families to care for their own. It is a deficit created by \nincreased taxation of the family through the erosion of the personal \nexemption. For too long we have ignored this growing burden and its \ngrowing social costs.\n  Mr. President, the promise of tax relief for the American family is \nnow before us to be fulfilled or to be ignored. At the end of this \nprocess, I want to vote on a budget that tackles both threats to the \nAmerican family--the threat of the budget deficit and an ever-growing \nthreat of a tax burden. I want to support a budget that contributes to \na growing economy and builds new momentum for job creation. For too \nlong we have dismissed the needs of families to answer the call of \nother interests. With this vote, that trend can end.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this critical amendment. \nAgain, the fundamental choice before us is, do we want to leave more \nmoney in the hands of Federal bureaucrats to spend in their so-called \nwisdom on behalf of our families and the needs that are pressing on our \nsociety, or do we want to rest that decision with parents and with \nfamilies?\n  By cutting spending just an additional three-tenths of 1 percent, we \ncan give that decision to families rather than rest it in the hands of \nGovernment bureaucrats. That is the decision before us. We can have \nboth. It is a fundamental choice that we must make. I am pleased to \njoin the Senator from Texas, and I am pleased that he offered this \namendment because that presents us and grants us that choice.\n  If I have any additional time, I know the Senator is pressed for \ntime, I am happy to yield any additional time back.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in view of the fact that we have more time \nleft than that side, would the Senator from Texas object to two rather \nshort statements in a row?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would not object.\n  Mr. EXON. Then I would yield at this time 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Michigan, followed by 2 minutes by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my friend from \nNebraska.\n  Tomorrow, or the next day, the Senate is likely to approve a budget \nwhich would be described as being balanced by the year 2002, although \nit will not be. It will not be balanced because it relies heavily on \nsurpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund to achieve that so-called \nbalance.\n  But the proposed budget resolution before us is unbalanced in another \nimportant way. The budget blueprint represented here penalizes middle-\nincome working families, reduces our investment in education, and \npenalizes our senior citizens, in order to provide a tax reduction \nwhich will benefit mainly the wealthiest of Americans.\n  One of the most inequitable aspects of the budget before us is that \nit raises taxes on working families. The proposal to cut back the \nearned-income tax credit for working families--in other words, to raise \ntaxes on working families who make less than $28,000 per year will, \naccording to the Department of the Treasury, raise their taxes, and in \nthe case of a single parent with two children, for instance, who makes \n$8,800 a year, raise his or her taxes by $354. That is a minimum-wage \nparent making $8,800. That is a tax increase of $354, according to the \nDepartment of the Treasury, and that is what is in the budget \nresolution before us.\n  Now, Kevin Phillips, a conservative commentator, says this about the \nRepublican budget proposal and this particular tax increase on people \nmaking $28,000 or less. He said,\n\n       It is the senior citizens, the poor, students, and ordinary \n     Americans who will see programs that they depend on gutted by \n     this proposal, while the richest 1 or 2 percent, far from \n     making sacrifices, actually get new benefits and tax \n     reductions.\n\n  President Reagan described the earned income tax credit, which is \nbeing cut back in the proposal before us, as ``the best antipoverty, \nbest pro-family, best job creation measure to come out of the \nCongress.'' That is what President Reagan told us about the earned \nincome tax credit. That is what the proposal before us will cut back. \nThat is the law which benefits families that earn under $28,000, and \nthat is the proposal before us which will cut back that earned income \ntax credit so that families earning under $28,000 will pay more in \ntaxes.\n  Why are we doing this? Mainly to cut some taxes. And, according to \nthe proposal of the Senator from Texas, most of the tax cut will go to \nthe wealthiest of Americans. Over 50 percent of the benefits in the \namendment of the Senator from Texas goes to Americans earning over \n$100,000. Now, what a contrast that is.\n  In the budget proposal before us, if you earn less than $28,000, you \nare slated for a tax increase. If we adopt the Bradley amendment, we \nwill cure that unfairness. But then comes along another amendment which \ncompounds the unfairness, and that is the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas, which then says we ought to take that pot of money created by \nthe cuts on seniors and on students and on working people and give \nthose dollars mainly, over 50 percent, to people earning over $100,000.\n  Now, the contrast could not be sharper. It could not be clearer. The \nunfairness is clear. We can correct that unfairness in two ways, by \nadopting the Bradley amendment and defeating the Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. President. I rise to oppose the Gramm amendment which would \nprovide for a $345 billion tax cut over the next 7 years.\n  This tax cut provides more than half of its benefits to people making \nmore than $100,000 a year. It gives a $20,000 tax break to those who \nmake $350,000.\n  On Wednesday or Thursday, the Senate will likely approve a budget \nwhich will be described as balanced in the year 2002 although it will \nnot be. It relies heavily on surpluses in the Social Security trust \nfunds to achieve balance. The proposed budget resolution before us is \nalready unbalanced in another important way. The budget blue print \nrepresented here penalizes middle-income working families, reduces our \ninvestment in education, and penalizes our senior citizens, in order to \nprovide for a tax reduction which will benefit mostly the wealthiest of \nAmericans.\n  The Gramm amendment would make the inequities of this budget worse \nand would remove from conference with the House the possibility that \nthe unfairness might be somewhat reduced. One of the most inequitable \naspects of the proposal before us is that to pay for these tax cuts for \nthe most well-off Americans, it raises taxes on working families. The \nproposal to cut back the earned income tax credit for working families \nmaking less than $28,000 per year would, according to the Department of \nthe Treasury, raise taxes by $354 on a single parent with two children \nmaking only $8,840 a year. That's minimum wage.\n  Yesterday, I quoted noted conservative commentator Kevin Phillips, as \nhave a number of my colleagues this week, but his recent public remarks \nsum up the problems with the Republican budget proposal and this \nparticular tax increase on people making $28,000 a year very well. He \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice, with * * * the people who \n     have the big money making the biggest sacrifice. Instead, \n     it's senior citizens, the poor, students, and ordinary \n     Americans who'll see programs they depend on gutted while * * \n     * the richest 1- or 2-percent, far from making sacrifices, \n     actually get new benefits and tax reductions.\n\n  The earned income tax credit has a long history of bipartisan \nsupport. President Reagan called the EITC, ``The best anti-poverty, the \nbest pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of the \nCongress.'' The EITC has played an important role in providing \nincentives to keep people working who are struggling to get on the \nlowest rungs of America's economic ladder and to stay off the welfare \nroles.\n  And our Republican colleagues do not, look to the $2\\1/2\\ trillion \nover the next 5 years in all tax expenditures. There is no effort in \nthis budget to control the growth of corporate tax deductions, no \neffort to restrain the growing tax breaks for the largest and richest \namong us. In fact, the Gramm amendment would eliminate the corporate \nalternative minimum tax, a tax designed to assure that profitable \ncompanies have to pay some reasonable amount in Federal income taxes. \nThis is a more than $25 billion tax reduction for such companies.\n  Instead, the Republican budget aims a $21 billion tax increase at the \nworking families with children. In Michigan, this means a $457 million \ntax hike over 7 years on nearly 316,000 hard-working taxpayers making \nless than $28,000 a year. Over the next 7 years, they'll pay an average \nof nearly $1,500 more.\n  Mr. President, the budget before us has its priorities wrong. The \nBradley amendment on which we will vote shortly is a step in the right \ndirection. The Gramm amendment is just wrong. It would provide tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest while leaving intact this tax increase on working \nfamilies. It's simply a question of fairness.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Gramm amendment and support the \nBradley amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would apologize as a teacher for not \ndoing justice to the issues before the Senate. It is just impossible in \n2 minutes.\n  Let me start out by saying that there is an old Yiddish proverb that \nI think applies to this amendment on the floor. That Yiddish proverb \nsays you cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. Quite frankly, \nthis is a perfect example of that.\n  On the one hand, we tell people we are serious about deficit \nreduction. On the other hand, we are talking about $300 or $350 billion \nof tax cuts going disproportionately to the wealthiest and highest-\nincome citizens.\n  Mr. President, I just have to say that that does not pass the test of \nintellectual rigor in the State of Minnesota. People want the Senate to \nget real with them. They want the Senate to be straightforward with \nthem. They do not believe for a moment that we can have hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of tax cuts while, at the same time, we are \npretending to be serious about deficit reduction.\n  Second of all, Mr. President, and it is very difficult to talk about \nwhat the statistics mean in personal terms, but honest to God, when we \nare talking about severe cuts in Medicare for elderly people, and \nMedicaid for elderly people, and nutrition programs for children, and \nsupport for students to be able to go on to higher education, a higher \neducation that they can afford, and when we give away an investment in \neducation and health care and jobs for people, and we want to do all of \nthis deficit reduction on the backs of these citizens, middle-income \ncitizens, families, working people, all on behalf of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the United \nStates of America, it not only does not meet the Minnesota standard of \nrigor, it does not meet the Minnesota standard of fairness.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield the junior Senator from Arizona 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding. Mr. President, \nI express my strong support for the Gramm amendment.\n  This amendment is about keeping our promises to the American people \nto provide tax relief to the American families. We have heard a lot of \ncriticism about this amendment. It provides a $500 per child tax credit \nfor the American family. It provides for marriage penalty relief, \nspousal IRA, a new American dream savings account to allow people to \nbuy a home, provides a credit to families caring for elderly family \nmembers.\n  It keeps faith with our seniors. It does not take a nickel from \nSocial Security. In fact, it raises the Social Security earnings \nlimitation, something that the senior citizens from Arizona have been \nfighting for since I has been here. It enables seniors to be able to \nwork without having a penalty.\n  It provides estate and gift tax relief, provides incentive for the \npurchase of long-term care insurance, something all of our seniors are \ninterested in. This amendment also provides incentives for businesses \nto grow and create new jobs.\n  Capital gains tax reform--there is over $5 trillion in backed-up \ncapital, in pent-up capital, in our society that could be freed with \nthis kind of capital gains tax relief. That means jobs for Americans.\n  This amendment provides for a home office deduction. For small \nbusiness expensing. It repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax \nand provides for neutral cost recovery. Balancing the budget, Mr. \nPresident, is important, but balancing the budget is not the only goal. \nAt best we will produce a Government that still taxes too much, spends \ntoo much, and regulates too much.\n  With the Gramm amendment we are saying to the American people that we \ntrust them to spend their own hard-earned tax dollars more wisely than \nthe bureaucrats in Washington. They know how to take care of their \nfamily and how to invest and create new jobs.\n  While some here talk of ordinary Americans, we believe that Americans \nare extraordinary. Given the opportunity, they can improve their own \nlives and the lives of their families. They just need the resources to \ndo so.\n  Who cares, Mr. President, more about a child's education than a \nparent? Give them the $500 child tax credit. Who spends the money more \nwisely and efficiently? The St. Mary's Food Bank in Arizona or the \nDepartment of Agriculture, that administers nutrition programs? If I \nhad $500 to contribute to an entity to provide for the poor, I am going \nto contribute it to a local charity sooner than to the U.S. Government.\n  Who is a better job creator, the Federal Government or private \nbusiness? The Gramm amendment means Congress has to prioritize the \nremaining spending, like American families have to do. By reducing \ntaxes, it provides a chance to stimulate economic activity and produce \nmore revenue for the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, when a retailer has a sale on a Saturday, does he \nexpect to receive less income as a result of that sale? No. By reducing \nthe rates, he intends to bring more people in and more than make up by \nincreased volume what he has lost in the price that he charges.\n  The same thing occurs when we reduce taxes rates. We are not \nproducing less revenue to the Treasury. We actually--and experience \nproves this--produce more revenue to the Treasury by virtue of that \nreduction.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I heard some conversation a while ago that \nbasically suggests the liberals in this body believe that this \namendment will make it more difficult to balance the budget and \ndeliver. They oppose it. Here is my challenge to all of the liberals \nwho have spoken here. Will they support the budget resolution without \nthis tax increase in it? Do any of our liberal colleagues want to stand \nup and say yes, they will vote for this amendment, for the budget \nresolution before the Senate, so long as we do not have the tax \nincreases in it?\n  The answer, Mr. President, is no. And the reason they will not \nsupport the budget resolution even without the tax increases is because \nfundamentally they do not support a balanced budget.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Tax cuts, not increases.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am sorry if I misspoke with regard to the \ntax cuts [[Page S7169]] being proposed by the Gramm amendment.\n  The bottom line, the liberals who oppose the Gramm tax cuts do so \nbecause they like taxes, because they want the money to spend, not \nbecause they are going to support a budget resolution that does not \nhave these tax cuts in it.\n  If any of our liberal colleagues are willing to stand up and prove me \nwrong by saying no, they will vote for this budget resolution so long \nas it does not have the Gramm tax cuts in it, then I will eat these \nwords and say, fine, I accept their vote.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that the talk about opposing this \namendment, because they are interested in balancing the budget, is just \nso much talk because in the end they will vote against the budget \nresolution that balances the budget. They would rather have the tax \nmoney to spend. That is why they oppose the Gramm tax cuts.\n  I hope that our colleagues will support the Gramm tax cuts. Mr. \nPresident, I believe if they do so they will be striking a blow for the \nAmerican economy and for the American family.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader on our \nside.\n  Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Texas is premised on \nthe idea that both House and Senate budget resolutions balance the \nbudget: Absolutely false. Let me refer specifically to the House \nbudget, page 4: The deficit for the year 2002 is estimated at $120.7 \nbillion. They make no pretense, they print it in black and white.\n  Moreover, if we look at the figures on page 4, lines 20 and 21, we \nwill find that the debt increases from 2001 to 2002 by $192 billion; \nthat is the real deficit under the House resolution.\n  The real deficit under the Senate budget for the year 2002 is listed \non page 7, line 21 as $113.5 billion. If we turn to page 9, we can see \nthat the debt increases $177 billion--the real deficit.\n  So the very notion that we have done a good job, that we have \nbalanced the budget, or that we deserve a reward, is all based on a \nfalse premise. Mr. President, the biggest falsity, one perpetrated on \nboth sides of the aisle, is the belief that we can balance the budget \nthrough spending cuts alone and without increasing revenues.\n  I laid out the harsh budget realities in January of this year. I \ncontinue to report it, but in the limited time I have, I cannot go \nthrough the entire document. Thus, I would ask unanimous consent to \nhave it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Hollings Releases Realities on Truth in Budgeting\n\n       Reality No. 1: $1.2 trillion in spending cuts is necessary.\n       Reality No. 2: There aren't enough savings in entitlements. \n     Have welfare reform, but a jobs program will cost; savings \n     are questionable. Health reform can and should save some, but \n     slowing growth from 10 to 5 percent doesn't offer enough \n     savings. Social Security won't be cut and will be off-budget \n     again.\n       Reality No. 3: We should hold the line on the budget on \n     Defense; that would be no savings.\n       Reality No. 4: Savings must come from freezes and cuts in \n     domestic discretionary spending but that's not enough to stop \n     hemorrhaging interest costs.\n       Reality No. 5: Taxes are necessary to stop hemorrhage in \n     interest costs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit CBO Jan. 1995 (using trust                                                                                                                      \n funds).................................             207             224             225            253             284             297             322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nFreeze discretionary outlays after 1998.               0               0               0            -19             -38             -58             -78 \nSpending cuts...........................             -37             -74            -111           -128            -146            -163            -180 \nInterest savings........................              -1              -5             -11            -20             -32             -46             -64 \n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total savings ($1.2 trillion).......             -38             -79            -122           -167            -216            -267            -322 \n                                         ===============================================================================================================\nRemaining deficit using trust funds.....             169             145             103             86              68              30               0 \nRemaining deficit excluding trust funds.             287             264             222            202             185             149             121 \n5 percent VAT...........................              96             155             172            184             190             196             200 \nNet deficit excluding trust funds.......             187              97              27            (17)            (54)           (111)           (159)\nGross debt..............................           5,142           5,257           5,300          5,305           5,272           5,200           5,091 \nAverage interest rate on debt (percent).             7.0             7.1             6.9            6.8             6.7             6.7             6.7 \nInterest cost on the debt...............             367             370             368            368             366             360             354 \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Figures are in billions.

Mr. President, government is big. But what is big is \nthe interest costs on the national debt.\n  I was here when we balanced the budget under President Lyndon \nJohnson. The gross interest cost at that time was $4 billion.\n  Think of it, 36 Presidents, Republican and Democrats, all the wars \nfrom the Revolution, World War I, II, Korea, and a good part of \nVietnam--the interest costs on the debt were only $4 billion. The \ninterest costs on this year's deficit and debt are estimated at $340 \nbillion. The cost of Government as you and I know it, domestic \ndiscretionary, is $275 billion. That is the courts, the Congress, the \nPresident, the departments, FBI, DEA and all other non-defense \nappropriated accounts. Thus, even if you eliminate all of those \ndepartments, you still have a deficit.\n  What you are doing in the Gramm amendment is a charade, requiring \npeople to pay higher interest costs and saying you are giving it to \nthem in a tax cut. We are misleading the people on the idea that the \nwork is done.\n  I agree that the people are better able to spend their money than we \nare. But they expect us to come to Washington and to be honest about \nbudget matters. It is time to get out of the wagon and help us pull--\nthe trouble is that we here are in the wagon. It is the children who \nare doing the pulling.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be delighted to yield, on your time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to make three unanimous-consent requests on \nmy time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am through with my time. But I would be delighted to \nget into a debate with my distinguished chairman.\n  In closing, let me just reiterate that I really am tired of this \nfraud. The greatest fraud I know exacted on the American people is the \nidea we have choices. We are broke. And the single biggest government \nprogram that we have is the interest costs on the debt that we have to \nspend year after year. To honestly stop this hemorrhaging we have to \nfreeze, we have to cut, we have to close loopholes and increase taxes. \nWhen we finally admit that, we will get on top of the problem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGramm be allocated 20 minutes on the Thurmond-McCain amendment, the \nupcoming amendment, to be subtracted from the Thurmond-McCain time on \ntheir amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this has been cleared by the Democratic \nleader and by Senator Exon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that just prior to the final vote on the \nbudget resolution there be 30 minutes for debate to be controlled by \nthe Democratic leader, to be followed by 30 minutes for debate to be \ncontrolled by the Republican leader, or the manager, Senator Domenici, \nthis in addition to the time allotted under the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gramm amendment. \nI would direct my remarks to my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nrather than the other side of the aisle, because, in 1993, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina and the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator \nfrom Illinois and the majority of those on that side of the aisle who \nwere in the majority at that time voted in favor of the largest tax \nincrease in the history of this country. That was their decision. And, \nbecause they were in the majority at the time, that was the will of \nCongress.\n  In 1994, however, the American people repudiated that massive tax \nincrease. The American people said they want their taxes cut and they \nsaid they want to keep some of the money for themselves.\n  If the Senator from South Carolina does not think a $500 per child \ntax exemption would be appreciated by average Americans in this \ncountry, he is free to have his own views. The fact is, the people in \nArizona, the families in Arizona, would be more than pleased to have a \n$500 a child tax cut and would have money to spend on their own \nchildren rather than to send to Washington.\n  What this amendment is all about is whether we are going to have the \nstatus quo where we have accepted the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of this country, enacted in 1993, or whether we are going to \ncarry out the message of the American people who said we want less \nGovernment, we want less regulation, we want less taxes.\n  I see the Gramm amendment, frankly, as a real stark choice and \nperhaps the most important vote we will take in this budget debate, \nbecause it will determine basically the future--not of the party on \nthat side of the aisle, but of the party on this side of the aisle--as \nto whether we intend to keep the commitment and promise we made to the \npeople of this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the old western movies we used to see \nthese folks traveling around selling these bottles of tonic they \nclaimed would cure everything from the hiccups to the gout. Of course, \nthe bottle of tonic did nothing of the sort.\n  This proposal--to cut taxes--reminds me of that. It is really dealing \nwith myths. Let me deal with a couple of facts. People say, ``The \nbudget is going to be balanced. Now let us talk about a tax cut.'' In \nthe budget resolution in this Chamber today on page 7--this is a \nreproduction of page 7--it says ``Deficits.'' In the year 2002 the \ndeficit is $113.5 billion. Balanced? Where?\n  I want one person today on the majority side to come to the floor and \ntell us what this says, on page 7. It says a $113 billion deficit after \n7 years.\n  Second, tax cut. Do not take it from me, take it from a Republican, \nKevin Phillips, who says,\n\n       Spending on government programs [speaking of this budget] \n     from Medicare and education to home heating oil assistance, \n     is to be reduced in ways that principally burden the poor and \n     the middle class while simultaneously taxes are to be cut in \n     ways that predominantly benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of \n     Americans.\n\n  Do not take it from me. Take it from a Republican who tells it like \nit is.\n  Here is the paragraph of what he is talking about on the tax cuts. \nThey call it middle-class tax cuts. Families under $30,000 a year get \n$120. Families over $200,000 a year are given $11,200 tax cut. That is \na middle-class tax cut? Not where I come from.\n  No, this budget is clear. With this amendment calling for tax cuts \nfor the wealthy, this budget says to working families: We are going to \nmake it harder for you to send your kids to college because we do not \nhave enough money but we are going to give a big tax cuts to the \nwealthy. It says to the elderly and poor: We are going to make it \nharder for you to get health care because we cannot afford it but we \nare going to give a big tax cut to the wealthy. It says to 2,000 \ncorporations that we will give a $2 million check to each one of them, \nbecause we are going to eliminate the alternative minimum tax.\n  I do not understand those priorities. Those priorities make no sense \nat all. The first job in this Chamber is to balance the Federal budget. \nFor those on the other side to stand up and say we do not care about \nbalancing the budget, and then to offer an amendment that says, ``By \nthe way, the budget is not in balance now that we have brought to the \nfloor, but we also want to give very big tax cuts to those who need \nthem least in this country and take it out of the hides of other folks \nwho want to send their kids to school or to get health care or to buy \nhome heating fuel in the cold winter,'' somehow I think those \npriorities do not sell very well back home, because the people see \nthrough them.\n  This is a curious and tortured claim that is brought to the floor, \nthat somehow if we do not support tax cuts for the rich we do not care \nabout the Federal deficits. We are the ones who care about the Federal \ndeficit. We want to balance this budget, but you do not balance the \nbudget by trotting out [[Page S7171]] something that is popular, a big \ntax cut, call it a middle-class tax cut, and butter the bread of the \nwealthy in this country, and then tell other folks we are sorry, we \ncannot afford things that are essential for you.\n  No, this does not fly. This does not make sense. I think the American \npeople will see it for that. This is pure politics, pure politics.\n  This budget resolution on the floor today does not balance the \nbudget. It does not claim it does. On line 21 of page 7 it says the \nFederal deficit in the year 2002 is going to be $113 billion.\n  Would that those who called themselves warriors in the past debate on \nthe deficit not turn out to be wall flowers on this issue and better \nserve this country and their constituents by deciding if there is money \nto be achieved anywhere, any place, on revenue or the spending side, to \nuse it to bring this down to zero and put this country back on track. \nReally balance the budget, really give us some truth in labeling. Yes, \nthat would better serve this country's interests.\n  I know it may not be the most popular thing, but I happen to think it \nis the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to give our dear colleagues on the \nleft credit for one thing. They do not propose budgets. They do not \nvote for balanced budget amendments to the Constitution. They never \npropose cutting anything. But they can stand up in front of God and \neverybody else and say they are for balancing the budget. It is like \nBill Clinton, who feels our pain and does not share with us that he \ncauses it all the time.\n  I believe that we have a clear and stark choice here. You can support \nor not support Senator Domenici's budget, but he makes the hard choices \nto balance the budget over the next 7 years. What my amendment does is \nmake more hard choices, cut spending more so that in addition to \nbalancing the budget, we can let the working men and women of America \nkeep more of what they earn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will not yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, in one of his debates, Ronald Reagan said ``There you \ngo again.'' And here we go again. This is a historic debate in this \nChamber. At no point in recent times have the differences between the \ntwo political parties been more evident than right now. On the \nRepublican side, you have somebody offering tax cuts, spending cuts, \nslowing the rate of growth, balancing the budget, and on the other side \nit is business as usual: More spending, more taxes, no alternatives.\n  I was in this Chamber for many hours during the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment, and I heard it over and over and over again, \nspeaker after speaker after speaker: We do not need the amendment. All \nwe have to do is do it. What is the Republican plan? How come you do \nnot tell us how you are going to do it?\n  Well, here we are. We are saying how to do it. We are saying balance \nthe budget. You would not give us the amendment because you would not \ngive us enough votes. We are now offering the amendment. We are \noffering the opportunity to balance the budget without the amendment. \nWhat are you doing? Talking and walking. That is what they are doing, \ntalking and walking over there.\n  The Gramm amendment adds one more important component to the \nunderlying Domenici proposal that has been missing, and that is very \nsimply this. Either you want to let working Americans keep more of what \nthey earn or you do not. You want to cut taxes for families and \nbusinesses so they can have more money to invest on their kids or in \ntheir businesses or you do not. That is what the Gramm amendment is all \nabout. And I wish to commend the Senator from Texas for having the \ncourage to come up with this bold proposal because the Senator from \nTexas knows that this is the essence of the Republican contract, the \nContract With America, that was made with the American people, that put \nthe Republican Senators in the majority in this Senate and put the \nRepublicans in the majority in the House of Representatives. \nRepublicans ought to be on this floor unanimously supporting the Gramm \namendment today because without that contract and without that promise \nto the American people, you would not be in the majority. So if you \nwant to break that contract, then vote against the Gramm amendment.\n  I am talking to my colleagues on this side of the aisle because I \nknow where my colleagues are coming from on the other side of the \naisle. This amendment, the Gramm amendment, allows for a 3-percent \ngrowth in the overall budget--not a cut. The Domenici plan is 3.3. So \nfor 0.3 percent, Senator Gramm is offering businesses and families more \nmoney to invest and to provide for growth.\n  The Gramm amendment makes a statement. It says we need to enact \nincentives for Americans to save and invest, penalty free withdrawals \nfor homes, for education, medical expenses, marriage penalty tax \ncredit, cut the capital gains rate, and index it for inflation, and a \n$500 a child tax credit.\n  This is the essence of the difference between the two parties, Mr. \nPresident, as I said. The tax cuts in the Gramm proposal are paid for \nwith spending cuts. It does not undercut the Domenici proposal. It \nsimply provides deeper cuts to provide the tax benefits to the American \npeople.\n  We have seen a lot of polls lately that suggest the American people \nreally do not want tax cuts. They are asked whether we would rather \nhave tax cuts or deficit reduction. Well, of course, people will say we \nwould like to have both, and you can get both right here in this \nproposal. When it is offered either/or, they will say, fine, balance \nthe budget. We do not need the tax cuts. We will sacrifice. Balance the \nbudget.\n  This is both. This is both. Ask the American people if they would \nsupport a budget that reaches balance and gives them a capital gains \ntax. Ask the American people if they would support a budget that \nreaches balance and allows penalty-free withdrawals for education or a \ndownpayment on a loan. Ask the American people if they would support a \nbudget that reaches balance and provides a $500 tax credit for each \nchild. Ask them that and see what the answer is--not either/or, both. \nAnd that is what the Gramm amendment is all about. The choice is not \nbetween tax cuts and a balanced budget. The question is are you willing \nto cut spending enough to do both.\n  And again, the word ``cut'' is used very loosely because we are \nasking our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and some of the \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle to support a proposal that limits \nthe growth of the U.S. Government over the next 7 years to 3 percent. \nThat is what we are asking you to do.\n  You were out in the Chamber time after time after time during that \nbalanced budget amendment debate saying give us your plan; give us your \nplan; we do not need an amendment. All right, we did not get the \namendment. Where is your plan? You defeated your President's plan 99 to \nnothing joining with us on the Senate floor. I have not seen yours. I \nam hearing all this talk, but I do not see any plan.\n  Frankly, I think the American people are sick of it. They were sick \nof it in the elections in 1994, and they are going to be even sicker of \nit after this debate. We have an opportunity here. History shows us \nthat tax cuts create jobs. It is not the Government's money. It is your \nmoney. You provide it to the Government. Give the Government less. \nLeave it in your pocket, and you will create jobs, and you will employ \nmore people, and we will have more tax revenues, and we will balance \nthe budget even more quickly.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me just say every Republican Senator \nand House Member, as I said, voted against that budget, the President's \nbudget. The tax cuts included in the Gramm package total $173 billion. \nWe are getting $173 billion back out of the $250 billion tax increase \nthe President provided us last year. We do not even get as far at \ncutting taxes as Clinton went [[Page S7172]] in raising taxes. Now, \nthat is not really too much to ask.\n  So, Mr. President, let me conclude by complimenting Senator Domenici \nfor his courageous decision to meet this head on, and again to \ncompliment Senator Gramm for adding what I believe is a stronger \namendment to this package to balance the Federal budget and to cut \ntaxes, to do what the American people asked us to do when they elected \nus into the majority in November.\n  I yield back the remainder of any time I may have.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank him for his patience, and I am \npleased to yield 4 minutes to my distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I am pleased to stand up and say I think this is a bad amendment. \nWould I like a tax cut? Of course. We would all like a tax cut.\n  I have three grandchildren. I face the choice of sacrificing a little \nbit or building a better future for my three grandchildren. That is the \nfundamental choice. I do not have a hard time making that choice, and I \ndo not think the American people have a hard time making that choice.\n  Let us move to a balanced budget. I commend Pete Domenici for moving \ntoward a balanced budget. I do not happen to agree with the priorities, \nbut he is moving in that direction. But the Gramm amendment would take, \nover a 10-year period, $594 billion in tax cuts.\n  Our history on these things, on legislative answers--and this is why \nwe need the constitutional amendment--is they last for about 2 years, \nas our friend from Texas knows better than anyone else, and then they \nblow up in our face.\n  The danger is the Domenici plan will last 2 years and then we will \ndiscard it because it becomes too politically potent and we will keep \nthe tax cut.\n  When the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, says you cut taxes and \nyou get more revenue for the Federal Government, in 1981 we had both a \nRepublican--the Ronald Reagan plan--and a Democratic plan to do \nprecisely that. I voted against both the Republican plan and the \nDemocratic plan. But I can remember Ronald Reagan saying, ``If you pass \nthis, by 1984 we are going to have a balanced budget in our country.'' \nIt did not make sense. This amendment does not make sense now.\n  And to cut back from the Domenici numbers, $40 billion in Medicaid--\nwho are Medicaid recipients? Half of them are poor children. Forty \nbillion dollars we are going to get here. If anyone thinks that $40 \nbillion is not a tax cut, talk to any hospital administrator. That \nmeans we are going to cut back on what hospitals get for Medicaid. And \nwhat will hospital administrators do? They will shift it to the non-\nMedicaid, non-Medicare payment to the insurance companies, and our \ninsurance rates go up all over the country.\n  If anyone thinks that is not a tax increase, they are just fooling \nthemselves.\n  Oh, this is great politics. And my friend from Texas is good at \npolitics. I commend him for standing up frequently on the courageous \nside of things. But this one is wrong. He is wrong. It is not in the \nnational interest and his amendment should be defeated.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the junior Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, at the outset of my remarks, I would like to point out \nto the sponsor of this amendment that, without this broad-brushing, \nthese issues that a number of us on--the Senator said ``on the left''--\non this side of the aisle voted for and supported the balanced budget \namendment. In fact, Senator Simon, my senior Senator, who is leaving \nthe floor now, was an original sponsor of the balanced budget amendment \nand continued to press for that matter over the years. And so, this is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  Mr. President, we ordinarily consider tax cuts when our economy needs \neconomic stimulus, but economic growth is strong, so strong, in fact, \nthat the Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven separate times to \nensure that the economy would not overheat. And unemployment is low; \nour economy has created 6 million new jobs. Jump-starting the economy, \ntherefore, is unnecessary at this time, and cannot be the motive for \nthis amendment.\n  What is behind this amendment--as the chart over there indicates--is \nthe notion that the Federal Government is too big. Now, that is \nsomething of an arguable point. It is true, for example that national \ndefense consumed $81 billion in fiscal 1970, and increased to over $281 \nbillion by fiscal 1994. However, in 1970, the $81 billion financed over \n3 million soldiers, sailors, Air Force personnel, and marines, whereas \nthe $281 billion we spent last year financed Armed Forces only about \nhalf that amount. The large dollar increases, therefore, do not really \nrepresent growth at all.\n  It is true, of course, that as a percentage of the economy, \nGovernment has grown. The Federal Government accounted for about 19.2 \npercent of the economy in 1959, and 22 percent last year. That is an \nincrease of about 14 percent over the past 35 years. Where did that \nmoney go. Well, most of it went to Medicare and Social Security. These \ntwo programs alone increased from 2 percent of the economy in 1959 to \nover 7.2 percent in 1994--that is, they more than accounted for all of \nthe growth in Government over the last 35 years. Everything else--\ndiscretionary spending, cash, nutrition, and housing assistance for the \npoor, agriculture--almost everything else went down. The only other \nFederal activities to increase in size as a percentage of the economy \nsince 1959 are interest expense and Medicaid.\n  What these numbers all mean is that, to the extent the Federal \nGovernment has grown over the past 35 years, it has grown because \nSocial Security and Medicare have become mature programs over that \nperiod. If you ask Americans whether they would prefer a tax cut, or \nwhether they would prefer to reduce their retirement or health care \nsecurity, the answer is, I think quite obvious.\n  Now, this amendment does not quite ask that question, but it does \nraise another one: would Americans rather have a tax cut, and sacrifice \nlong-term medical care for the elderly, and medical care for the poor, \nand investment in our children's education, or would they rather give \nup the tax cuts, balance the budget, but continue to make essential \npublic investments in education, and in health. I think the answer to \nthat question is equally obvious. While Americans would very much like \nto balance the budget, they want to do so in a way that preserves \nessential investments in our future.\n  They know that the reason balancing the budget is so important is \nbecause we do not want to deprive future generations of their \nopportunity to live the American dream. And they know that trying to \nbalance the budget in a way that reduces educational opportunity and \ncuts access to health care does not meet our obligation to our \nchildren--and their children. They know that simply is not fair. They \nknow that it hurts both individuals and our country, because our future \nis diminished if every American does not have the opportunity to strive \nfor the American dream.\n  And it is not just individual Americans who know that America's \nfuture depends on making the right choice. Financial markets know it \nalso. If the Senate adopts this amendment and the tax cuts become law, \nwe will have undermined our commitment to real deficit reduction, and \nwe will have ignored our responsibility to the future of Americans and \nto America. The results of that will be continued declines in our \nnational wealth, a renewed fall of the dollar, a widening of the gap \nbetween rich and poor, and diminished opportunities for many Americans \nand for our Nation as a whole.\n  The simple truth is that we are all in this together--we are all \nAmericans--and the way we balance the budget should reflect that fact. \nA tax cut that is unneeded to stimulate our economy makes no sense. A \ntax cut that creates confusion in the minds of financial markets as to \nwhether the United States is committed to deficit reduction makes no \nsense. And a tax cut [[Page S7173]] that undermines the essential \npurpose of balancing the budget in the first place--protecting future \nopportunities for our children and our country--is not what Americans \nwant and must be defeated.\n  I would point out, my previous colleague made the point that fiscal \nyear 2002 still has a deficit here of $113 billion. It seems to me that \na $113 billion deficit is like being just a little bit pregnant. I \nbelieve we should focus our attention on deficit reduction instead of \nirresponsible promises of a chicken in every pot to make political \npoints.\n  I urge my colleagues, therefore, to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas for yielding me this time.\n  I rise in support of the Gramm amendment to the 1996 concurrent \nbudget resolution. I have said on the floor of the Senate before that, \nalong with balancing the budget, which is very important, we need to \nprovide some tax relief for all Americans, especially families.\n  Slowing the rate of growth in Federal spending is not just a \npolitical exercise or an accounting endeavor. The Federal Government is \nfinanced by the hard work of the people. If Government is to be made \nsmaller and, thus, costs less, then Americans should be able to keep \nmore of their hard-earned cash.\n  As I listened to the debate here in the Senate, it seemed to me that \nthere are Senators or a Senator that will speak for almost every group \nin the country, many times for good reasons: whether it is education or \nMedicare or the elderly or the defense program. But rarely do we have \npeople that stand up here in the Senate and speak up for the working \ntaxpaying Americans.\n  Who among us is willing to do that? Senator Gramm of Texas is willing \nto do that.\n  It seems to me if we are going to control the rate of growth in the \nFederal Government spending by over $1 trillion over the next 7 years, \nshould not the people that are paying the bills, carrying the load, \ndoing the work, get just a little bit of the relief?\n  And I want to ask my colleagues: What is it you object to in this \nlist of tax cuts? I felt very strongly that we should have had these \ntax cuts in the body of this resolution. I am pleased that we have the \ndividend that is designated for tax cuts. But I really think we should \nmake it clear that we want some of these changes. And what we are \ntalking about is some tax cuts that will encourage growth.\n  Whatever happened to the idea that one of best ways to reduce the \ndeficit is to have growth in the economy? We have heard that for years. \nPresident Clinton has even talked about that.\n  And the economists all indicate they are worried about savings. How \nabout the idea of letting the people get a little consideration to \nencourage them to save more?\n  So let us encourage investment and growth and savings. That is what \nthese tax cuts do.\n  And, also, how about a little more fairness in the Tax Code?\n   There are so many problems with the Tax Code you cannot begin to \nenumerate them all. But when you start talking about things like \nallowing wives working in the home to be able to have an individual \nretirement account, who is against that? That is fundamental fairness. \nEverybody can have an individual retirement account at certain levels \nof income, but not the spouse working in the home. To me, correction of \nthis is just basic fairness.\n\n  How about the marriage penalty credit? For years, Congress has talked \nabout how we need to get rid of this marriage penalty, and yet it just \nlives on. This tax cut would deal with that problem.\n  What about the idea of our elderly? We have a lot of our elderly who \nwould like to keep working. But now if they keep working, many times \nwhen they need it and when we need them, they get penalized.\n  These tax cuts would include, among other good things, raising the \nSocial Security earnings test threshold. We should do that. I would \nlike to eliminate it, but this proposal would take the threshold up to \n$30,000.\n  So you see, we are talking about some things that will help families \nand wives, married couples, small businesses and our elderly in a real \nway.\n  We have a provision in here that would provide small businesses \nestate and gift tax relief. The people who own small businesses run the \nrisk of losing everything they have or affecting what they do because \nof these tax penalties.\n  And we should have the capital gains tax rate cut. When I go home and \nI ask the people of all backgrounds and economic stations in life, \nshould we have a capital gains rate cut, ``Absolutely,'' they say, we \nshould do that. It never ceases to amaze me that in Washington, DC, a \ncapital gains tax rate cut is fought. But out where people are creating \nthe jobs and when they want to be able to sell timber or timberland, \nthey understand that a capital gains tax rate cut would help them and \nwould help the economy and would create jobs. But not in Washington, \nno.\n  What about the $500 tax credit per child? Why do we not want to let \nthe families with children keep a little bit more of their own money, \nlet them decide how they want to spend money for clothing and schools \nand food for their children? Oh, no, it is much better to have a \nprogram from Washington that does it for you or tells you how you must \ndo it. This would allow the decisions to go back to the families with \nchildren. Let them decide how to spend their money.\n  I want to point out that this is not an insignificant consideration \neither. It really would make a difference in the family income. I would \nlike to have printed in the Record, Mr. President--it may have already \nbeen done, but I want to make sure it is in here--an article in the \nWashington Post on May 16 by James K. Glassman entitled ``Yes, Cut \nTaxes.'' I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Yes, Cut Taxes\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n       Critics of the Republican budget in the press, Congress and \n     the White House may be drastically underestimating the \n     power--both political and economic--of those tax cuts the \n     House passed in April. I know I did.\n       First, a little history. The Republicans won the November \n     congressional elections, using a contract that pledged a \n     balanced budget and a tax cut.\n       President Clinton figured they couldn't do it, so his \n     strategy was to sit back and let them take the heat for \n     overreaching. His February budget opted for the status quo, \n     which means annual deficits of $200 billion-plus forever.\n       Now, the Republicans are offering their official budget \n     plans, and--whaddaya know?--they show they can indeed balance \n     the budget by their target year, the palindromic 2002. And \n     they can do it by increasing spending in each year by an \n     average of $45 billion.\n       But skeptics see two problems. The first is Medicare. \n     Republicans want to increase spending on the program by about \n     6 percent annually instead of 10 percent. In Washington \n     parlance, this is a ``cut'' of $280 billion, so it's not \n     expected to be easy to sell.\n       The second problem is tax cuts. Sen. Pete Domenici (R-\n     N.M.), who heads the Senate Budget Committee, said Sunday, \n     ``We don't have a tax cut until we balance the budget.'' But \n     his House counterpart, Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), things, the \n     country can have both at the same time.\n       The trouble with tax cuts is that they're hard to justify \n     at the same time you're ordering painful limits--and some \n     outright reductions--in spending. Also, it's likely that a \n     total restructuring of the tax system (a flat tax or a \n     national sales tax) will be a big issue in next year's \n     presidential election. So why piecemeal changes now?\n       In the past, I made these same arguments in urging Congress \n     to shelve the tax cuts. But that was before I did something \n     that most journalists (and even politicians) still haven't \n     done: I took a close look at the tax bill.\n       Now I'm changing my mind. The tax changes are a political \n     plus--and likely an economic plus as well. Once Americans \n     understand them (and few do now) they're apt to become very, \n     very enthusiastic. Reluctant politicians risk being trampled.\n       The two main provisions of the tax bill, H.R. 1215, are \n     these:\n       (1) Nearly every family with children can reduce its final \n     tax bill by $500 per kid.\n       For example, the average household headed by a married \n     couple has an income of about $50,000 a year. If that family \n     has three children, its current federal income tax bill, \n     according to a study by Price Waterhouse, is $4,643.\n       But if H.R. 1215 becomes law, the family's tax bill well be \n     reduced by $1,500--to $3,143, a [[Page S7174]] cut of a \n     whopping 32 percent. Such a family with two children would \n     save 20 percent, with four children, 47 percent.\n       These are huge cuts, perhaps unprecedented in U.S. fiscal \n     history. Yet I doubt that most Americans know much about \n     them. The press coverage of H.R. 1215 earlier this year was \n     dominated by a specious controversy over whether tax relief \n     benefited the wealthy. Of course, it does--but only if the \n     rich are willing to invest their money, not spent it. Which \n     brings us to the second element . . .\n       (2) Taxes on capital gains will be cut dramatically.\n       This is the part that's meant to encourage investing, and \n     it's a fact that most investing is done by families with \n     higher incomes. But the capital gains cuts in H.R. 1215 \n     aren't a replay of the Reagan tax cuts, which didn't work as \n     advertised.\n       Those 1986 cuts lowered the tax rates on income (salaries, \n     bonuses, interest on bonds) but actually raised the rates on \n     capital gains (profits from the sales of assets like stocks \n     and real estate). As a result, the changes encouraged \n     consumption, but not investment. In fact, the paltry U.S. \n     savings rate actually fell.\n       The changes in the tax bill the House passed in April are \n     directly targeted at investment--and they're extremely \n     powerful.\n       The bill does two things: First, it reduces a family's \n     capital gains rate to one-half of its income-tax rate. So, if \n     you're in a 28 percent bracket (taxable income of $38,000 to \n     $92,000 for a couple filing jointly), you'll pay just 14 \n     percent on your stock profits.\n       Second, the bill indexes capital gains, which means that \n     you only pay taxes on real profits, not on inflation. \n     Indexing can produce huge tax savings--but only for long-term \n     investors. And long-term investors are what the U.S. economy \n     desperately needs; they provide the capital that creates good \n     jobs.\n       Consider a family with taxable income of $80,000 a year \n     that buys 200 shares of Wal-Mart at $25 a share, holds the \n     stock for six years, then sells it for $50 a share--a profit \n     of $5,000.\n       Right now, taxes would be $1,400 (28 percent of $5,000). \n     But under H.R. 1215, if inflation over those six years \n     averaged about 3 percent, the family would pay tax only on \n     its ``real'' (non-inflationary) gain--on $4,000 rather than \n     on $5,000. And the rate would be just 14 percent. So the tax \n     bill would be $560 instead of $1,400, a reduction of 60 \n     percent.\n       Would capital gains cuts of that magnitude entice Americans \n     to save and invest rather than to consume? It's a good bet.\n       The tax changes in H.R. 1215 would mean that the Treasury \n     would receive about $80 billion less revenue in 2002 than it \n     now expects. That's a shortfall of about 4 percent that would \n     have to be met with extra spending restraint. is the trade-\n     off worth it? It's more and more clear the answer is yes.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I quote from that article I think the most \npertinent part:\n\n       (1) Nearly every family with children can reduce its final \n     tax bill by $500 per kid.\n       For example, the average household headed by a married \n     couple has an income of about $50,000 a year.\n\n  Not rich folks; these are middle-income, working people.\n\n       If that family has three children, its current Federal \n     income tax bill, according to a study by Price Waterhouse, is \n     $4,643.\n       But if--\n\n  This amendment is added to the budget resolution--\n\n       The family's tax bill will be reduced by $1,500--to $3,143, \n     a cut of a whopping 32 percent. Such a family with two \n     children would save 20 percent, with four children, 47 \n     percent.\n\n  This is a significant move to help families with children.\n  So, Mr. President, when I look down the list of provisions in this \ntax cut, I ask--in fact, I challenge--Senators to come out here and \ntell me which one of these they are against.\n  Are you against providing tax incentives for the purchase of long-\nterm care insurance? How about a home office deduction for small \nbusiness men and women, individual entrepreneurs that work out of their \nhomes? Everybody else gets a deduction for office expenses but not if \nyou work in your home. More and more Americans are doing that, are able \nto do that, or are going to have to do it in the future.\n  So I think there are many good provisions in this legislation. I urge \nthe Senate to support it. It does have the support of a number of \ngroups that are interested in encouraging growth and savings in the \nbusiness community. The Heritage Foundation indicated that 490,563 \nchildren in my State of Mississippi would be eligible for the per child \ncredit that I spoke of a moment ago. That means almost $245.3 million \nof this hard-earned cash would be returned to the families in my State.\n  In President Clinton's home State of Arkansas, there are 458,547 \nchildren who would benefit from the per child tax credit. That is about \n$229 million more than Arkansas families will get back without this tax \ncredit.\n  So I think, Mr. President, we have an opportunity to really help the \neconomy and to help the families in this country. We should add this \namendment to the resolution. Then, when we go to conference, while \nthere still would be some differences, we could work out those \ndifferences and have tax relief in this very important legislation.\n  So I urge the support of the Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a series \nof letters in the Record in support of the amendment by the National \nTaxpayers Union, by Citizens for a Sound Economy, by the Christian \nCoalition, by Traditional Values Coalition, by the Family Research \nCouncil, by Concerned Women of America, by the Business and Industrial \nCouncil, and by the National Federation of Independent Business.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The 300,000-member National Taxpayers Union \n     (NTU) strongly supports the FY 1996 Budget Resolution (S. \n     Con. Res. 13) as reported by the Senate Budget Committee. A \n     vote FOR the Committee's Budget Resolution will be scored as \n     one of the most heavily-weighted pro-taxpayer votes in our \n     1995 Rating of Congress. NTU opposes any attempts to increase \n     the spending projected in the Budget Resolution. ``No'' votes \n     on such amendments will likewise be included as pro-taxpayer \n     votes in our Rating.\n       We are pleased that for the first time in fifteen years the \n     Senate Budget Committee has reported a Budget Resolution to \n     balance the budget without raising taxes. While the Budget \n     Committee has outlined significant spending cuts, the final \n     proposals will be drafted by the authorizing and \n     appropriations committees. The Committee has made suggestions \n     that NTU has supported for many years, including the \n     termination or privatization of many government programs. It \n     also begins the long-overdue process of reforming Medicare, \n     which is headed for bankruptcy in a few years.\n       Unless current trends change soon, funding increases in \n     major entitlement programs will slash the after-tax income of \n     the average American worker by almost 60% over the next 45 \n     years. After-tax income would plunge from $19,000 in 1995 to \n     $7,821 in 2040. As bleak as this projection may seem, it is \n     based on an optimistic assumption that pre-tax incomes will \n     rise faster over the next 45 years than they have over the \n     past 20. This spending growth is not sustainable, and if \n     allowed to grow unchecked will permanently damage our \n     children's hope for a better future.\n       In the world economy, the advent of the Information \n     Revolution will give a huge advantage to efficient \n     governments. Because computers allow most economic \n     transactions to occur literally anywhere, competition between \n     jurisdictions expands by the day. That necessitates a \n     revolution in the way government is financed and a radical \n     downsizing of its activities. The budget restraint in this \n     resolution will force necessary reexamination and reform of \n     many government programs.\n       While we fully support the Budget Resolution, we are \n     disappointed that it does not project passage of the \n     important tax reduction proposals that the House passed last \n     month. Therefore, we support an amendment by Senator Phil \n     Gramm and others that would further restrain spending growth, \n     accommodate most of the House-passed tax cuts, and still \n     balance the budget by 2002. It is vitally important that \n     Congress also reduce the tax burden on middle-class taxpayers \n     and the present tax disincentives for savings, investment, \n     and economic growth. The typical American taxpayer has to \n     work until May 6 this year just to pay his federal, state, \n     and local taxes. Overburdened taxpayers expect and deserve \n     substantial relief from this crushing tax load. A vote for \n     the Gramm amendment will be included as pro-taxpayer vote in \n     our Rating.\n       Through almost 200 years of American history, our leaders \n     strove to follow Thomas Jefferson's wise advice: ``We shall \n     consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our \n     debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.'' Passage of \n     the Budget Resolution is essential if Congress hopes to \n     restore a fiscally sound future for the next generation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Keating,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Citizens for a\n\n\n                                                Sound Economy,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I am writing on behalf of the 250,000 \n     members of Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) to register our \n     support for your proposal to balance the budget by 2002 by \n     cutting taxes and slowing federal spending \n     growth. [[Page S7175]] \n       In order to encourage a growing economy that creates new, \n     high-paying jobs and rising living standards for our children \n     and grandchildren, we must bring federal spending under \n     control. Your proposal does this by limiting federal spending \n     increases to 3.3 percent per year. Cutting taxes and capping \n     the dollars available for the federal government to spend \n     would mean more dollars for American families to spend. \n     Letting Americans spend and invest their money as they like, \n     instead of allowing the government to spend their money for \n     them, is one of the best things Congress could do to \n     strengthen our economy.\n       Americans are faced with chronic federal budget deficits \n     because of ever-increasing government spending. CSE strongly \n     supports your plan because it would cut taxes and help bring \n     federal spending under control, thereby resulting in the \n     first balanced budget in a generation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Christian Coalition,\n\n\n                                          Capitol Hill Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.5 million members and \n     supporters of the Christian Coalition, I am writing to urge \n     your support for Senator Phil Gramm's proposed substitute \n     amendment to the Concurrent Budget Resolution for FY '96 when \n     it comes to the floor next week. This amendment will provide \n     for tax relief and growth incentives as promised in the \n     Contract With America.\n       The American family has repeatedly been promised tax \n     relief, only to see those promises broken. That is why the \n     recent passage by the House of Representatives of the family \n     tax relief promised in the Contract With America was \n     particularly gratifying. But the American people do not make \n     differentiations between the House and the Senate--they only \n     know that Republicans campaigned on the Contract With America \n     and that the 1994 elections were a mandate to the Republican \n     party to pass the Contract. That is why we are writing today \n     to urge the Senate to stick with the tax relief promised in \n     the Contract With America.\n       Although all Americans have been impacted by today's high \n     taxation level, families with children have particularly felt \n     the impact due to the diminished value of the personal \n     exemption. The personal exemption protected 68 percent of the \n     average family of four's earnings from taxation in 1948, but \n     it has not kept up with inflation and higher income. If it \n     had done so, it would today be between $7,000 and $8,000. The \n     American family pays more in federal, state, and local taxes, \n     than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.\n       It is important to remember that in asking for the $500 per \n     child tax credit, families are not asking for a new subsidy, \n     a new entitlement, or a new spending program from the \n     government. They are asking to keep more of their own hard-\n     earned income in order to raise their families.\n       We urge the Senate to put families first and support the \n     Gramm substitute amendment when it comes to the floor next \n     week. This is the family dividend of budget reduction. Thank \n     you for your attention to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ralph E. Reed, Jr.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                 Traditional Values Coalition,\n\n                                                     May 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm. Next week the Senate will begin \n     consideration of the budget resolution. On behalf of \n     Traditional Values Coalition's 31,000 member churches I am \n     writing to urge you to support Senator Phil Gramm's \n     amendment.\n       For too long special interests have had more clout and \n     control over the budget process than working families. In \n     addition, over the last few decades Washington has shown a \n     lack of financial discipline, forcing working families to \n     shoulder the burden of increased government spending and \n     higher taxes. Traditional Values Coalition believes that it \n     is now time for Congress to change its priorities and focus \n     by providing tax relief to the parents of 52 million \n     children. With the passage of the Contract with America, the \n     Houses has acknowledged this injustice toward working \n     families. I hope the Senate will as well.\n       Senator Gramm's amendment will restrain the growth in \n     federal spending by $94 billion over five years and provide \n     desperately needed tax relief for 29 million hardworking \n     families. TVC believes cuts in wasteful government spending \n     will pay for the family tax relief. These spending cuts \n     should come from eliminating hundreds of programs ranging \n     from the Uranium Enrichment program ($1.6 billion) to the \n     National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities ($1.4 billion) \n     and by privatizing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \n     ($1 billion).\n       In the 1950's, the average American family paid 3% of their \n     income in federal taxes. Today, the average family sends 25% \n     of its income to Washington. It is outrageous that the \n     average working family pays more to the tax man than it \n     spends on shelter, food and clothing.\n       Traditional Values Coalition believes that working families \n     are better equipped to make decisions on how to spend their \n     own money than bureaucrats in Washington. Working families \n     are not asking for anything special or an entitlement. They \n     are simply asking for the government to return what \n     rightfully belongs to them--their hard earned money.\n       Traditional Values Coalition considers Senator Gramm's \n     amendment pro-family and pro-growth. Last year Congress put \n     spending first, this year put families first.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Rev. Louis P. Sheldon,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to express my support for an \n     amendment Senator Gramm plans to offer to the budget \n     resolution when it reaches the Senate floor later this month. \n     The amendment would significantly reduce the tax burden on \n     America's families by adopting a $500 per-child tax credit \n     and a variety of other tax measures (including a deduction \n     for adoption expenses, spousal IRA benefits, etc.) which are \n     very much needed.\n       The Gramm proposal allows the Senate to adopt the ``crown \n     jewel'' of the House GOP's Contract With America. It \n     recognizes that the electoral revolution that occurred last \n     November 8 was driven in no small part by a desire on the \n     part of the American people to see the size of government \n     reduced and the amount of disposal income available for their \n     use increased.\n       As you know, the 1986 White House Working Group on the \n     Family that I chaired for President Reagan had as its central \n     recommendation a dramatic increase in per-child tax benefits. \n     The Senate has an historic opportunity to address this long \n     overlooked area of tax law and to demonstrate to the American \n     people that it is working to make the kinds of changes \n     Americans voted for last November.\n       While I recognize that some legislators perceive tax relief \n     to be at odds with the important goal of deficit reduction, \n     it is important to point that the Gramm proposal--like the \n     House GOP Contract--provides both significant tax relief and \n     significant deficit reduction. As such, it recognizes that \n     these two important goals are not mutually exclusive.\n       I urge you, therefore, to enthusiastically support Senator \n     Gramm's efforts. Please let me know if you would like \n     additional information about this subject from me or any \n     member of my staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gary L. Bauer,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   Concerned Women\n\n\n                                                  for America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: Concerned Women for America is the \n     nation's largest pro-family women's organization with over \n     600,000 members. For many years CWA has worked on legislative \n     efforts to allow American families to keep more of their \n     hard-earned money. Thus, we have worked diligently in favor \n     of the $500-per-child tax credit, homemaker IRA equity, and \n     tax credits for adoption expenses.\n       We are very disturbed by the increased tax burden on \n     families which often compels both parents to enter the work \n     force in order to make financial ends meet. In 1948 the \n     median family of four paid only two percent to of its income \n     to the federal government in taxes. However, in 1989 the same \n     family paid nearly 24 percent in federal taxes. Adding on \n     state and local taxes, over one-third of that family's income \n     will be spent on taxes.\n       Families in your state need you to stand firm on their \n     behalf. The House GOP ``Contract With America'' was passed \n     because the voters made their voices heard last November. Tax \n     relief for families was a vital component that helped to \n     spark that revolution. Now it is time for the Senate to do \n     its part to fight for families. Otherwise, the Senate will \n     shoulder the voters' outrage and become the weak link in the \n     fight for smaller government and less taxes.\n       CWA cannot compromise on this principle. This issue is not \n     about class warfare. It is arrogant and baseless to assert \n     that government cannot afford to allow families to keep more \n     of their own money. Families should not have to suffer for \n     the appalling lack of discipline and will in Congress to cut \n     federal spending!\n       Please join Concerned Women for American in supporting the \n     Gramm amendment to the Senate Budget. CWA members in your \n     state, and all America's families, will remember your vote.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Beverly LaHaye,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                              Business and Industrial Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: In recent testimony to the \n     Congressional Joint Economic Committee, Milton Friedman has \n     calculated the aggregate cost of direct and indirect \n     government expenditures at a staggering 50 percent of \n     national output. About half of the [[Page S7176]] U.S. Gross \n     Domestic Product is taken in taxes by the government at the \n     federal, state, and local levels, including the costs of \n     complying with excessive government regulations. Moreover, \n     the Institute for Policy Innovation states that 50 percent of \n     the average family's budget goes to pay taxes to all levels \n     of government. Clearly, the federal government is far too big \n     and is taking too much from our economy. The Congress needs \n     to drastically cut spending and also cut taxes.\n       USBIC strongly supports your proposed amendment to the \n     Senate Budget Resolution which would cut spending further in \n     order to achieve the crucially important tax cuts already \n     passed by the House as part of the Contract with America. \n     Your amendment would combine the savings from lowering non-\n     defense discretionary spending ($117 billion over seven \n     years) beyond the reductions already in the Senate Budget \n     Committee Resolution, with Medicaid savings derived from \n     accelerating the decrease in the rate of growth in Medicaid. \n     In addition, your amendment would use the ``dividend'' \n     projected by the Congressional Budget Office resulting from \n     balancing the budget by 2002. All of these additional \n     spending cuts and savings would be combined to pay for $173 \n     billion in tax reductions over five years. We are delighted \n     that your amendment would preserve the following crucial tax \n     cuts already in the Contract--capital gains tax reduction and \n     indexing, small business estate and gift tax relief, small \n     business expensing, and repeal of the corporate alternate \n     minimum tax. USBIC believes that the capital gains tax cut \n     alone, if scored dynamically rather than statically, will \n     increase revenues by $150 billion over five years, thereby \n     in-and-of itself almost paying for all the other tax cuts yet \n     a second time.\n       We represent 1000 small and medium-sized, mostly family-\n     owned businesses nationwide. As you know, such businesses \n     employ half of our nation's workforce and create two thirds \n     of all new jobs. Such businesses are the bedrock of the \n     nation's economy, yet they are being severely squeezed by \n     high taxes and excessive regulations. Your amendment \n     preserving the vitally needed House tax cuts will strongly \n     improve the nation's economy by stimulating investment, \n     growth, and new jobs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kevin L. Kearns,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to support your amendment, the Contract \n     with America Tax Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act, to the \n     FY 1996 Budget Resolution.\n       For the first time in decades, the Congress is debating a \n     resolution that puts the federal budget on a permanent path \n     to a balanced federal budget. Your amendment would make \n     possible significant tax relief for American families and \n     small businesses while balancing the budget by the year 2002. \n     It returns hard-earned money to families and small businesses \n     who know best how to spend it.\n       NFIB members strongly support a balanced federal budget and \n     believe their taxes should be reduced. High taxes \n     consistently rank at the top of the list of concerns for \n     small business owners in surveys conducted by the NFIB \n     Education Foundation.\n       Important tax relief for small business includes: small \n     business and family farm estate tax relief, incentives for \n     retirement savings, and capital gains tax reduction and \n     indexing. Your plan includes all of these proposals and more.\n       We applaud your efforts and look forward to working with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska.\n  Let me just begin by stating something that may put me within the \nminority here. I am opposed to all tax cuts in this bill, not because I \nam opposed to tax cuts. I think they ought to all be postponed--that is \nmy own view--whether they come from one source or another. If we are \nhonestly dealing with deficit reduction, tax cuts ought not be on the \ntable.\n  But I do want to rise and express my opposition to the particular \nproposal being offered today because I think it is particularly \negregious and creates serious problems for our country.\n  My colleague from Texas, with whom I serve on the Banking Committee, \nhas often and very colorfully talked about who is in the wagon and \noutside the wagon. I raise here a picture of the good old chuck wagon. \nI call it the Republican tax cut wagon.\n  I am going to use the wagon metaphor to explain to people, if I can, \nwhat we are talking about with this proposal. The wagon metaphor is a \npotent one.\n  If we apply it to the Contract With America's tax cut, I think people \nwill get a clear picture of what we are talking about. If you take off \nthe wagon's cover and show what is inside this tax-cut wagon, you get a \nclear picture of what is occurring.\n  More than 51 percent of those riding in this tax-cut wagon are the \nwealthiest 12 percent of our population in this country earning more \nthan $100,000 a year. In fact, the richest 1 percent, the best off of \nthe population, of those earning over $350,000 will reap, under this \nproposal, an average windfall of $20,000 in tax breaks. People earning \nover $200,000 will receive a tax break in excess of $11,000. Is it any \nwonder that a recent Wall Street Journal article described the House \nGOP tax-cut package, much of what we are voting on today, in these \nwords, and I quote the Wall Street Journal:\n\n        Don't do anything yet, but start salivating. The tax bill \n     passed Wednesday by the House of Representatives could turn \n     out to be the biggest tax-saving bonanza in years for upper-\n     income Americans.\n\n  While the tax-cut package represents a bonanza to the very well off, \nfamilies earning $20,000 to $30,000--this area down here, Mr. \nPresident--will have their tax cut by only $247 per year. Those earning \n$30,000 to $50,000 will get a tax cut of $569 a year. That is about \n$1.50 a day.\n  Collectively, these families, shown in orange on the chart, represent \n35 percent of all American families, but they will receive less than 15 \npercent of the benefits under this tax cut.\n  The least affluent, 25 percent of American families, earning less \nthan $20,000 a year, shown in red, Mr. President, this thin column \nhere, will receive a tax cut of $20 to $90 a year.\n  Now that we have a better understanding of who is riding in the \nwagon, let us take a look at who is truly pulling the weight. The \ncontract's tax cut package will cost $345 billion over 7 years and $639 \nbillion over 10 years. How is this going to be paid for? By some of the \nmost draconian, in my view, cuts presented on the floor of this body. \nMedicare recipients who have a median income of $17,000 will pay an \nadditional $3,200 in the next 7 years.\n  I do not argue the fact that Medicare needs to be addressed, but we \nmight be more creative in solving that problem than using those dollars \nto pay for a tax cut, as I pointed out earlier, that goes to upper-\nincome people. After decades of hard work, the seniors face retirement \nyears full of anxiety--all of us know it--and squeezed by medical \nbills. Medicare problems are a symptom of a larger problem. It did not \ncreate the problem. More than 12 million working families will have to \npay higher taxes because of the Republican proposal to cut some $21 \nbillion from the earned income tax credit, a program that President \nRonald Reagan called ``one of the best programs we can possibly have to \noffer to the working poor in this country.''\n  In Connecticut, these cuts will increase taxes on 87,000 working \nfamilies by an average of $1,400 over 7 years. College students, Mr. \nPresident, will see the cost of a diploma rise by anywhere from $2,000 \nto $5,000 as a result of cuts in the student loan interest subsidy and \nother programs.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, it is the height of hypocrisy to bemoan \nthe fact that some Americans are riding in the wagon while others are \npulling and then turn around and offer a massive tax cut and ask \nworking families, students, and seniors to foot the bill for a tax \nbreak for the more affluent in our society.\n  Mr. President, I just feel, here again--and I say this with all due \nrespect to my colleagues that are proposing this--this is not a time \nfor this kind of a tax cut here at all. We cannot afford it. Deficit \nreduction ought to be the name of the game. If we are going to have \ndeficit reduction, if we are going to ask people to pay, then to offer \n12 percent of the American population to become a beneficiary of 51 \npercent of this break, it seems to me ill-advised and wrongheaded. \n[[Page S7177]] \n  My hope is that this amendment will be rejected and we will come \ntogether around a sound budget alternative. I thank my colleague from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would like to say to my dear colleague \nfrom Connecticut that that is a fine looking wagon.\n  Mr. DODD. Not if you look on the inside of it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is beautiful both inside and out.\n  I would like to make a couple of simple points. No. 1, our colleagues \nalways get confused when we are talking about tax cuts. They are always \nthinking about welfare. So they cannot understand when we cut taxes \nthat people who do not pay any taxes do not get a tax cut. Those people \nare already riding in the wagon. I did not see 40 million people on \nwelfare riding in that wagon. I did not see $350 billion taken away \nlast year from working people to give to the people riding in the \nwagon.\n  When our colleague says that someone with a certain income level only \ngot a $120 tax reduction, since the credit is $1,000 for a two-child \nfamily, that means they were only paying $120 in taxes. Tax cuts are \nfor people who are paying taxes. In terms of all this business about \nrich people, I go back to my point: How can we be a country that loves \njobs and hates the people that create them? The only way rich people \nwill benefit from the capital gains tax rate is to invest money and be \nsuccessful. If they invest money and they are successful and they do \ncreate jobs and the Federal Government takes a substantial portion of \nwhat they earn, why should they not benefit? What is wrong with \nprofits? Is America the only country in the world as we are going into \nthe 21st century where capitalism is a dirty word?\n  This is something I do not understand. This is a different \nperspective on America than I have ever seen. Again, I think it does \nclearly define the vision that I am talking about versus the old and \ntired vision which has dominated American Government for 40 years. It \nis almost as if it is better to have people in misery as long as we can \nrub everybody's nose in it, rather than trying to create incentives for \neconomic growth. Redistributing wealth does not solve poverty. Creating \nwealth does solve it, and that is what the debate is about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished floor manager. \nLet me say, first of all, capitalism is not a dirty word. Crazy \nbudgeting is what is crazy. It is not dirty, but it is crazy. Everybody \nin this body is always saying, ``This is what the people want. They \nwant term limits, and they want a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget.''\n  Let me show you what 70 percent of the people in this country want. \nThis chart shows a USA Today poll which asks, ``Do you prefer deficit \nreduction or tax cuts?'' Seventy percent say that if we are going to \ncut spending, we should apply it toward deficit reduction. That's \nalmost three times the number of people who prefer tax cuts.\n  So what are we doing here? We are thwarting the obvious will of the \npeople. The amendment of the Senator from Texas reminds me of turning a \nchild loose in a candy store. I cannot think of anything in this \namendment that I would not love to vote for, except the very regressive \npart of the tax which rewards the rich and takes from the poor. The \nSenator's amendment has a new IRA, it has a deduction for caring for \nthe elderly. It has all kinds of tax breaks that I would love to vote \nfor. But Mr. President, we cannot afford this, and the people of this \ncountry do not believe it is possible to have these tax cuts and \nbalance the budget, too.\n  When I ride home on an airplane, I talk to the people around me, and \nthey say, ``Senator, the thing that troubles me about you Democrats is \nyou engage in class warfare.'' I hear that very often. I suppose Rush \nLimbaugh has talked about it, otherwise, so many people would not be \ntalking about it.\n  But who is really engaging in class warfare here? Look at what the \namendment of the Senator from Texas does. It gives a whopping $124 a \nyear to people who make zero to $30,000 a year. That is a pizza every \nthird Friday night. And when you take away the earned income tax \ncredit, they pay a lot more. They not only do not get the $124, they \nwind up losing a substantial amount every year. But what about people \nwho make over $200,000 a year? What kind of tax cut would they get out \nof this amendment? They would get a cut of $11,266. Why, Robin Hood \nwould be whirling in his grave--taking from the poor to give to the \nrich.\n  They say, ``You Democrats talk too much about class warfare.'' If \nthat is not class warfare, I do not know what is.\n  Mr. President, the last time we had a balanced budget was when Lyndon \nJohnson dumped the Social Security trust fund into the budget. And \nsince that time, we have had integrated budgets. Social Security has \nbeen counted. Otherwise, the deficit would have been much, much bigger. \nSo what do we do under this budget? We are going to take $600 billion \nof Social Security funds over the next 7 years to pretend to the \nAmerican people that we have achieved a balanced budget.\n And the Senator from Texas comes with an amendment that will only cost \n$350 billion--talk about deja vu. I heard all of this in 1981, $3.5 \ntrillion ago, how we can cut taxes and balance the budget.\n\n  Mr. President, I divinely hope our colleagues will not accept this \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have one or two speakers scheduled to \ncome. I will make a few comments before recognizing those who indicated \nthey would like to speak on this subject.\n  Let me say that the debate has been very interesting and very \nchallenging. I will simply say that I hope all Senators will realize \nand recognize that this is a very key amendment that we must defeat if \nwe are going to truly balance the budget and not try to fool the \nAmerican people.\n  Time and time again, it has been said that we cannot have a tax cut \nand balance the budget, too. I reference once again the fact that I was \nhearing the same story on the floor of the Senate in the early 1980's \nwhen a massive tax cut was proposed at the same time the President of \nthe United States was going to balance the budget in 4 years.\n  Now, I think the President of the United States at that time was just \nnot well informed. I happen to think that the numbers simply will not \nadd up. I think most realistic people will say, while it would be \nnice--this Senator and everyone on this side and certainly everyone on \nthat side would like to have the opportunity to provide a tax cut--the \noverriding problem in America today is the deficit.\n  Certainly, this Senator would be the first one to join the bandwagon \nfor a tax cut that was targeted at middle-income America. Certainly, \nthe $500 credit for school-age children would be one that I would be \nattracted to.\n  I have to say, as a fiscal conservative, and I think no one can \nquestion that, as one who voted for the balanced budget amendment, the \nlast big vote we had in the Senate with regard to who wants to get \nthings done, I simply say that I believe the measure being offered by \nthe Senator from Texas, which is an incorporation of Speaker Gingrich's \ncrown jewel of America, as far as the Contract With America is \nconcerned, is simply unrealistic. I hope very much it will be defeated.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield to me \nfor a question.\n  Mr. EXON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I used this chart a while ago and the \nSenator from Texas did not yield for a question. This chart is page 7 \nof the budget resolution that is before the Senate.\n  I ask the Senator from Nebraska if this is not accurate. I notice \nthat the Senator from Texas says, ``With this plan of ours, the budget \nis balanced. So now, we will go give tax cuts.'' Of course, tax cuts \nfor the wealthy but, nonetheless, tax cuts.\n  Page 7 of the budget resolution says ``Deficits.'' On line 21, the \nyear 2002, a $113 billion deficit remaining in the year 2002.\n  Is it not true that this budget resolution does not come to the floor \nsaying we balanced the budget; it comes to the floor saying we have a \n$113 billion deficit in the year 2002?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I answer my colleague from North Dakota by \n[[Page S7178]] saying he is absolutely correct. The figures that he \ncites are in the budget resolution.\n  What I think the Senator from North Dakota fails to recognize is that \nthe tooth fairy is going to take care of that deficit. With that \nexplanation, I am sure that the Senator will be fully satisfied.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I guess one of the things that is always frustrating about \npolitical debate is that it is so seldom that we will really talk about \nthe issues that are involved. So we have drifted far afield from those \nissues.\n  I would like to go back and try to set them all in perspective. I am \ngoing to reserve my final moments to conclude the debate, and I will \nallow the Democrats to speak until their time has expired.\n  First of all, this is not a debate about balancing the budget versus \ncutting taxes. I am not proposing to cut taxes, except to the degree \nthat spending is being cut beyond the level contained in the budget \nresolution.\n  I am proposing, if we look at this chart, very simply to do this: The \nred line here starts off with the Federal Government spending roughly \n$1.5 trillion this year. It shows how much the Government can spend \nover the next 7 years and still balance the unified budget of the \nUnited States of America.\n  What I am proposing is to cut spending below that level so that \nrather than the Federal Government investing in the education of our \nchildren, families can invest in the education of our children; only \nthe families will know the names of the children they are investing in. \nOnly the families will have a stake directly in those children.\n  My proposal is to cut Government spending on things like Government \nsubsidies to business, so we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so \nthat we can provide incentives for investment decisions to be made by \npeople who are going to benefit or lose in those investment decisions, \nso that the marketplace, based on competition and efficiency, can make \ninvestment decisions.\n  With regard to the debate about the income level of the people paying \nthe taxes, the point is if we give a $500 tax credit per child in \nAmerica, if someone is not paying $500 worth of taxes, they do not get \nthe tax credit.\n  But then what we are trying to do is to deal with a problem that in \n1950, the average family with two children was sending 1 out of every \n$50 it earned to Washington for the Congress to spend; today the \naverage family in America with two children is sending $1 out of every \n$4 to Washington for the Congress to spend. I want to let families \nspend more of their own money on their own children for their own \nfuture. That is what this debate is about.\n  If we ask people if they want to balance the budget or cut taxes, \nthey say balance the budget. I agree. If we ask do I want my children \nto be healthy or do I want them to go to college, I want them to be \nhealthy. When their health is secured, I then want them to go to \ncollege. I do not have only one objective for my children.\n  We have set out a budget that balances the budget. What I am \nproposing to do is to cut Government spending further, eliminate the \nFederal Department of Education, reduce subsidies to business and cut \ntaxes by that amount so that families can invest more of their own \nmoney rather than having Government spend their money for them, and cut \nthe capital gains tax rate and let businesses invest their money as \nthey see fit, rather than us subsidizing businesses to invest money \nwhere we would like it to be invested.\n  That is what this debate is about. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  I think we are getting down to where this debate is all going to be \nin the Record and the decisions will have been made. It focuses or \ncenters around a couple of fairly narrow issues, as I see them.\n  We can discuss forever whether there were tax cuts intended when the \nBudget Committee passed the resolution on the floor, or whether there \nwere not; and at times, it was said in the slip of a tongue that, yes, \nthey were for tax cuts; no, they were not for tax cuts because the \nFinance Committee was going to be making its decision. It was just \ngoing to be kind of set aside, $170 billion set aside that would be \nthere to provide savings, but everybody knew it was there, but for the \nwink of an eye was reserved for tax cuts.\n  Today we have heard a debate about the real thing. We have come face \nto face, finally, with what the issue is. The issue, very simply, is \nwhether or not we are going to deprive people of programs that are \nessential; that is, to take care of those seniors who are beneficiaries \nof Medicare, to make sure that Medicaid has the funding so that in \nplaces like Newark, NJ, and throughout this country, hospitals that \nderive 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent of their income from Medicaid \nbecause they serve a poverty-stricken population will not have to \nclose.\n  We want to do that, as I hear the argument today, so that we can take \ncare of the tax cuts that benefit primarily those in the upper income \nlevels.\n  As a matter of fact, roughly, for every person earning $350,000 it is \nestimated by Treasury that there will be a $20,000 reduction in taxes. \nThat is a pretty hefty present at the end of the year, $20,000, while \nthey are asking senior citizens who, on average, 75 percent of them, \nmake $25,000 a year or less, who are totally dependent on $25,000 a \nyear or less for their income and, on top of that, are having to \nsupplement their Medicare Program with about 20 percent of their \nincome, or roughly $5,000, for that group that is at the $25,000 level. \nIt does not leave much for ordinary living. And heaven forbid that a \nnursing home long-term care program is involved. That is the end of it.\n  But we want to do that so we can take care of the tax cut, a tax cut \nprimarily for those who are at the top of the income ladder.\n  The question resolves itself very much, whose side are you on? On \nthis side of the aisle we are on the side of the working Americans, the \npeople who are doing their darnedest to try to keep home and family \ntogether, to try to provide for the education of their children, to \ngive them a hand up so when it is their turn to takeover family \nresponsibilities and leadership in the country they are prepared to do \nit.\n  An America falling behind competitively is not a sight that is \npleasant to see. An America whose health, whose longevity is declining \ncompared to other nations in the world is not a pleasant sight to see. \nAn America who is 25th among nations in foreign aid --25th among the 25 \nmost advanced nations in this world. They leave us behind. When there \nare not only important diplomatic objectives to be gained but important \ncommercial objectives to be gained as well.\n  We see what happens. We need border guards. We know the State of \nTexas likes to see more border guards to help curb illegal immigration. \nWe need more FBI agents, as we have seen very recently.\n  We have to change the way we deal with security issues. But, no, all \nof those things are put on hold so we can take care of a tax reduction \nfor those who in many cases do not need it.\n  Yes, when you get to the middle class Americans, when those who are \nin the level of income where they need all the help they can get, that \nis a worthwhile consideration. But for someone who is making $150,000 a \nyear, $350,000 a year, or more? That is not necessary, in my view, when \nit comes to considering the price that is paid for it.\n  The statement was made just a few minutes ago about whether we would \nlike to see our children healthy or educated? I could not agree more \nwith what the Senator from Texas said. I would like to see the kids \nhealthy first. But I also want my kids to be secure. I want them to \nknow in the next century that instability within our society was not \ncreated by the elimination of some programs to give people job \ntraining, a decent education, an opportunity for full participation in \nour society. Instead of pretending we are going to be able to shield \noff some of the problems that we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The 6 minutes of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I close with the question very simply put on this \nchart, [[Page S7179]] and that is: Whose side are we on? We here are on \nthe side of the average American and our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle want to take care of those who have enough, who have enough \npower, to give them an extra edge they do not need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the remaining time on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 2 minutes and 22 \nseconds. The Senator from Texas, 4 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Is the Senator from Texas ready to yield back his time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, I am going to be the final speaker. I intend to use my \nlast 4 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, winding up the debate, I just want to \nreiterate, if I might, some very fundamental points that have been made \nover and over again.\n  First, we have high hopes that this particular amendment that is \nuniversally opposed on this side of the aisle is also substantially \nopposed on that side of the aisle and, therefore, this might well be \nthe first victory that we have had in the whole series of debates on \nthe budget, inside the Budget Committee and on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope my optimism about this vote is not ill founded, because if the \namendment offered by the Senator from Texas comes to pass and is agreed \nto by this body, I think it is going to cause such havoc that the \nconference with the House of Representatives would be essentially \nmeaningless. If we pass this what I think is an ill-advised amendment, \nregardless of the fact that it passed in the House of Representatives, \nregardless of the fact that it is the so-called crown jewel of the \nContract With America, regardless of the fact that I see no reasonable \nperson could sit down and pencil out the figures and come up with any \nconclusion that we could possibly balance the budget by the year 2002 \nthen if we proceed not to vote down the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas, the House and the Senate in conference would be \nplaced in a position to where I think it would be nearly impossible to \nwork out anything that would be halfway reasonable.\n  I think under those circumstances it would be a foregone conclusion \nthat whatever system eventually passes through the authorization and \nthrough the appropriations process would be vetoed by the President of \nthe United States.\n  This is the time for reason. This is the time for reality. Let us \nvote down the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if this amendment is adopted, both the \nHouse and the Senate will have adopted the tax cut in the Contract With \nAmerica. We will have cut the growth in spending sufficiently to \nbalance the Federal budget and to let working men and women keep more \nof what they earn to invest in their future, to invest in their \nchildren, to invest in their businesses. If we reject this amendment we \nwill have a budget in the Senate that spends $175 billion more on \nnondefense spending over the next 7 years than the House budget does, \nand by not reducing spending as much, we will not give a tax cut to \nworking families, we will not cut the capital gains tax rate, we will \nnot transfer spending authority back to parents. We will continue to \ntake the position, as this budget does, that the Congress of the United \nStates knows better how to spend $175 billion than parents would know \nhow to spend it, if they got to keep it to invest in their own \nchildren;\n that we, by spending $175 billion more than the House in this budget, \nbelieve we can do more to help the economy through Government subsidies \nthan the private sector can do by cutting the capital gains tax rate \nand by having real investment in the private sector of the economy.\n\n  A new day is dawning in the House of Representatives. They did \nsomething virtually unheard of in the modern era of American politics. \nThey set out in black and white what they would do if we gave them a \nmajority in the House of Representatives, as we did in the Senate, and \nthen they did it. What we are doing here is fulfilling only half of our \ncontract.\n  Now, I know from having talked to enough of my colleagues that the \nfix is in, that there is talk about coming up with a compromise. There \nis discussion of cutting a deal so that we can go on in the Senate \nspending substantially more than the House is spending and yet we are \ngoing to act as if we are giving a tax cut, possibly in some kind of \ntemporary tax-cut proposal.\n  I do not believe that is what Americans had in mind when for the \nfirst time in 40 years they gave us a majority in both Houses of \nCongress.\n  I think they believe that we were going to change the way our \nGovernment does our business. This amendment gives us a very, very \nclear choice. If you support the Contract With America, if you want to \ncontrol spending so we can balance the budget and so that we can let \nworking men and women keep more of what they earn to invest in their \nown children, in their own businesses, in their own future, then vote \nfor this amendment and guarantee that the Contract With America will be \nembodied in the final budget we adopt.\n  But if you want the Senate to be able to spend $175 billion more than \nthe House budget, if you think we can spend money better than the \npeople who earn it, then you want to vote no. I think that coming back \nlater with some temporary tax cut, with some cut-a-deal proposal, \nundermines what we committed to the American people we would do, and I \nam opposed to it. I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  All time on this amendment has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand under the sequencing that \nthe next amendment is Senator Exon's amendment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that time on the Exon amendment be limited to the following: 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Exon, 5 minutes under the control \nof Senator Domenici, and there be no second-degree amendments in order \nto the Exon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. At this time I would like to yield for purposes of a \nstatement on the budget to the Senator from Montana for 10 minutes. And \nthen we will proceed, if it is all right with the manager of the bill, \nwith the Exon amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let me just ask, if I could, we have made some \ncommitments that after the Senator from Nebraska we have a defense \namendment. Then after that the Senator has told us Senator Feingold----\nThe Senator has no plan beyond that?\n  Mr. EXON. No plan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would like very much to try to reduce the time. We \nare going to have Senator Thurmond reduce the time to one-half hour and \nmaybe we can start doing half hours or less regularly. But that will be \nthe next one after this.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, with regard to the vote on the Gramm \namendment, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the \nGramm amendment occur in the stacked sequence at a time to be announced \nby the two leaders and that no second-degree amendment be in order \nthereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I should have made that request. I failed to, and I \nthank the Senator for making it for me in my behalf.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Budget Resolution.\n\n\n                     protecting the american dream\n\n  The Budget Committee has given us a sound accountant's budget. It \ncalls for the downsizing or elimination of many programs that have \noutlived [[Page S7180]] their usefulness. It uses much more realistic \nassumptions than the House budget.\n  It would put us on the path toward a balanced budget. That is a goal \nI strongly support. And I hope we will write it into the Constitution \nby passing the balanced budget amendment.\n  But, as we work to live more within our means, it is more important \nthan ever that we set the right priorities.\n  A budget is, after all, more than numbers and programs. It is people. \nIt is middle class Americans working harder than ever just to make ends \nmeet. It is middle class parents who scrimp and save in order to \nrealize the dream of sending their kids to college.\n  It is our seniors--that generation of Americans who worked so hard to \nbuild our economy while, at the same time, winning World War II and the \ncold war. They have earned a right to live with the independence and \ndignity that Medicare and Social Security help provide.\n  And it is our farmers--the families who have worked so hard and so \nsuccessfully to feed America and the entire world.\n  For me, the ultimate test of any budget is how it affects these \nordinary middle class Americans. Are they being treated fairly? And, if \nthey work hard and play by the rules, will they share in the American \ndream of building a better life for themselves and for their children?\n  At the outset, let me provide one example where I firmly believe this \nbudget sets the wrong priorities. It proposes to cut just over $10 \nbillion from the farm program. This will make American agriculture less \ncompetitive in foreign markets and cause serious financial hardship for \nour farmers.\n  At the same time, it recommends funding an even greater amount for \nthe NASA space station--a scientific boondoggle that has a long history \nof cost overruns. It is time to get our priorities back down to Earth \nby eliminating the space station and restoring funding for the farm \nprogram.\n  While I believe there is room to make such commonsense changes to \nthis budget, it contains a more fundamental flaw. While the very \nwealthy get a free ride--and maybe a big tax break--working families \nand the elderly are called upon to sacrifice.\n  The commentator Kevin Phillips--a Republican--recently pointed this \nout. Here is what Mr. Phillips had to say about this budget process:\n\n       [This] legislation . . . especially as put forward by the \n     House of Representatives--has major overtones of special-\n     interest favoritism and income redistribution. Spending on \n     government programs--from Medicare to home-heating oil \n     assistance--is to be reduced in ways that principally burden \n     . . . the middle-class while, simultaneously, taxes are to be \n     cut in ways that predominantly benefit the top one or two \n     percent of Americans. . . . We should be talking about shared \n     sacrifice. Instead, it's senior citizens . . . and ordinary \n     Americans who will see programs they depend on gutted while \n     business, finance and the richest one or two percent--far \n     from making sacrifices--actually get new benefits and tax \n     reductions.\n\n  Over the past 25 years, the rich in this country have gotten a lot \nricher. Back in 1969, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans controlled \nabout 20 percent of our national wealth. Yet today, this figure has \nskyrocketed to nearly 40 percent. And that leaves a smaller piece of \nthe pie--a smaller piece of the American dream--for the middle class.\n  Wealth is no crime. We should encourage risk taking and investment by \nbusiness. But it is time for the most wealthy Americans to get out of \nthe wagon and help the rest of us--seniors, working families, farmers, \nand students--pull it across the line to a balanced budget.\n\n\n                montanans are already pulling the wagon\n\n  And most Montanans are already doing all they can to pull this wagon.\n  Montana is a great place to live. But it can be a tough place to make \na living. The average Montana family works hard, but takes in less than \n$25,000 each year.\n  That is not a lot of money to put food on the table, to pay the \nmortgage, to make the car payment, and to save for the kids' education.\n  And, with each passing year, things get even tougher. Prices rise; \nbut wages stay flat. Last year, for instance, working Montanans just \nbarely kept pace with inflation. And, if you lived in a fast-growing \ncommunity with skyrocketing housing prices--places like Missoula, \nBozeman, Hamilton, or Kalispell--you almost certainly lost ground.\n  It is every bit as difficult for most of our senior citizens. All too \noften, Montana seniors living on fixed incomes just cannot make it. \nWhen you go into a fast-food restaurant or convenience store in \nMontana, you are just about as likely to be waited on by a senior \ncitizen as you are by a teenager.\n  It is not that Montanans are afraid of hard work. In good times and \nbad, we have always done what it takes to make ends meet and build a \nbetter life for our children.\n  But we cannot do that when the Government keeps reaching into our \nwallets and gives nothing back in return. And, when you get to the \nbottom line, that is what this budget means to most Montanans. It is a \ntax; a tax on our seniors; a tax on our property owners; a tax on our \nparents; a tax on our students; a tax on our consumers; and a tax on \nour working families:\n  The cuts in Medicare are a back door tax on Montana seniors who will \nend up paying an additional $900 each year for health care. And, sadly, \nsome seniors living on fixed incomes will be forced to rely on their \nchildren and grandchildren to make up the difference.\n  The cuts in education are a back door tax on Montana students, \nparents and property owners. This budget would eliminate 33 percent of \nthe Federal investment in educating our children. Consequently, States \nand local school districts are bound to face the prospect of raising \nlocal property taxes in order to make up the difference.\n  Beyond this, the proposed increased costs for the student loan \nprogram amount to nothing more than an increased tax on our students \nand parents working to send their kids to college. For example, the \ncosts of a $17,000 undergraduate student loan are estimated to increase \nby almost $5,000 over the life of the loan. And it you are a teacher in \na rural Montana school district making--let us say--just $17,000 a \nyear, that translates into a large chunk of your monthly paycheck just \nto pay off your student loan.\n  And, finally, this budget includes an expensive surprise for electric \nratepayers in eastern and central Montana. The proposed sale of the \nWestern Area Power Administration [WAPA] will increase their electric \nbills, probably by about a third. And, ironically, WAPA is not \nsubsidized. It is a program that protects ratepayers while also making \nmoney for the Government.\n\n\n               forget politics: use a little common sense\n\n  Despite these flaws, I believe this budget could be salvaged. Many of \nthe cuts it proposes make sense. All it would take is agreement--\nbipartisan agreement--to rethink our priorities and find a way to \nprotect rural America and restore funding to education and Medicare.\n  If we put partisanship aside, we could get the job done. All it would \ntake is a little common sense.\n  First, let us bring our priorities down to Earth. Let us kill the \nspace station and protect the family farmer. The costs are about the \nsame. But the benefits of providing a stable supply of food and fiber \nfor America and the world are far greater.\n  This budget also sets aside $170 billion to eventually provide tax \nrelief--most of it probably going to the very wealthy. It is just \ncommon sense that we should use these funds to protect Medicare and \neducation. If we did that, this budget would be a good start; something \nI could work with.\n  Unlike some in my political party, I do not believe we should spare \njust about every domestic program and take a meat ax to the defense \nbudget. There must be real cuts in a broad range of Federal programs.\n  Here are seven areas where we can make a good start:\n  First on my list is foreign aid. I am sick and tired of seeing the \nUnited States pay more than its fair share to support wasteful \norganizations like the United Nations and the World Bank. It is high \ntime we demand that other countries pay their fair share of the U.N. \nbudget. Moreover, I was pleased to see that this budget calls for a \nsignificant cut in funding for the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  Second, I am tired of seeing the United States spend billions of \ndollars for the defense of countries like Korea and Japan. While those \ncountries do all [[Page S7181]] they can to keep our products out of \ntheir market. It is time that they share more in the burden of their \nown national defense.\n  Third, I also agree with the Budget Committee's call to abolish the \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency. We do not need to spend an \nadditional $60 million on this agency when we already have the Defense, \nState, and Energy Departments to do the same thing. It is time to get \nrid of it.\n  And the same is true of a boondoggle called TV Marti, a wasteful \nFederal program that attempts to broadcast sitcom reruns to Cuba.\n  Fifth, I was encouraged to see that the Budget Committee recommends \nthe abolition of the Department of Commerce. This bureaucratic \nbehemoth--a mish-mash of agencies ranging from the National Institute \nof Standards and Technology to the National Marine Fisheries Service--\nhas long lacked a clear mission.\n  Let us move those Commerce programs that are worth saving--like the \nEconomic Development Administration that just helped create over 700 \nhigh-wage jobs in Butte--to other departments. And let us scrap the \nbureaucratic over head and the Commerce programs that have outlived \ntheir usefulness.\n  Sixth, I also believe the Budget Committee missed another opportunity \nto clean house by abolishing a second Cabinet Department. There is no \nbetter example of a failed Great Society program than the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  HUD's history is one of scandal, waste, and failed housing projects; \nplaces where drug dealers and other criminals intimidate and prey upon \nwomen and children. I believe we can find ways, through block grants \nand tax incentives, to promote good, affordable housing without HUD's \nexpensive and too often failed bureaucracy.\n  And seventh--last but certainly not least--welfare is another place \nwe must make savings. I intend to work on the Finance Committee to \nbring the costs of this program down. And, just as importantly, we must \nrestore the value of the American work ethic to our welfare program. I \nhope Democrats and Republican can work together to make this happen.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In closing, we all need to make sacrifices. We need to bring the \nbudget into balance and give our children some relief from debt.\n  I go home just about every weekend. And I hear it time and time \nagain, Montanans are willing to do their part to bring down the \ndeficit. In order to get this done, they are willing to make great \nsacrifices.\n  They ask only one thing in return: fairness. They want to know that \nno one region or class of people is getting a free ride; that we are \nall pulling the wagon together toward a balanced budget.\n  I wish that were the case with this budget resolution. But it is not. \nWe can do better. We can be fair. We can set the right priorities. And \nwe owe the people we represent nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1124\n\n   (Purpose: To restore funding for seniors, education, agriculture, \n  working families, veterans, and other Americans, using amounts set \n                          aside for a tax cut)\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, this amendment is very concise; it is very \nclear. We have cut down the time to 15 minutes on our side and 5 \nminutes for the opposition.\n  Essentially, this amendment would take $160 billion from the $170 \nbillion reserved in the Republican budget for tax cuts for the rich and \nredistribute $100 million to Medicare and Medicaid; $30 billion to \neducation; $17 billion to the earned income tax credit; $3 billion to \nVeterans Affairs; and $10 billion to agriculture.\n  The largest part of this amendment has been offered in part or in \ntotal in previous amendments to alleviate the hit that we think is \nunfair on many of the programs as they were produced out of the Budget \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n  We have discussed at length the distribution of taxes contained in \nthe House Republican passed tax bill. It provides a $20,000 tax cut for \ntaxpayers earning over $350,000. Fully 51 percent of the Republican tax \ncuts go to Americans with incomes over $100,000.\n  We have to get our priorities back on track and that is what my \namendment does.\n  Let me walk my colleagues through the reasons for the redistribution \nof the $170 billion contingent fund.\n  First is Medicare and Medicaid. My amendment restores $100 billion of \nthe overall cut in Medicare and Medicaid is intended to reduce the \nadverse effects of increased premiums, deductibles and co-payments on \nbeneficiaries.\n  Most, if not all, of these add-backs would affect part B of the \nprogram and would not--I repeat--would not worsen the solvency of the \nHI trust fund.\n  My amendment states that any add-backs will be structured in such a \nway to ensure that the fund remains solvent for the same time period \nattained through cuts made in this year's reconciliation bill.\n  I am restoring these reductions in order to protect the 1 in 4 \nMedicare beneficiaries who rely on Social Security for their only \nsource of income.\n  Second is Medicaid. Two-thirds of all Medicaid dollars are spent on \nseniors and disabled people. This is the only program which pays for \nlong-term care.\n  Many middle-income people who develop disabling conditions--like \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's--end up spending all of their incomes for \ncare. They often have nowhere else to turn but Medicaid.\n  Under the Republican budget, nearly 1 million seniors and disabled \npeople could lose their coverage. This amendment would add back\n funding to reduce the hit on that population.\n\n  The funding in my amendment could also be used to reduce the cuts to \nchildren.\n  Third, is education which would receive $30 billion through this \namendment. Over 500,000 graduate and professional students currently \nreceive subsidized loans. Nearly 50 percent of full-time, full-year \nstudents rely on the subsidized loans to pay for their education.\n  Eliminating the in-school interest subsidy means graduate and \nprofessional students could have their total debt increase by $3,000 to \n$6,600 depending on how long they are in school. The subsidy is \ncritical for these students, most of whom are independent and going \nback to school to pursue higher learning that is critical to the future \nof our Nation.\n  My amendment also helps restore some of the Republican budget cuts to \nthe impact aid program.\n  Impact aid is a critical program that provides funds to school \ndistricts that educate children of military personnel, children who \nlive on Indian lands, and children who live in federally subsidized \nhousing.\n  For school districts with large areas of Federal property within \ntheir boundaries, raising sufficient revenue to provide for the \neducation of these children is a daunting challenge. Federal land is \nexempt from local property taxes--the mainstay of local education \nfinance--causing a greater tax burden on the residents and owners of \nnon-Federal land.\n  In my own State of Nebraska, Bellevue School District relies upon \nimpact aid funding for almost 25 percent of its annual operating \nbudget. Cuts in impact aid would be devastating to the quality of \neducation for children of military personnel in Bellevue. My amendment \nsoftens the blow.\n  Fourth is the EITC which would receive $17 billion. The EITC helps \nkeep working families off of welfare. It also assists middle-class \nfamilies who have sudden losses of income.\n  The Republican budget cut for the EITC is particularly cruel since \nreal wage growth has been slow, and many people are having to take \nlower-wage jobs as a result of downsizing and restructuring.\n  Fifth, is veterans. My amendment adds $3 billion back to veterans \nprograms.\n  This Republican budget is a sad tribute to America's men and women \nwho have worn their country's uniform.\n  Let us be clear, by funding the VA's medical system at the 1995 level \nfor the next 7 years, the Republicans are dramatically cutting access \nto health care services for veterans' across the country.\n  The Republican budget also increases veterans' contributions for GI \nbill education benefits. It increases the co-payment for prescription \ndrugs for higher-income vets.\n  Finally is agriculture. Mandatory agriculture spending is already \nprojected to decline by 17 percent over the budget resolution \ntimeframe. The Republican budget would cut an additional 20 percent \nfrom these programs primarily CCC commodity programs.\n  This amendment would ensure that farm programs make a fair \ncontribution to deficit reduction without devastating the entire farm \neconomy and severely hampering the ability of the Agriculture Committee \nto draft a workable farm program and a workable farm bill in the \nfuture.\n  Finally, it would reduce the reconciled cut to the committee by $10 \nbillion and thus lessen the overall projected cuts from farm commodity \nprograms from $12 billion to $2 billion.\n  Finally, I would note that if the CBO scores this surplus \ndifferently, the numbers provided would be adjusted accordingly.\n  The amendment does not allocate $10 billion of the projected $170 \nbillion tax cut now in the Republican budget.\n  I intend to leave that amount open to be used to restore cuts in \nother programs that may have been unfairly hit. Or, it could be used as \na cushion to further reduce the deficit and help us reach a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator finished with his time?\n  Mr. EXON. No, I have time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 5-\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually, I only want to use 2 minutes. If the Senator \nwill let me do that in wrap-up, I will let him finish and I will use \nonly 2 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe the arguments can be made pro and \ncon and have been made pro and con on this amendment. Very simply in \nthe time remaining--I will consider yielding back after making these \nclosing statements.\n  Once again, we are not attempting to change the date that we would \nbalance the budget as prescribed in the Republican budget, we are not \nadding to the deficit, we are not adding to the national debt. We have \nbeen staying, as we have through all of these amendments--all of these \namendments--within the parameters laid down, the overall figures of the \nBudget Committee.\n  What we are simply saying is that rather than provide a kitty, if you \nwill, in the Senate budget, which is clearly earmarked for tax cuts and \nis so established by the chairman of the committee in this resolution, \nan earmark of $170 billion dollars which could come, according to CBO, \nif we balance the budget by the year 2002, to simply take a portion of \nthat $170 billion and, instead of cutting taxes, cut the hit on these \nprograms that I have outlined. This amendment merely alleviates the \nsubstantial and unfair cuts in each and every one of them.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and may be in a position to yield \nback after the Senator has made his statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mexico has 4-\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me speak very briefly, after which when time has \nbeen used up on the amendment, Senators should know that I plan to \nraise a point of order.\n  Mr. President, what we have now is, as I view this, we have the \nbudget resolution produced by the gallant 12 budgeteers from the \nRepublican side. We have a budget resolution that gets to balance. In \nthat, we decide that many programs have to be reformed, changed, some \neliminated, but we say we are going to stop spending in the red. We are \nnot going to charge our children with our bills any longer. In 2002, we \nstop that.\n  Now it just so happens, Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, that \nin 2002, according to the Congressional Budget Office, according to \ntheir economists and other economists, that [[Page S7183]] essentially \nwhen you put down a balanced budget and you make it enforceable and you \npass a whole batch of laws that change current entitlements so less is \nspent and they certify that for you and say you have a balanced budget, \nthere is a dividend--the dividend could be in the neighborhood of $170 \nbillion--an economic dividend for doing what is right.\n  What is right? What is right is to get in balance by the year 2002. \nSo by doing what is right, the Republicans on the Budget Committee, and \nRepublicans and hopefully some Democrats, when they vote for this \nbudget resolution, have earned something for the American people. What \nhave they earned?\n They have earned reduced long-term interest rates for starters --very \nsignificant for homeowners, auto buyers, for everyone, including \nbusiness people and mothers and fathers sitting around talking about \nstudent loans. If they are affluent enough to pay their own student \nloans, there is less interest on those loans. That is what we get from \nthat side.\n\n  Indeed, there is a bonus of $170 billion that is kind of a surplus \nsitting there. We are now in the black and we have this surplus. What \nthe Republicans say at this point in time is that we should transfer \nthat $170 billion from a reserve fund to the tax writing committee and \nsay to them, give the American people a modest dividend by cutting some \ntaxes. Now, not rich people, not $300,000 earners. We have said in this \nbudget resolution that it will go--90 percent--to middle-income \nAmericans. That is the Senate's position if they adopt ours.\n  Let me say that, in a nutshell, Senator Exon would then say instead \nof doing that with that $170 billion, let us spend it. So we have a \nbalanced budget and my good friend from Nebraska says, now, spend $100 \nbillion of it on Medicare, spend $30 billion on education, spend $10 \nbillion on agriculture, spend it on et cetera, et cetera. We hardly get \nto balance and we hardly get the dividend for Americans that they are \nentitled to, because most of them say, ``Give us a balanced budget.'' \nThey are entitled to a bonus when we do what they have been telling us \nto do. So we say leave it there for a possible tax cut for Americans.\n  Senator Exon would say for all of these good things, let us spend it, \nand all of a sudden we start spending again after we got in balance, \nand we add $170 billion in spending.\n  The purposes are good. Senators pick some very, very interesting \nprograms that Americans are interested in but everybody is worried \nabout. He says, use the dividend for them. We have explained them in \ndetail. We believe we are going to make the Medicare trust fund \nsolvent. We believe education is not going to get harmed under our \nassumptions. We believe we have been fair to agriculture, and on down \nthe line.\n  So I do not believe we ought to adopt the amendment. It is out of \norder under the Budget Act. When my time comes, I will so move.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be very brief. I simply want to say that I have \nlistened once again to my good friend and colleague from the State of \nNew Mexico, my chairman. We do not happen to agree on this matter, but \nwe happen to agree on many, many things. Time and time again, I have \nheard that those of us who realize that these programs are taking a \nconsiderable hit are being accused of being spenders if we do not try \nto alleviate some of the unfairness that I see in the Republican \nbudget.\n  When this debate first started, I complimented my talented friend \nfrom New Mexico for the courageous job he has done. Time and time \nagain, I have said that we in the amendments that we offered in the \ncommittee, and the amendments we have offered on the floor, have not \ndone anything to reach the goal that the Senator from New Mexico is \nespousing. We are simply asking, do we honestly feel that we should \nmake some changes in the approaches on certain programs? I do not \nbelieve it is fair to say, nor do I think the American people are \nparticularly concerned because their main worry is balancing the budget \nand keeping it balanced and to quit borrowing more money, which is \ncrippling America with the interest we are paying on that borrowing. \nSuffice to say that we really believe that we can work with the \nRepublicans, with Senator Domenici, if they would just listen to some \nof our pleas.\n  I really think that the people of America would be most satisfied if \nwe realistically face the challenge that we have to balance the budget \nand reduce the deficit. That is primarily the only thing that most of \nthem are looking for. With that, I yield the remainder of my time and \nurge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it would be interesting to search the \nsouls and hearts and minds of those on that side of the aisle to see, \nif this amendment were adopted, if they would vote for this budget \nresolution. It is most interesting. Take the dividend created through \nall of this hard work, tell us now here is how we would like it spent, \nthen prevail on that and watch the budget go down in flames, because \nclearly we would not get very much support from that side of the aisle. \nWe might get Senator Exon, but I will not even ask him.\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator will yield--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded himself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Off of my time. The Senator has made an interesting \nproposition. I would say to him that with all of the reservations that \nI have, if he will accept this amendment, he will at least get one vote \non this side and, I think, considerably more. That may be a partial \nanswer to his question, and I am acting in very good faith.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree. We may get one.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Exon-Daschle amendment would reorder \nand re-balance the spending priorities in this proposed budget.\n  Specifically, the amendment would shift funding from a proposed tax \ncut for the wealthiest Americans to several key programs upon which our \nnational interests depend. The Exon amendment would restore $100 \nbillion to Medicare, $30 billion to education, $17 billion to the \nearned income tax credit, $3 billion to veterans' programs, and $10 \nbillion to agricultural programs. The amendment would also exclude the \nproposed sale of the country's Power Marketing Administrations, \nincluding the Western Area Power Administration, from the budget. All \nof these are important priorities for our Nation and, especially, for \nrural America.\n  This amendment, like the amendments we offered yesterday, are \ncompletely paid for. It does not add one penny to the deficit.\n  Yesterday I spoke of the importance of the restoration of Medicare \nfunding, and, earlier today, I referred to the importance of the earned \nincome tax credit. So, today, I will focus on the other elements of \nthis amendment.\n  First, the amendment would restore $30 billion in education funds. \nThe underlying budget resolution proposes to balance the budget at the \nexpense of educating our youth. That is unacceptable. It is myopic, and \nit is a false economy. The next generation cannot afford to be \nshortchanged in this manner. Educational investments are one of the \nbest investments this country can make, especially as our youth prepare \nfor the 21st century.\n  This amendment, which provides $30 billion to restore funding for \ncritical education programs, will help young Americans and their \nfamilies by restoring funding in student loans and education programs.\n  The $30 billion restores funding for the student loan in-school \ninterest subsidy and other critical programs such as Title 1, Pell \ngrants, Impact Aid, special education, and Safe and Drug-free Schools.\n  Impact Aid is especially important to South Dakota. Last year the \nprogram received a $70 million reduction in fiscal year 1995 funding. \nFurther reductions are intolerable. These funds--which represent the \nmoney the Federal Government is obligated to pay to reimburse local \nschool districts for Federal displacement of the local tax \n[[Page S7184]] base--are absolutely critical to over 50 schools in my \nState, and hundreds of schools throughout the country, that depend on \nImpact Aid to meet our children's basic educational needs.\n  The Impact Aid program provides critical dollars to over 50 schools \nin South Dakota. These payments are not a Government subsidy. Quite \nsimply, their purpose is to compensate school districts for the loss of \ntaxable revenue from what once was local taxable land. The message in \nthe continued trend of decreased funding is that Congress has decided \nwe do not need to uphold our obligation to the school districts that \nrely so greatly on these funds.\n  In the McLaughlin school district in South Dakota the Impact Aid \nfunds represent approximately 37 percent of the school's budget; in the \nLake Andes school district, 20 to 25 percent of their budget\n comes from Impact Aid monies; 30 percent of the Dupree school's \ngeneral fund revenue budget is generated by Impact Aid funds; in Smee, \nSouth Dakota, if Impact Aids funds continue to dwindle, they will be \nunable to operate; in Pollock, South Dakota, they would have to close \ntheir doors if this funding is eliminated.\n\n  The list goes on and on, Mr. President. This means that teacher pay, \nbooks, facilities, desks, buses--everything it takes to run a school--\nis dependent on whether this Congress lives up to the commitment that \nwas made to these schools when the lands in their districts were taken.\n  I simply ask this question of my colleagues. Is it fair to eliminate \na program that was designed to help alleviate a very clear Federal \nburden that was imposed on certain local communities and school \ndistricts because the Federal Government decided to acquire land in \ntheir particular district? The answer is no. This is a Federal \nresponsibility, not a Federal subsidy.\n  The Exon-Daschle amendment would also restore $3 billion in funding \nfor veterans' programs, including veterans' health care. In light of \nthe budget's proposed Medicare cuts, the cuts in VA funding are \nespecially egregious, for reduced Medicare funding will undoubtedly \nlead to increased pressure on, and a shift in costs to, the VA health \ncare system. As my colleagues know, the VA health care system is an \nalready overburdened and underfunded one, so I fail to understand how \nthe majority justifies this proposal.\n  The $3 billion in this amendment would ease some of that pressure and \nhelp us ensure that our fundamental commitment to the men and women who \nhave served this Nation is fulfilled. To do otherwise sends exactly the \nwrong message to veterans and the men and women who currently serve in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  While Senator Exon and I will talk more about the budget resolution's \ntreatment of agriculture tomorrow, when we will offer an amendment to \nrestore some of the agricultural funding cut in the Republican budget, \nI want to take a moment to speak on that issue today. This amendment \nwould restore $10 billion of the agricultural funding cut in the budget \nproposal.\n  The amendment directs the funding where it is most needed--to farmers \nwho struggle each year to stay on the farm, to keep producing America's \nfood and fiber supply, and to families who strike a rough patch when \nthere is job loss or other bad luck, people trying to put food on the \ntable and keep their families together.\n  The Republican budget, on the other hand, raids rural America to aid \nthe comfortable. The Republican budget proposal would cut $45.9 billion \nout of the Agriculture Department over the next 7 years. That is likely \nto translate to around $12 billion in direct cuts to farm programs. It \nis a 20-percent cut in farm spending. It will contribute to the further \ndeterioration of the economic and social fabric of rural America. No \nother sector of American life is being asked to absorb such a hit. We \ncan not have a prosperous urban America riding on the back of an \nimpoverished farm America. Yet that is what Republican budget cuts will \nprovide.\n  Farmers in South Dakota would see a devastating decline in their \nincome of over $57 million. Other rural States will suffer similar \npain. This budget is short-sighted for rural America and self-\ninterested for the best-off. It is not a balanced, fair proposal. It is \nnot a budget that sustains the American tradition of building a strong \nfarm sector, a tradition that has enjoyed bipartisan support until this \nRepublican majority.\n  Finally, this amendment would prevent the budget resolution from \ncounting the sale of the power marketing administrations and other \nassets toward deficit reduction. This would remove the incentive to \nsell the Power Marketing Administrations [PMAs] in order to balance the \nbudget, and\n would help ensure that decision is made on the basis of what would be \nthe best policy for the United States. Since the sale of PMA's makes no \neconomic sense, this amendment would substantially hinder their sale.\n\n  I have been concerned because the Clinton administration has \nannounced plans to sell three of the five PMA's, including the Western \nArea Power Administration [WAPA], which markets power from the main \nstem dams on the Missouri River to South Dakota utilities and \ncooperatives. The administration has stated it intends to sell WAPA in \n1998.\n  Despite the fact that the administration stated in the budget that \n``the proposal will provide customer protection from significant rate \nincreases,'' I am deeply concerned that if this plan is approved by \nCongress and goes forward, then significant rate increases will be \ninevitable, affecting consumers and the overall economies of rural \nstates such as South Dakota.\n  The PMA's are an example of a Government program that works well. \nSouth Dakota, the Western Area Power Administration, which markets \npower from the main stem dams along the Missouri River, has ensured a \nconsistent and affordable supply of electricity. The program is being \nrun on a sound financial basis, as it recovers all expenses relating to \nits annual operation and the initial construction expenses, with \ninterest. By providing low-cost power, the PMA's have substantially \nassisted in the economic development of many States.\n  Any one-time savings from the sale of WAPA would be offset by long \nterm revenue losses. The administration and the Republicans expect a \none-time budget savings from the sale, that over the long-run, will not \nsave the Federal Government any money at all. Since the operational and \ncapital costs of the program are more than paid back currently, the \nsale simply allows the Federal Government to collect the debt faster. \nBut since the debt is being paid back with interest now, there is no \nlong-term financial benefit to the Government. Long-term revenue losses \nfrom the sale offset the near-term revenue gains.\n  Some claim that the power marketing administrations can be sold \nwithout causing substantial rate increases. In reality, today's rates \nare set at the lowest possible level, while still ensuring that the \ndebt is paid off. If the power marketing administrations are sold, then \nit is likely that rates will increase substantially. Those who buy the \nPMA's will attempt to maximize the return on their investment. And \nelectric rates for existing Federal power customers will rise as a \nresult. Some predict rate increases as much as 300 percent for some \ncommunities.\n  This sale will not only affect the economy of South Dakota or a few \nwestern States. Power marketing administrations sell power in 34 States \nacross the country. I would ask all of my colleagues from these States \nto consider the impact of the sale of PMA's before they cast their \nvote.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we need to reduce the deficit. No one \nargues that point. This amendment restores essential funding--upholding \nour obligation to rural America, children, and the elderly--and is \ncompletely offset with the reserve fund set aside by the GOP to pay for \ntax breaks for the wealthy. Again, the amendment does not contribute \none penny to the deficit.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The pending amendment is not germane to the provisions \nof the budget resolution pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct. I raise a point of order against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305 of the act for the \npurpose of the pending Exon amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? [[Page S7185]] \n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment also be \nstacked pursuant to the previous order, subject to leadership control \non when we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Can I inquire of my friend at this time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. We have stacked a series of votes now. I do not believe we \nhave indicated when we might start our voting so that everybody would \nbe properly advised. Are we going to start voting in an hour, 2 hours, \n3 hours? Could the Senator give us some information on that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is a very good question. I thank the Senator. We \nare, hopefully, going to get through with the Thurmond-McCain \namendment, which is next, and then we will start voting about 4 p.m. \nThat is the best I can give you at this point.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator Thurmond is next. I yield to him \nto offer his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1125\n\n(Purpose: To restore adequate defense budget levels and to provide for \n   offsetting reductions from nondefense discretionary spending and \n               nondefense spending in the defense budget)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for \n     himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Warner, Mr. Coats, \n     Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lott, Mr. Smith, Mr. Cohen \n     and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 1125.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

It is further the \n     sense of the Senate that defense spending may not be reduced \n     by more than a total of $10 billion and non-defense spending \n     may not be increased by more than a total of $10 billion over \n     the seven years of the resolution, from the levels of \n     discretionary spending in this section.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have been asked ``What do Americans \nexpect of their Armed Force?'' I believe Americans expect a capable and \nready force, ready to meet our Nation's security needs, able to \nsafeguard our national interest and maintain our position as a world \nleader. The budget resolution from the Senator from New Mexico was a \ngood effort. It required many hard decisions. The problem remains that \nthe planned defense budget, as offered in the budget resolution, does \nnot meet the needs of our Armed Forces or give us the ability to meet \nour global commitments.\n  We live in a dangerous world. It is our responsibility not to repeat \nhistory and drastically reduce defense. This path will leave our forces \nin a dangerously unprepared state, and we will pay the price in the \nfuture. The international environment requires the United States to \nmaintain a strong defense to deter aggression and maintain our vital \ninterests. The Armed Services Committee has already received \nindications that the Defense Department is planning further end \nstrength reductions to pay for needed modernization. The Bottom-Up \nReview described a minimum force, said to be necessary to support our \nmilitary strategy. This review was not based on strategy. Force \nstructure levels were too low, and the required modernization was \nmortgaged.\n  Over the last year, the Armed Services Committee has continued to \nhear testimony concerning present and future readiness problems. Lack \nof funds is placing combat readiness in danger. The ability of our \ncommanders in the field to maintain their forces is being jeopardized \nby an underfunded program. GAO and other sources have estimated \nshortfalls in defense to range from $20 billion to $150 billion over \nthe next 6 years. Defense spending has been reduced every year since \n1985, and as a percentage of gross domestic product is at pre-World War \nII levels. Modernization and procurement accounts remain at 50-year \nlows as modernization projects are continually pushed farther into the \nfuture or canceled all together. This is a trend that cannot continue. \nThe defense budget, in the budget resolution, simply does not provide \nthe minimum resources necessary to sustain our force or meet the \nDepartment's pressing needs. [[Page S7186]] \n  At the same time, requirements for our service men and women have not \ndecreased. Instead, contingency operations and other deployments have \nincreased requirements for American forces, placing greater stress on \nour service members, family members, and their equipment. These \ndeployments have a price and are taking a toll on our force readiness. \nWe must support our forces and not cripple our Nation's defense.\n  Our responsibility is to ensure that the bill for these funding \nshortfalls is not paid for by the sacrifice of men and women in our \nArmed Forces. These young Americans have been asked to live without \nproper housing and barracks, to make do with constrained training, and \ndo without new systems and technology, because we cannot afford it. \nQuality-of-life programs have been ignored to support increasing \noperating tempos. Benefits are continually under review for further \nreductions. We should expect increasing recruiting and retention \nproblems, if we do not support these young Americans who are serving \nour Nation.\n  I am strongly in favor of cutting Federal spending and reducing the \ndeficit, but we must meet our national security needs. The first \nresponsibility of government is to provide for its defense. This \namendment reverses a dangerous trend and provides for that commitment. \nIt does not increase the deficit in Senator Domenici's budget \nresolution. The amendment improves the balance between current and \nfuture readiness. We provide for an adequate quality of life for \nservice members and their families. We can take care of shortfalls in \nimportant new systems such as national and theater missile defense \nsystems. We must not allow our Nation's defense needs to be decided by \npurely fiscal considerations. If we do, then sooner than we may \nrealize, a bill is going to come due. Hopefully, that bill will not be \npaid with the lives of our service men and women, and great harm to the \nNation.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has consumed 5 \nof the 7 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I reserve the remaining 2 minutes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my distinguished leader and chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Thurmond, and I also want to thank my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for their leadership, \nespecially Senator Thurmond's leadership, on this very important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry we are short of time. This amendment \ndeserves a great deal more consideration if Members believe, as I do, \nthat the first priority of any government is to preserve the security \nof its citizens.\n  Senator Thurmond has described the amendment. I would just like to \nremind my colleagues for 2 years, Republicans have charged that the \nadministration has failed to maintain a defense adequate to confront \nthe myriad challenges we face in this period of instability. Now it is \nour responsibility to correct that failing.\n  I am disappointed that the budget resolution submitted to this body \nby Republicans is the Clinton numbers, the same numbers that we \nattacked so vociferously for 2 years.\n  Mr. President, no decade in this century began more auspiciously than \nthe 1990's. That gross impediment to human liberty, the Berlin Wall, \nwas breached by the stronger forces of human yearning. The central \nsecurity problem of our time, the possible clash of East and West on \nthe plains of Germany, was resolved by the dissolution of the Warsaw \nPact, the reunification of Germany, and the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  The euphoria that accompanied these events anticipated the imminent \narrival of a new world order of independent democracies engaged only in \npeaceful commercial competition with one another.\n  The resurrection of ancient conflicts and hideous barbarism in the \nBalkans; the reappearance of other incidents of irrational nationalism \nthat had been sublimated by the cold war; the haunting familiarity of \nZhirinovsky's odious appeal to perverse patriotism; the accelerating \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and the waging of over 50 \nconflicts around the world have dimmed our hopes for a more just and \ntranquil world, and reminded Members that we have interests and values \nthat are still at risk in this promising but uncertain world.\n  The world is still a very dangerous place. American vigilance and \nstruggle are required now more than ever. There are numerous potential \nthreats to our national security in the world today:\n  In North Korea, one of the world's remaining Communist dictatorships \nseeks to acquire nuclear weapons, and this administration has failed to \nexercise the decisive leadership necessary to halt, once and for all, \nthe threat of nuclear warfare on the Korean Peninsula.\n  In Asia, China has laid claim to the entire South China Sea and \nenhanced its claim with a massive buildup of its armed forces, \nincluding the acquisition of new submarines, marine forces, and \naircraft carriers.\n  In the Middle East, Iran poses a serious threat to the security of \nthe region with their own efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, their \nlongstanding support of terrorist movements, and their aggressive \nmilitary buildup in the Straits of Hormuz.\n  Iraq remains a potential trouble spot as Saddam Hussein maintains a \nstranglehold on political and economic power in that state.\n  Russia's involvement in its ``near abroad,'' the ongoing horrible \nconflict in Chechnya, and its advocacy of changes in stable arms \ncontrol agreements causes serious concerns.\n  Ethnic conflicts continue to rage from Sri Lanka to Rwanda.\n  And in Bosnia, United States military personnel may soon be sent in \nharm's way to assist in extracting international forces from the failed \nU.N. peacekeeping effort in that State.\n  These and many other examples of instability in the world today make \nit imperative that we support an adequate national defense posture in \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. President, the defense budget has declined 35 percent in real \nterms between 1985 and 1994. President Clinton promised in his State of \nthe Union Address in January of 1994, ``* * * we must not cut defense \nfurther.'' Yet, his fiscal year 1996 defense budget submission cuts \ndefense for 4 more years, totaling another 10 percent decline by 1999.\n  Mr. President, what we are faced with is a Hobson's choice. We are \nspending money to maintain a ready force. That money is well spent, and \nwe still have the finest and highest quality men and women this Nation \ncan recruit and maintain in our Armed Forces. However, in exchange for \nthat, we are sacrificing totally, the modernization of our force.\n  In 1985, we procured 325 tactical aircraft; in 1996, we will procure \n289. In 1985, we procured 80,000 missiles; in 1995 we procured 3,000. \nIn tanks, in 1985, we procured 2,680 tanks and other vehicles; in 1995, \n34 tanks and vehicles. Ships, in 1985, we procured 34; in 1996, we will \nprocure 3.\n  Mr. President, we cannot--we cannot--maintain the capability that won \nthe Persian Gulf with the kind of lack of modernization that is part \nand parcel of this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona had 5 minutes, and \nhas 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, not unlike other Members of this body, \nam a student of history. I am certainly a confirmed believer in the old \nadage that those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat \nthem.\n  In 1917 the United States of America was not prepared to go to war. \nIn 1941, on December 7, America was not prepared to go to war. In June \nof 1950, when North Korea attacked across the 38th parallel, the United \nStates was not prepared to go to war. In the 1970's, when we had a \nhollow Army, the United States was not prepared.\n  We must understand that what we are doing here is mortgaging the \nblood and treasure of America by adopting a proposal which cannot meet \nour national security requirements and needs. It is an enormous \nresponsibility of this body, to assume a responsibility in \ncontravention to the knowledge, wisdom and advice of our military \nleaders and all objective observers, and that is that we cannot \nmodernize our forces so victory, if conflict comes, can only be \npurchased through enormous [[Page S7187]] expenditure of treasure, and \nfar more important than that, American blood.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I will use it at \nthe end of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does Senator Thurmond or McCain have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 minutes and 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am in control, technically, of the time in \nopposition. But, frankly, I want to give that opposition time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska for his side. They are going to \nhave the time in opposition, not the Senator from New Mexico.\n  But I will reserve, now, before I give that over--I will keep 10 \nminutes for myself and Senator Lott. He, I understand, will not be able \nto fit in, in the time allotted. I will arrange to give him that time, \nnot in opposition but in favor. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, over the past several days, I have \nlistened closely to the debate over this budget resolution which, I \nbelieve, has the potential to set our Nation on the road to fiscal \nresponsibility. I want to commend the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, for his courageous proposal which will balance the Federal \nbudget by the year 2002. I support what he and the other Republicans on \nthe Budget Committee intend to do with this budget resolution--\neliminate the Federal deficit and relieve the enormous burden of debt \nthat we are currently loading on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. However, I take exception with the spending levels for \ndefense included within the budget resolution before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the security of our Nation and \nthe risks we face in a world that--despite the demise of the cold war--\nremains a very dangerous and unpredictable place. As we speak, our \nArmed Forces are preparing for the possibility of a mission to assist \nin the withdrawal of U.N. forces from the former Yugoslavia. Whether or \nnot you believe that we should put U.S. forces at risk to carry out \nthis mission, I am certain that every Senator in this Chamber would \nsupport funding to ensure that our forces are trained and equipped to \nfacilitate the rapid accomplishment of this mission with minimal risk \nto the lives of U.S. military personnel. We learned in Operation Desert \nStorm that well-trained troops equipped with modern weapons and \nequipment suffer fewer casualities.\n  Today we are facing a world proliferating with new threats based on \ncenturies-old ethnic, racial and religious hatreds.\n  The problem with preparing our forces to defend against threats in \nthis new world of disorder is that we may not be able to anticipate \nwhere and whom we will have to fight. We will have to be prepared for \nthe unexpected, for major regional crises that arise suddenly--in other \nwords, for contingencies. The case in point is the gulf war. Prior to \nAugust 1990, no one ever expected we would end up in a major land war \nagainst Iraq.\n  Fortunately, we had a superior military capability that was more than \na match for Iraq. But, in the past, this has not always been the case. \nThe outbreak of World Wars I and II and Korea found us woefully \nunprepared, and the result was many thousands of Americans lost in the \nopening days of those conflicts. Consequently, in an era of \nuncertainty, combined with multiple potential dangers, the No. 1 threat \ncould be our own unpreparedness.\n  Mr. President, the administration's ways of dealing with these \nuncertainties was to conduct a Bottom-Up\n Review which resulted in a force structure that is supposed to be able \nto fight and win two nearly-simultaneous major regional contingencies. \nIt is highly questionable, however, whether or not this planned force \nwill be capable of meeting this requirement. There is also general \nagreement that the administration's future years defense plan [FYDP] is \ninadequate. The General Accounting Office estimated that the FYDP may \nbe underfunded by as much as $150 billion.\n\n  The administration has made readiness a high priority at the expense \nof modernization of our military. They have kept personnel and \nreadiness accounts funded at high levels, but because the overall \nbudget is underfunded, modernization--the R and procurement \naccounts--have paid the bills. Procurement is at intolerably low \nlevels. A Marine Corps general officer testifying at an Armed Services \nCommittee hearing recently stated that the Marine Corps procurement \nbudget was only about one-third of what it should be for the third \nstraight year. ``You can't modernize on pocket change,'' he told the \ncommittee.\n  I should also point out that even with all of the administration's \nemphasis on readiness, significant readiness problems have occurred \nwithin our military over the past year.\n  Last September, three Army divisions reported readiness levels of C-\n3. Not since the days of the Carter administration, have that many \ndivisions reported such poor readiness levels.\n  Overall readiness for active Navy aviation squadrons declined from \nabout 75 percent in fiscal year 1990 to 61 percent last year.\n  Funding shortfalls in the 2d Marine Air Wing's flying hour program \nresulted in 11 of 30 squadrons reporting in the two lowest readiness \ncategories (C-3 or C-4) for the 4th quarter of fiscal year 1994.\n  Admiral Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations stated recently, ``We \nhave gone to the well and it is dry. We must fund training if we are to \nprevent a `hollow force.'''\n  Mr. President, I believe it is clear that our military services are \nunderfunded in the administration's proposed budget and future years \ndefense plan. For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, members of the Armed Services \nCommittee have been expressing that view. Every Republican on the Armed \nServices Committee signed a letter to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee recommending that fiscal year 1996 funding for defense be \nfrozen at last years level, adjusted for inflation. This would result \nin a $12.5 billion increase over the President's\n request for fiscal year 1996.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Budget Committee's proposal accepts the \nadministration's recommended budgets now and in the outyears for \ndefense. If we accept the administration's budgets, then the \nresponsibility for shortfalls in defense funding and the resulting \ndeficiencies in our Armed Forces will lie with those of us in the \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address in 1994, the \nPresident implored the Congress not to cut defense further--that \ndefense had been cut enough. Then, this year, in his budget request for \nfiscal year 1996, the President recommended $5.7 billion less than he \nrecommended last year--in real terms, this is over $13 billion less \nthan last year. Mr. President, that sounds like a cut to me.\n  There are those who state that defense should pay its fair share. Mr. \nPresident, I maintain that defense has already paid more than its fair \nshare--that defense has already been cut too deeply. Fiscal year 1996 \nrepresents the 11th consecutive year of declining defense budgets--the \nlongest continuous decline in post WW II history. DOD spending as a \nshare of the Federal budget has declined from 42 percent in 1968 to 18 \npercent in 1994 and continues to decline.\n  As I indicated earlier, Defense procurement spending has suffered \ngreatly under the Clinton administration. During the hollow force days \nof the mid-1970's, procurement spending was only about $46.7 billion; \nin 1985, at the height of the Reagan buildup, procurement spending \nreached $120 billion; in 1995, procurement spending is down to $39.4 \nbillion--representing a 67-percent decrease from fiscal year 1985 and \n16-percent less than the mid-1970's low point.\n  Mr. President, when we fail to modernize our forces with new weapons \nand equipment, we not only cause maintenance and operating costs to \nrise, but more importantly, we condemn our future soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines to fight their battles with obsolete weapons and \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, when I asked an old Marine sergeant, who was a combat \nveteran of several wars, why he was so sure there would be another war, \nhe replied, ``There always has been.'' It is certain that our forces \nwill be called upon again to go into battle. The time \n[[Page S7188]] may be sooner than we think. I hope the Congress will \nnot put our servicemen and women at greater risk because we cannot find \nadditional funds from a budget of almost $1.3 trillion.\n  I support the Thurmond-McCain amendment and urge my colleagues to \nvote for it also.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Thurmond-\nStevens-McCain amendment. I commend my colleagues for their efforts to \nensure an adequate defense budget. Under this amendment, defense \nspending would be increased to meet the levels approved by the House \nlast week. However, the measure is deficit neutral in each year of the \nresolution, and keeps us on path to achieve a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  We are committed to cutting Federal spending. But we must ensure that \nour military is prepared to meet future challenges. Over the past few \nyears, the Clinton administration has sacrificed the readiness and \nmodernization of our forces. However, around the world, potential \nenemies are increasing and modernizing their military capabilities.\n  For the past 2 years, the administration has justified its reduction-\nin-force structure by promising to provide our troops with the most \nmodern technology available. During last year's hearings on the fiscal \nyear 1995 budget, General Shalikashvili stated, and I quote:\n\n       The structure is adequate only if we stick with two \n     linchpins: We must improve our capabilities, and we must \n     improve and maintain our readiness.\n\n  Unfortunately, this has turned out to be empty rhetoric. Procurement \nspending and procurement rates are at their lowest levels in 45 years. \nDespite promises to enhance force capabilities, modernization has come \nto a virtual standstill. The result is that our Armed Forces are \nsmaller, but not more capable.\n  Where President Clinton has failed to recognize the long-term needs \nof the military, we in Congress must take the lead. Our defense budget \nmust balance our need to maintain near-term readiness and our need to \nprovide enhanced capabilities for the future. It must prepare us for \ntomorrow's challenges. Failure to do so will jeopardize the security of \nthis Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, much of the debate over the defense budget \nin recent weeks and months has been based on misperceptions and half-\ntruths.\n  A good example can be found in one editorial entitled ``Grasping the \nObvious,'' which lashed out at defense spending, claiming that \nPresident Clinton wanted to increase the defense budget and that:\n\n       The Defense Department has somehow become untouchable, \n     taking a place alongside Social Security and Medicare in the \n     pantheon of sacrosanct Federal enterprises.\n\n  The editorial went on to argue that defense budgets should be reduced \njust as much if not more than other areas of Federal spending, and that \nthe Pentagon and the White House would have to realize that in a time \nof ``diminishing military threats,'' deep cuts would have to be made.\n  The writer is not alone in failing to grasp the obvious. The post-\ncold-war period has seen a proliferation of efforts to cut American \ndefense budgets dangerously deeply. These efforts have been accompanied \nby accusations that, in an era of budget balancing and deficit \nreduction, the military is not absorbing its fair share of cuts.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Far from being placed on a pedestal, protected from America's budget \ncutting zeal, defense spending has already been subjected to a frenzy \nof profound and often damaging reductions. The defense budget has been \ncut every year for the past decade, for an overall real decline of some \n35 percent. In contrast, real spending on Medicare and Social Security \nover the same period has increased 63 and 23 percent, respectively.\n  The portion of the defense budget used to buy weapons and other \nequipment has already suffered a reduction of more than two-thirds over \nthe past decade:\n  A decade ago we purchased 720 tanks a year. Today, we buy none.\n  Annual purchases of ships and aircraft have declined 80 and 87 \npercent respectively.\n  Dozens of major weapons programs and more than a hundred smaller ones \nhave been terminated.\n  As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has put it, the \nPentagon has entered a ``procurement holiday.''\n  For the past decade, it has been defense that has borne the blows of \nthe budget cutting axe as domestic spending has steadily grown.\n  The very real reductions in defense budgets over the past decade may \nnot seem important from the vantage point of defense spending critics, \nbut for those whose job it is to ensure military readiness and to \nguarantee American security, the cuts have already made their tasks \ndifficult to the point of being almost impossible. The question for \nthese\n professionals is whether minimum levels of reliability and readiness \ncan be ensured, given current spending cuts.\n\n  Earlier this year, Gen. Carl Mundy, Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nwarned:\n\n       We are stretched thin. Actual operational commitments over \n     the past 3 years have actually grown steadily and have \n     greatly exceeded those predicted by either the Marine Corps \n     assessment or the Bottom-Up Review * * *. We have not to date \n     received sufficient resources to fund * * * minimum essential \n     requirements * * * to provide a reasonable assurance that we \n     can meet our commitments with operationally ready and \n     effective forces, not only today, but throughout the program \n     years.* * *\n\n  This assessment has been echoed by senior officers in all of the \nNation's armed services. It illustrates the well-founded concerns of \nthose who understand the importance of readiness and modernization in \nmilitary planning, especially in today's uncertain world.\n  The past few years have shown that the end of the cold-war standoff \nwith Soviet Russia has not simplified and brought harmony to the world, \nrather it has increased uncertainty and made the world more susceptible \nto a host of festering regional conflicts. Many of these conflicts have \nthe potential for escalation, spillover, and major destabilization in \nareas critical to the security and interests of the United States and \nour closest allies.\n  While the United States is not the world's policeman, we are the only \nglobal power, and we have global interests that can be threatened by \nregional powers, great and small. Defending our interests requires us \nto station forces abroad and to be able to project power around the \nglobe.\n  A brief glance around the world shows the variety of dangers the \nUnited States must be prepared to meet:\n  Russian troops are turning Chechnya into a wasteland and Russian \nneighbors into colonies, while Russian engineers prepare to build \nnuclear reactors in the terrorist theocracy of Iran and Russian \nofficials threaten the independence of the Baltics;\n  China also plans to sell Iran nuclear reactors and seems intent on \nbecoming a regional hegemon, claiming sovereignty over the strategic \nSouth China Sea, extending its coastal defense perimeter 10-fold out to \n2,000 miles, and backing these claims up with military deployments;\n  Iran is aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons while also deploying \nRussian-built submarines and Chinese- and North Korean-built missiles \nin order to gain control of the Persian Gulf and dominate its \nneighbors;\n  North Korea has violated last October's nuclear agreement and \ncontinues to mass troops and artillery on the DMZ, making an Asian \nnuclear arms race and another Korean war real possibilities.\n  NATO is edging closer to intervening in Bosnia in order\n   to rescue the U.N. troops deployed there, which would put some \n25,000 United States troops in the midst of a seemingly intractable \nwar.\n\n  Those who view this as merely a list of hypothetical risks unlikely \nto require American military deployments would do well to recall that \nsince the end of the cold war, U.S. Armed Forces have been sent into \naction repeatedly on some 2\\1/2\\ dozen operations.\n  While members of the Armed Services Committee are on record as \nfavoring increases in the defense budget, this amendment would merely \nslow the decline in defense spending over the next 7 years. Even if \nthis amendment is adopted, defense spending will continue to decline in \nreal terms for another 7 years, resulting in 17 straight years of cuts \nin the defense budget.\n  Given the tremendous cuts imposed on the defense budget in recent \nyears [[Page S7189]] and the great uncertainty we face around the \nworld, we cannot continue to gut America's Armed Forces. The military \nis already strained by the unprecedented number of peacetime operations \nit is being ordered to undertake.\n  Mr. President, listening to the leaders of our Armed Forces and \nlooking around the world, we are compelled to conclude that putting the \nbrakes on military spending cuts is not merely a wise position, it is a \nnational security imperative.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Thurmond amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nThurmond-McCain amendment, which seeks to increase defense spending by \n$68 billion over the next 7 years, and pay for that increase by making \nfurther cuts in domestic programs.\n  In this era of shared sacrifice where no one is spared the budget \nax--not children, seniors, nor veterans--I fear that those who would \nnow ask the Senate to increase the level of defense spending simply do \nnot understand the true war this country is fighting.\n  Mr. President, it is America's families who are on the front lines \ntoday, fighting to find a safe place to live, a sound education for \ntheir children, affordable health care, and job security.\n  It is the war against crime, poverty, ignorance, and AIDS that needs \nto be this country's priorities as we approach the next century.\n  During the cold war, Americans made sacrifices here at home so that \nour national resources could be used to defeat communism around the \nglobe. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and with it, the Warsaw Pact. The \nSoviet Union officially dissolved in 1991. We fought the war, and we \nwon.\n  In the aftermath of the cold war, I believe American families deserve \nto live in a safer and more stable world. They deserve to know that \nmore of their tax dollars are going to educate their children and \npolice their streets.\n  The Republican budget before us today, which outlines their spending \npriorities for the next 7 years, makes deep cuts in programs for \nchildren, the poor, veterans, and the elderly, while insulating defense \nspending from cuts.\n  And now we are asked to support an amendment which would add $68 \nbillion more in defense spending, and to pay for that increase, \nAmerican families would have to accept yet deeper cuts in domestic \nprograms.\n  Even without this amendment, let us remember what the Republican \nbudget is asking of American families.\n  Teachers and students are asked to accept dramatic cuts in education \nspending, worker training programs, and student loan assistance.\n  Preschoolers and their parents must accept a 30-percent cut in Head \nStart funding, which will deny as many as 100,000 low-income children \nthe benefit of a preschool education.\n  Rural Americans will be asked to accept 20-percent cuts in mandatory \nagriculture spending.\n  Children and the elderly will be asked to shoulder $400 billion in \nMedicare and Medicaid cuts. In America today, one in four children, and \none in three infants, are covered by Medicaid.\n  The earned income tax credit, a program to help keep working families \noff welfare, will be cut by 11 percent.\n  Our Nation's scientific community must accept $25 billion in cuts for \nbasic research.\n  The budget blueprint before us increases the veterans' contribution \nfor GI bill education benefits, and freezes funding for the VA's \nmedical system at the 1995 level for the next 7 years, cutting access \nto health care for veterans around the Nation. Under the Republican \nproposal, the VA will be forced to close the equivalent of 35 of its \n170 hospitals and deny care to over 1 million of our Nation's vets.\n  And if we accept the amendment now pending before the Senate, \nAmerican families would be asked to accept even deeper cuts in \neducation funding, crime control, and other important domestic \nprograms.\n  Proponents of this amendment point to recent declines in defense \nspending with alarm. While spending for our military is down from the \nmid-1980's level, we must keep this trend in perspective. The United \nStates today has the largest military budget and the most powerful \nmilitary force in the world.\n  The combined military budgets of Russia, Iraq, China, North Korea, \nLibya, Iran, Syria, and Cuba total $95 billion annually. That is one-\nthird the level of U.S. defense spending. Each year, the United States \nspends more than the next nine of the world's biggest military spenders \ncombined.\n  In fact, this country spends so much for defense, even the Pentagon \ncan't keep track of it all. According to the GAO and the Pentagon's \ninspector general, as well as the Pentagon's\n Controller John Hamre, billions of defense dollars are lost year after \nyear due to poor recordkeeping and lax accounting practices at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n\n  According to GAO, each year the pentagon pays private contractors up \nto $750 million it does not owe them--with businesses often paid twice \nfor the work they have done. And at this point, according to the \nPentagon, there is really no way to retrieve these lost funds, or to \nstop the massive overpayments.\n  Billions of dollars simply lost in the system, Mr. President, in an \nera when we are saying no to university scientists looking for cures to \ndevastating diseases.\n  Billions of dollars lost in the system when we are saying no to \npreschoolers who need HeadStart programs.\n  Billions of dollars lost in the system, when we are saying no to our \nNation's elderly, who thought they could rely on Medicare in their \nfinal years.\n  Billions of lost dollars when we are saying no to basic scientific \nresearch, which has fueled our economy for decades.\n  At the very least, Congress should hold defense spending to the \nPresident's level until the Pentagon can fix their payment procedures \nand bring some accountability to the system. We owe that much to the \nNation's taxpayers.\n  Our debate today is about deficit reduction--which requires hard \nchoices. Under the Senate budget plan, the United States will continue \nto maintain the strongest military in the world. Today the military's \nshare of the gross domestic product is 4.6 percent, which is higher \nthan the entire Federal domestic discretionary budget combined 3.7 \npercent.\n  And in the current international climate, where the United States \nremains the only military superpower, we are also the dominant economic \nand political actor on the stage. In this role, we must increasingly \nemphasize nonmilitary solutions to global conflicts--diplomatic \nnegotiations, multilateral efforts, and regional responses.\n  But most of all, in order to project strength abroad, we must gain \nstrength here at home. Our national security, in my view, will not be \nstrengthened by yet more guns and missiles. We need to restore global \neconomic leadership. We must invest in our children and their future--\nin their education and their health. We must rebuild our cities and our \ninfrastructure, and invest in technology and scientific research.\n  We must ensure that the economy our children inherit in the next \ncentury is sound and growing.\n  Mr. President, I will end with a quote from Dwight Eisenhower, who \nobserved in 1953,\n\n       Every gun that is fired, every warship launched, every \n     rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from \n     those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are \n     not clothed. The world in arms is not spending money alone. \n     It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its \n     scientists, the hopes of its children.\n\n  General Eisenhower had it right. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues \nto defeat the Thurmond-McCain amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am a supporter of this historic budget. \nBut I want briefly to comment on the level of defense spending it \nrecommends--a level I believe is clearly inadequate to retain our long-\nterm readiness and the quality of life of our men and women in uniform.\n  Balancing the books is one of the most important duties of \nGovernment. But it is not the first duty of Government. That duty is \nthe defense of our country, this means more than defending our borders. \nIt means shaping a security environment that will be favorable to \nAmerica in the future. It means providing our troops with the training \nthey need and the equipment they require.\n  The Armed Services Committee has spent a good deal of time and effort \nthis spring, through hearings and briefings, exploring the current and \nfuture needs of our military. [[Page S7190]] \n  Although the cold war is over--we have found that the demands we \nplace on our military have not diminished. If anything, they have \nexpanded--into quick deployments, in high-risk situations, under \ntremendous danger and strain. For example:\n  Our shrinking forces in Europe--from 314,000 prior to the fall of the \nBerlin wall and now rapidly approaching 100,000--have been deployed in \nmore missions in the last 5 years than in the previous 45 years.\n  The average soldier now spends approximately 138 days each year away \nfrom home on extended, short notice deployments. This must be combined \nwith extensive training to maintain key skills.\n  Our Navy surface ships, and the men and women who man them, are \ndeploying and training at tempos that keep them away from home in \nexcess of 130 days per year, on average.\n  The Marines currently have 24,000 people deployed overseas carrying \nout 911 fast reaction assignments. Just to give you some concept of the \npace of change in the Marines, the total manning level for the Marines \nhas been stabilized at 178,000. During the last 5 years, the Marine \nCorps downsized 24,000 personnel--the same figure which is currently \ndeployed.\n  The Air Force has gone from 18 active fighter wings to 13 wings \nresulting in a four-fold increase in deployment obligations over the \nlast 7 years--while drawing down the overall end strength by one third. \nThese commitments have required a quadrupling of the total number of \npeople deployed over the last 5 years.\n  My point is this: A serious gap is opening between the military \nmission we define and the level of funding we provide. Unfortunately, \nthe budget resolution before us continues this dangerous trend, which \nmay leave our forces without the tools, training or equipment to \nfulfill future tasks we will ask of them.\n  The Gulf war is our benchmark of American military success. It is an \neffort we must be able to duplicate, well into the future. But even \nthat war was conducted under the most favorable circumstances.\n  We had 6 months to move equipment and troops into the region. It is \nvery unlikely we will enjoy that sort of advantage in other situations.\n  Our training and logistics were given extensive time to put into \nplace.\n  Our opponent had inferior technology, and no known weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  All the surrounding countries in the region were friendly.\n  The international community was solidly behind us.\n  As we plan for the next war--a war we hope will never come--it would \nbe foolish to base our strategy on advantages we enjoyed in the last \none. And I am deeply concerned we have squandered some of the \nadvantages we can control.\n  If we attempted today to engage in a major regional conflict, I \nbelieve we have placed artificial handicaps on our ability to project \nAmerican power. Future enemies have gained from the lessons learned by \nIraq, and will not allow a protracted buildup to take place. We would \nnot be able to conduct such a war because the shortfalls in air and sea \nlift capabilities would prevent it.\n  The drawdown in personnel over the last 4 years is another critical \nelement in this debate. The proposed budget levels will not allow us to \nadequately address these shortfalls. We need additional funding in \ndefense to develop capable and modern equipment, and allow our men and \nwomen to do the job assigned to them.\n  In addition, with this continued decline of our defense, we are \nsending the wrong message to the world, especially to our allies--a \nmessage of retreat and withdrawal. America has world-wide commitments \nand national interests which must be maintained. Our ability to back-up \nthose obligations, with a strong and viable military, should be one of \nour highest priorities.\n  If we build our economic security but cripple our military capability \nin the process, then we will have failed both our children and our \nNation. Maintaining America's national strength is our best assurance \nof peace--and that peace is worth the price.\n  Mr. President. I support the Thurmond amendment. It is an effort to \nreverse a dangerous trend, and restore a national resource--the \nstrength of our Nation. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment from the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, before the Senate votes on this \namendment, I want to be sure that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisles understand the importance of this vote.\n  If the Senate elects not to support an increase in defense spending, \nthen the responsibility for underfunding defense for the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears will no longer rest with the administration. By accepting the \nBudget Committee recommendation to accept the administration's proposed \ndefense budgets we, the Members of the Senate, must bear full \nresponsibility for decreasing readiness and the lack of modernization \nin our Armed Forces.\n  The Armed Services Committee has received a large number of letters \nrequesting assistance and support for items in the defense budget or \nfunds to be added in the authorization process. I want to make it clear \nthat it will be very difficult to include any new programs or proposals \nthat add money to existing defense programs without the increase in \nfunds this amendment provides. Furthermore, resources to provide \nadditional equipment for the National Guard and Reserves will not be \navailable. Programs within the budget that are already at jeopardy such \nas the third Seawolf submarine are at greater risk without the increase \nthis amendment provides.\n  Mr. President, this is not a threat but reality. I hope all my \ncolleagues will consider this amendment carefully and vote to provide \nthe funds needed for an adequate defense for our Nation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Thurmond-McCain \namendment to increase the level of defense spending to a reasonable \nlevel. Throughout my campaign, I promised the voters to oppose \nadditional cuts in defense, and sufficiently fund important weapons \nsystems modernization programs needed to ensure our forces' \ntechnological supremacy. Although there may no longer be a monolithic \nthreat to our existence, there are a myriad of threats and strategic \ninterests which warrant a United States military force level capable of \nprotecting them.\n  In defining and protecting the U.S. strategic interests, the Clinton \nadministration has been negligent. It has consistently failed to \nrequest the funds necessary to field, maintain and train the forces \nnecessary to carry out its own National Security Strategy. Estimates of \nthis budget shortfall range from almost $50 billion to over $480 \nbillion during the next five years. In fact, the President's budget \nwill allow military spending to fall below the anemic levels provided \nto the hollow forces of the Carter administration. From 1985 to the end \nof the Clinton administration's budget in 2001, critical procurement \nmodernization programs will fall over 57 percent, while research and \ndevelopment spending is cut by almost 40 percent.\n  Therefore I believe our military capability is seriously compromised. \nSenator McCain's February 1995 Report on Military Capabilities and \nReadiness stated that although smaller forces can still be militarily \neffective, they must also be ``continually enhanced through \nmodernization.'' The former service Chiefs of Staff who conducted this \nstudy found military modernization at a standstill, while procurement \nand research and development budgets were insufficient to maintain our \nforce's technological superiority.\n  Mr. President, in light of these conditions, I find it imperative to \nsupport the amendment proposed by Senator Thurmond. This amendment \nwould increase defense spending by $67.9 billion over seven years and \nfinance it by an equivalent reduction in non-defense discretionary \nspending. As I mentioned during the debate on the Gramm tax cut \namendment, I agree that it is possible to reduce discretionary spending \nfurther than what is proposed in the budget resolution. However, I do \nnot think it is prudent to do so on a proportionate across-the-board \nbasis. In my judgement, additional program eliminations and \nconsolidations in targeted areas of the budget is the proper course to \nfollow.\n  In closing, providing for the Nation's defense is the Federal \nGovernment's first and primary responsibility. To [[Page S7191]] allow \nthe President to deplete our military below that level necessary to \nprotect our strategic interests is irresponsible and ill-advised. We \nmust increase the funding to the National Defense account and we must \ndo it now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the time is getting out of \nbalance in terms of those in favor and those opposed. Do we have any \npeople who might speak in opposition?\n  Mr. EXON. We will have somebody in just a moment.\n  There has been some misunderstanding on time. At the present time, \nwill the Chair advise the Senate how much time is allocated and \nremaining to the proponents of the amendment, and what is the split on \nthe time with regard to the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 25 minutes remaining. The \nopponents, the Senator from Nebraska, would have 50 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I did not hear the time in answer to my \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry. The proponents would have 25 \nminutes remaining. Senator Domenici would have 10 minutes. And you \nwould have 50 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did Senator Thurmond want to yield some time or did he \nwant to wait?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will wait and let them speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that would be fair.\n  Mr. EXON. I inquire of the Senator from Iowa, [Mr. Grassley], who \nasked for some time, is he prepared to offer his remarks at this time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from Iowa wish?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I have 5 minutes for the moment. I may want some \ntime later on.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 5 minutes, and if the Senator needs more time I \nwill be glad to yield it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a battle that is mainly being \nfought on the Republican side. There are Republicans who are bent on \npumping up the defense budget once again. There are a lot of \nRepublicans on this side who are of the opinion that that should not be \ndone. They may not speak as well about that issue, so I am going to do \nwhat I do quite often, oppose the efforts by my distinguished \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, to make sure that we do \nnot spend any more money on defense than what is in the very well-\ncrafted compromise put together by the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici.\n  The proposal to pump up the defense numbers makes no sense at all. I \nthink it defies all reason and all understanding. I am baffled by their \nproposal; more important, baffled by the number of $92 billion, higher \nthan anything I had heard spoken of behind the scenes over the last \nmonth that might come up at this particular time.\n  What they are doing is starting back on the slippery slope towards \nhigher defense budgets that is a license for further waste and \nmismanagement. Not only that, but the world situation does not call for \nspending more money at this particular time. The Soviet threat is gone. \nThe cold war is over. But the debate in Congress for spending more for \ndefense is reminiscent of that era.\n  There has been a dramatic decrease in the primary threat to our \nnational security as we knew it. We have rewritten our national \nsecurity goals, but the budget that my colleagues want the increase for \nis defined in those cold war terms.\n  The defense budget is coming down, and it should be coming down. So \nwhy do they say that it needs to go up? Why and for what? There is no \ngood reason. The bureaucrats at the Pentagon say that they need more \nmoney, and they say they need it right now. That is the reason. That \nhappens to be the only reason.\n  Once again I wish to remind my colleagues what happened on May 2, \n1985. The Reagan administration was trying to continue the pumped up \ndefense numbers that had been in existence for 3 years at that \nparticular time. They were trying to push defense spending from around \n$255 billion in fiscal year 1985 to around $300 billion in fiscal year \n1986, and then to $400 billion, and then to $500 billion in the years \nbeyond.\n  Now, that was at the height of the cold war and the height of Soviet \nmilitary power. The rise in the Soviet military power was the principal \ndriver behind the plan to push the Pentagon budget to $500 billion by \nthe year 1990. But on May 2, 1985, the Senate rejected this Reagan \ndefense budget buildup even in the face of massive Soviet military \npower.\n  This measure, the fiscal year 1986 budget resolution, put a brake on \nthat, effectively ending the planned growth of the Pentagon budget. If \nwe rejected a defense budget buildup to those numbers in 1985 when we \nwere confronted with a serious military threat, why would we now move \nto pump up the budget when that threat has literally evaporated? Why \nwould we do that?\n  As we learned back in the 1980's, higher defense budgets only bring \nhigher costs, more overhead, and more waste, as long as the Department \nof Defense management leadership remains AWOL. More money for defense \nwhen the threat to our national security has decreased dramatically \ncannot be justified. The numbers before us in this amendment then \ncannot be justified.\n  May I have 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The international situation today as we know it points \nto decreasing threats and a call for defense numbers to stay flat. If \nwe pump up the budget now, we will be buying weapons that we do not \nneed, weapons like the Sea Wolf submarine, the F-22 fighter, more B-2 \nbombers, Comanche helicopters, all designed to defeat a threat that no \nlonger exists. The Sea Wolf, the F-22, the B-2 and the Comanche are all \ncold war relics. The cold war warriors are trying to buy cold war \nweapons on a post-cold war budget. That is the only reason we are \nhaving the debate on this amendment today.\n  This kind of defense policy will give us another hollow force like we \nhad in the 1970's. We will end up with another hollow force because the \ncold war warriors have to rob the readiness accounts to pay for the \ncold war relics. They have to rob the readiness accounts because all \nthe cold war weapons are underfunded. They are underfunded because this \noutrageous price tag cannot be justified in the absence of a Soviet \nmilitary threat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska. I congratulate him on his excellent work on this measure.\n  Mr. President, a number of recent newspaper articles, in the \nWashington Post and the Baltimore Sun, have reported on the extent of \nfinancial mismanagement in the Department of Defense. These reports \nindicate that this mismanagement has resulted in at least $28.8 billion \nlost in overpayments to defense contractors or simply unaccounted for \nover the past decade. Unbelievably, this amount is down from $48.7 \nbillion in 1993. The current Department of Defense comptroller, Mr. \nJohn Hamre, has had the unenviable task of trying to sort out the \nextent of the problem and the multiple causes for it. He is to be \ncommended for his diligence and honesty in dealing squarely with this \nissue, and he deserves our support as he attempts to correct the \nunderlying morass of multiple and confusing payment and accounting \nsystems that created the current crisis. But the fact is, the \nDepartment of Defense cannot adequately safeguard the roughly $260 \nbillion that it is entrusted with each year. Yet the amendment before \nus would increase the money entrusted to the Department of Defense by \n$92 billion over 7 years. This amendment would cut deeper into the \nshrinking accounts for energy, agriculture, education, and law \nenforcement programs--programs that directly benefit every American \ncitizen--in order to pour more money into [[Page S7192]] a defense \nmoney bucket that has so many holes in it that it might better be \ndescribed as a money sieve.\n  According to the press reports, which also cite Department of Defense \nInspector General and the General Accounting Office reports, basic \naccounting and record-keeping procedures, required of even the smallest \nprivate office, are not widely followed in the Department of Defense \nand the military services. Invoices and payment records are not \nreconciled, yearly tracking of funds spent on equipment or programs is \nnot done, and program managers are authorized to write checks on the \nDepartment of Defense account without checking the balance in the \ncentral registry. And the Department of the Treasury covers the \nDepartment of Defense's bad checks, so no one is ever held accountable \nfor their profligate spending. Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States for the General Accounting Office, has \nstated in written testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense that ``none of the military services or major DoD components \nhave produced reliable financial statements since the passage of the \nCFO [Chief Financial Officers] Act of 1990.''\n  According to the DoD Inspector General, $14.7 billion cannot be \naccounted for with invoices, so the Department of Defense cannot say \nthat it is not buying unneeded or unnecessary items. Over $7 billion \nworth of goods and services were purchased by military offices in \nexcess of the amounts authorized by Congress. Every year, the \nDepartment of Defense overpays defense contractors by $500-750 million. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office,\n while contractors generally notify the Department of Defense when they \nare overpaid, they may not return the payments unless instructed to do \nso. As of July 1994, a sample of large and small defense contractors \nwere holding approximately $231.5 million in contract overpayments, \nincluding one that had been outstanding for about 7 years, costing the \ngovernment about $5 million in interest. This is not a system that \nneeds more money added to it.\n\n  While many of these appalling examples of waste are due to the \nproblems inherent in antiquated and confusing accounting systems, 19 \ndifferent payroll systems, and over 200 different contracting systems, \nthere are also troubling examples of potential fraud that are being \ninvestigated. One involves an investigation into whether Air Force \nofficials used money from various weapons programs to construct a golf \ncourse. In today's difficult fiscal environment, it is essential that \nevery defense dollar goes toward maintaining the readiness of our \nfighting forces and is not diverted to golf courses or to purchasing \nitems in excess of defense needs because we cannot keep track of our \nmoney.\n  Secretary of Defense Perry and Mr. Hamre have made great progress in \ncorrecting this mess, which stretches back over decades but was \nexacerbated during the defense buildup in the 1980's. The number of \naccounting programs are being reduced, the financial staff is being \nhalved and consolidated from 300 offices nationwide to 25, and a system \nis being implemented to check all payments against invoices. The number \nof different military and civilian pay systems have also been reduced.\n  These are important steps, and they are necessary steps. In his \nwritten testimony before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee \nthis morning, Mr. Hamre estimated that through the consolidation and \nstandardization of its financial systems and operations, the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service will achieve substantial savings in its \nown operating costs, on the order of $57 million in fiscal year 1997. I \nwould hope that these savings would be put to use further upgrading and \nconsolidating the Department of Defense accounting systems into a \nsmoothly functioning system. Improvements in financial management at \nthe Department of Defense should whittle down the current $28.8 billion \nin so-called ``problem disbursements.'' These savings should fund \nincreases in defense programs, not false savings brutally carved with a \nmeat axe from already lean energy, agriculture, education, and law \nenforcement programs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, \nand I say that with all due respect to the cosponsors thereof.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the articles to which I \nreferred in my statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, May 17, 1995]\n\n   Pentagon Unable to Account for $28.8 Billion; Error-Prone Payment \n                              System Cited\n\n                       (By Gilbert A. Lewthwaite)\n\n       Washington.--The Pentagon is facing an accounting gap, with \n     discrepancies on its books totaling $28.8 billion, its top \n     financial officer told Congress yesterday.\n       The problem includes a $13 billion imbalance between checks \n     the Pentagon has written over the past 10 years and the \n     vouchers it can produce to account for those payments. The \n     other $15 billion is from a variety of bookkeeping \n     shortcomings.\n       Pentagon comptroller John Hamre said $1 billion worth of \n     ``problem'' disbursements were being made monthly without \n     being properly matched to invoices.\n       ``We got into this sad state of affairs because we designed \n     a system where you pay now and account later,'' he told the \n     Senate Armed Services subcommittee on readiness. ``It isn't \n     that we have wicked people trying to screw up, it's that we \n     have a system that's so error-prone that good people working \n     hard are going to make mistakes.''\n       The Pentagon's finances are in such bad shape that Sen. \n     Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said the Defense Department \n     may need the sort of financial control board imposed on the \n     District of Columbia.\n       ``This is totally unacceptable. There is a lot of money \n     here which is going through the sieve,'' said Mr. Levin, \n     adding that voters experienced ``frustration, disappointment, \n     indeed, anger'' over reports of continuing Pentagon waste, \n     fraud and abuse, particularly at a time when Congress was \n     ordering major spending cuts in other programs.\n       Mr. Hamre, in an effort to explain the accounting \n     difficulties, said the Pentagon each month processes 2.5 \n     million invoices, spends $9.2 billion and issues 10 million \n     paychecks.\n       ``So that's 10 million times to get things screwed up,'' he \n     said.\n       His own pay, he said, had been miscalculated six times in \n     the 18 months he has spent in the department, adding: ``And \n     it's really bad when you screw up your boss' pay. And I've \n     done that a couple of times.''\n       Mr. Hamre's boss, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, has \n     made financial reform a priority in an effort to save money, \n     which can be spent on improving the combat readiness of the \n     armed forces.\n       The Perry plan calls for reducing the 250 accounting \n     systems the Pentagon operates, halving of the financial staff \n     of 46,000 to 23,000 in five years, and consolidating 300 \n     accounting offices nationwide into 25 financial centers.\n       To phase out the practice of paying first and accounting \n     for the payment later, beginning July 1 any Pentagon payment \n     of more than $5 million will have to be checked against an \n     invoice, said Mr. Hamre. After October 1, the new rule will \n     apply to payments of more than $1 million. Eventually it will \n     apply to all payments.\n       The military pay systems for uniformed personnel has been \n     reduced from 18 in 1991 to six today, and will be down to two \n     in 1997. Civilian pay systems have been reduced from 18 to \n     10. By 1998 there will be a single civilian pay system.\n       Mr. Hamre said the Defense Department was also screening \n     its retirement rolls after 1,000 military pension recipients \n     in the Philippines failed to turn up at the U.S. Embassy to \n     confirm their status. They were then struck from the rolls.\n       The Senate panel heard that in fiscal 1994 the Pentagon was \n     accountable for more than $1 trillion in assets, 3 million \n     military and civilian personnel, and $272 billion in \n     expenditures--approximately equivalent to 50 percent of the \n     federal government's discretionary spending.\n       ``It's big bucks,'' said Sen. John Glenn, a leader in the \n     decade-old campaign to reform the Defense Department's \n     accounting systems. ``If any of the civilian agencies on the \n     chopping block had [the Pentagon's] record on financial \n     management, they would probably be at the top of the hit \n     list.''\n       Charles A. Bowsher, U.S. comptroller general and the top \n     federal financial watchdog, said the Perry blueprint for \n     financial reform was ``a good overall plan,'' but he added \n     that only ``modest progress'' had been made in implementing \n     it.\n       Asked about overpayments of an average $750 million yearly \n     to defense contractors, Mr. Bowsher said that frequently it \n     was the contractors themselves who revealed the overpayments \n     to the Pentagon.\n       An accounting firm, hired by the General Accounting Office \n     to check on 5,000 defense contracts since 1990, found $285 \n     million in overpayments. To date the Pentagon has demanded \n     repayment of $133 million, but has actually collected only \n     $85 million, a GAO official said.\n       Mr. Bowsher also pointed to the ``Byzantine'' process of \n     obtaining a military travel voucher, which involved 40 \n     transactions costing the defense department 30 cents for \n     every travel dollar. Administrative charges in the private \n     sector were down to 1 cent for every dollar, he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 14, 1995]\n\n               Billions Go Astray, Often Without a Trace\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       Each year, the Defense Department inadvertently pays \n     contractors hundreds of millions of dollars that it does not \n     owe them, and much of the money is never returned.\n       In addition, the department has spent $15 billion it cannot \n     account for over the past decade.\n       And Pentagon purchasing agents appear to have overdrawn \n     government checking accounts by at least $7 billion in \n     payment for goods and services since the mid-1980s, with \n     little or no accountability.\n       Unlike the infamous $7,600 coffee pot and $600 toilet seat \n     pricing scandals of years past, these problems, and many \n     more, are the result of poor recordkeeping and lax accounting \n     practices that for years have characterized the way the \n     Defense Department keeps track of the money--$260 billion \n     this year--that it receives from Congress.\n       According to a series of investigations by the department's \n     inspector general and the General Accounting Office, and \n     ongoing work by Pentagon Comptroller John J. Hamre, the \n     Department's systems of paying contractors and employees are \n     so antiquated and error-prone that it sometimes is difficult \n     to tell whether a payment has been made, whether it is \n     correct, or even what it paid for.\n       Just how much money does the poor accounting waste?\n       Former deputy defense secretary and new CIA Director John \n     M. Deutch wouldn't hazard a guess. ``Lots,'' he scribbled \n     recently on a reporter's notebook in response to a question.\n       For months after he took the job as chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff in late 1993, Gen. John Shalikashvili \n     received paychecks for the wrong amount. In the last year and \n     a half, Comptroller Hamre counted six problems with his own \n     pay.\n       A paper-based system in which items frequently are \n     misplaced or lost and computers that often cannot talk to \n     each other are part of the problem. But there are other major \n     systemic weaknesses. A lack of basic accounting procedures--\n     such as matching invoices and payment records, or keeping \n     track of money spent on a given piece of equipment from one \n     year to the next--has made it impossible to determine how \n     billions of dollars have been spent by each of the service \n     branches.\n       In addition, Hamre explained, tracking the money has been \n     nearly impossible because 300 different program directors--\n     the Air Force F-16 fighter program director, the commanding \n     officer of an aircraft carrier, the head of a maintenance \n     depot, for example--have had separate checkbooks, each one \n     free to write checks without regard to the balance in the \n     Pentagon's central registry.\n       The U.S. Treasury has always paid the bills, even when \n     there was no money in a given project's account, because it \n     assumes any error was unintentional and someday would be \n     corrected, said Pentagon officials and inspector general \n     investigators.\n       ``There's this huge pot of money over there in the Treasury \n     that you can keep drawing down,'' said the Deputy Inspector \n     General Derek J. Vander Schaaf. ``As long as your [overall] \n     checkbook's good,'' he said, meaning the Treasury, ``nobody \n     screams.''\n       The problems were created over several decades and made \n     worse during the 1980s Reagan administration defense buildup \n     during the latter days of the Cold War, when there was little \n     political will to scrutinize the record sums being spent.\n       Today, however, even ardent defense hawks have become \n     disturbed over the mismanaged flow of funds. Some Republicans \n     who looked deeply into the matter are suggesting a freeze on \n     military spending until the Pentagon's corroded payment \n     system can be permanently fixed.\n       ``The defense budget is in financial chaos,'' said Sen. \n     Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who is advocating a freeze. \n     ``The foundation of the defense budget is built on sand.''\n       A Senate Armed Services subcommittee is scheduled to hold a \n     hearing on the problems Tuesday. It will be chaired Sen. John \n     Glenn (Ohio), a Democrat, who was authorized by Republicans \n     to conduct it because of his long-standing interest in the \n     subject.\n       Among the problems detailed by the Defense Department, the \n     Pentagon inspector general and the GAO:\n       Of the 36 Pentagon departments audited by the inspector \n     general (IG) in the last year, 28 used ``records in such \n     terrible condition'' as to make their annual financial \n     statements--an accounting of money collected and money \n     spent--utterly worthless, said Vander Schaaf.\n       Financial officials cannot account for $14.7 billion in \n     ``unmatched disbursements,'' checks written for equipment and \n     services purchased by all military units within the last \n     decade. This means that accountants know only that a certain \n     amount of money was spent on the overall F-16 jet account, \n     for example, but not how much was spent on F-16 landing gear \n     or pilot manuals because they cannot find a purchase order \n     from the government to match the check.\n       ``You don't know what you're really paying for,'' Vander \n     Schaaf said.\n       The $14.7 billion represents ``hard-core problems'' where \n     department accountants have tried but failed to find the \n     records. ``We could be paying for something we don't need or \n     want,'' said Russell Rau, the IG's director of financial \n     management.\n       In the last eight years, various military offices appear to \n     have ordered $7 billion worth of goods and services in excess \n     of the amount Congress has given to them to spend. These \n     ``negative unliquidated obligations'' may indicate that a \n     bill has been paid twice or mistakenly charged to the wrong \n     account because bookkeepers at hundreds of maintenance \n     depots, weapons program offices and military bases did not \n     keep track of payments they made, said Vander Schaaf.\n       Of the $7 billion ``the government has no idea how much of \n     this balance is still owed,'' Rau said.\n       Hamre has threatened to take part of the $7 billion out of \n     the military services' current operating budget if they \n     cannot find documentation for the expenditures by June 1.\n       Every year the Defense Department pays private contractors \n     at least $500 million it does not owe them, according to \n     Vander Schaaf. The GAO believes the figure is closer to $750 \n     million.\n       The payment system is in such bad shape that the Pentagon \n     relies on contractors to catch erroneously calculated checks \n     and return them. Many of the overpayments are due to errors \n     made on a paper-based system in which harried clerks are \n     judged by how quickly they make payments. And because there \n     is no adequate way to track the amount of periodic payments \n     made on a contract, businesses often are paid twice for the \n     work they have done.\n       Defense Department finance officials believe they are \n     recouping about 75 percent of the overpayments, although they \n     admit they have no way of knowing exactly how much is being \n     overpaid.\n       Today, after an 18-month struggle by Hamre to turn the \n     situation around, the department still has 10 payroll systems \n     and 200 different contracting systems.\n       Hamre, who wins praise from Republicans and Democrats for \n     his efforts, has undertaken a major consolidation of payroll \n     and contracting offices. He has opened more than 100 \n     investigations into whether individual program managers or \n     service agencies violated the law by using money appropriated \n     for one program for something else or for paying contracts \n     that exceeded their budget.\n       He has frozen 23 major accounts and has stopped payment to \n     1,200 contractors whose records are particularly troublesome. \n     In July, clerks will be prohibited from making payments over \n     $5 million to any contractor ``unless a valid accounting \n     record'' of the contract can be found. By October, the amount \n     drops to $1 million, which means it will affect thousands \n     more contracts.\n       According to Hamre and Rau, a number of cases are under \n     investigation for possible violations of the Anti-Deficiency \n     Act, the law that governs how congressionally appropriated \n     money must be spent. Penalties range from disciplinary job \n     action to criminal prosecution. Investigators are trying to \n     determine:\n       Why there is an unauthorized expenditure of around $1 \n     billion on the Mark 50 torpedo, and the Standard and Phoenix \n     missiles. Hamre and Rau suspect that Navy officials used \n     money appropriated for other items or wrote checks on empty \n     accounts to pay contracts from 1988 and 1992.\n       Whether Air Force officials used money from various weapons \n     programs to build a golf course at Wright-Patterson Air Force \n     Base in Ohio beginning in 1987.\n       What happened when some programs ran out of money. ``There \n     are some [cases] in the Air Force now that really stink,'' \n     Hamre said. When money for the Advanced Cruise Missile ran \n     out, Air Force officials simply terminated the existing \n     contract and rewrote another, more expensive one the \n     following day, Pentagon investigators recently concluded. In \n     order to pay for cost overruns associated with the new C-17 \n     cargo plane, contract officials simply reclassified $101 \n     million in development costs as production costs.\n       Hamre said the services allowed such money mingling to go \n     on partly because of the complexity of the yearly \n     congressional appropriations process. ``People want to find \n     an easier way to get the job done,'' he said. ``They are \n     trying to get some flexibility in a very cumbersome system.''\n       But, he added, some services also have resisted correcting \n     problems and punishing wrongdoers. ``I'm very frustrated by \n     it,'' he said. ``In the past, they just waited until people \n     retired. It was the old boy network covering for people.''\n       The Defense Department is unlike any government agency in \n     scope and size. It sends out $35 million an hour in checks \n     for military and civilian employees from its main financing \n     office in Columbus, Ohio. And it buys everything from \n     toothbrushes to nuclear submarines; about $380 billion flows \n     within the various military purchasing bureaucracies and out \n     to the private sector each year.\n       It takes at least 100 paper transactions among dozens of \n     organizations to buy a complex weapons system. Some supply \n     contracts have 2,000 line items and, because of the \n     congressional appropriations process, must be paid for by \n     money from several different pots.\n       Fixing the problems without throwing the entire system into \n     chaos, Hamre said, ``is like changing the tire on a car while \n     you're driving 60 miles per hour.''\n       But some argue it has never been more important to make the \n     fixes quickly.\n       ``Here we are in a period of reduced spending, it's \n     critically important today that we [[Page S7194]] get a \n     bigger bang for the buck,'' said Sen. William V. Roth Jr. \n     (R.-Del.), chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, \n     where many of the current problems were first revealed. \n     ``We've got to put pressure on to expedite it. At best, it \n     will take too long.''\n       But in the world of Defense Department financing, time is \n     not always a solution, as one small example illustrates.\n       In 1991, because of a computer programming error, the \n     department's finance and accounting service centers \n     erroneously paid thousands of Desert Storm reservists $80 \n     million they were not owed. When officials realized the \n     mistake, they began to send letters to service members to \n     recoup the overpayments. Many veterans complained to \n     Congress, which then prohibited the Pentagon from collecting \n     any overpayment of less than $2,500 and made it give back \n     money collected from people who received less than that \n     amount.\n       To comply, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     (DFAS) payment centers in Cleveland, Denver, Indianapolis and \n     Kansas City created new computer programs to cancel the debts \n     and issue refunds. But they did not adequately test the new \n     programs, IG and GAO investigators found.\n       As a result, the appropriate debts were not canceled, and \n     improper amounts of refunds were issued, often to the wrong \n     service member. The DFAS center in Denver, for example, \n     canceled $295,000 that service members owned it for travel \n     advances. In all, the botched effort to follow Congress's \n     direction cost taxpayers an additional $15 million, Pentagon \n     officials said.\n       ``It isn't possible now'' to recoup the money, Hamre said. \n     ``We can't reconstruct the records. We admit were really, \n     really bad. We don't do it again.'' The IG's office has \n     agreed that it would be too costly to reconstruct the records \n     and recoup the loss.\n       As he often does when he testifies about these matters on \n     Capitol Hill, Hamre confessed to the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee recently: ``We've made a lot of progress. But we've \n     got a long way to go.''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield Senator Nunn 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Thurmond-McCain amendment to \nincrease the defense spending levels in this budget resolution.\n  For over 2 years, I have been expressing my concern that projected \ndefense budgets are not sufficient from four standpoints: First, to \nmaintain the current readiness of our forces; second, to provide the \nstandard of living that military personnel and their families expect \nand deserve; third, supporting the force structure necessary to carry \nout the full range of missions that we expect our military forces to be \nable to perform; and fourth, to provide for the modernization that is \nthe key to the future capability of those forces. The modernization of \nour forces, which is essential to future readiness, is an area of \nincreasing concern, Mr. President, and this is an area where we are \nmost deficient today.\n  The men and women in the military continue to perform superbly every \ntime they are called on, and we are calling on them all the time. We \nowe it to them to give them the support they need to do their job. We \nalso have to ensure that the men and women who will be called on 5, 10, \nor 20 years from now will have the same advantages vis-a-vis their \nopponents that our forces have today, including the technological \nsuperiority that played such a key role in Operation Desert Storm and \nplays such a key role everywhere our forces are deployed today.\n  While I am encouraged by the funding for readiness, military pay \nraises, and quality of life initiatives Secretary Perry has recommended \nin the President's budget, I think there are clearly insufficient funds \ngoing into modernizing the force. Modernization, for the most part, is \ndelayed into the outyears under the current future years defense \nprogram. We all know how illusory these budget projections become 4 or \n5 years down the road.\n  Under the current budget, 1996 and 1997 will be the second and third \nstraight years during which the Air Force will not purchase a single \nnew fighter aircraft. The Air Force has no\n bomber program. Our leading standoff weapon program has been canceled, \nyet the budget, at this stage, contains no funds to replace that \ncapability. The number of navy ships is not nearly enough to replace \neven a 300-ship Navy. and the Marine Corps is years away from having a \nreplacement for its aging amphibious assault vehicles. It would not \ntake long to list the Army's modernization programs, but it would take \na long time to list the deficiencies in that program.\n\n  The fiscal squeeze on the defense budget is already intense. As we \nseek to balance the budget, and properly so--especially if we try to \nenact tax cuts, which I think are ill-advised, and which I hope this \nbody will vote against this afternoon--if we do that, however, the \npressure is going to get more and more intense on the defense budget. \nThis gives me even less confidence in the outyear funding predictions \nthat show funds for defense modernization increasing.\n  In my view, we need to increase the defense topline now particularly \nin the outyears, to restore the balance to our defense program. We also \nneed to reinstate the firewalls.\n  And I congratulate the chairman of the committee and the members of \nthe Budget Committee for doing this in the resolution. That is \nenormously important to protect any defense increases we are able to \nachieve and to provide some stability in the defense budget. Firewalls \nhave not and will not mean that defense cannot be cut. What it does \nmean is that these cuts will not be shifted to other programs, and that \nmeans that if there are defense cuts and the firewalls are in, then the \ncuts will go to deficit reduction. I believe that is appropriate, and I \nthink that is the way that defense is best protected.\n  We have been reducing the defense budget for a long time. The current \nbuilddown started during President Reagan's second term, even before \nthe fall of the Berlin Wall, and continued, accelerated, throughout the \nBush administration and the current administration. I believe the time \nhas come to stabilize the defense budget as much as possible, since the \ndefense budget has already made a greater contribution to deficit \nreduction than any other part of the budget; I might add, than all of \nthe budget combined.\n  In my judgment, the administration needs to restore some balance to \nthe defense program but Congress' recent action are a good news/bad \nnews story.\n  The good news is that the House budget resolution provided an \nincrease for the defense budget. This amendment would do the same in \nthe Senate budget resolution. And the Senate budget resolution, unlike \nthe House version, contains firewalls. But there has been bad news for \ndefense as well.\n\n\n            the senate resolution does not increase defense\n\n  First, although there have been a lot of statements that the \nPresident's defense budget and Bottom-Up Review force structure are \ninadequate, this resolution as reported out by the Budget Committee \ncontains no increase for defense above the levels proposed by the \nadministration--in fact in the final 2 years it is lower than the \nadministration's plan.\n  And while the House version of this resolution does increase defense, \nthe House voted earlier this year in their tax cut bill to pay for the \ntax cut largely by cutting discretionary spending, which includes \ndefense, and the House did not include firewalls in either the tax cut \nbill which reduced the discretionary caps or in their budget \nresolution. So the House has put discretionary spending on the table to \npay for cutting taxes, which certainly makes it more difficult to find \nthe money to increase the defense budget.\n\n\n         requirement that dod absorb the cost of contingencies\n  Second, despite the frequent complaints about the cost of contingency \noperations and their effect on readiness, the defense supplemental \nenacted earlier this year required the Department of Defense to absorb \nalmost the entire cost of these contingency operations--the very \npractice that had been criticized in the past. In fact, the House \nleadership wrote to the President earlier this year stating their \nintention that as a matter of policy all future supplementals would \nhave to be offset.\n  This resolution would essentially adopt that same approach by \nrequiring 60 votes for any future emergency supplementals, instead of a \nmajority vote as has been the case in the past. Of course this only \napplies to discretionary funding, since entitlement programs could \ncontinue to increase without even requiring votes, let alone \nsupermajority votes.\n  Mr. President, I have several concerns with the approach the Congress \n[[Page S7195]] has taken on supplementals so far this year. The defense \nsupplemental did not provide the net increase in defense spending for \nreadiness that was requested by the Clinton Administration, despite the \nconcerns many of my colleagues have expressed about readiness. The cost \nof these contingencies were made up almost entirely by cutting \nelsewhere in the defense budget, and those cuts came in modernization.\n  So the scorecard so far in this new Congress is that the defense \nbudget, as it now stands, counting the supplemental, is below what \nPresident Clinton had asked for. So to those in the Congress of the \nUnited States who are saying the Clinton defense budget is too low, and \npeople on both side of the aisle are saying that, I say to them we are \ncutting below the President's budget, not in this resolution, but in \nthe overall supplemental and that approach.\n  I am also troubled by the impact that a policy of making DOD absorb \nthe full cost of these contingencies could have on the\n defense budget and on defense management. It largely defeats the \npurpose of having supplementals, and I can already predict some of the \nproblems we are going to have with this policy.\n\n  I am not sure we have really thought through the impact of what we \nmay be doing to the military with this 100 percent offset approach. \nEarlier this year, Gen. Gordon Sullivan, the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, told the Armed Services Committee that if the Congress adopts a \npolicy of forcing the military to completely offset the costs of any \ncontingency operation:\n\n       * * * it is just going to destroy our training programs, \n     our quality of life programs, and it is going to be difficult \n     to manage the readiness of the force * * *. It is going to \n     come out of reducing real property maintenance. We may have \n     to furlough civilians, terminate termporary employees, \n     curtail supply requests, park vehicles, reduce environmental \n     compliance. It is going to have a major impact.\n\n  General Sullivan said that in the event the military is told to \nassist a large-scale evacuation of U.N. personnel from Croatia:\n\n       I just have to stop training, and I will have to move money \n     around from elsewhere to keep that operation going since \n     obviously what you expect me to do is to fight and win you \n     wars. So, I will have to get the money from people who are \n     not doing that to support it.\n\n  Now that may sound like an exaggeration to some, but if you \nunderstand the laws that govern the defense budget, you will see why \nGeneral Sullivan's comments are right on target. The cost of an \noperation, such as paying for the airlift to get there, the fuel, spare \nparts, and so on, must come out of the operating budget. The military \ndoes not have the authority to fund contingency costs by diverting \nfunds from the procurement of weapons, or from research or military \nconstruction or military personnel accounts, even if they wanted to.\n  And even within the operating budget, there are further constraints. \nA large portion of the operating account is civilian pay, so you cannot \nsave money there without firing civilians. And you cannot cut really \ncut the money to operate the bases--you have to pay the light bill. So \nthe areas General Sullivan is talking about--training, maintenance and \nrepair of the buildings on our military bases--are the only areas where \nthe military has the flexibility to change its plans halfway through \nthe year. And in fact that is exactly what happened last year--money \nhad to be diverted from training.\n  In addition to my concerns about the financial impact on the Defense \nDepartment if this bill is viewed as a precedent, I also\n share the concerns expressed by my friend Senator Inouye about the \nlong-term policy implications of telling the military any future \ncontingency they are involved in is going to come out of their budget \ndollar for dollar. This is going to have an impact on their ability and \ntheir willingness to respond to situations like Haiti or Cuba, or \nespecially a much more expensive operation like peace enforcement in \nBosnia, in the future. In effect, we could have our funding and \nbudgeting procedures dictating our foreign policy and our decisions on \nthe use of force.\n\n  I hope we do not set in concrete a policy of making the Defense \nDepartment absorb the costs of contingency operations, because if we \nare telling the Department of Defense that any time there is an \nemergency that comes up and they come over and request supplemental \nfunds that they are going to have to provide a 100-percent offset, then \nwe are going to change the nature of the responsiveness of the \nDepartment of Defense itself to the missions that may, indeed, be \ncrucial to our Nation's security.\n  If the Department of Defense is told that any unanticipated operation \nthey undertake, either unilaterally or with NATO or the United Nations, \nis going to have to be completely offset within the defense budget, \nwhich means they are going to have to basically kill or substantially \nalter crucial defense programs in order to absorb those costs, then the \nresult is going to be a very strong signal that the United States is \nnot going to be as involved as we have been in world affairs, including \ncommitments to our allies and commitments that we have voted for at the \nU.N. Security Council.\n\n\n              modernization funds are the first to be cut\n\n  The future readiness and future capability of the Defense Department \nrequires modernization and it requires research and development, and \nthose are the programs that were cut to fund the defense supplemental \nearlier this year, and those are the programs that will continue to be \nhurt by this policy of requiring complete offsets for contingency \noperations. Five or ten years from now, people will have a very serious \nproblem with readiness if we continue to declare there is no emergency \neven when our forces are responding to the unanticipated events that we \nall know will take place somewhere in the world from time to time.\n  This is why I am supporting this amendment to increase the defense \ntopline number. We have cut the defense budget so much already that \nthere is very little flexibility left to deal with the unexpected, even \nthough we all know that the Defense Department always has to be ready \nfor the unexpected--we expect them to be ready for the unexpected. And \nI am very concerned that as we struggle to live within these \ndrastically reduced budgets without further reducing our military \ncapability, the\n Congress will, acting in good faith to preserve readiness, make cuts \nthat will cause great harm over the long term.\n\n  You need look no further than the supplemental enacted earlier this \nspring to see the warning signs. What was cut to offset the cost of \ncontingency operations? Basic science and technology research. Dual-use \ntechnology programs that are designed to better integrate our defense \nand civilian technology bases in order to get the Defense Department \nbetter technology at lower cost. In other words, programs that will pay \noff in the long term but seem easy to cut in the short term.\n  Another example is environmental cleanup at military installations, \nwhich was cut by $300 million in the supplemental. Is this program as \nimportant to our combat capability as funding training and \nmodernization? Of course not. But the reason that environmental cleanup \ncosts are so high now is that for years these problems were ignored. \nAnd if we push them under the rug again, we are only going to wind up \nwith an even bigger bill down the road.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, so far we have seen a lot more talk \nthan action about enhancing our national security and increasing the \ndefense budget. Many of my colleagues share my concern that we have cut \nthe defense budget too far, too fast and that we are mortgaging our \nfuture by sacrificing the capability of our forces 10 years down the \nroad in order to fully fund current readiness. The Thurmond-McCain \namendment represents real action to enhance our national defense while \nat the same time putting us on a path to a balanced budget, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table showing real reductions in the \ndefense budget be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                        \n[[Page S7196]]\n                                                        FISCAL YEAR 1996 SENATE BUDGET RESOLUTION                                                       \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1980       1985       1990       1995       1996       1997       1998       1999       2000       2001       2002  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNat Def BA (current dollars)...     $143.9     $294.7     $303.3     $263.5     $257.7     $253.4     $259.6     $266.2     $276.0     $275.9     $275.9\nDOD fiscal year 1996                                                                                                                                    \n deflators\\1\\..................     0.5383     0.7130     0.8378     0.9727     1.0000     1.0294     1.0595     1.0900     1.1195     1.1494     1.1801\nNAT Def BA Const (1996 dollars)     $267.2     $413.3     $362.0     $270.9     $257.7     $246.2     $245.0     $244.2     $246.5     $240.0     $233.8\nGDP (CBO estimates)............     $3,746     $4,207     $4,853     $7,036     $7,370     $7,747     $8,152     $8,572     $9,013     $9,843     $9,978\nDefense BA as percent of GDP...        3.8        7.0        6.2        3.7        3.5        3.3        3.2        3.1        3.1        2.8        2.8\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\CBO assumes higher inflation.                                                                                                                        \n\n                            Real Changes\n\n                                                           (In percent)\n1980-85............................................................54.6\n1985-90...........................................................-12.4\n1990-95...........................................................-25.2\n1995-2000..........................................................-9.0\n1980-1990..........................................................35.4\n1985-1995.........................................................-34.5\n1990-2000.........................................................-31.9\n1980-1995...........................................................1.4\n1985-2000.........................................................-40.3\n1980-2000..........................................................-7.7\n1980-2002.........................................................-12.5\n1985-2002.........................................................-43.4\n1990-2002.........................................................-35.4\n1995-2002.........................................................-13.7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Carolina and \nmy colleague from Arizona for sponsoring this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, for offering this amendment, along with \nSenator McCain.\n  I commend both of my colleagues for this amendment to restore much \nneeded funds to our defense program and to do it without adding to the \ndeficit but by setting priorities throughout the budget, including the \ndefense budget. I might add that that also has priorities shuffled \naround in order to help with this amendment.\n  I want to emphasize from the outset, again, it does not undermine the \nobjective of a balanced budget by the year 2002. This amendment will \nnot change that objective in any way. We still get to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002.\n  But what this amendment does do is to help stave off terrible \nshortfalls in military readiness training and modernization. We owe it \nto our troops in the field to have the training and modernization that \nthey deserve if we are going to ask them to go into harm's way.\n  The defense reductions under President Clinton's budget, frankly, are \nwreaking havoc on our military capability. Most of us in this Chamber \nknow that, especially those of us who are on the Armed Services \nCommittee who see it every day.\n  I hope that my colleagues would listen carefully to those of us on \nthe Armed Services Committee in both parties who have spoken so \neloquently on this matter. This body simply cannot and must not \nlegitimize a blueprint for disaster by approving these kinds of defense \nnumbers.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled that the Budget Committee has endorsed \nthe Clinton defense numbers. These spending totals are simply \ninadequate to safeguard our national security. And they are already \nhaving a very serious effect on readiness.\n  I am also troubled that the President has chosen to blame Congress \nfor current deficiencies in military readiness. I would emphasize that \nthis is the same administration that entered office and immediately cut \ndefense by $178 billion, the same administration that has dramatically \nunderfunded operations, maintenance, and readiness modernization and \nquality of life programs for our military families.\n  This is the same administration that has turned our Armed Forces into \na 911 force all over the world on behalf of the United Nations, and yet \nwe ask more and more and more and give them less and less and less.\n  This is the same administration that committed our military forces to \noccupy Haiti without the consent of Congress, costing taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  This is the same administration that turned our naval base at \nGuantanamo into a refugee camp leaving the Defense Department stuck \nfooting the bill to feed, clothe and bathe thousands of refugees \nindefinitely while subjected to the insults of many of them.\n  This is the same administration that has pledged $4 billion in \nnuclear reactors for North Korea at the time we are spending tens of \nbillions of dollars to defend against a North Korean military threat.\n  I find these types of inconsistency preposterous. The truth is that \nthe Clinton defense program is decimating our Armed Forces. Personnel \ntempo is going through the roof, our troops are being constantly \ndeployed all over the world from Haiti to Somalia to Southwest Asia and \nback home, with little or no time to spend with their families, and \nthey are out again going someplace else.\n  I urge my colleagues to talk to them, talk to the military personnel, \ntalk to their families and find out how tough this is.\n  Depot maintenance backlogs are increasing; critical modernization \nprograms are being terminated; morale is down; retention is down; 25 \npercent of our Army divisions were recently classified as unprepared to \nmeet their mission requirements.\n  Mr. President, if Senators support this blueprint, which is so \ndevastating our military capabilities, then they ought to oppose the \nThurmond-McCain amendment. It is as simple as that. If you do not want \nto give our Armed Forces what they deserve, then go ahead and oppose \nthe amendment. But if you share the view of the majority of Americans \nthat this President has gone too far with these military reductions and \nour international security is in jeopardy, you should support the \nThurmond-McCain amendment.\n  In conclusion, I want to emphasize this amendment does not add to the \ndeficit, it will not undermine the balanced budget, and it will restore \nmuch needed funds back to our defense program to stave off an imminent \ndisaster in military readiness.\n  I yield back any time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Does the opposition have any speakers, Mr. President? \nMr. President, we will have to charge time over there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask again, does the opposition have \nany speakers?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and the \ntime be equally charged.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lott.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have an additional 10 minutes we can yield, too. Why \ndo I not yield 5 of the 10 I have to Senator Lott.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could make a parliamentary inquiry, but \nnot counted against my time, what is the status? Are we going to try to \nget some debate back and forth, or should I proceed at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not see how we can make them do that if they do \nnot--the best we can do is put a quorum call in. When you put a quorum \ncall in, under the statute, it is charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is charged to the side who suggests it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have two alternatives. We can wait around and see if \nthey suggest it or, if they do not, then we can just let the time run \nand it is equally charged. The Senator asked that it be equally charged \nunder a UC?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. What we are attempting to do is unsnarl a \npotential problem. If we can have a moment to talk we might be able to \nunsnarl it.\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 5 \nminutes charged to no one.\n  Mr. EXON. There is a suspicion somebody is trying to fool somebody \nelse.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes charged to neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nthat the time be charged to neither side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have to advise Senators that the time \nhas come to start a vote shortly. So I ask unanimous consent that at \n3:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote on the stacked votes that had \nbeen postponed earlier today, in the following sequence: The Bradley \nmotion to waive; on or in relation to the Roth amendment; on or in \nrelation to the Gramm amendment; on or in relation to the Exon \namendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the first vote in the voting \nsequence be 20 minutes and that thereafter they be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the conclusion of the stacked votes, the Senate resume the \npending amendment, which would be placed in status quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum until 3:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With the time to be equally divided?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, we have before us a proposed budget that \ncuts over $1 trillion in Federal spending. It cuts health, education, \ntraining, veterans, and virtually everything else but for one item. The \nPentagon is increased by $34.5 billion over what a hard freeze would be \nover the 7 years. Simply put, this budget jeopardizes our long-term \nnational security by failing to invest in education, training, and \ninfrastructure in order to preserve a bloated Pentagon budget and its \ncold war relics.\n  Mr. President, the cold war is over, I would like to inform everyone. \nAnd guess what? We won.\n  First let me explain exactly what my amendment does. My amendment \nwill provide over the next 7 years for a hard freeze for Pentagon \nspending.\n  Now, for the next 3 years, my amendment would track exactly what the \nBudget Committee does--exactly. For 1996, 1997, and 1998, my amendment \nwould provide the same funding for the Pentagon as does the \nRepublicans' budget proposal.\n  Beginning then in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, I increase spending for \ndefense but not as much as the Budget Committee.\n  For example, in 1999, the Budget Committee provides $266.2 billion \nfor defense. My amendment would provide $261.4, less than $5 billion \nless. So I track it, but what happens is over the 7 years my amendment \nfreezes it--over the 7 years--and thus saves $34.8 billion.\n  My amendment would take that $34.8 billion and put it into function \n500, which is education and job training. Education and job training is \nway below a hard freeze in the committee bill. The Defense Department, \nthe Pentagon is above a hard freeze. I am bringing the Pentagon down to \na hard freeze, taking that money, putting it into education and job \ntraining to bring it up to just under a hard freeze. It still would be \nbelow a hard freeze level of funding for education and job training, \nbut at least it brings it up close to a hard freeze.\n  But I wanted to make the point very clear, that for the first 3 years \nmy amendment spends the same thing on defense as does the Budget \nCommittee. And so those who would like to just kind of freeze \neverything, well, this is a freeze amendment. It freezes Pentagon \nspending for the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I keep picking up these articles. I know Senator Byrd \nearlier talked about the articles that were in the Washington Post: \nBillions go astray often without a trace in the Defense Department is \nthe headline in this recent story on Pentagon waste. It says the \nDepartment has spent $15 billion it cannot account for over the past \ndecade. And Pentagon purchasing agents appear to have overdrawn \nGovernment checking accounts by at least $7 billion in payment for \ngoods and services with little or no accountability.\n  You want to talk about waste and inefficiency, start reading some of \nthese articles about waste and inefficiency in the Defense Department. \nIt boggles the mind and it picks taxpayers' pockets.\n  I also want to point to a scandal that happened last December in the \nAir Force, and to my knowledge it still has not been resolved--a \nscandal. Gen. Joseph W. Ashy was in Italy. He wanted to get to the U.S. \nSpace Command in Denver, CO. He could have flown commercially, could \nhave gotten on a United Airlines flight. No, he got an Air Force C-141 \ntransport jet that flew empty from here to Italy, picked him up and \nflew him to Colorado at an estimated cost of $120,000.\n  Did he fly alone? No, he took his cat with him. I guess he paid $85 \nfor his cat. But he listed on the manifest that his wife was going to \nbe with him, that she was traveling with him. His wife was already in \nColorado, and it turned out that there was a young Air Force aide, a \n21-year-old senior airman Christa Hart, a young woman traveling with \nhim, and she was not even listed on the manifest but his wife was.\n  You wonder why she was on that flight with him, at a cost of $120,000 \nto fly this general. And the Air Force tried covering it up, and as far \nas I know they still have not explained it except to say that no \nregulations were broken.\n  Well, I might just say that one-way, first-class fare from Rome to \nColorado Springs is $1,617. But, no, General Ashy had to fly himself \nand his young female aide and his cat in a C-141 for $120,000, and they \nstill have not fessed up to it. And I will bet you General Ashy will \nnot even get his wrist slapped for wasting taxpayers' dollars like \nthat.\n  So there is a lot of waste in that Pentagon that we can clamp down \non, and I think if they have a hard freeze over 7 years, then maybe \nthey will start doing a little bit better accounting and they will \nstart knocking out these luxury flights for generals and their cats and \ntheir 21-year-old female aides.\n  The real story is here in the chart I have here as to why we do not \nneed to continue to increase Pentagon spending. This chart illustrates \nhow much the United States is spending this year on the military. It \nsays $260 billion. Actually, it is $261 billion. Our NATO and other \nallies will spend $250.9 billion. So [[Page S7200]] total U.S., NATO, \nand our allies spending, $510 billion this year, fiscal year 1995 on \ndefense.\n  Well, what is the rest of the world doing? How about our potential \nadversaries? Here is Russia, $12 billion this year.\n  In fact, last year the sum in Russia was $79 billion. This year, \nRussia cut military spending from $79 billion to $12 billion this year.\n  Mr. President, I will ask consent to have an article printed in the \nRecord about the Russian budget. The military defense officials in \nRussia have called it a disaster, but the Parliament did not listen to \nthem. They went ahead and cut it to $12 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                Russian MoD Labels Budget a Catastrophe\n\n                          (By Anton Zhigulsky)\n\n       Moscow.--Members of Russia's parliament, failing to heed \n     the military's call for increased funding, set defense \n     spending for 1995 at 46.5 trillion rubles ($12 billion).\n       Defense Ministry officials have lobbied the government \n     during the past several months for a budget more than twice \n     as large--up to 110 trillion rubles ($29 billion).\n       Defense Minister Pavel Grachev called the budget ``a total \n     catastrophe for the Army.'' The spending plan as passed put \n     the future of the armed forces ``under threat,'' he said \n     after the March 15 vote. ``It is a sin to keep an army in \n     poverty and half-starved.''\n       On March 15 parliament's lower house, the Duma, passed the \n     fourth and final draft of the government budget, which will \n     take effect April 1. That budget saddles Russia with a \n     deficit of about 73 trillion rubles ($18 billion), or 8 \n     percent of gross national product.\n       The argument over the Russian defense budget has been \n     particularly contentious, especially since the costly \n     invasion of the separatist region of Chechnya in December.\n       Grachev has argued that a defense spending level of 46 \n     trillion rubles will affect readiness, equipment maintenance \n     and troop morale, all of which have been in a downward spiral \n     since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n       In a front-page appeal to parliament in the Defense \n     Ministry daily Krasnaya Zvezda on March 10, the ministry \n     warned that ``parliament has one last chance to prove that \n     the armed forces is not a stepchild.''\n       In the past several weeks Krasnaya Zvezda has warned that a \n     demoralized armed forces, without the resources to train or \n     even house troops, may not be politically reliable if the \n     government is forced to quash a coup as it did in October \n     1993.\n       On March 15, Russian soldiers suffered an additional \n     setback when the Duma voted to spend 1 trillion rubles ($250 \n     million) to purchase weapons from the ailing defense \n     industry.\n       The money had been earmarked earlier for the Army's day-to-\n     day needs, such as housing and provisions, but deputies \n     decided to aid the cash-strapped defense factories instead.\n       Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov acknowledged that the \n     1995 military budget is ``tough and even cruel,'' but said \n     the state could provide no more.\n       ``There are matters of principle on which there can be no \n     concessions,'' he told the deputies.\n       Krasnaya Zvezda blasted the vote, stating the following day \n     that it would be easier to disband the Army completely than \n     to subject it to the budget.\n       ``This Duma has never understood the problems of the Army. \n     It is absolutely indifferent to the defense capacity of \n     Russia,'' the newspaper said.\n       The Russian Defense Ministry also is under fire for its \n     handling of the crisis in Chechnya, and President Boris \n     Yeltsin has promised to pursue long-overdue changes in the \n     Army, which suffered humiliating losses to partisan fighters \n     in Chechnya.\n       ``Chechnya has convinced us once again that we are too late \n     in conducting military reform. We must not delay any more. \n     The Army is starting to disintegrate,'' Yeltsin said Feb. 23.\n       But military officials, complaining of a lack of money, \n     said reform can be carried out only if it is properly funded. \n     ``Without funding, there will be no reform,'' Grachev said in \n     the parliament March 16.\n       According to Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst with the \n     daily newspaper Sevodnya, Russia's armed forces must be \n     reorganized quickly to avoid more combat deaths in the war-\n     torn northern Caucasus region and in Tadzhikistan, where \n     Russian soldiers are bolstering the government in a civil \n     war.\n       ``The situation in the Army is beginning to get out of \n     control. The new budget doesn't allow Russia to keep the Army \n     as it is. A combat-ready professional army will have to be \n     started urgently, within 12 to 18 months,'' Felgenhauer said.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a table that indicates what my amendment would do in terms of \nbudget authority and budget outlays.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      Fiscal year--                                                     \n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     1995          1996          1997          1998          1999         2000         2001         2002        Total   \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBudget authority:                                                                                                                                       \n    Committee..................         261.4         257.7         253.4         259.6        266.2        276.0        275.9        275.9       1864.6\n    Harkin.....................         261.4         257.7         253.4         259.6        261.4        266.0        265.9        265.9       1829.8\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Savings..................           0             0             0             0            4.8         10.0         10.0         10.0         34.8\n                                ========================================================================================================================\nBudget outlays:                                                                                                                                         \n    Committee..................         269.6         261.1         257.0         254.5        259.6        267.8        267.7        269.2       1836.9\n    Harkin.....................         269.6         261.1         257.0         254.5        258.6        264.4        261.1        263.0       1820.1\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Savings..................           0             0             0             0            1.0          3.4          6.2          6.2         16.8\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what this chart says is that the United \nStates and its allies are spending almost 10 times more than all of our \npotential adversaries put together. Here is Russia at $12 billion; \nChina, 27.4 billion; North Korea, $5.3 billion; Iraq, $2.6 billion; \nIran, $2.3 billion. Libya, Syria, and Cuba spend even less.\n  You total up all of our potential adversaries--and I put Russia in \nthere even though Russia is not a potential adversary at this time; and \nwe have diplomatic relations with China--you add them all up and it \ncomes to $54.37 billion. That is in the whole world what our \nadversaries are spending. We are spending $510 billion total; for the \nUnited States, $260 billion.\n  If you just look at the United States, we are spending almost five \ntimes more than all of our adversaries put together. And yet the budget \nbefore us says it is not enough. We are going to increase it in the \nnext 7 years, while we cut education, cut job training, cut Head Start, \ncut Pell grants. That simply defies common sense.\n  We had this other chart yesterday when we talked about education. \nLook at what is happening. Here is the line that shows the cost of \ngoing to State universities per year, rising by the year 2002 to about \n$8,000 a year. Here is line for Pell grants that student rely on, going \nfrom $2,590 down to $1,500, almost a 40 percent cut in Pell grants over \nthe same year--a 40 percent cut in Pell grants. That is what we are \nbeing asked to do. But, at the same time, we are being asked to \nincrease military spending.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining of his \ntime.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask to be notified when I have 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. President, I am sure you are going to hear from the opponents of \nthis modest amendment Senator Bumpers and I are offering the argument, \n``Well, if we freeze it, it is going to cut into readiness, our ability \nto respond.''\n  That is simply not true. This amendment would fully protect readiness \nand modernization. Believe me, there are places we can cut that have \nnothing to do with readiness or modernization. We can cut out some of \nthis high-flying stuff that General Ashy was doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article regarding General Ashy and his $120,000 flight last \nDecember.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 9, 1994]\n\nAir Fare, Rome to Colorado: $120,000; General's Costly Flight Runs Into \n                    Flak on Hill (But the Cat Paid)\n\n                          (By John F. Harris)\n\n       A commercial flight was leaving the next day, but that was \n     not soon enough for Air Force Gen. Joseph W. Ashy.\n       Instead, the new leader of the U.S. Space Command traveled \n     on an Air Force C-141 transport jet, which flew him, one aide \n     and the Ashy family cat from Italy to Colorado at an \n     estimated cost of at least $120,000.\n       Ashy's Sept. 9 flight on a 200-passenger plane specially \n     equipped with a luxury cabin and carrying a steward on its \n     crew of 13 was more convenient at the time, but it is causing \n     big trouble now.\n       After a complaint from Capitol Hill, Defense Department \n     Acting Inspector General Derek J. Vander Schaaf agreed this \n     week to investigate the propriety of the flight and whether \n     Air Force public affairs personnel were truthful in answering \n     reporters' inquiries.\n       Ashy, who followed Pentagon regulations by paying $85 fare \n     for the cat, declined to comment.\n       A spokesman at the Space Command in Colorado Springs, Lt. \n     Col. Dennis Gauci, said Ashy and his aide considered flying a \n     commercial flight out of Rome on Sept. 10, but worried the \n     schedule would not give him enough time in Colorado the next \n     day to take an eight-hour training course on procedures for \n     alerting the president in event of an air attack.\n       He was sworn in as head of the Space Command Sept. 13.\n       Ashy, 54, a 32-year Air Force veteran and fighter pilot, \n     could not leave earlier, the Air Force said, because he was \n     still commander of the 16th Air Force in Italy, a job that \n     included directing air missions over Bosnia.\n       Air Force officials in Washington acknowledge Ashy's flight \n     looks bad, but said no regulations were broken. Ashy, they \n     said, was on an especially tight schedule to get to his new \n     posting, and asked an aide to see if any government planes \n     were heading his way.\n       Subordinates went overboard in accommodating his request, \n     according to an Air Force official at the Pentagon familiar \n     with the case, and an empty C-141 was ordered across the \n     Atlantic and back again to ferry Ashy to his new home.\n       United Airlines is quoting a one-way, first-class fare from \n     Rome to Colorado Springs of $1,617.\n       The C-141, which costs about $3,400 an hour to operate, was \n     dispatched from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey to Italy \n     and on to Colorado.\n       Total flight time was 31 hours, Air Force officials said, \n     and two mid-air refuelings were required that added to the \n     cost.\n       The price tag gave Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) a case \n     of sticker shock, and he asked Vander Schaaf to investigate.\n       In a letter to the inspector general, Grassley said he \n     learned about the incident from Newsweek military affairs \n     columnist David Hackworth, a highly decorated retired Army \n     colonel who is planning a story about the flight in next \n     week's issue of the magazine.\n       Hackworth is ``disturbed by the arrogance that General \n     Ashy's behavior appears to represent,'' and believes ``Air \n     Force officials have `repeatedly lied' to him'' and an ABC \n     News producer who collaborated with him in investigating the \n     episode, Grassley wrote.\n       The inspector general's office will ``determine whether the \n     travel was proper and reasonable, and address a number of \n     related matters, the most important of which appears to be \n     whether Air Force personnel were truthful in answering press \n     inquiries about the flight,'' Vander Schaaf said in a \n     memorandum Tuesday to Defense Secretary William J. Perry.\n       Ashy had no idea until he got on the flight, according to \n     Gauci, that a C-141 had been dispatched especially for him.\n       When an aide contacted the Air Mobility Command to ask \n     about transport, Gauci said, Ashy assumed he would be on a \n     flight that was already traveling from Europe to the United \n     States.\n       ``General Ashy didn't specifically request that plane,'' \n     Gauci said, ``and he had no idea where that plane \n     originated.''\n       The spokesman said Ashy also did not know the C-141, \n     ordinarily used for carrying troops and equipment, would be \n     equipped with a special ``comfort pallet,'' which includes \n     such amenities as first-class seating, a kitchen and a \n     sleeping area.\n       The plane had recently been carrying U.S. Ambassador to the \n     United Nations Madeleine K. Albright on a flight to Russia, \n     the Air Force reported.\n       Ashy's flight might not have been publicized, except for a \n     coincidence before taking off in Naples. Two retired military \n     officers and their wives, who are allowed to travel on \n     military planes on a space-available basis, asked the crew if \n     they could tag along.\n       Even though the flight was flying nearly empty, Air Force \n     officials said the crew told them no, because they believed \n     Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado was not an allowed port \n     of entry into the United States for travelers not on Air \n     Force business. An Air Force official in Washington said the \n     crew was mistaken, and that accommodations for the foursome \n     could have been made.\n       Vowing revenge, the spurned retirees took their grievances \n     to Hackworth, who began investigating. ABC's ``20-20'' is \n     also planning a piece on the incident for tonight's \n     broadcast.\n       Air Force officials said the crew made other mistakes. The \n     manifest on the plane said Ashy's wife was with him on the \n     flight. In fact, the Air Force said, Ashy's wife was already \n     in Colorado, and the woman traveling with him was his 21-\n     year-old aide, Senior Airman Christa Hart.\n       ``Why did a young female enlisted aide . . . accompany \n     General Ashy on this flight?'' Grassley asked in his letter. \n     ``Why is Hart's name not listed on the flight manifest? Was \n     Hart performing normal official duties, or was there some \n     other reason for her presence?''\n       Hart was on the flight because she is joining Ashy in his \n     new assignment, an Air Force official said. She serves as a \n     valet to Ashy and performs some protocol functions.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We can cut that out. We can start having better \naccounting procedures. We can reduce the Milstar, for example, this \nrelic that is no longer needed. If we cancel that, we save $3 billion \nover 7 years.\n  Stopping production of the Trident D-5 missiles after 1996. After \n1996, we will have enough to equip all of our nuclear subs at START II \nlevels. So why buy more D-5's? This would save $3.7 billion over 7 \nyears. And we could, for example, reinstate the fees on commercial arms \nsales to pay the U.S. Government for R costs, that again gives us \nabout $500 million over this period of time.\n  So, Mr. President, there are a lot of things we can do. We do not \nhave to cut into readiness or modernization. I would not want to cut \ninto readiness or modernization. But there is a lot of waste and a lot \nof inefficiency in the Pentagon that can and should be eliminated.\n  Quite frankly, when you look at the defense budget, what it is now is \na jobs program. That is what we are spending money in the Pentagon for. \nIt is a jobs program. But I submit to you, Mr. President, there are \nmore effective and efficient ways to invest in jobs programs than \nthrowing it at the Pentagon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that he has 3 minutes \nremaining on his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes of my time.\n  First of all, let me say to every Senator around, the argument that \nthe U.S. Defense Department does not manage its business with \nperfection should come as no surprise. But should it surprise anyone \nthat the Department of Education does not manage its business very \nwell? Might that be a shock? I would assume there is as much waste and \ninefficiency in the Department of Education of the United States as \nthere is in the Defense Department.\n  Mr. President, I would say that HUD has more waste than the Defense \nDepartment.\n  To talk about the fact that the Defense Department has made some \nmistakes is no argument at all to take $40 billion out of defense now \non this budget resolution.\n  Actually, this amendment should be turned down. I am hoping it will \nbe turned down by a large number, by a large vote. But I think there \nare some who will say ``Well, let's just take it out of defense and put \nit on education.''\n  Well, Mr. President, fellow Americans, the argument can be made on \nevery single domestic need. Think of one: the National Institutes of \nHealth. We are not able to fund them fully. A tremendous program. Take \nit out of defense. Defense is getting too much.\n  We could have an array of amendments here and, by the time we were \nthrough, saying, pay for all these things we need, guess what would \nhappen, Mr. President? The United States of America would have no \nmilitary left.\n  Now it seems to me that everybody knows we have put defense on a \ndownward path over the last 8 years. This budget resolution still has \nto go to conference with the House. In this resolution, we have assumed \nthe President's numbers. I am the first one to suggest I have not been \nvery happy with the President's numbers. I did not vote on the last \namendment to add some $80 or $90 billion in budget authority to \ndefense. [[Page S7202]] \n  But I am here to say we ought to leave it alone. It is probably about \nas low as it ought to get.\n  That does not mean that every American program on the other domestic \nside, from health to education, is fully funded either. There are many \nwho would say defense is not fully funded either. The Chiefs of Staff \nof the United States military could tell us some things we ought to be \ndoing that we are not doing.\n  Mr. President, when we need the defense of the United States, when we \nneed those men and women, we are not going to be arguing about some \ngeneral using an airplane that he ought not use. We are going to say, \n``We hope they take care of that.''\n  But let us take care of the men and women and our needs. And we know \nwhat they are.\n  I only reserved 5 minutes on this amendment. I hope nobody assumes \nthat I do not think it is a serious amendment. I do. And I hope no one \ngets the idea that all we have to do the rest of this debate is to \nbring amendments down here and offer to take money out of defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself one additional minute.\n  After all, the point of it is that it is a big department of \nGovernment. It is the evidence of America's strength in the world. It \nought to be big. It ought to be powerful. It ought to be strong.\n  We have an all-volunteer Army. Nobody compares with that. When people \nsay we spend more than everyone, of course we do. We pay our men and \nwomen in the military. They are not drafted. They are paid good \nsalaries and have a good retirement because we decided that is how we \nwanted keep a strong military. This will begin the demise of the \nmilitary and everybody will think it is for a good purpose. It will \nactually have a very serious, bad effect on America's future.\n  I reserve whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves 1 minute and 17 seconds.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, to hear the comments by my friend from New \nMexico, you would think the amendment I am offering would totally gut \nthe Department of Defense.\n  As I pointed out, my amendment keeps the same spending for the \nDepartment of Defense as the Budget Committee does over the next 3 \nyears. That is my amendment. It continues the same spending. And then, \nfor the next 4 years, it provides for just slightly less growth than \nwhat the Budget Committee has, slightly less growth.\n  I am not cutting defense spending. I am just growing it a little bit \nless than what the Budget Committee does in the out years.\n  Well, for example, as I said, for the next 3 years, spending under my \namendment is the same as the Budget Committee. In 1999, the Budget \nCommittee would spend $266.2 billion. I spend $261.4 billion. Over the \ntotal of the 7 years we would spend $34.8 billion less, bringing the \nPentagon to a freeze level.\n  Do you know what the difference is, Mr. President? Do you know what \nthe difference between my amendment and the Budget Committee is? Two \npercent.\n  You mean to tell me that someone can stand here with a straight face \nand say, ``Over the next 7 years, the Department of Defense cannot \ncontribute 2 percent?'' What a joke.\n  Then we hear people in the military, military officers, saying, ``Oh, \nwe have to have more money.''\n  Here is what Defense Minister Pavel Grachev called the Russian \nbudget. He said it is ``a catastrophe for the Army.''\n  Of course, military people are going to say that.\n  But back to my chart, back to my chart, Mr. President. The United \nStates is spending $260 billion this year.\n  All of our adversaries combined only spend $54 billion--one-tenth of \nwhat we alone spend. Yes, we have to remain strong in the world. Yes, \nwe have to pay our military people. Yes, we have to keep a strong \npresence around the globe. But at what expense? By wastefully throwing \nthis kind of money at it?\n  I am sorry, it is simply ridiculous to think that our modest \namendment would even cause a disturbance for the Pentagon. It will not \nhurt readiness or modernization one iota. It will not cut one paycheck \nfrom the military. Two percent? We are cutting education. We are \ncutting everything a lot more than 2 percent. My amendment is just 2 \npercent less than the committee's level for defense, a freeze, and we \nare told the Pentagon cannot even do that to help balance the budget.\n  We are asking for sacrifice from our senior citizens, sacrifice from \nour students to make them pay more for their college loans, sacrifice \nfrom our poor to give up the earned-income tax credit, but we cannot \nask the Pentagon to live with a freeze at a time when our enemies are \nspending only one-fifth as much as us combined? Two percent less than \nthe recommended increase. It is not even a cut. And yet some argue we \ncannot even ask them to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will close by saying 2 percent is not too much to ask \nto help balance the budget of the future.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the world is not a utopia. There are dangers \nall over the world and there are growing questions as to whether we \nwill be able to meet these challenges in the future.\n  Must we repeat history and not be ready when the next major threat \noccurs? The readiness of our military is slipping. We are not procuring \nthe equipment we need to meet a growing and unpredictable threat. The \nmorale of the men and women who serve in uniform is declining.\n  Mr. President, we are not even providing sufficient ammunition for \nproper training. We have already cut defense spending by over 35 \npercent. Must we be doomed to repeat history--again?\n  We need to take a look at where we are, and what we have done to our \ndefense spending levels over the last 11 years. Since 1985:\n  Ship purchases are down 80 percent; aircraft purchases are down 86 \npercent; tank purchases have dropped to zero--a 100 percent reduction; \nand strategic missile purchases have dropped 95 percent.\n  In 1993, the President proposed a 5-year defense spending plan which \nadded $126.9 billion in cuts to defense spending--over and above the \nreductions previously made by President Bush. Now we need to \nunderstand, the cold war ended during the Bush Administration--and \nsignificant realignment of defense priorities occurred immediately \nfollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  Prior to 1993, defense spending was already cut--and cut deeply. \nBefore the Members vote on the amendment by the Senator from Iowa, it \nis important to know what was cut prior to 1993.\n  Military personnel were reduced by more than 350,000; overall defense \nspending declined by about 20 percent; our Navy dropped from 536 ships \nto 448 ships in the fleet; three aircraft carriers were eliminated from \nthe fleet; eight Fighter Wings were cut from the Air Force; we slashed \nour strategic bomber fleet to 181 planes; and we terminated dozens of \nweapon systems.\n  All of this was cut from our defense forces prior to 1993.\n  The budget request this year, cuts defense spending even further. The \nprocurement budget this year is at its lowest level in 50 years--and is \n$6 billion less this year, than last. Procurement spending under this \nbudget is only 39 percent of the total defense budget.\n  Now, I completely agree that we should only spend what is necessary \nfor our national security needs. The question raised by this amendment \nis: Do we need to spend more for defense--or less? In order to answer \nthis important question, you need to review the facts.\n  Fact No. 1: The Defense Planning Guidance calls for a Navy fleet of \n346 ships in order to meet our national security requirements.\n  But this budget does not provide funding sufficient to achieve and \nmaintain a fleet level of 346 ships. Only by not retiring older, less \ncapable ships are we able to even come close to the ship numbers we \nrequire.\n  Fact No. 2: The Defense Planning Guidance calls for 184 heavy bombers \nin order to meet our security requirements.\n  But this budget barely provides more than 55 percent of the required \nheavy bombers to meet our security requirements. The bomber plan is so \nbad, in fact, we will be forced--under this budget--to keep the B-52 in \nservice until the year 2030. In 2030, the B-52 will be over 60 years of \nage. [[Page S7203]] \n  Fact No. 3: Before the budget was submitted to the Congress, the \nSecretary of Defense, on November 15, 1994 reported that fully one-\nforth of our Army Divisions were far below peak preparedness.\n  But this budget does not aggressively increase funding to solve this \nproblem until the year 2000 and after.\n  This century, America has failed to be prepared to protect her \ninterests on three occasions. We failed to be ready in 1942 at Pearl \nHarbor, We failed to be prepared in Korea in the 1950's. Just over two \ndecades later, we failed to be prepared to deal with the military \nchallenges facing us in the deserts of Iran.\n  Failure to prepare leads to a certain outcome--preparation for \nfailure. Loss of military capability does not announce itself--except \nby failure.\n  No Member of this body can predict when or where America will next be \nchallenged. But just as the mighty Mississippi flows southward with \nlumbering power, on this you can be certain:\n  American will again be challenged.\n  America will again be forced to defend her interests.\n  The only question yet to be answered is--will we be ready to meet \nthese future challenges? If you believe American will not be challenged \nagain, you should vote for Senator Harkin's amendment.\n  If you believe however, that preparation is essential for victory and \nvigilance is our strength--then you should oppose this amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in 1996 dollars, the Department of \nDefense has been reduced from $402 to $246 billion. Now, is there \nanyone that would like the American military and American defense to be \nlike the Soviet Union? Of course they do not pay anything. They hardly \npay their military. Would we like to do that? Would we like to say we \ndo not need any new technology or innovation, or do we want to remain \nthe strongest Nation on Earth? We have cut defense enough. If there is \nmore money needed for education, we ought to take it out of some other \nprogram, not out of the Defense Department and the men and women who \nserve us there.\n  I believe my time has expired. If not, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico yields back the \nbalance of his time. All time has expired on this amendment.\n  Under the previous order, the amendment will be laid aside at this \nmoment.\n  Under the previous order, we will go to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. On the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nFeingold has 20 minutes and the Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes; \n10 minutes of the time of the Senator from New Mexico is granted to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1127\n\n        (Purpose: To strike provisions providing for a tax cut)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Senator Hollings, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Robb, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Simon, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Moseley-\n     Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 1127.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 74, strike beginning with line 8 through page 75, \n     line 22.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment, in addition to being \njointly offered by Senator Hollings and myself, is also cosponsored by \nSenator Byrd, Senator Nunn, Senator Bumpers, Senator Kerrey, of \nNebraska, Senator Robb, Senator Dorgan, Senator Simon, Senator Murray, \nand Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  Senator Hollings will speak in a moment or two about this, but let me \njust say, first of all, this is really the moment when the Members of \nthis body can convey to the American people whether they believe tax \ncuts are a priority or not. It is a clean vote.\n  We can ensure the focus of this budget resolution stays on deficit \nreduction and deficit reduction alone by adopting this amendment. Other \namendments before us that have been rejected have suggested we use the \n$170 billion tax cut fund for restoring Medicare cuts or education, \nearned-income tax credit. I think those were all worthy priority \nchoices. They are all more important than a tax cut at this point. Mr. \nPresident, none of those amendments were adopted, and we stand here \nwith there still being the $170 billion kitty, or cookie jar, existing \nin the budget resolution that came out of the Budget Committee.\n  My amendment simply strikes the section of the resolution which \nestablishes a special budget surplus account. The result will be that \nany additional savings that would have accrued to this account will \ninstead simply go toward the purpose of deficit reduction. By striking \nthe budget surplus allowance, any fiscal dividend that flowed to the \nFederal Treasury as a result of the deficit reduction contemplated in \nthe resolution would reduce the amount the Government would otherwise \nhave to borrow.\n  It would eliminate the indebtedness of this country to the tune of \n$170 billion. Eliminating this cookie jar also brings us that much \ncloser to really balancing the Federal budget without using Social \nSecurity, and this point has to be stressed and stressed again. It is \nmy understanding that even under this budget resolution, we will still \nbe using $113 billion of Social Security funds to balance our books in \nfiscal year 2002. Mr. President, this is not a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002 unless you raid the Social Security funds.\n  CBO estimates that in 2002, the so-called fiscal dividend might be \n$50 billion for that year by adopting this amendment. So instead of the \n$113 billion bite out of Social Security, we will reduce it by $50 \nbillion.\n  This tax cut that is hidden in the budget resolution is the loose \nthread that threatens to unravel the budget, the potential tax cut \nfunded from the so-called budget surplus allowance. This is the symbol \nof irresponsibility that remains in the budget resolution, and it is \nnot just a little bit of money. It is three times the total that \nPresident Clinton proposed in terms of tax cuts earlier this year. He \nproposed about $60 billion. This is almost three times greater than \nthat, Mr. President, and people did not think that was an insignificant \namount either. It is a giant tax cut.\n  At best, the budget that passes this body and finally the one that is \nagreed upon by both Houses will be unpopular. It cannot help but be \nunpopular. Some feel that adding a tax cut will sugar coat the medicine \nand make it politically a little bit less risky to balance the budget. \nBut it will not. In fact, it will do just the opposite. A tax cut will \nonly undercut any work that will be accomplished by Congress.\n  First, it will make those tough cuts we do make suspect. Those whom \nwe ask to sacrifice for the cause of deficit reduction will not be \npersuaded that their own sacrifice will not instead go to provide tax \ncuts to someone else, someone who may well be a lot wealthier than they \nare. The Senator from South Carolina and I think that is a formula for \ntrouble. We simply cannot pass what may be a $1 trillion package of \nspending cuts, including massive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and \neducation and other programs, and then ask the Nation to support that \npackage while promising tax cuts to everyone. It will not wash. Beyond \nthat, the potential in this budget resolution for a tax cut is just too \ngreat of a temptation.\n  What this $170 billion fund does, Mr. President, is essentially lay \nout a series of low-calorie menus for a dieter, asking them to eat only \ncelery, carrots, some cottage cheese, maybe a little water, but at the \nsame time we put right next to them a big piece of banana cream pie. \nThat is what this tax cut is. We are not going to put the Federal \nbudget deficit on a diet by providing for a tax cut. Nor will we assure \nthe Federal Reserve and the financial markets by claiming we can do \nboth. [[Page S7204]] \n  It is possible, the prospects of lower interest rates that might flow \nfrom really lowering the deficit will be lost, and if we do not act \nresponsibly in this matter some will reject the claims we can have it \nall. By every measure I know, the Nation has expressed an overwhelming \npreference for deficit reduction over a tax cut. The mail and phone \ncalls I have received from Wisconsin since November on this have been \nabsolutely clear, because the people of the United States know what is \nat stake. They know there is no free lunch here. We can reduce the \ndeficit and help ensure their children and grandchildren will have a \nGovernment that is financially sound or we can give a nice big tax \nbreak now and stick future generations with the tab. By significant \nmajorities, people want the former. They want us to start paying off \nthe bills that have been run up, and they want us to do it now. This is \nnot a partisan issue. For my own part, I have opposed the tax cut plans \nof both parties because I believe it is the fiscally responsible thing \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I hope that both sides come together in a bipartisan \nfashion. I have heard Members of both parties make absolutely \nunequivocal statements on the floor that they do not believe tax cuts \ncan be a priority at this time. This is an opportunity to come together \nand say we can have a balanced budget by the year 2002 but only if we \nresist the temptation to go forward with a tax cut we all would like to \nvote for but cannot afford.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, this is the same amendment that I presented in the \nBudget Committee which was defeated by a 12 to 10 vote. At the markup \nin the Budget Committee markup, Democrats were characterized as wanting \nto take the surplus, and spend it, whether for Medicare, education or \nwhatever; Republicans were criticized for taking the surplus to give \ntax cuts.\n  The truth of the matter is that there will be no $170 billion \nsurplus. But if part of it does materialize, it ought to go to reducing \nthe deficit. That was the amendment I offered in committee, and that is \nthe amendment that should today be adopted by the Senate if we are \nreally sincere. But rather than have any light shed on the subject, we \nhave been bombarded by irresponsible reporting on the budget in the \nlast several weeks. Specifically, I refer to Time magazine's cover \nwhich said, ``This time it's serious. Budget resolution . . . for the \nfirst time in decades, Congress is committed to balancing the budget.'' \nAbsolutely false. Turn to page 7 in the budget resolution itself. What \nword appears? ``Deficit'' by the year 2002. It does not appear \n``balanced.''\n  On page 7, line 21, for fiscal year 2002 a deficit of $113.500 \nbillion, or, more accurately, on page 9, you can see how much the debt \nactually increases by the year 2002 over just 1 year--2001. It is \n$177.7 billion. That is the real deficit. We are all rhetoric and no \nreality. Republicans are already giving themselves credit and claiming \nto have done a wonderful thing which to some on the other side \njustifies a tax cut. But Mr. President, the American people know what \nis going to happen. Under this proposal, the tax cuts in stone and the \nspending cuts are going to slip by the board.\n  Specifically, on this idea of committing to balancing the budget for \nthe first time in decades, I submitted when I was chairman of the \nBudget Committee--and again in 1985. Everyone remembers Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings. That was a balanced budget--not in 7 but in 5 years. In 1991, \nwe were treated to the budget summit. I remember at that time that \nmembers were slapping each other on the back and congratulating \nthemselves on really getting the budget under control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 1991 budget resolution deficit \nsurplus figures appearing on page 21 of the budget report be printed in \nthe Record at this particular time.\n  There being no objection, the figures were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    CONFERENCE AGREEMENT TOTAL BUDGET                   \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      1991       1992       1993       1994       1995  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBudget authority.    1,485.6    1,562.6    1,582.4    1,593.4    1,668.4\nOutlays..........    1,236.9    1,269.3    1,305.0    1,324.8    1,355.5\nRevenues.........    1,172.9    1,260.8    1,349.8    1,433.3    1,511.7\nDeficit (-) /                                                           \n surplus (+).....      -64.0       -8.5       44.8      108.5      158.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So, Mr. President, yes, they had a deficit for 1991 and \n1992. But at that time, their estimates projected a surplus in 1995 of \n$156.2 billion. The reality was much different. Instead of $156.2 \nbillion surplus, we have a $317 billion deficit--a swing of some $474 \nbillion off in the 3 or 4 years.\n  There is no education in the second kick of a mule. We have been \nthrough this gamesmanship. Let us cut out the nonsense and get serious \nhere and report accurately that we are not balancing the budget. You \ncannot do it without a balanced approach of spending cuts and tax \nincreases.\n  If there is any surplus, heavens above, let us allocate it to the \ndeficit, because by 2002, we will have a $6.6 trillion debt with \ninterest costs growing at the rate of almost $500 billion a year. That \nis, one-third of the budget is automatically going to interest costs, \njust the carrying charges, not to reduce the debt but just to open up \nthe doors early every morning up here in Washington in the Government.\n  So we cannot engage in this nonsense and gamesmanship. We have to get \nreal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Eight minutes remain of the Senator from Wisconsin's time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if a Senator on the other side wishes to \nspeak, we can go forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me commend my good friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, for offering this amendment. I certainly \nsupport the idea that we can do more in deficit reduction and that a \ntax cut is ill-advised. However, I must reluctantly oppose the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Budget Committee, I think we agree, has \nperformed a very remarkable job in putting this budget resolution \ntogether. Senator Domenici and the staff of the majority and the staff \nof the minority have worked in good faith, and I think they have \nfulfilled the commitment that everyone of us in this body has made when \nhe or she voted for the balanced budget amendment earlier this year.\n  We have demonstrated that we can balance the budget and put our \nNation's fiscal house on the road to solvency.\n  Now, in addition to the savings that will occur under this budget \nresolution, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that a \ncredible reduction in the deficit by the year 2002 would produce a \nfiscal dividend for the Federal treasury. We are all in agreement on \nthat. CBO estimates that interest rates would be 1 to 2 percent lower, \nand real GNP would be nearly 1 percent higher by the year 2002 if we \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  Now, because of these two factors, CBO estimates that we would reap a \nfiscal dividend of some $170 billion over a 7-year period, and as much \nas a $356 billion dividend over 10 years.\n  The issue that has divided many Members on both sides of the aisle, \nand is the subject of this debate, is what should we do with this \nfinancial windfall if indeed there is one? During the debate we have \nbeen confronted with two specific choices. One, using the dividend to \nincrease Federal spending, or, two, using the dividend to provide \n[[Page S7205]] tax cuts. So far, we have not been able to reach an \naccord on either proposal.\n  The amendment being offered by my friend from Wisconsin would use the \nfiscal dividend to further reduce the deficit and, as a consequence of \nthat--and this is the discomfort I have--it would absolutely preclude \nany possibility of a tax cut for this year.\n  I really believe that this is the wrong time for the Senate to \ncompletely close off the tax reduction option--I emphasize option--at \nthis time. Despite what many Members on the other side have said, this \nbudget resolution--and I emphasize this--does not mandate a tax cut. In \nfact, there is no specific tax cut in this plan. What this budget \nresolution says is that if all of the committees in Congress adopt \nreconciliation legislation that produces a balanced budget in the year \n2002 and if--I emphasize ``if''--that reconciliation legislation makes \nit through a conference committee--and that is a big ``if''--and then \nis signed into law by the President, then and only then may Congress \nconsider reducing taxes.\n  The CBO will have to certify that the reconciliation legislation \ndoes, in fact, produce a balanced budget. That is, CBO must certify \nthat the budget is balanced in the year 2002. CBO will have to provide \nan estimate of how much additional savings will be achieved through \nlower interest rates and increased economic growth. CBO may determine \nthat the savings are as projected, $170 billion; on the other hand, \nthey may be lower or higher.\n  Once CBO has provided that savings estimate, only then can Congress \nconsider cutting taxes. Obviously, we do not necessarily know what \ninterest rates might be.\n  In any event, in the Senate, the decision whether to cut taxes is \ngoing to be first made by one committee. That is the Finance Committee, \nand that is a committee that I serve on. As a consequence, in the \nFinance Committee, I intend to make every effort to convince my \ncolleagues on the committee that the CBO economic dividend should be \nused for further deficit reduction rather than tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment by my good friend from Wisconsin is \nadopted, and if we completely foreclose the future option of reducing \ntaxes, this Senator, the Senator from Alaska, is concerned that this \nbalanced budget resolution may not receive a sufficient number of votes \nto pass this body.\n  I believe it would be far worse for our Nation's economic health if \nwe fail at this effort to bring the deficit to zero than it would be if \nwe merely retained the longer-term option of reducing taxes. It is for \nthat reason, Mr. President, that I must reluctantly oppose the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator retains 3 minutes 35 seconds of \nhis time; Senator Domenici of New Mexico has 10 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the other side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 8 minutes 1 \nsecond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself about 3 or 4 minutes and \nthen will have to absent myself from the floor, and I will be back. \nPerhaps the other side can use part of their time.\n  Mr. President, the budget that we crafted that is currently before \nthe U.S. Senate, I believe, is a fair way to handle the American people \nand to say to them, ``Once you get a balanced budget, for all the \nsacrifice that goes into that, there is some positive to come out of \nit.''\n  We all understand that when we get a balanced budget and we no longer \nare borrowing money, when those out there that set interest rates based \nupon money supply see that America is for real, interest rates come \ndown. There is no question.\n  Americans should not think we are going through this event in our \nhistory, one of the most significant in modern times, of putting our \nfiscal house in order, deciding that we finally want to pay our bills \nourselves as adults instead of having our children and grandchildren \npay them--there ought to be a bonus for that. We ought to get something \nout of that.\n  Incidentally, in this case, the major economists that look at fiscal \npolicy of this Nation--perhaps they are just startled by the fact that \nwe are finally going to live within our means and be rational and talk \nabout what we can afford and what we cannot afford--they say there will \nbe an economic bonus, an economic dividend. There will be a change \nsufficiently large in interest rates that when we get to balance, we \nget an economic dividend of somewhere between $150 to $200 billion if \nit is done in the manner prescribed in this budget resolution.\n  So what did we say? We said simply, we are not going to have tax cuts \nuntil the event is completed--the balancing of the budget. So we say, \nwhen all of these laws are changed by the Congress, that is finished, \nthen we can ask the CBO, the real number estimators for our land, are \nwe there? Have we reached that point, that event? Is it real? When they \nsay, ``Yes,'' they will then say there is an economic dividend. We will \nsay then and only then is that released to the Finance Committee of our \nU.S. Senate to be used for tax cuts.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are many people in this body and many \nAmerican people who think we ought to have a tax cut for the American \npeople. Especially one that focuses in on the American family.\n  Frankly, I agree with that. I said my first priority as the chairman \nof the Budget Committee would be to get a balanced budget. I believe we \ngot one. I believe that this is historic, and if carried out, the \neconomy will get better, interest rates will come down, and I believe \nwe have a brighter future if we stay there for about 10 years, in \nbalance, paying bills, reducing the debt, instead of borrowing more and \nmore every year.\n  Now, I think the Senator from New Mexico thinks at that point in time \nwhen we finish that work, we ought to give the American people at least \nan opportunity to get a tax cut, to get some relief, especially for \nfamilies. That is what this budget resolution does.\n  Now, frankly, there are some who would like to spend that dividend. \nWe have heard from them. I do not know that there will be any more \nopportunities on the Senate floor to spend that dividend again or to \nuse it differently. We have been through that.\n  Now we have reached the point in time where those who are not for \nthis budget resolution--and I assume the Senator who offers this \namendment is not for this budget resolution. Perhaps that is a false \nassumption. If it is, he might tell the American people he will vote \nfor this budget resolution. That would be interesting. I surmise he \nwill not say that. If he does, I would say, ``Wonderful.''\n  From that side of the aisle there will be a huge number of votes \nsaying after we get there, we want to say what to do with it, and we do \nnot want to give the American people a tax cut even after the balanced \nbudget when the economic dividend is available and we are still in \nbalance.\n  I do not believe that amendment ought to pass. I do not believe the \nmotion to strike that part of the budget should pass. That is why I am \nspeaking tonight. I have spoken enough, perhaps, today and I am not \nsure I will speak much more. Maybe another 3 or 4 minutes before this \namendment is finished.\n  Essentially, while I compliment the Senator who offered the \namendment, he obviously is really interested in fiscal prudence, in \nmaking sure that we use common sense, as he says. I believe the common \nsense was all exercised before he ever got to the floor, before this \namendment ever arrived, when Republican Senators decided to balance the \nbudget. We hope when we are finished that some Democrat Senators will \njoin Republicans.\n  That event was completed. Now we come to the floor and say, ``No \ndividends to America. Just strike it out of this budget resolution.''\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator has a little over 7 \nminutes remaining on his time. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin. [[Page S7206]] \n  While the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is still on the \nfloor, let me tell him I fall into the latter category of one who is \nthinking if we do not do any more damage, that I may be one, and there \nare several on this side of the aisle, I might inform the Senator, who \nare thinking about voting for the budget that emerges --not because we \nthink it is the perfect vehicle.\n  Indeed, tomorrow, some Members will have an alternative, hopefully, \nto that particular vehicle.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from New Mexico. I have known him \nfor about 15 years. I have respected his willingness to make tough, \nprincipled decisions in attempting to bring some sense of fiscal \nresponsibility to an otherwise undisciplined Federal Government over a \nlong period of time.\n I said on this floor the other day, that I thought he deserved \nenormous credit for giving us a target, something that was truly \nimportant.\n\n  I support the amendment of my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin, because I believe we ought to make it clear that deficit \nreduction is the most important objective we are attempting to achieve \nat this particular time. We are not truly balancing the budget even if \nwe stick to the numbers we are dealing with, because we continue to \nmask the total budget in the Social Security surplus. It will be about \n$113 billion out of true balance, but it is exactly the same kind of \nobfuscation we have been using for years and I am certainly willing to \ngive all the credit that is due for moving in that direction. But in \nthis particular case, if we are serious about deficit reduction, I \nthink the only message we can leave at this point is we are prepared to \nmake some tough choices.\n  Several on this side are willing to make those tough choices with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. One of the most difficult \nvotes for me was one just two votes ago when I had to vote ultimately \nagainst a very substantial increase in defense spending. Not because I \ndo not think we need it, because if we are serious about fighting two \nmajor regional conflicts and winning in the years ahead we are going to \nhave to put more money into the defense budget, even more than the \nPresident has added back right now. I accept that responsibility and \nwill continue to work on it. But I thought it was a discordant message \nwith respect to deficit reduction.\n  That is why I am prepared, with several colleagues, I believe, to \nsupport the ultimate product of this debate. I hope we will find ways \nto amend that particular end product so we can have something that has \nthe kind of balance that many of us want to achieve. But I think the \nmost important thing we can do is keep our eye ultimately fixed on the \ntarget, which is to bring it into what is balance using the $113 \nbillion that will be available from the Social Security surplus.\n  With that I yield whatever time I have remaining and I thank the \nSenator from Wisconsin for offering this particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. First of all let me thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis tremendous support on this issue all along.\n  Now I would like to yield to the Senator from Illinois, who has also \nbeen as solid as can be in trying to impose these tax cuts.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Feingold who, \nfrom day one, when both parties were talking about tax cuts, said, \n``This does not make sense. Our priority has to be to get this budget \nbalanced.''\n  As I have said half a dozen times on the floor, and I said it in the \nBudget Committee, I commend Senator Domenici for moving toward a \nbalanced budget. I disagree with how we get there. But the question is \nright now on a tax cut. The next best thing to passing this amendment \nis to do what Senator Murkowski said on the floor just a few minutes \nago. He said, as a member of the Finance Committee he is not going to \nvote for a tax cut. And I commend him for that statement.\n  When my friend from New Mexico says there ought to be a bonus, we \nought to get something out of it, I think the bonus is to have this \nbudget in balance to get our fiscal house in order. When he says we \nought to get something out of it--I know he has more children, and more \ngrandchildren I believe, than I do. If my three grandchildren can have \na better future, that is what we ought to be interested in. I think, \nfrankly, passage of the Feingold amendment moves us in that direction.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico well enough to know he will not be \nheartbroken if the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin is agreed \nto. I hope it will be agreed to. I am certainly going to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I just take 30 seconds and say to \nmy good friend, Senator Simon, I think you know a lot. But you do not \nknow whether I will be heartbroken or not. That is pure speculation. I \nspoke rather vigorously against it. All my instincts and all my \nabilities are to speak against it. I have done the very best I can.\n  You draw your conclusion. I draw my own.\n  Mr. SIMON. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, who has also been extremely helpful on this issue.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding for 1 minute. \nI find myself very much in the position just articulated by my friend \nand colleague from the State of Virginia. We have to make hard choices \nhere. I felt about that amendment that he referenced about like he did. \nBut if we are going to make the hard choices then I think we should \nmake them. Therefore I endorse thoroughly the amendment offered by my \nfriend from Wisconsin and my friend from South Carolina.\n  Certainly, in times like these, when we are talking about the concern \nfor the defense needs and all the other needs we have been talking \nabout all during this debate, it seems to me we have no way or reason \nto be talking about a tax cut. If there is any money left over after \ndoing what we think is obviously necessary for national defense and \nthese other programs we would be talking about, then that is where the \nmoney should be spent. If not there, to reduce the deficit.\n  I hope the Senator accepts the amendment that is being offered and \ndebated at this moment.\n  I yield any remaining time I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the ranking member and ask how much time we \nhave left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 10 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me use the last brief period of time \nto say in response to the Senator from New Mexico that one thing has \nbeen accomplished even if we do not win on this vote. That is, the \nearly effort to pretend there was not a tax cut in the Senate budget \nresolution is over. They are admitting it now, that there is this fund \nand they are not willing to eliminate it. That is progress. Because \nthat was the first attempt.\n  Why are we not able to support the resolution in this form? It is \nbecause the proposal of the Senator from New Mexico is out of balance \nin the year 2002 because of this very problem of this $170 billion. In \nfact, what it is, is what is left of the crown jewel of the Republican \ncontract. It is basically lying on the floor now after the vote earlier \ntoday; 69 to 31 the U.S. Senate rejected the Gramm amendment which was \nthe crown jewel of the Republican contract. This is all that is left of \nit.\n  This amendment is an opportunity to say what all the American people \nreally know, which is we cannot afford this. As the Senator from \nNebraska said, we are either going to do deficit reduction or we are \nnot. This amendment is the one that allows both parties to come \ntogether and strike the iron while it is hot.\n  I hope the Senator from Alaska is right and we get it done in the \nFinance Committee but we should do it now on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado controls 6 minutes \nand 36 seconds.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am an admirer of the Senator from \nWisconsin. [[Page S7207]] He has, I think, forthrightly brought forth \nbefore the Senate a number of proposals that are meant to save money. \nSo I rise out of concern over his amendment, not over concern over the \nSenator himself but concern over the implication. Let me simply go \ndirectly to the point.\n  He made what I thought was a very interesting analogy. He talked \nabout this amendment as a proposal to go on a diet, to eat carrots and \ncelery and other such things. But then to put at the end of the diet a \nlarge piece of pie.\n  I do not think that is an appropriate analogy. Let me tell you why. \nWhat this budget resolution is is a diet. I think the Senator from \nWisconsin is right about that. There is no question the Federal budget \nis overweight and this is a diet. This is carrots and celery. As a \nmatter of fact, I think it is so good there might be some lean beef in \nhere, too, all of which is very helpful to lose weight. But the \npotential at the end of the rainbow here is not a piece of pie. What it \nis, is the question of whether or not, when you have gone on the diet, \nyou can have your suit altered. What it is is a question of whether or \nnot you can put a swimming suit on.\n  If the Senator from Wisconsin wins, what he is going to say is you \ncan go on your diet, which is the first time you have done it in many, \nmany years. You can lose the weight, you can eat that celery, you can \neat those carrots. But at the end of the period we are not going to let \nyou take your suit off. You are going to have to walk around in the \nsame baggy suit. There is no reward.\n  You can do your job. You can make the tough decisions. But, by golly, \nyou cannot put on a swimming suit and let other people see how trim and \nattractive you are. Believe me, America is trim and attractive, if ever \nit gets its budget in balance.\n  Now, that is what the issue is. It is not a piece of pie. It is \nwhether or not you can enjoy the fruits of your efforts.\n  Mr. President, we have had lots of inflated rhetoric about budgets. \nEveryone knows it. Everyone knows every time we promise to get the \nbudget in line, it has not worked. And the reason it has not worked is \nbecause this Congress continuously overspends its own budget. So we \nneed some help. There is no question about it. And is the promise that \nif we mind our P's and Q's, if we eat our carrots and celery, that we \nwill get some reward at the end, some help? I think so. We need some \nhelp. I do not think anybody can seriously suggest that this Congress \ndoes not need help in sticking with its budget resolution.\n  Now, there is a unique aspect of this. This budget resolution does \nnot commit to a tax cut. What it says is if you pass the budget \nresolution, if it all scores out and if you come back and fully \nreconcile it and fully pass that reconciliation--and I think everybody \nknows that is going to be tough and is perhaps unlikely--and if you \nreconcile in a way that the President signs--and that is an even more \ndifficult question because the President has not been enthusiastic \nabout signing things that cut spending--if you get all that, then you \nmay be able to talk about this.\n  So what we are talking about is a little incentive for a Congress \nthat I believe is desperately in need of some incentive, is desperately \nin need. What happens here is if you eliminate any incentive and you \nhave a Congress that goes back to its old ways of overspending its own \nbudget, you make it much less likely that we will ever get to the \npromised land, that we will ever keep on our diet.\n  Mr. President, what is the impact of going to someone who is on a \ndiet and saying if you make the diet, there is going to be no reward at \nthe end? Well, it is pretty clear. You diminish the incentive to get it \ndone.\n  It is my judgment, Mr. President, and I think one of the American \npeople, that we ought to be talking about more incentives to get this \nCongress to stay on its diet, not less. I hope the Members will reject \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Maine wishes to speak on \nthis subject. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes off the \nresolution to the Senator from Georgia on the subject at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold amendment of which I \nam a coauthor, to apply the $170 billion fiscal dividend to deficit \nreduction. The $170 billion set aside in this resolution for a later \npossible tax cut is certainly more responsible than the House approach \nbeginning with a $1.2 trillion deficit exercise by cutting taxes. The \nHouse approach to me is like going on the wagon and beginning with \nchugalugging a bottle of whiskey. To me that is the analogy.\n  The Senate approach is to set the money aside until after a \nreconciliation bill is enacted and then making it available for a tax \ncut at the discretion of the Budget and Finance Committees and, of \ncourse, Congress' later approval.\n  Mr. President, I believe this fiscal dividend brought about by lower \ninterest rates and higher economic growth will exist if we balance the \nbudget by 2002. I do not think it is funny money, but I think it is \nvery fragile. If we touch it by using it either for increased spending \nor tax cuts, I am afraid it may break. There is a strong probability \nthat the spending slowdown in Medicaid, Medicare, education, \nagriculture, and other areas will generate more and more opposition \nfrom substantial segments of America before the cuts are passed by the \nCongress and certainly before they are fully implemented over a period \nof years.\n  There is also a probability that in cutting projected spending by \nover $1 trillion in a 7-year period Congress will inadvertently make \nsome serious errors which cause extreme hardship and which will have to \nbe corrected.\n  Mr. President, if my choice is to use the dividend, the $170 billion, \nfor tax cuts or for easing the most severe impacts on Medicare, \neducation and low-income working Americans, I believe the priority \nshould be on easing the impact, and my votes reflect this.\n  However, those are not the only two choices. In effect, until this \namendment is voted on, we will have been choosing between either \nspending the $170 billion or refunding it. In either case, we will be \nspending and refunding before we have earned the dividend, in my view. \nIf I have a choice, as we do on this amendment, however, of using the \n$170 billion, which has not yet been earned because we passed no \nreconciliation bill--and even when we pass one, we all know, looking at \ncatastrophic insurance and others, when the public rises up in arms \nover some action by the Congress, it does not take us long to step \nback, and that may happen. I hope it does not, but it may happen in \nsome of these cuts. I think the Feingold amendment is the responsible \nway to go because we will be putting this $170 billion on the deficit \nfrom the very beginning, and it will in effect be a contingency fund so \nthat if we have to back up or some of the cuts do not work out as \nprojected, we can still work on the goal in the year designated.\n  If this amendment passes, there will be a small cushion, a small \nmargin for error in economic assumptions or other assumptions in this \nplan to achieve a balanced budget by 2002.\n  I would also remind all of my colleagues who believe, as I do, that \nwe should be balancing the budget without using the Social Security \nsurplus, leaving the fiscal dividend alone and applying it to deficit \nreduction, as we will do if this amendment passes, would help us move \ntoward the goal of a real balanced budget in the operating accounts \nrather than simply a unified balance which we all know simply postpones \nthe day of pain when the general fund has to start reimbursing the \nSocial Security fund for the billions and billions of dollars owed. In \nfact, it will be trillions by the 2010-2013 range.\n  Mr. President, I understand the analogy my friend from Colorado used \nabout going on a diet and eating celery and carrots and getting thin. \nBut I would remind my colleagues that when we get to 2002, if \neverything works out in this budget as planned, we will still have to \nborrow the Social Security [[Page S7208]] trust fund of $107 billion. \nAnd if we keep adding to the deficit, we will, under this resolution, \nat the time we get to 2002, instead of being slim and trim in a \nswimsuit, we are going to still owe to the people holding bonds and \nnotes and Treasury bills all over this country something to the tune of \nabout $6 trillion to $7 trillion. I believe the number is now about \n$4.9 trillion that is the national debt.\n  So we will not be slim and trim. We will be bulging over our bathing \nsuits, but we will simply stop in that year adding to the fat and the \nbulge. So I am not sure we are going to all want to put on our bathing \nsuits in 2002 and show the bulges that have been building up for the \nlast 40 years. Nevertheless, that would be a rather optimistic view.\n  While the exact estimate would depend on what savings and enforcement \nprovisions were enacted in the reconciliation bill, CBO's previous \nestimate of the fiscal dividend was about $350 billion in 2002. If we \napplied that to the deficit reduction, we could cut the real deficit, \nexcluding Social Security, in half from about $100 billion to $50 \nbillion in that year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 5 minutes yielded to \nhim.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield me 1 more minute? I think I can \ncomplete in 1 more minute.\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator could complete in 1 minute. We are in a real \ncrunch tomorrow for time, much more than most people realize.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will complete in 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. One more minute.\n  Mr. NUNN. Thirty seconds.\n  We all know that someone has to face up to the Social Security \nproblem. We all know the Social Security system is not going to be the \nsame for those in their 20's, 30's, and 40's today. It cannot be. And \nthe longer we avoid facing up to that problem, the worse the problem is \ngoing to be. Balancing the budget without the continued use of the \nSocial Security surplus to finance other Government spending is an \nabsolute necessary first step in that effort. I urge my colleagues to \nstrike the reserve fund in this resolution and thereby apply these \nfunds to the deficit. We must focus all of our efforts on creating a \nfiscal dividend before we refund it or consume it.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska. I thank my colleagues.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1128\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for mandatory spending in Function 500)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have an amendment to offer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while that amendment is en route, might \nI ask, did I yield back the remainder of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That time was yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Cohen, \n     Mr. Lott, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Simpson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1128.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I think that there is no question that \neducation is one of the highest priorities that we can give in this \nbudget resolution, and certainly we should do everything that we can to \nensure that it receives our greatest attention.\n  So I am very pleased to be able to offer an amendment in conjunction \nwith many of my colleagues--Senator Abraham, Senator Grassley, Senator \nCohen, Senator Brown, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Lott, Senator Chafee, \nand Senator Simpson--to restore $6.3 [[Page S7209]] billion in the \neducation account. While education will play a key part in the future \nof America's children, let us not also forget the goal of this entire \nprocess of this budget resolution and the debate we are engaged in to \nbalance the budget by the year 2000 is the greatest gift we could \npossibly bequeath to future generations of Americans.\n  I know there have been various efforts to restore funding towards \neducation, but the amendments that have been offered have certainly \ncontained fundamentally flawed funding mechanisms. There has been much \ntalk and discussion here in the Senate about the dividend that the \nCongressional Budget Office may provide to score the budget if we put \nin place a balanced budget by the year 2002, and that we may achieve a \nsavings of up to $170 billion.\n  But that may or may not materialize at the end of 7 years and, \nobviously, as each year goes by, it will be determined whether or not \nthe targets have been met under this balanced budget resolution that \nhopefully will be enacted into law, as well as reconciliation.\n  But I do not think that on an issue as important as education that we \ncan premise the restoration of funding through an illusory estimate \nthat, as I said, may or may not be there at the end of this budgetary \nprocess.\n  But furthermore, the purpose of the budget resolution is to provide \ninstructions to the Appropriate Committees, both the authorizations as \nwell as the Appropriations Committees, as to what funding levels they \ncan rely upon in which to conduct their work.\n  So they need to know what the bottom line is, and that is what the \nbudget resolution is all about, to tell them how much they can spend \nand they, accordingly, make the determinations as to how they will \nproceed within the aggregate numbers that have been provided to them in \nthe respective functions within the Federal budget.\n  I think we are playing a dangerous numbers game if we think we are \ngoing to just restore funding based on this dividend that, again, may \nnot materialize. I do not think that we can be fiscally presumptuous in \nbasing these numbers on such a funding mechanism. I think that we have \nthe obligation to provide reliable, straightforward, factual estimates \nand data to the appropriations committees and the other committees \nwhich will be engaged in the work in trying to determine how they reach \nthese funding levels that will be contained in this budget resolution.\n  But the amendment that I am offering today with my colleagues, as I \nsaid earlier, takes a fiscally responsible approach but, at the same \ntime, helps to address the educational needs of the next generation.\n  Mr. President, we restore $6.3 billion in additional funding, but at \nthe same time we provide for specific offsets. Now, of course, the \nappropriate committees may not follow those recommendations. They have \nthe option of pursuing other categories for specific reductions in \nspending. But we have provided the offsets by reductions in funding for \nthe intelligent vehicle program, NASA R for commercial aircraft, new \nFederal building construction, reducing the executive branch air \ncarrier fleet from 1,500 planes to 1,350 planes and capping employee \nbonuses, Federal employee bonuses at $100 million from the present $300 \nmillion.\n  We think that there are certain priorities that we should target in \nany budget resolution and throughout the budgetary process of this \nyear, one of which certainly should be to help provide very critical \nand important assistance to low- and middle-income families who depend \nupon Federal assistance to provide the educational assistance for their \nchildren.\n  Our amendment ensures adequate funding to protect several very \nimportant policies regarding student financial aid. What we want to do \nand accomplish as a result of this amendment is to ensure that the \nLabor and Education Committee is enforced to make changes in the \nstudent loan programs that affect home and farm equity, in the \ndetermination of eligibility for student loans, increasing the student \nloan origination fee or eliminating the grace period for beginning \npayments upon graduation.\n  Our aim and goal is to ensure that there are sufficient funds within \nthis account to preclude the Labor and Education Committee from taking \nthese steps, and our amendment is intended to provide enough money to \nprotect those policies.\n  The impact of including home and farm equity in the calculations of \neligibility for Federal assistance would be enormous on so many \nfamilies all across this country. All we need to do is to examine the \nsituation which occurred prior to the enactment and the reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Act of 1992, when home and farm equity was \nconsidered in determining income eligibility for student assistance.\n  The inclusion of the value of family home or farm in the need \ncalculation meant that many hard-working middle-income families were \nnot able to qualify for student aid. These hard-working families, for \nwhom their home or farm was their only real asset, were punished by \nbeing shut out of Federal student aid programs.\n  So in 1992, Congress recognized what a serious problem this had \nbecome for many families in America. So, consequently, the 1992 higher \neducation amendments exempted a family's farm or principal resident \nfrom the student aid program in the calculations of their need. This \nmade it possible for low- to middle-income families to receive help \nfrom the Federal Government to send their children to college, rather \nthan requiring them to try to mortgage their home or farms in order to \npay for their education.\n  We want to make sure that Congress does not change the present law, \nwhich has made college more affordable for thousands of low- and \nmiddle-income families, and that is why we worked so hard to provide \nreasonable offsets which will hopefully guarantee the continuation of \npresent law which eliminates consideration of the home and the farm \nfrom the needs analysis for student aid programs. We think that these \noffsets are a fair trade.\n  As I said earlier, the committees may determine that they can use \nother offsets, and that is certainly within our purview and the \nprerogatives of the committee.\n  Our amendment is intended to ensure that those individuals and \nfamilies living off limited incomes will continue to have access to \nFederal student aid to send their children to college. The fact is that \nfarms and homes should not be included in the calculation of a \nstudent's eligibility for student grant or loan assistance because \nthose assets are not liquid and cannot be easily converted to cash for \nstudents to use toward their college education.\n  The second aspect of our amendment is student loan original fees \nwhich, I think, is also a critically important issue in terms of costs \nregarding education. OBRA 1993 reduced the original fee for both \nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans from 5 percent to 3 percent. We \nbelieve that that is an important change and would like to see the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee maintain this policy. Increasing \nthe loan origination fee increases the principal amount that borrowers \nmust repay to the Federal Government and the amount of interest the \nstudent must pay.\n  Our amendment would provide enough money to hopefully protect the \npresent origination fee formula. Finally, our amendment would also \nensure there is an adequate grace period for those students after they \ngraduate from college. We know that certainly in these difficult \neconomic times, students upon graduation do not easily find employment, \nand the current grace period is up to 6 months.\n  We think it makes sense for us to continue to provide a grace period \nbecause students do not often find gainful employment immediately, and \nwe do not want to force them into a situation where they end up \ndefaulting on their student loan almost immediately upon graduation. So \nthis grace period gives them a chance not only to find employment but \nalso to begin planning so that they can eventually make the payments on \ntheir monthly loans.\n  As we know from the cost of college education and postsecondary \neducation, it has become a very, very expensive proposition for the \nstudents, as well as their families.\n  We are offering this amendment because we recognize that productivity \nand the performance of our economy is [[Page S7210]] intertwined with \nthe investments that we make as a Nation in education.\n  The structural changes in the American economy, the revolution \ntechnology, have made it necessary for students to attain training \nbeyond high school for the work force of the future.\n  While nearly 40 percent of today's jobs are in low-skill occupations, \nonly 27 percent will fall into that category by the year 2000. At the \nsame time, jobs in high-skill occupations will rise from 24 percent to \n41 percent of the work force.\n  Looking at the new jobs that are being created, and will be created \nin this decade, more than half of the new jobs created presently \nbetween now as well as the year 2000, will require education beyond \nhigh school.\n  In fact, the median year of education required by the new jobs is \n13.5. This is a year and a half beyond high school. Therefore, every \nworker is going to have to recognize that they will require not only \nhigh school education but certainly a postsecondary education of some \nkind, whether it is a 4-year college degree or technical education. \nWhatever it will be, it will require not only postsecondary education \nbut schooling beyond that, as well.\n  Men and women who continue their education beyond high school, as we \nhave seen in study after study, have consistently earned more money on \naverage each year than those who do not.\n  In 1990, for example, the average income for high school graduates \nwas almost $18,000. For those who had 1 to 3 years of a college \neducation, earned on the average $24,000. Those who graduated from \ncollege and received a college diploma received on average salary of \n$31,000. These statistics are from the Census Bureau.\n  The entire country benefits, as well. For every $1 we invest in \neducation we get enormous returns as a result. Back in 1990, another \nstudy was conducted that analyzed the school assistance that was \nprovided to high school students back in 1972. For every $1 that the \nFederal Government invested in the student loan programs at that time, \nthe Government received $4.3 in return in tax revenues.\n  According to a study by the Brookings Institute, over the last 60 \nyears, education and advancements in knowledge have accounted for 37 \npercent of our Nation's economic growth.\n  At a time in which education is becoming paramount in this global \narena, where it is going to make the difference for an individual and \nthe kind of living that can be enjoying for themselves and their \nfamilies, education puts them on the cutting edge. It puts our Nation \non the threshold of competition for the future.\n  If we deny individuals the opportunity to receive an education \nbecause they lack the financial assistance or the access to financial \nassistance, clearly, we as a Nation, are going to suffer.\n  Costs of education have increased significantly, two to three times \nfaster than the growth of median incomes. Without student aid, \nincreasing costs make higher education out of reach for millions of \nAmericans.\n  At a time when college costs are increasing dramatically, in fact, \nsince 1988 college costs have risen by 54 percent. We know salaries and \nincome for families have not increased 54 percent.\n  We have to make sure that we carefully retain policies that will make \nhigher education accessible to millions of low- and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  I also would like to read part of a letter from the American Council \nof Education which supports this amendment, saying ``It will help \nmillions of low- and moderate-income students fulfill their goal of a \ncollege education. Passage of your amendment is essential if the \nfundamental promise of the Federal student loan program is to remain \navailable to future generations of college students. We are grateful to \nyou for offering it, and we urge all Members to vote in favor of it.''\n  I know this amendment will make a significant contribution to \nstudents pursuing a higher education. I am pleased to be joined by \nseveral of my colleagues who have cosponsored this legislation.\n  I would now like to yield to the Chair of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee who is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Maine \nyielding. I am very pleased to offer my support to the amendment that \nhas been offered by Senator Snowe and Senator Abraham.\n  As Senator Snowe has pointed out, this amendment would soften the \nimpact of the budget resolution on Federal student loan programs by \nreducing the reconciliation instruction to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources by $6.3 billion over 7 years.\n  At the same time, it maintains the objective of the resolution to \nachieve a balanced budget by the year 2002 by making offsetting \nreductions in other budget functions.\n  During the course of the debate on this budget resolution, I have \nlistened to my colleagues speak about the significance of restoring \nsound fiscal policy. Many have spoken to the fact that the true \nbeneficiaries of this effort will be future generations--our children. \nI strongly agree.\n  I was privileged, and it was certainly a lesson in learning about the \nworks of the budget and the Senate and the operations of Government, to \nserve on the Budget Committee for a number of years. I would like to at \nthis time, Mr. President, particularly commend Senator Domenici, as \nchairman of the Budget Committee, who has for years, labored in the \nvineyards of budgetary policy and has put forward for the Senate, at \nthis time, I think, an extraordinary budget. All who served on the \nBudget Committee should be commended because it is not an easy task.\n  This amendment that is being put forward by Senator Snowe and Senator \nAbraham does not compromise the resolve to put our fiscal house in \norder. Nor does it impair the budget resolution. What it does is revise \nand realign our priorities just slightly in the context of the entire \nbudget, but significantly in our ability to fulfill what I think most \nagree is an appropriate and valuable role for the Federal Government.\n  I recognize that as chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee I might be accused of having adopted a ``not in my backyard'' \nattitude toward the budget resolution. Let me assure my colleagues that \nthis is not the case.\n  The committee will do its fair share toward reducing the size and \nscope and expense of Government. In fact, we started early making a 25-\npercent reduction in the committee's own budget, which was the largest \ncut in any of the Senate committee budgets.\n  This is an amendment that should pass. It has offsets that keep the \nbudget on course toward balance. It makes no overly optimistic \nassumptions. It does not touch taxes. It is a serious attempt to stay \nwithin the parameters which a majority of the Senate Committee on the \nBudget endorsed in reporting this resolution.\n  I think it is also important to remember what the budget resolution \nis. It is a resolution that makes no reference to any specific program; \nrather, it divides spending into broad overall categories.\n  I understand this amendment assumes some specific outsets. There are \nmany other assumptions that could have been used to specifically define \nthose offsets.\n  However, at this stage they are just that--assumptions--and nothing \nmore. They are not mandates on authorizers and appropriators. In the \nends, authorizers and appropriators will make the decisions on \nindividual programs.\n  Some of my colleagues may have objections to any specific offsets \nthat may have been delineated and discussed in relation to this \namendment.\n  While I am concerned about some of the assumptions, one which may be \nregarding the NASA aviation research program, aviation research is \nvital not only to industry but also to public safety and the \nenvironment.\n  However, Mr. President, it is important to remember that the \namendment itself does not refer to the advanced subsonic technology \nprogram or high-speed research, or NASA, for that matter.\n  It refers only to a slight reduction in the overall transportation \nfunction. Less than one-half of 1 percent, in fact.\n  I would like to ask Senator Snowe, is that not correct?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to answer the Senator from Kansas. The \nSenator is absolutely correct. We recommend offsets so that we \ndetermine the credibility of our numbers and ensuring the committee can \nreach those funding levels, but certainly it is within the prerogative \nof the respective committees [[Page S7211]] to determine how they reach \nthose numbers.\n  They may choose to arrive at them in a different way and make \ndifferent reductions and offsets than the ones we recommended. The \nspecific offsets are not included in the legislation. We want to make \nsure they understand that we have some credible numbers that have been \nscored by the CBO.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  I am confident, Mr. President, that the authorizers and appropriators \nwill evaluate programs under their jurisdiction and set their own \npriorities. That has always been the case. It will continue to be the \ncase.\n  This amendment leaves them more than enough room to preserve a vital \nNASA function, for instance, aviation function, and meet the country's \npressing transportation infrastructure needs.\n  Likewise, the budget resolution makes no specific assumptions about \nhow the Senate Committee and Labor and Human Resources will meet its \ninstruction on mandatory spending. Yet, the range of options available \nto the committee on mandatory programs is much more limited.\n  Even the adoption of this amendment will not leave the committee with \nan easy task--as we still must produce over $7 billion in savings among \na rather limited number of options. I would like to go further, but I \ndo not believe it would be realistic to do so.\n  I share the goal of assuring that our Nation's young people do not \nface a future in which the burden of public debt smothers their \ncapacity to benefit from the fruits of their own labor.\n  I thought Senator Snowe, in her comments, very eloquently laid out \nexactly why it was very important to be able to add this money back to \nassist with the student loan program in ways that I think we all \nrecognize would be very beneficial.\n  I believe the Snowe-Abraham amendment strikes a reasonable balance \nbetween these two important objectives. I urge its adoption by the \nSenate when this amendment comes to a vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley.\n  Mr. Grassley. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of \nthe amendment offered by Senators Snowe, Abraham, and myself.\n  Let me just say that as the 2d ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee, and having served on the Budget Committee for over 14 years, \nhow much the committee has benefitted from the infusion of knowledge, \nideas, and energy from these two Senators, Senator Snowe and Senator \nAbraham, as well as Senator Frist, the other newcomer to the committee.\n  I am pleased to be joining these two Senators as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment which lessens the debt our undergraduate \nstudents will face and also ensures that students will not be denied \neligibility for loans because of the value of their family's home or \nfarm.\n  I commend the Senators for offering this amendment.\n  It should not be forgotten though that it is this budget resolution \nand the tremendous work of Chairman Domenici that will do so much to \nbenefit our students, both undergraduate and graduate.\n  The lower interest rates that will be achieved by getting to balance \nby 2002, will translate into hundreds of millions in savings for \nstudents who are paying off their student loans.\n  It is important to note that this amendment offers real offsets for \nthe programs it wants to fund. This amendment doesn't do across-the-\nboard cuts, or worse, tries to pay for it by assuming funds from the \neconomic dividend. This amendment provides real offsets from other \ndiscretionary spending.\n  I would like to comment briefly on one of the offsets--cutting back \npart of the Government's private airlines.\n  I have asked the GAO to review the number of planes that are owned by \nthe Federal Government. Incredibly, the Federal Government, not \nincluding DoD, has over 1500 planes--most of which are owned.\n  Agencies like the Panama Canal Commission, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, and the General Services Administration all have planes.\n  Now many of these planes are necessary,\n   and do have important missions. However, GAO has found that a \nsignificant number of these planes have as their primary mission \nferrying senior Government officials around.\n\n  Similarly, the President's Commission on Integrity and Efficiency has \nfound that many of these aircraft are not necessary.\n  When we are asking others to tighten their belts we cannot continue \nto fund a private airfleet for Government officials.\n  A good example of the wastefulness of these Government-owned aircraft \nis highlighted in a recent report by the NASA inspector general:\n\n       Several NASA aircraft were used by NASA employees, other \n     Government employees, and non-Federal travelers for official \n     travel at higher costs than using commercial airlines.\n       An analysis of fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 1993 \n     travel, comparing the cost of travel using seven of the eight \n     aircraft--NASA owned aircraft--with the cost of using \n     commercial air flights, showed $5.9 million could be saved \n     annually by using the commercial flights.\n\n  This amendment assumes the selling of only a small number of planes, \n150, approximately the number that GAO believes are being used for \ntravel purposes. The amendment still allows the Government to retain \nover 1,400 planes to achieve their missions.\n  This is a good amendment, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment that will help young people to attend college.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to \nyield as much time as he may consume to Senator Abraham of Michigan, \nwho helped in developing this amendment. I was pleased to work with him \nbecause we share the goal in advancing the needs for our families in \nthis country with respect to education.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join Senator Snowe in offering an \namendment to restore $6.3 billion in mandatory education spending \nthrough offsetting cuts to corporate welfare and general Government.\n  Before I discuss the details of the amendment, let me make clear that \nmy sponsorship in no way detracts from the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee or his resolution. Senator Domenici and his staff have done a \nHerculean task of putting this budget together and they should be \napplauded. In the area of education, however, I have some concerns.\n  Mr. President, going to college has been an integral part of the \nAmerican dream ever since Harvard University was established by the \nGeneral Court of Massachusetts in 1636. For millions of young Americans \nfrom lower and middle-class families, a college education is the first \nstep towards a brighter and more productive future. For many of these \nfamilies, however, that dream is out of reach without some form of \nassistance. The student loan program makes it possible for children \nfrom families of modest means to attend college and get their degree.\n  Because of the important role the student loan program plays in so \nmany lives, I am concerned that the spending reductions included in the \neducation, training, employment, and social services function will \nresult in decreased access for low- and middle-income students to a \ncollege education. While it should be noted that the reductions in this \nfunction will not necessarily come out of the student loan program, the \nsize of the reconciliation instructions included for the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee make such cuts possible.\n  By reducing these instructions by $6.3 billion, I hope to relieve \npressure on the authorizing committee so that in reaching their target, \nthey don't have to resort to some of the cuts listed in the CBO \n``Spending and Revenue Options'' book for mandatory education spending.\n  Options like increasing the student origination fee, including home \nand farm equity for when calculating financial need, and eliminating \nthe 6-month grace period between graduation and when the loan payments \nbegin hit students and then families hard when they can afford it the \nleast. The goal of this amendment is to protect undergraduate students \nfrom higher out-pocket-costs when they apply for Federal loans.\n  To pay for this restoration of funding, we are offering the offsets \nfrom the [[Page S7212]] transportation, general government, and \nallowances function. Speaking generally, I am certain a good case could \nbe made for each of these spending areas. With the goal of balancing \nthe budget, however, the Senate must set priorities, and trading \ncorporate welfare for the dream of a college education is a good \nbargain.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me just say that the Federal \nGovernment has been helping students gain access to higher education \nfor over 40 years. This partnership has enabled millions of men and \nwomen to go to college, get their degree, and go on to live more \nproductive and creative lives. This amendment would protect that \ntradition and ensure that student loans continue to be available to all \nAmericans. It is a good amendment, and I hope the Senate will support \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to inquire as to how much time \nis remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine for yielding me some time and congratulate her and Senator \nAbraham for the amendment which they have presented and of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  I believe they are on the right track. Any time you make \nsubstitutions, as the Senator from Kansas pointed out, it is difficult. \nBut I think the selection of the substitutions that Senators Snowe and \nAbraham made are good ones. So that is a fine amendment and I am glad \nto be a cosponsor of it.\n  I would just like to say, if I might, a few words about this budget \nwe are considering here today and will vote on tomorrow. It seems to me \ntremendously important that we bear in mind that for 33 straight years \nthis Nation of ours, through wars and recessions, through good economic \ntimes and through bad economic times, the Federal Government has \ncontinually had to borrow money each year to pay its bills. Why is this \nso bad? What it means is that each year we continue to finance the \nGovernment with debt, and in doing so we steal the economic prosperity \nof our children and our grandchildren. Interest expenses this year \ntotaled $235 billion. Not a penny of that for principal--$235 billion; \n15 percent of the total budget of the United States now is being spent \non interest on the debt. That amount of $235 billion will increase to \n$400 billion in just 10 years unless we do something about this budget.\n  With the problem so clearly defined, you would think the President \nwould have addressed it when he sent up a budget this year. But he did \nnot. Instead, the President sent us a budget that had $200 billion of \ndeficit this year, and over the next 7 years he continued with deficits \nof the same nature.\n  I do not think that continuing on the path of deficit spending is \nacceptable. To me it is morally wrong to be sending these bills on to \nour children and future generations. Some Members on the other side of \nthe aisle have suggested that selecting 7 years from now, the year 2002 \nis arbitrary. I mean why do you select 2002? How about 2005? There is \nnothing magic about 2002. But let us get on with the job. Once you \nstart down the slippery slope of saying how about 2005, how about 2015 \nor 2020? I do not go with the thinking of postponing it beyond 7 years. \nSeven years provides us with enough time to implement the cuts in a \nmanner that does not jeopardize our economy.\n  Like every Senator, I have heard from people who come up to me, as \nevery Senator here has had the experience, and they say, ``I am for \nbalancing the budget, but''--the next word is always ``but''--``but \nplease protect this particular program I am interested in,'' whether it \nis education or the environment or health care or doing something about \nlaw enforcement. You always hear that word ``but,'' but do something \nabout greater research at the NIH--whatever it might be.\n  If we are going to balance this budget, we have to have hits right \nacross the board, in a whole series of attractive programs. Is this the \nperfect budget? I do not think it is. I suppose, if they had asked me \nto draw up a budget, I could have done a better job, probably. That is \nwhat I think. And every single Senator here thinks the same thing. But \nthis budget is the first one in three decades that puts us on a path of \nfiscal responsibility. I congratulate the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, for the extraordinary work he has done. \nNot only Senator Domenici, but the members of his committee likewise \ndeserve congratulations.\n  We have a choice. We can stick with the status quo. We can do \nnothing. And we can just go on with $200 billion of deficit this year \ngoing up to $400 billion in a few years. Or we can end these deficits \nand do it now. The budget before us leads America away from the red ink \nand toward a better future for our children.\n  If we succeed in balancing this budget, as we are on the path to \ndoing now, we will reap the benefits of lower interest rates, stronger \neconomic growth, and the feeling, that wonderful feeling that we are \npassing this Nation on to our children in better condition than we \nfound it. What could be more worthwhile than that? What more worthy \ngoal than to say we are not going to continue passing these bills on to \nour children and grandchildren?\n  Mr. President, I just hope this budget before us will receive the \nsupport from every single Senator when we vote on it tomorrow \nafternoon. Again, I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Maine \nand the distinguished Senator from Michigan for the excellent amendment \nwhich they have submitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would now yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to elaborate a little further on \nsome of the reasons why I think this amendment is so important. As a \ncandidate for the Senate during the 1994 campaign, I traveled \nthroughout my State. I was struck by the extent to which young people \nin Michigan, college students, high school students, and others really \nbelieve that it was important that we focus on the future. They were \nlooking to us, I think, those of us had who were running, to try to \naddress how we could make our Nation more competitive, how we could \nexpand opportunities, particularly opportunities in the private sector \nin the next century, how we could be more competitive in a global \nenvironment in which we compete no longer with just three or four other \nindustrial nations but with virtually the whole world.\n  I think, as I talked to people, both those who might themselves be \nbeneficiaries of student loans in this 7-year period we are discussing \nbut also to leaders of industry in my State, it became increasingly \nclear to me that a top priority had to be a well-educated work force, a \nwork force prepared to be competitive with the kind of global economy \nwhich we will encounter.\n  That is why I think it is important that we make our citizenry as \ncompetitive as it can be. I believe this amendment, by producing the \nkinds of environments in which not only the volume of student loans \nthat are available does not decrease but the access to those loans by \npeople of more modest means remains unchanged, is the way by which we \ncan fulfill for many people their dreams to be able to participate \nfully in the kind of competitive economic environment of the future.\n  For that reason, I think the amendment particularly is sensible, one \nthat I hope other Members of the Senate will join us in supporting when \nwe cast our votes on this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Snowe, \nAbraham, Grassley, Brown, Kassebaum, and others in offering an \namendment to the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution to restore funds to \nvaluable education programs by reducing funding for Federal building \nprojects by 50 percent.\n  I strongly support this amendment and believe that it represents a \nmuch better use of scarce Federal resources. I am very concerned about \nthe cost of Federal construction projects. Last Congress, I introduced \nlegislation to [[Page S7213]] reform the way the Federal Government \nmanages its office space. I was concerned that the Government had \nbillions of dollars in construction projects in the works and did not \nseem to be focusing enough attention on whether these projects were \nbeing constructed or renovated in the most cost-effective manner, \nwhether the Federal Government was building in areas already glutted \nwith commercial real estate, or even whether projects were truly \nneeded.\n  Numerous General Accounting Office [GAO], and General Services \nAdministration [GSA], Inspector General [IG] reports over the years \nhave consistently identified problems in GSA's real estate portfolio \nand its chronic history of wasteful spending and mismanagement. The \nagency's long standing problems have significantly impaired its ability \nto meet the property needs of the Federal Government in a cost-\neffective and business-like manner. My legislation directed OMB to \nreview Federal property management policies and implement changes to \nensure better coordination among Federal agencies, focus on longer term \ncost-effectiveness, and achieve cost savings. While my legislation was \npassed by the Senate, it was amended in conference to require GAO to do \na study to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of establishing \na single Federal agency responsible for selling and otherwise disposing \nof real property owned by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD], Farmers Home Administration, Department of \nAgriculture, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC], and the \nResolution Trust Corporation [RTC]. This report is due out later this \nyear.\n  In July 1993, I held a hearing in the Senate Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management to examine how GSA manages its real \nestate. The results were quite disturbing. The hearing highlighted the \nfact that the Federal Government was constructing it did not need and \nleasing buildings it could not afford. Last May, the full Governmental \nAffairs Committee examined waste in the Federal courthouse construction \nprogram. The hearing illustrated that the Federal Government was \nwasting millions of dollars on courthouses that were padded with \nextravagant features such as brass doorknobs, kitchenettes, custom \nlighting, and expensive wood paneling.\n  During these hearings, R.S. Means, a Boston company that surveys \nconstruction costs, reported that the Federal Government was paying at \nleast two to three times as much to build a Federal courthouse or \noffice building than it cost to build a State courthouse or construct a \nbuilding for the private sector.\n  The GAO also found major flaws in the methodology used by the Federal \njudiciary for estimating future court space needs. As a result, future \nspace needs for a 10-year period were overestimated by more than 3 \nmillion square feet which, if authorized, could result in $1.1 billion \nin unneeded courthouse space. I, along with a number of my colleagues, \nwrote GAO to request an audit of the Federal courthouse construction \nprogram. That report is due out later this year.\n  Last March, Senator Kerrey and I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to the fiscal year 1995 budget resolution calling for a 1-\nyear moratorium on construction of new Federal courthouses. Although it \npassed the Senate, the provision was dropped in conference and a number \nof courthouses and other Federal office buildings were subsequently \nfunded.\n  More recently, I joined Senator Kerrey in offering an amendment to \nthe rescission bill that would have added over $300 million in deficit \nreduction to be taken from wasteful or unnecessary GSA projects. The \namendment would have scaled back projects that were not authorized or \nthat the GSA itself has either never asked for or said are unnecessary \nor lavish. Senator Shelby offered a second degree amendment which \nexpanded the projects covered to all Federal new construction, repair \nand alteration projects, including those that had gone through the \nnormal authorization process, eliminating $1.9 billion in funding for \nFederal construction projects. Unfortunately, much of the $1.9 billion \ncut by the Shelby amendment was restored in conference. Mr. President, \nat a time when we are looking at cuts in education and many valuable \nprograms, I find it hard to believe that we cannot find the means to \ncut funds for Federal building projects first.\n  I have commended GSA Administrator Roger Johnson in the past for his \nefforts to reform GSA and save taxpayers' dollars. At his confirmation \nhearing, I asked Johnson to suspend and review all Federal construction \nprojects to determine if the projects were truly needed. GSA \nAdministrator Roger Johnson's time out and review looked at about 200 \nconstruction and leasing projects and recommended changes with \npotential savings of $1.2 billion. While this is certainly a step in \nthe right direction, more still needs to be done.\n  As Congress looks for ways to address the Federal budget deficit, we \nmust ensure that Government programs and agencies are operating in the \nmost cost effective manner possible. In these times of tight budgetary \nconstraint, this amendment makes sense. I am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment which will reduce funding of Federal buildings projects by 50 \npercent, on top of the 25 percent already assumed in the budget \nresolution, and target these funds to helping students go to college. \nThis amendment represents a better use of scarce Federal dollars and \nputs money back into important education programs. I urge my colleagues \nto support the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by Senators Snowe, Abraham, Grassley, Brown, Kassebaum, Cohen, \nLott, and Chafee.\n  I support the goal of the amendment--to provide increased funds for \nhigher education. My record is clear and unequivical on education \nfunding. These funds must be increased, but not in the way proposed by \nthe proponents of this amendment. I would like to speak about two of \nthe offsets that the amendment identifies and discuss the impact which \nthese cuts would have on our economy.\n  First, the amendment would zero out two important NASA programs. \nThese programs are the R or seed corn type programs which many of my \ncolleagues have heard me speak about in the past. This amendment would \nzero out NASA's High-Speed Research Program, and NASA's Advanced \nSubsonic Technology Program.\n  Before I talk about these specific programs, I would like to observe \nthat NASA has already absorbed more than its share of budget cuts. A \ncouple of figures will illustrate what I am talking about: In fiscal \nyear 1993, NASA's 5-year budget request was about $122 billion. The \nfiscal year 1996 request is now $82 billion for the next 5 years. NASA \nhas been cut by one-third in just over 2 years.\n  NASA has stepped up to the plate to reduce bureaucracy and improve \nthe way it does business. Under Dan Goldin's leadership the agency is \ncurrently going through a painful process of reducing its budget by $5 \nbillion over the next 5 years. Mr. Goldin believes that this can be \nachieved without eliminating programs. He has a tough row to hoe to \nachieve this. Further cuts in NASA's budget will simply result in the \nelimination of current programs.\n  Now, let me talk about the High-Speed Research Program first. The \ngoal of this program is to help develop the technologies industry needs \nto design and build an environmentally compatible and economically \ncompetitive high-speed civil jet transport for the 21st century. The \ntechnology developments are to reach an appropriate stage of maturity \nto enable an industry decision on aircraft production by 2001.\n  Mr. President, the technologies currently needed to develop such a \ntransport are beyond the state of the art. NASA estimates that industry \nwill need to invest more than $20 billion to bring such a transport to \nmarket.\n  Studies have identified a substantial market for a future supersonic \nairliner to meet rapidly growing demand for long-haul travel, \nparticularly across the Pacific. Over the period from 2005 to 2015, \nthis market could support 500 to 1,000 aircraft, creating a \nmultibillion dollar sales opportunity for its producers. Such an \naircraft will be essential for capturing the valuable long-haul Pacific \nrim market.\n  As currently envisioned an HSCT aircraft should be designed to carry \n300 [[Page S7214]] passengers at Mach 2.4 on transoceanic routes over \ndistances up to 6,000 nautical miles at fares comparable to subsonic \ntransports.\n  Now let me talk about the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program.\n  The goal of NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology Program is to \ndevelop, in cooperation with the FAA and the U.S. aeronautics industry, \nhigh payoff technologies to enable a safe, highly productive global air \ntransportation system that includes a new generation of environmentally \ncompatible, economical U.S. subsonic aircraft. Some of the technologies \nand issues being studied and developed in this program include:\n  Fly by light/power by wire: a fully digital aircraft control system \nwhich would be substantially lighter, more reliable, and efficient than \ncurrent control systems.\n  Aging aircraft: to develop new ways of inspecting aircraft to \ndetermine their airworthiness. New approaches are being developed to \ndetermine the residual strength in airframes using advanced \nnondestructive technologies. It might be worth thinking about this \nprogram the next time you are sitting in a 727 that is 20 years old \nwaiting to take off on a cross-country flight.\n  Noise reduction: This program is developing technologies to reduce \naircraft noise by 10 decibels or more by the year 2000.\n  Terminal area productivity: Technologies, chiefly involving air \ntraffic control, that can improve the efficiency of operations on the \nground at busy airports.\n  Integrated wing design: New concepts, design methodologies, model \nfabrication and test techniques are being developed to provide industry \nan integrated capability to achieve increased aircraft performance at \nlower cost.\n  Propulsion: Technologies to improve fuel efficiency of future \ncommercial engines by at least 8 percent and reduce nitrogen oxides by \n70 percent over current technology. These are only some of the \ntechnologies being developed under the program which the amendment's \nproponents would completely gut. It is a truly shortsighted amendment \nthat would eliminate these important applied technology programs.\n   Mr. President, it is no secret that aerospace business is a \nGovernment-private sector partnership. Historically our Government has \nfunded aeronautics R, and industry has taken this basic technology \nand developed aircraft that have dominated the world market. Over the \nlast decade or so, other governments have gotten into the act. \nCurrently the U.S. Market share is about 65 percent, down from about 91 \npercent in the 1960's.\n  Cutting these two important programs will not help us regain this \nmarket share--quite the opposite. We will be\n sending a signal that the U.S. aircraft industry will be less \ncompetitive.\n\n  In summary, the advanced subsonic technology:\n  Meets future technology needs for next generation aircraft.\n  Enables NASA to develop high-risk, high-payoff, precompetitive \ntechnology to prove feasibility so that industry may complete \ndevelopment and apply technology to specific products.\n  Will result in accomplishments in noise prediction codes for quieter \nengines, nondestructive evaluation techniques for detecting corrosion, \ncracks and disbonds; analytical tools to understand airraft wake \ncortices for safe landings.\n  Assists in preserving 1 million U.S. high-quality jobs and $25 to $30 \nbillion annual positive balance of trade for U.S. aviation.\n  The High-Speed Research program will:\n  Enable NASA to develop early, high-risk technology for future \nenvironmentally compatible, economically competitive, high-speed civil \ntransport aircraft--technologies needed are beyond state of the art;\n  Industry will take NASA technology and invest $20 billion to actually \ndevelop aircraft, and\n  If the United States is first to market, the U.S. market share could \ngrow to 80 percent, achieve $200 billion in sales, and create 140,000 \nnew U.S. jobs.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nSnowe-Abraham amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to say in conclusion that I \ncertainly appreciate the efforts by the Senator from Michigan, and \nother colleagues and cosponsors of this amendment, on a very critical \nand important issue in our estimation. We want to be sure that the \nAmerican people understand and know that we consider education to be \none of the highest priorities. That is why we are seeking to restore \n$6.3 billion in the education account.\n  When you consider the fact that since 1988 students' education costs \nincreased by 219 percent, it is almost difficult to comprehend, because \nthe average family has been struggling since that time in some very \ndifficult and unusual economic times, considering the recession that we \nhave had, certainly in my State of Maine and in the New England area, \nwhich was the hardest hit in addition to the other parts of the \ncountry, especially California. We represented a third of all of the \njobs that were lost during the course of that recession.\n  So when you consider the fact that education needs became more \nimportant, we have to make sure that they have access to adequate \nfunding for financial assistance in the future. Not only is it \nessential for their future, but it also essential to this country's \nfuture when you consider how important the educational experience is \ngoing to be for global competition in and for the economic world we \nwill be facing in the next century and beyond.\n  So I appreciate the statements that have been made by all of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield time for an inquiry by the Senator from Arkansas, \nor I will yield him what time he needs on his amendment. I guess what \nwe were hoping for is to restore the balance of the time due on this \nside on the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine. I would make \ninquiry at this time, if the Senator from Maine would consider setting \naside her amendment now that the yeas and nays have been ordered so \nthat we can allow Senator Bumpers to proceed with the offering of an \namendment that he has that we will vote on tomorrow.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was not here. But essentially there is \ntime remaining in opposition to the amendment. I have to use a little \nbit of that. In fact, that is what I was discussing. I told the Senator \nI wanted to discuss this before I asked her to set her amendment aside.\n  So I am willing that that time be charged in opposition, however, \nanybody would want to do it. If somebody wants to speak on the general \nbudget, I will yield them time. Does the Senator from Alabama need \ntime?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I need 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 15 minutes in opposition to the Snowe amendment \nat this point. I am trying to make arrangements.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, over the past few days Members on the \nother side of the aisle basically have claimed to represent the best \ninterests of hard-working Americans. They stood up with charts and made \npassionate speeches, and say they know better. They criticized the \nDomenici budget, although they have no budget of their own.\n  I believe that the budget resolution debate has been demagogued to \ndeath.\n  This debate has been turned into an issue of who is compassionate and \nwho is not, and rich against poor, even though the Senate budget \nresolution does not include $1 yet in tax cuts. Never mind we do not \ntouch Head Start. Never mind that we do not touch the School Lunch \nProgram. Mr. President, never mind that we do not cut Social Security. \nNever mind that we preserve Medicare, which will go bankrupt unless \nresponsible leaders take action. [[Page S7215]] \n  I believe we need tonight to discuss the real issues, like our \ntremendous national debt and our endless string of deficits. I believe \nthat people on the other side of the aisle do not want to debate \nbasically the fact that we are the biggest debtor nation in the world. \nPeople on the other side of the aisle I believe do not basically want \nto debate the fact that the dollar is, overall, losing its value \nagainst most major currencies, and that hard-working Americans are \nlosing purchasing power every time the dollar depreciates. No, Mr. \nPresident, they will not debate the real issues.\n  Mr. President, I was once told that on the other side of the aisle \npeople see what they want to see, and that the Republicans have the \nunfortunate tendency of seeing what is there. I would like to show you \nwhat is there. Because what is there are the real issues.\n  I want to share with you a chart, if I can, a chart that shows the \nFederal Government's net financial assets beginning in the year 1946, \nwhich is over here, through 1993. Instead of an upward spiral, you see \na downward spiral because these are real issues.\n  This chart comes from data contained in the 1995 Economic Report of \nthe President. It shows the Federal Government's net financial assets, \nas I said, from 1946 to 1993.\n  As one can see on the chart, the Federal Government is depleting the \nnational wealth of the United States every year. It is going down. But \nlook at it over here, how fast it is going down. The greatest country \nin the world, Mr. President, the United States of America, the great \neconomic leader of our time, possessed net financial assets of nearly \n$3 trillion in 1993. Far from saving our children and investing in our \nkids for tomorrow, the spending machine of the Federal Government is \nsquandering away our resources at a record rate.\n  The chart says it better than we can. In fact, net financial assets \nof the Federal Government have been decreasing at a rate of 7.1 percent \na year over the past 20 years, while private wealth has grown only 3.2 \npercent. The Federal Government is depleting national wealth at a rate \ntwice as fast as the private sector can create. This is a trend that we \ncannot simply sustain as a Nation.\n  There is a direct impact in the rise in Government budget deficits, \nwhich is to worsen the current account balance and place upward \npressure on interest rates. Our current account stood at $104 billion \nin 1993. This means we either sold $104 billion in assets to foreign \nentities, borrowed $104 billion from foreign entities, or a combination \nof the two.\n  Although a current account deficit in and of itself is not a bad \nthing, the accumulation of persistent current account deficits over \ntime leads to an overwhelmingly external debt that we have today. These \ndeficits identify a systematic shortfall of savings below investment \ndue to an expansion consumption relative to income.\n  The implication is that we borrowed to finance current consumption, \nexpenditures that have no real effect on economic growth or future \nincome in this Nation. In other words, the Government is borrowing \nabroad to finance the excess of expenditures over income. Projections \nof higher current account deficits run well into the foreseeable \nfuture, which does not bode well for this country.\n  The increase in interest rates caused by budget deficits increase the \ncost of capital, home mortgages, car payments and any other goods that \nare financed. If the other side of the aisle really wants to help the \nhard-working, middle-class Americans, it seems to me they should help \nthem reduce the cost of living instead of adding, Mr. President, to \ntheir already tremendous burden.\n  It is true that hard-working, middle-class Americans need relief, but \non the other side of the aisle I think a lot of the people just cannot \naccept the notion that relief does not have to come in the form of a \ncheck, Mr. President, in the form of a check from the Government every \nmonth. No, they do not have to accept the notion of freedom and free \nmarkets. They still believe that Americans depend on Government for \ntheir livelihood.\n  I reject that notion wholeheartedly. I understand the unpleasantries \nof debt-stricken countries. We all do. Let me tell you that the \nrestrained growth in this budget resolution is more compassionate, more \nbeneficial and more tolerable than any experience of a bankrupt \ncountry. The immediate gratification of consumption does not outweigh \nthe tremendous long-term benefits of a balanced budget.\n  Democrats supposedly believe in a balanced budget. However, they have \npresented no proposal that I have seen. President Clinton supposedly \nbelieves in a balanced budget, but he has not presented one here that I \nknow of. President Clinton, I understand, will not even support a $16 \nbillion rescission package much less the $175 billion in cuts necessary \nto balance the budget this year. And $16 billion, Mr. President, is \nonly 9 percent of this year's deficit. Come to find out it is only .3 \npercent of the $4.8 trillion debt.\n  The actions of President Clinton and his party do not match their \nwords. Their idea of deficit reduction is the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993 that we all know included the largest tax \nincrease in history. Did it reduce the deficit, Mr. President? Yes. \nOnly temporarily, for a year or two. But if one looks at the outyears, \ndeficit spending just keeps going up as far as the eye can see.\n  What do we have to show for our $241 billion tax increase? Nothing, I \nwould submit--nothing but increasing deficits and reduced disposable \nincome for hard-working Americans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has outlined the potential economic \nimpacts of balancing the budget by the year 2002. They project long-\nterm interest rates will fall by almost 2 percentage points. They also \nproject an increase in real GNP of almost 1 percent, just from \npracticing a little fiscal discipline.\n  Mr. President, a balanced budget is good for America today, tomorrow \nand forever. That is why I am going to support the Domenici budget.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time for that purpose?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Pardon me, Mr. President, for not being in the Chamber. \nI yield 15 minutes to Senator Thompson from Tennessee who desires to \nspeak in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we are now in the midst of a budget \ndebate, but in listening to the debate over the last several days it \nhas become apparent to me this is not just a debate over the budget, \nnot just about the need to balance the budget or budget priorities. It \nis a debate over two conflicting sets of ideas, and ultimately it is a \ndebate over how much faith we have in the American people to support a \npolicy that we all know is right.\n  Many Americans believe that our country is at a crossroads. While we \nall know that we were the victors of the cold war and we are still \nstrong and prosperous, more and more of our people are coming to the \nconclusion that there are some things in this country that are simply \nwrong: the youthfulness and the viciousness of our crime, our welfare \ndependency and social disintegration that comes from that, a gradual \nslowing of our economy, our extremely low savings rate and low \ninvestment rate, a greater and greater dependency upon foreign money to \nprop our economy up. Americans wonder how long we can remain strong \nwhen we are losing so many things that have made us strong.\n  We look at the lessons of history, and we see that the fate of other \ngreat nations where they have gone down the road of bigger government, \nhigher taxes and increasing debt and moral and intellectual laziness. \nWe see how they enjoyed their brief hour upon the world's stage and \nthen moved on and declined. And we wonder if ours is going to be the \ngeneration that oversees the decline of the United States of America to \nthe role of a second-rate country.\n  We certainly are not addressing the totality of this situation during \nthis current debate. Indeed, we must question how much in the way of \nsolution actually lies in the hands of the Federal Government. However, \nthis debate [[Page S7216]] does involve an area that is largely under \nthe control of Congress. Indeed, some might say that Congress was \nprimarily the cause of it. And it is the most serious economic problem \nfacing our Nation. That is a debt that is literally bankrupting our \ncountry.\n  One of the things most basic to human nature, Mr. President, is \nlooking out for those who we bring into the world, and for most of our \ncountry's history we did just that. Through world wars, through a Great \nDepression, we paid for what we consumed. However, for a quarter of a \ncentury or so now, we have gone off on another track. We have gone off \non a spending spree, and we are borrowing money now from future \ngenerations. Over the years, every interest group imaginable has \norganized itself and made its demand on the Federal Treasury. And since \nwe are a system essentially of professional legislators whose primary \ninterest is in reelection, the answer to these demands for more Federal \ndollars is usually yes. So program is piled upon program, and once a \nprogram is created and its constituency is created, it is never done \naway with. It is seldom even reduced. It is usually only expanded. And \nmore and more people are increasingly dependent upon the so-called free \nmoney that we are borrowing from our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious the American people have decided that \nthis country cannot survive under this old way of doing business. They \nhave rightfully decided that we cannot sustain an almost $5 trillion \ndebt that is still growing. They have decided we will not saddle our \nfuture generations with higher interest rates, less affordable homes, \nfewer jobs, lower wages and a loss of economic sovereignty. They \nunderstand we are on the verge of bankrupting two of our most important \nsocial programs in this country, Social Security and Medicare, if we do \nnot take immediate steps.\n  In response to this clear mandate, the Republicans on the Budget \nCommittee, without one Democratic vote, have produced a plan that will \nbalance the budget by the year 2002 by slowing the growth in Federal \nspending from 5 percent a year to 3 percent a year. It protects Social \nSecurity, saves Medicare from bankruptcy, maintains the Social Security \nsafety net, reduces the Federal Government and removes power out of \nWashington back to the people.\n  Of course, the defenders of the status quo continue to do everything \npossible to defeat these goals. They first denied the need to balance \nthe budget. They are only following the President's lead in that \nregard. He has submitted what the Washington Post called a ``weak and \ndirectionless budget'' that will add over $1.2 trillion to our national \ndebt over 5 years. Then his senior economic adviser claimed that \ncutting the budget would actually be bad for the economy. These \ndevelopments were met with universal dismay and derision and have since \nbeen abandoned by our friends across the aisle.\n  We tried to pass the balanced budget amendment. At this point the \ndefenders of the status quo, being able to see which way the wind was \nblowing, acknowledged the need to balance the budget but forcefully \nargued that we should balance it without a constitutional amendment; \nthat all we needed to do was exercise our responsibility as \nlegislators. Besides that, they said, tell us how you are going to \nbalance the budget. We want to see a plan. And they defeated the \nbalanced budget amendment by a single vote.\n  Now the Republicans have submitted the balanced budget resolution. We \nhave detailed a plan, and we are ready to take on the responsibility. \nNow our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, backed into a \ncorner, slip their favorite old worn out record on the Victrola. Side A \nis entitled ``Scare the Sick and the Elderly.'' Almost as popular with \nthem is the flip side called ``Class Warfare''--in other words, the \nsame old record that they were playing during the last congressional \nelections, which proved so rewarding for them. They rail against tax \ncuts for the rich when in fact there are no tax cuts in this budget for \nanybody, much less the rich. However, they correctly point out that \nthere might be $170 billion dividend if in fact a balanced budget is \ncertified.\n And they seem petrified at the thought that this might actually result \nin some taxpayers getting the benefit of some of the money in the form \nof a tax cut; in other words, getting to keep a little bit of the money \nthat they earned in the first place. So now instead of helping us \nbalance the budget, they are busy trying to figure out how to spend \nthis $170 billion that they had no hand in producing and that does not \neven exist yet.\n\n  Clearly, the tax-and-spend philosophy that has gotten us into the \ntrouble that we are in is alive and well. Mr. President, the opponents \nof this budget who for so long promoted big spending and every pork \nbarrel project to come down the pike, including the President's ill-\nfated stimulus package, and who have opposed the balanced budget \namendment and a balanced budget are now saying that we are not \nbalancing it in the right way. They say, ``We definitely want a \nbalanced budget, but not at the expense of group A or group B or group \nC'' and the groups go on and on and on. In other words, we cannot \nreduce the rate of growth in any areas even where the growth rate is \nout of hand if it actually affects anyone.\n  The defenders of the status quo talk about protecting children when \nit is their policies of the past that have robbed these children of \ntheir future prosperity. They talk about defending the college student \nwhen it is the philosophy of ``spending is the solution to everything'' \nwhich has greatly diminished the value of a college degree because so \nmany of our students entering college nowadays cannot even read and \nwrite.\n  They talk about defending the elderly when it is their policies, the \npolicies of the past, that have put us on the verge of bankrupting both \nSocial Security and the Medicare trust funds.\n  They talk about making sure that the wealthy receive no additional \nbreaks, and yet it is the wealthy who are the bond holders who are \nreceiving the astronomical interest payments that we make on our \nnational debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, without \ndeficit reduction, annual interest payments by 2002 will balloon to \n$334 billion.\n  No, the plain truth is that the only way for these groups to get what \nthey deserve and to prosper in the years ahead is to turn our backs on \nthe failed policies of these so-called defenders and rectify the damage \nthat they have already done by moving toward a balanced budget. The \nbalanced budget resolution before this body is the first major step \ntoward that end.\n  These budget critics want to refight the eighties again, ignoring \ntheir own part in the spending binge that ran up the deficit. They say \nit was the President's fault back then. I say to my friends on the \nother side, the constitutional authority of the President of the United \nStates has not changed. If it was the President's fault in the \neighties, whose fault is it now?\n  As a recent Washington Post editorial said:\n\n       Democratic complaints about Republican budget plans will \n     continue to have a hollow and unpersuasive ring until the \n     Democrats begin to come up with specific alternatives of \n     their own. Until then they will merely seem to be defending \n     the present spending pattern, with its succession of $200 \n     billion a year deficit reaching as far as the eye can see \n     that President Clinton projected in the budget he sent to \n     Congress last February.\n\n  Now, it should be kept clearly in mind that we are not going through \nthis exercise simply to avert disaster, although that would be reason \nenough. We are doing it to ensure future prosperity, Mr. President. \nEliminating the deficit could bring widespread benefit in the form of \nlower interest rates for mortgages and business loans. That would spur \na boon in housing construction and business investment which would \ncreate jobs and raise incomes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office states that the package of a credible \nbalanced budget plan would lead the bond market to bid down interest \nrates almost immediately.\n  New home buyers would be clear winners. If interest rates dropped \nonly 1 percent, a young couple with a $100,000 mortgage would save \nenough over the life of that mortgage to put one of their children \nthrough college for a year without any help from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Roger Brinner, chief economist with the forecasting firm of DRI \nMcGraw-Hill estimates balancing the budget would raise America's yearly \noutput an extra 2.5 percent over the next 10 years. [[Page S7217]] That \nwould mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American \nfamily. He adds that the economy would create 2.4 million more jobs by \nthe year 2005 than if the deficit remained unchecked.\n  The General Accounting Office projects Americans living by 2025 would \nenjoy per capita incomes of $9,500 higher if Washington succeeds in \nbringing the deficit under control. Many analysts believe that the \ndollar slide in March was due to our failure to pass a balanced budget \namendment. The U.S. dollar has rebounded in foreign exchange markets \nduring the last several weeks, in part because of a growing belief \namong foreign investors that the United States is finally moving to put \nits economic house in order.\n  So, Mr. President, we must reject the ideas and practices of the past \nwhich have caused this problem. We must also reject the rhetoric which \nappeals to fear and prejudice and appeals to greed to use and consume \neverything we can get our hands on today and not concern ourselves with \nthe future and the fact that it is our own children's birthright that \nwe are consuming.\n  And so, Mr. President, let us get on about with what the people sent \nus here to do while it is still not too late to change our direction. \nWe as Members of this body must have the courage to stand up to the \ndemagoguery and any short-term political risk we might be taking by \ndoing what we know is right.\n  I am firmly convinced ultimately the American people are willing to \ndo what is necessary to ensure a brighter future for our children, and \nwe must have the wisdom to follow them and the courage to lead them. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Thompson.\n  We are going to enter a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. EXON. May I suggest to my friend, possibly we can get started \nwith Senator Bumpers, and then I think we all know what the unanimous \nconsent request is going to be. We can finalize it and type it up \nsometime during the debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is coming right now. I agree, we could probably \nstammer around and between us we might be able to articulate the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. EXON. As usual.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have difficulty with that. Let me just make sure we \nhave it down.\n  Mr. President, I wonder, without detracting anything from Senator \nBumpers who is going to get 20 minutes very soon on his amendment and \nhe can share that with Senator Murray, as I understand it, Senator \nStevens had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution cleared on both sides. I \nunderstand you all have cleared it. We cleared it.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Snowe \namendment be laid aside until 8 a.m. tomorrow in status quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBumpers be recognized to offer an amendment on which there be 20 \nminutes under the control of Senator Bumpers and 10 minutes under my \ncontrol; that no amendments be in order to the Bumpers amendment; and \nthat when the Senate votes, it vote on or in relation to the Bumpers \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the debate on the Bumpers amendment, Senator Hatfield be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say that this is going to go push things back a \nlittle bit. We are trying to accommodate everybody here at one time. Is \nthe Senator insisting on making an agreement at this time to go back to \nSenator Hatfield's amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Not back to it. He never offered it. That will be \nrotating, and he has received assurance from me for 36 hours that he \nwas the next thing after the Snowe amendment. We did not know about the \nSenator's. That is to be put ahead of it, after the Democrat amendment. \nI must do that. I cannot agree on time, but I think it will be \nreasonable considering the circumstances.\n  Mr. EXON. Under the circumstances, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished floor \nmanager would be willing to also state that at the time the rollcalls \noccur on these amendments, that mine follow that amendment of the \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What about following Senator Feingold's?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever the order is that the leader agrees to \npursuant to the unanimous consent request, Senator Bumpers will follow \nSenator Feingold.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thought it would be better if rollcalls followed the \nsequence in which the amendments are offered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not know what is going to happen to Senator \nSnowe's amendment. It could have second degrees.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator, in order to keep the flow properly here, \ninclude as part of his unanimous-consent agreement that after the \ndisposition of the Hatfield amendment that we would go back and meet a \ncommitment that we have made through Senator Boxer on this side, and \nthat her amendment would follow the discussion of the Hatfield \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So long as we make no agreements, other than that \nSenator Boxer is next, I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the several unanimous-\nconsent requests?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Bumpers if he could do me \na special favor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If this amendment of Senator Stevens has been cleared, \nthat is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Without in any way changing the time allowed, I wonder \nif we could now recognize Senator Stevens who has an amendment that has \nbeen approved on both sides. I will yield for 2 or 3 minutes and I ask \nthat he be permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my friend. I am apologetic that I did not appear \nbefore. I had constituents here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1129\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a sense of the Congress regarding full funding \n                   for Decade of the Brain research)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 1129.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title III of the resolution \n     insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FULL FUNDING FOR \n                   DECADE OF THE BRAIN RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) long term health care costs associated with diseases \n     and disorders of the brain have a substantial impact on \n     federal expenditures for Medicaid and Medicare, and on the \n     earning potential of the Nation;\n       (2) to highlight the impact of brain diseases and disorders \n     on the economy and well being of the Nation the Congress has \n     declared the 1990's the Decade of the Brain;\n       (3) meaningful research has been initiated as part of the \n     Decade of the Brain;\n       (4) if fully funded this research could provide important \n     new medical breakthroughs; and\n       (5) these breakthroughs could result in a significant \n     reduction in costs to the Federal Government.\n       (d) Sene of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that in furtherance of the goals of the Decade of the Brain \n     the appropriate committees should seek to ensure that full \n     funding is provided for research on brain diseases and \n     disorders in each of the fiscal years to which this \n     resolution applies.\n\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Domenici as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this deals with the decade of the brain.\n  Over 50 million Americans each year are affected by disease or \ndisorders of the brain and central nervous system. The impact on \nsociety is approximately $300 billion a year. But even as scientific \nprogress races ahead, public awareness is falling behind. The DANA \nFoundation has 10 attainable goals by the year 2000. These are;\n  First, the identification of the genes that are defective in familial \nAlzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.\n  Second, the identification of the genes responsible for manic-\ndepressive illness.\n  Third, the identification of new medications and therapeutic \nstrategies to reduce nerve cell death and enhance recovery of function \nafter strokes and other forms of brain injury.\n  Fourth, the development of new drugs and other measures to alleviate \nthe effects of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, motor neuron disease \n(e.g. ALS, or Lou Gehrig's), Parkinson's, and epilepsy.\n  Fifth, the identification of new treatments to promote nerve \nregeneration following spinal cord and peripheral nerve injury.\n  Sixth, the development of new and more effective treatments for \nmanic-depressive illness, anxiety disorders, and forms of schizophrenia \nthat at present resist treatment.\n  Seventh, the discovery, testing, and application of agents that will \nblock the action of cocaine and other addictive substances.\n  Eighth, the development of new treatments for pain associated with \ncancer, arthritis, migraine headaches, and other debilitating diseases.\n  Ninth, the identification of the genes that cause hereditary deafness \nand blindness.\n  Tenth, the elucidation of the neuronal mechanisms involved in \nlearning and memory.\n  There have been many breakthroughs during the early part of the \ndecade. Here are some of the recent discoveries or break-throughs;\n  Identified the genes responsible for Huntington's disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, and the familial form of Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Produced new medications for migraine headaches.\n  Identified several genes that cause hereditary blindness and \ndeafness.\n  Launched tests of new drugs to enhance recovery from stroke and \nspinal cord injury.\n  Produced new drug for the treatment of epilepsy.\n  Made significant progress in understanding the addictive action of \ncocaine.\n  CREB--a protein. One form of CREB turns on genes responsible for \nlong-term memory storage, while another form turns them off. The \nactivating form of CREB may dominate when important things are going \non, and the memory-repressing form when unnecessary information needs \nto be filtered out.\n  CRIF--brain chemical that may eventually control stress. It is a \nchemical that suppresses the body's stress response. Researchers at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania are currently studying it.\n  Riluzole--An experimental drug that has shown some success in slowing \nthe progression of the muscle-wasting Lou Gehrig's disease. This \ndisease affects 30,000 people in the United States.\n  Congress first authorized and President Bush proclaimed the ``Decade \nof the Brain'' in 1990.\n  The growth in our knowledge of the brain over the last 5 years has \nexceeded anything we imagined.\n  Now at the midpoint of the decade, new discoveries about the brain \noffer unprecedented opportunities to both lower health care costs and \nimprove the quality of life for those suffering from brain disorders \nand diseases.\n  The cost of neurological and psychiatric disorders currently exceeds \n$300 billion a year.\n  Brain diseases account for more hospitalizations and more prolonged \ncare than almost all other diseases combined.\n  In the remaining 5 years of the decade, scientists are optimistic \nthat even more important advances will be made in brain research.\n  We must continue to make this research a funding priority, so as to \nreap the benefits of the groundbreaking work already underway.\n  Over 50 million Americans each year are affected by disease or \ndisorders of the brain and central nervous system.\n  Today 1 in 5 Americans is affected by brain disorders, and everyone \nover their lifetime will be affected either individually or because a \nmember of their family is afflicted.\n  The results are often devastating.\n  We have made great progress in the past several years.\n  For example the simple step of a women taking folic acid vitamin \nsupplements can prevent spina bifida, a disabling disease. This saves \nan enormous amount of pain and suffering for parents and children \nalike.\n  The medical cost for a child with spina bifida can exceed $500,000 a \nyear.\n  We have also discovered new medications for the treatment of \ndepression.\n  We have identified the genes responsible for Huntington's disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, and the familial form of Lou Gerhig's disease.\n  We have produced new medications for migraine headaches.\n  We have launched tests of new drugs to enhance recovery from stroke \nand spinal cord injury.\n  But there is much still to be accomplised.\n  Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and neurological \ndisorder among young Americans age 15 to 25.\n  Two million Americans a year suffer head injuries at a cost of more \nthan $25 billion a year.\n  Since 1990 scientists have found that the permanent harm from \ntraumatic brain injury increases with each hour and day after the \ninjury.\n  This produces a clear opportunity to develop powerful new emergency \ntreatments.\n  By the year 2000 effective therapies to limit brain damage now in \nhuman trials will be approved.\n  Increasingly sophisticated neuropro- tective strategies will be \nintroduced.\n  Alzheimer's disease may be the single most important area of societal \nneed for biomedical research, according to the National Academy on \nAging (June 1994).\n  Four million Americans a year and 20 million people worldwide are \naffected. The cost is more than $60 billion a year.\n  Since 1990 scientists have discovered three genes that contribute to \nAlzheimer's, identified key points where intervention might delay, or \nprevent it, and improved techniques for diagnosis.\n  By the year 2000 several new drugs will be identified as promising to \ninterfere with the progress of Alzheimer's in order to delay its \ndisabling symptoms for 5 years.\n  This would allow millions of people to remain living independent and \nfuller lives. The cost to the public would also be greatly decreased by \nthis step forward.\n  Therapies to reverse the damage by replenishing lost cells or adding \ncells should begin to alleviate the suffering of those already \naffected.\n  More than 500,000 people are affected annually by strokes with 3 \nmillion people disabled. This cost is about $25 billion a year.\n  Strokes are the Nation's third leading killer.\n  Many patients survive stroke. There has been great progress since \n1990. The number of strokes were reduced as some risks were clarified.\n  Doctors have adapted new preventive techniques.\n  New drugs have been developed for limiting and possibly preventing \nstroke damage.\n  One and a half million Americans are afflicted with Parkinson's \ndisease. The cost is about $6 billion a year.\n  This disease is a slow progressive degenerative brain disease. \nResearchers have developed innovative ways to pinpoint damaged nerve \ncells.\n  By the year 2000 at least one and possibly several major new drugs \nwill be in human trials.\n  Screening for Parkinson's is likely, and new gene therapy should be \navailable.\n  I will include in the Record at the end of my statement an article \nfrom the Philadelphia Inquirer written by Dr. Leon Cooper, the winner \nof the 1972 [[Page S7219]] Nobel Prize in physics, and James Watson, \nthe winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine for 1982.\n  The article further expands on the importance of this research.\n  I will also include a summary of recent brain research by the DANA \nAlliance.\n  I would like to urge my colleagues to support this resolution which \nwill ensure that this vital research is continued and that additional \nbreakthroughs become reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Dr. Cooper and the DANA \nAlliance summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          (By Leon N. Cooper)\n\n       The growth in our knowledge of the brain over the last five \n     years has exceeded anything we imagined when Congress first \n     authorized and President Bush proclaimed the ``Decade of the \n     Brain'' in 1990. Now at the midpoint of the decade, we are on \n     the threshold of a new era that holds great promise for \n     individual health and vitality.\n       For all three stages of life--early development, maturity \n     and aging--new and anticipated discoveries about the brain \n     offer unprecedented opportunities to relieve suffering, \n     improve the quality of life of those suffering neurological \n     and psychiatric disorders, and lower health-care costs.\n       The question today is whether or not the American public \n     through its elected representatives will continue to make \n     brain research a priority, so as to continue to reap the \n     benefits of the nation's spectacularly successful investment \n     in basic research.\n       Neurological and psychiatric disorders together account for \n     more hospitalization and more prolonged care than almost all \n     other diseases combined. Patient care and social spending \n     caused by brain-related disorders represent a \n     disproportionate amount of all health-care costs.\n       In part because of prior successes of medical research, we \n     have become very good at keeping people alive to older and \n     older ages by treating or preventing respiratory, \n     circulatory, reproductive and other assaults. But our aging \n     population presents increasing challenges to the health-care \n     system because of the vulnerability of the aging brain.\n       In the remaining five years of this decade, scientists are \n     optimistic that even more exciting advances will be made \n     across the broad front of brain research. Work just coming \n     off laboratory benches should enable us to intervene early in \n     or medicate some of today's incapacitating brain diseases and \n     disorders.\n       Brain-related disorders cost this country billions of \n     dollars per year for patient care, hospitalizations and loss \n     of savings. These costs could be significantly lowered if we \n     could effectively treat the disorders, some of which began at \n     or before birth and may last a lifetime.\n       A new report by the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives--an \n     organization of 135 neurosurgeons who champion research in \n     the field--offers a few examples of impressive gains in \n     various areas that we may see during the rest of this decade \n     if adequate support for research continues:\n       Childhood: More effective treatments for muscle spasticity \n     in cerebral palsy and the prevention of a significant \n     proportion of CP cases arising from low birthweight. The \n     development of new medications for schizophrenia. The \n     identification of several more genes that contribute to \n     inherited forms of blindness, deafness and mental \n     retardation.\n       Adulthood: New insights into the cause of multiple \n     sclerosis and the testing of new therapeutic approaches that \n     alter the natural course of the disease. Understanding the \n     molecules in the brain to which drugs of abuse bind should \n     make it possible to develop more effective cocaine-blocking \n     agents. Improved clinical care has already increased the \n     proportion of patients with spinal-cord injuries who are able \n     to return to their communities; this should continue and, in \n     time, lead to the first effective methods to repair the \n     injured spinal cord.\n       Later years: Our growing knowledge of genetics and \n     pathology of Alzheimer's disease should allow us to \n     rationally design drugs to treat the disease. Some of those \n     drugs may well be in clinical trials before the end of the \n     decade. A cell transplant therapy for Parkinson's disease \n     will probably emerge as a practical procedure for individuals \n     who do not respond to L-dopa treatment. New drugs that \n     increase resistance to brain-cell damage in cases of stroke \n     will be available and begin to be tested in clinical trials.\n       What do these advances hold for average Americans? The same \n     kind of hope and solace that members of Congress would wish \n     for their own families and for themselves.\n       Ask Sen. John Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) what it means to \n     watch the relentless destruction of a parent from Alzheimer's \n     disease or Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), who underwent \n     surgery for a brain tumor.\n       But it would be impossible to talk to all those members of \n     Congress who have known the heartbreak of substance abuse by \n     a family member, or the agony of manic-depressive illness, or \n     the frustration of children with learning disabilities, or \n     developmental disorders. They would tell you how they want \n     these agonies banished from their lives forever.\n       What all these illnesses and difficulties have in common is \n     that they all involve the brain, and only brain research can \n     unlock the secrets that will give those who suffer from these \n     disorders (and their families) some hope.\n       Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.), when announcing the \n     introduction of the ``Mo Udall Bill'' to fund Parkinson's \n     research, personally lamented the fact that federal dollars \n     for basic medical research are proposed to decrease in the \n     administration budget by more than a billion dollars by the \n     year 2000.\n       Is that the message to the research community--that what \n     has already been achieved in brain research, and what you are \n     confident of achieving in the near future is not a national \n     priority?\n       No one doubts that neuroscience's achievements to date are \n     just the vanguard of even greater discoveries to come. The \n     explosive growth of technology--particularly imaging--is \n     providing unprecedented insight into the brain.\n       The exciting developments in genetics will benefit brain \n     research perhaps more than any other area of medicine, since \n     about half of all our genes are involved in the development \n     and operation of our brain.\n       The message of the Dana Alliance report--to be presented in \n     Congress tormorrow--is one of opportunity and hope. What will \n     be Congress' message to the scienific community?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        DELIVERING RESULTS: A PROGRESS REPORT ON BRAIN RESEARCH\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The most important and productive medical research \n     happening today is the study of the brain. Since the Federal \n     government declared the Decade of the Brain in 1990, \n     researchers have solved some of the most stubborn riddles of \n     the brain, and have created and improved treatments for the \n     disorders that afflict it. The stunning progress of the last \n     five years gives future researchers a higher vantage point on \n     which to stand while scanning the horizon for cures.\n       How does this affect you? One in five Americans is \n     struggling with a brain-related problem at any given time; \n     each of us will face such a struggle at some time in our \n     lives. It may be pain, depression, memory loss, or one of the \n     many problems like these that can be chronic and recurring. \n     It may be swift, like head injury and stroke; or it could be \n     degenerative and fatal, like Alzheimer's and Huntington's \n     diseases. Or a lifetime of anguish could result from a child \n     or grandchild's battle with addiction or schizophrenia. Some \n     of these afflictions are life-ending; all of them are life-\n     diminishing. The cost in personal terms is beyond measure, in \n     hard economic terms, it is more than half a trillion dollars \n     a year.\n       But now, the human brain is no longer a ``black box''--the \n     misunderstood and mysterious source of self, its maladies \n     misdiagnosed and undertreated. Today, at the midpoint of the \n     Decade of the Brain, it is clear that a new era has begun for \n     individual health and vitality. For all three of the major \n     stages of life that you and your family will experience--\n     childhood, adulthood, and the later years--discoveries about \n     the brain's mechanisms, how it forms, grows and ages, how to \n     heal and strengthen it, are raising our expectations for \n     dealing with brain-related difficulties, giving you the \n     realistic chance to avoid suffering.\n       If your maternal grandmother died with dementia, the most \n     common symptom of Alzheimer's, should you worry that your \n     later years will be marred by this disease? Scientists are \n     discovering ways to find out. Also, by the time you reach the \n     average age of onset, these same scientists could be able to \n     fend off the disease.\n       The causes of cerebral palsy, retardation and learning \n     disabilities are being revealed, increasing the chances that \n     it will be possible to prevent these horrible conditions in \n     your own children.\n       The discovery of drug binding sites in the brain is \n     enabling researchers to work towards potential treatments for \n     addiction, so that the lure of drugs will be much less likely \n     to steal the youth, or the life, of someone you love.\n       Most of the brain afflictions that can severely alter your \n     life, by affecting you or someone close to you, are yielding \n     to researchers. For all those who cry, ``Why me?'' when they \n     are confronted with a brain disease, scientists are \n     approaching the day when they will be able to answer. As the \n     progress snowballs, and the discoveries come more quickly, \n     the likelihood of your life being destroyed by a neurological \n     ailment continues to shrink.\n       Beyond the personal aspects, our nation itself has a \n     massive stake in brain research. Today, neurological and \n     psychiatric disorders together account for more \n     hospitalizations and more prolonged care than almost all \n     other diseases combined. No surprise there: Over the last \n     hundred years, we got better at keeping people alive and \n     ambulatory as far as their respiratory, circulatory, \n     digestive and reproductive systems were concerned, but we \n     were stymied by the brain.\n       Now neuroscience is catching up. In the next five years, we \n     will help brain and nervous system patients in large numbers, \n     and because these patients number in the millions of people, \n     developments in brain science will transform our assumptions \n     in planning for the future. In particular, at the \n     [[Page S7220]] societal level, the view of crippling, \n     chronic, long term, and mental illnesses will be much \n     different.\n       When the expanding numbers of aging Americans have less to \n     fear from the brain diseases of aging, and when disorders \n     that begin at or before birth, and last a lifetime, are \n     progressively fewer and less disabling, then the lost work \n     days (by patients and those who care for them) will fall, and \n     leisure activities will rise. Reduced social spending, \n     decreased work absences and improved quality of life all give \n     relief to a troubled economy.\n       The achievements outlined in our report, however, are just \n     the vanguard of greater things to come. One of the most \n     significant facts about the progress we have made in brain \n     research is that more brain scientists today are working on \n     questions of basic science. This accounts for the diversity \n     of disorders we have been able to address in such a short \n     time. Clinicians focusing on specific diseases now have \n     better odds of finding the keys to the disorders they are \n     researching because there is so much more information to draw \n     upon.\n       That is precisely what makes brain research so exciting. We \n     understand it better each day. And because of that, we will \n     solve problems of affliction that have truncated our lives \n     since the dawn of humankind. Everything lying ahead of us is \n     opportunity and hope.\n       Here are some highlights of the progress report, and some \n     predictions for the next five years. Join us in celebrating \n     the hope offered for current and future victims of brain \n     disorders:\n                               childhood\n\n       Researchers believed that a major reduction of spasticity \n     in cerebral palsy and prevention of one-third of all CP cases \n     arising from low birthweight will occur within five years.\n       New findings point to a family of drugs that may correct \n     drug-induced developmental abnormalities in children.\n       Thanks to recent public health studies, psychiatry now \n     classifies schizophrenia as a developmental disorder, and \n     promises more effective medications by the year 2000.\n       Researchers identified genes that contribute to inherited \n     forms of blindness and deafness and several forms of mental \n     retardation, including the most common inherited form among \n     males (Fragile X Syndrome). Growing evidence suggests that \n     genes also play a role in learning disabilities and \n     schizophrenia.\n\n\n                               adulthood\n\n       The first drug to block craving in alcohol addiction--\n     Naltrexone--has recently been approved as an adjunct to \n     psychotherapy.\n       Success in treating depression now approaches 90% with more \n     precise antide- pressant drugs which avoid unwanted side \n     effects.\n       Obsessive-compulsive disorder has become treatable.\n       For the first time ever, researchers have identified a \n     treatment (and are testing another) which alters the natural \n     course of multiple sclerosis.\n       Researchers have identified the sites where drugs of abuse \n     bind in the brain, and by 2000 hope to have effective \n     cocaine-blocking agents.\n       Recent refinements to treatments leave many more epileptics \n     seizure-free.\n       Discovering serotonin-responsive proteins led researchers \n     to develop sumatriptan, an effective treatment for migraine \n     headaches.\n       Improved clinical care now returns some 94 percent of \n     patients with spinal cord injuries to their communities. \n     Researchers may have the first treatment to enhance spinal \n     cord repair by 1996.\n       Genetic research has identified specific genes that cause \n     Huntington's disease and familial Lou Gehrig's disease. New \n     findings show that genes may also play a role in addiction, \n     manic-depressive illness, depression and epilepsy.\n\n\n                            the later years\n\n       Several genes have been found that lead to Alzheimer's \n     disease. Cognex (tacrine), approved in 1994, is the first \n     drug for treating Alzheimer's symptoms. A combination of \n     genetic testing and position emission tomography (PET) \n     scanning may yield an early diagnostic test for Alzheimer's. \n     Also possible: an eye-drop diagnostic test and a spinal fluid \n     analysis test.\n       The first animal model of Alzheimer's disease (a transgenic \n     mouse) has recently been produced, and it is already being \n     used to test drugs to slow the progression of Alzheimer's.\n       An effective approach to gene therapy for Parkinson's \n     disease will emerge before 2000. Relief from Parkinson-like \n     symptoms has been achieved in monkeys using dopamine-\n     enhancing drugs.\n       A new bloodclot-dissolving drug can improve the outcome of \n     stroke, if administered within two hours of onset.\n       A chili pepper extract, capsaicin, now helps relieve \n     chronic pain (even in cancer). Within five years, scientists \n     expect to have developed non-addictive pain relievers.\n       Recently discovered proteins that nourish, repair and \n     promote the growth of nerve cells are leading to drugs (some \n     already in trials) that increase resistance to stroke.\n                               TECHNOLOGY\n\n     Imaging:\n\n       Now, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows \n     doctors to view the active brain, and at their desktops to \n     interactively scan entire brain structures.\n       Using charged Xenon gas, laboratory scientists improved MRI \n     signal strength by a factor of 10,000, producing more clearly \n     defined pictures in animals.\n\n     Disease models:\n\n       Scientists are working with living organisms in laboratory \n     settings to test compounds and find new directions for \n     investigation. Animal models available today include:\n       Alzheimer's disease\n       Developmental disorders\n       Several different forms of epilepsy\n       Multiple sclerosis\n       Pain\n       Traumatic brain injury\n\n\n                          SOURCES FOR NUMBERS\n\nThe Developing Brain\n       Developing Disorders (cost and patients): National \n     Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 1993.\n       Schizophrenia (patients): National Institute on Mental \n     Health, Update August 1993.\n       Schizophrenia (cost): NIMH, 1995.\nThe Mature Brain\n       Blindness/vision loss (cost and patient numbers): National \n     Eye Institute, 1994.\n       Deafness/hearing loss (patients): National Institute on \n     Deafness and Other Communicative Disorders, 1992.\n       Deafness/hearing loss (cost): Hallworth, R, et al. ``Hair \n     Cells and Hearing'' Press Conference, Society for \n     Neuroscience Annual Meeting October 26, 1992.\n       Depression (patients): National Institute on Mental Health, \n     Update August 1993.\n       Depression (cost): Rice, Dp and Miller, LS. ``The Economic \n     Burden of Affective Disorders'' Advances in Health Economics \n     and Health Services Research 1993.\nThe Aging Brain\n       Alzheimer's Disease (patient numbers): ``News Notes.'' \n     National Institute on Aging, 1989.\n       Alzheimer's Disease (cost): National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 1993.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I commend to the Senate the decade of the brain and urge \nthe Senate to become familiar with what is happening in this research \narea. My amendment merely assumes that we will continue this support, \nthis endeavor, the research of the decade of the brain in the last half \nof this decade as we have in the first. I ask that the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. EXON. I think the matter has been cleared on both sides. I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1129) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Under the previous arrangement, I believe the Senator from \nArkansas is finally ready to be recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1130\n  (Purpose: To strike the proposed change in the budget process rules \n  which would permit the scoring of revenue derived from the sale of \n                            federal assets)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I must say, sitting around here all \nevening waiting to offer an amendment can be a very frustrating \nexperience. I have concluded that this is no way to run a railroad. I \nhave watched this process now for 5 days and I have listened to a lot \nof powerful speeches. There are plenty of opportunities for press \nreleases back home proving that you are a budget deficit hawk.\n  But as a result of that, there are a lot of good amendments that are \nnot going to be debated because we are running out of time tomorrow. \nThis process should permit those people who have honest-to-goodness, \nlegitimate amendments to offer and debate them. We should have a lot \nless--in this case about 30 hours--of political speeches. When debate \non the budget resolution is complete, there are going to be a lot of \namendments, many of which that would have improved the budget \nresolution, that will fail because their proponents will not have had \ntime to present their case to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of a single amendment that has been \noffered on this side of the aisle that would increase the budget $1. We \nhave tried to rearrange some of the priorities, but we have not tried, \nand would not try, to torpedo the legitimate goal of trying to balance \nthe budget by the year 2002.\n  My own amendment, Mr. President, goes to a rule change that is \nproposed in the budget resolution that I think is disastrous. This \nproposed rule change involves the sale of assets that belong \n[[Page S7221]] to the United States, where the taxpayers get a one-time \nwindfall. The rule change would permit revenues derived from the sale \nof these assets to be scored for Budget Act purposes.\n  When I was Governor, we had revenue sharing. The Senator from \nKentucky seated here was Governor of his State at the same time I was, \nand the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee was \nGovernor of his State. Three Governors here on the floor tonight who \nserved together.\n  One morning I went to my office and there was a check on my desk for \n$21 million made out to Dale Bumpers. I told my aide, ``Call the \nairport, tell them we will be there in 15 minutes.'' And $21 million \nwas the first revenue-sharing check we got.\n  I sent it to the Arkansas Highway Department because I knew they \nwould use it for things that would only be a one-time shot. To put that \n$21 million into the operating budget would have been irresponsible. I \nknew revenue sharing at some time was going to end and I would have had \nto raise taxes to continue the services that we were providing with \nthat $21 million.\n  I do not believe there is a single Governor in the United States that \nwould take a one-shot windfall amount of money and put it into an \noperating budget. It is lunacy to do it.\n  In 1987, the U.S. Congress, under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings II, adopted \nthe proposition that revenue derived from asset sales would not be \nscored. In short, the rule was intended to prevent the use of asset \nsales for operations.\n  Since 1986, every budget resolution that has come to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and been adopted by both Houses of Congress said \nspecifically that revenue derived from asset sales could not be used to \noffset the deficit. In other words, revenue from asset sales could not \nbe scored.\n  Yet here we have a proposed budget which changes this long-time \nsensible rule and assumes the sale of a whole host of Government \nassets, including the Presidio, an Army base in San Francisco; the \nstrategic petroleum reserve, the Naval petroleum reserve; the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment would simply strike one section in \nthe budget resolution in order to restore the old rule which prohibits \nrevenue from asset sales to be scored.\n  Mr. President, I have no objection to asset sales per se. We sell \nassets all the time. My amendment does not suggest that we cannot sell \nan asset. However, it suggests we cannot come in here with a big \nplatter full of asset sales in order to balance the budget, where the \nSenate has not debated those items and simply say, ``Here's $4 billion \nin deficit reduction.'' The budget resolution assumes that we will sell \nthousands of barrels of oil we have in the strategic petroleum reserve. \nIt anticipates the sale of the Presidio in San Francisco, and that will \nnever fly because San Francisco has so many ordinances nobody would \ngive anything for it because it will never be able to be developed.\n  If the proposed change in these long-standing budget rules is \npermitted to take place, let me tell Members where we will be headed. \nFirst of all, every budget reconciliation bill that comes before this \nbody is going to have a whole host of asset sales.\n  We are going to have a national yard sale. National parks, wildlife \nrefuges, national forests, highways, power marketing administrations, \nwater projects--all up for sale in order to balance the budget.\n  Many asset sales do not even make financial sense. Assume we get $1 \nbillion for the sale of the power marketing administrations. We cut the \ndeficit $1 billion in 1996. If you assume that these assets, if \nretained under Federal ownership, would produce $100 million a year in \nrevenue, by the year 2020 we will have lost revenues of $2.5 billion in \nexchange for the one-shot deal in 1996. No businessman in his right \nmind would do such a thing.\n  Mr. President how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes and 50 seconds.\n  Will the Senator send the amendment to the desk?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Bradley, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Baucus, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1130.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike line 7 on page 76 through line 12 on page 77.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the House had a budget task force which \nrecently adopted a Heritage Foundation recommendation that we should \nkeep only those national parks and wilderness areas of national \nsignificance. It may be that the senior Senator from Alaska seated on \nthe floor and his junior colleague may decide that Denali is not of \nnational significance and throw it in the budget reconciliation bill--\nit would be gone.\n  If we are only going to keep national parks and wilderness areas of \nnational significance, who is going to decide that? Congress? It will \nbe very tough if the budget is in dire need of revenue and no one wants \nto raise taxes. Here is where we could wind up.\n  First of all, we could make the Grand Canyon available for sale. That \ncould be the first to go.\n  Then take Mount Rushmore. I have been out to Mount Rushmore. They \nhave a thriving number of visitors out there. I think we can probably \nput a McDonald's and maybe a Marriott there at Mount Rushmore. There is \nno telling what that place would bring.\n  After we get rid of Mount Rushmore and Grand Canyon, here is the \njewel, we would sell the Statue of Liberty.\n  Now, Mr. President, that all sound very humorous. There is absolutely \nno reason whatever under this budget resolution, which allows the \nscoring of revenue from the sale of national assets, to believe that \nsome things just as precious as the Statue of Liberty will not be put \non the auction block.\n  Last year I was Chairman of the National Parks Committee. I went out \nto see the Presidio. I had never seen it except at a distance. It is \none of the most remarkable pieces of property left in the United States \nand certainly the most remarkable piece of property left in an urban \narea. Here we have already put it up for sale. Who knows where we go \nafter that?\n  Mr. President, I have offered the Bumpers-Bradley-Murray amendment \nthis evening not only because the proposed rule change in the budget \nresolution would permit the sale of our national treasures, but because \nit is also bad economic policy, bad social policy and bad culture \npolicy. We ought not to do it. We have lived very well for 205 years \nwithout trying to balance the budget by selling assets.\n  Finally, my amendment does not alter the bottom line of the budget \nresolution one bit. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee would \nstill be required to find whatever amount of money the budget \nresolution instructs the Committee to find.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, again, you put this proposition to the \npeople of this country, Do you think we ought to start selling off \nwilderness areas, national forests, some of our treasured national \nparks? I can just see it now. You cannot see all the Grand Canyon from \nthe rim. We need a highway down through it so you can really enjoy it.\n  We need a new Holiday Inn down at the bottom of the Grand Canyon so \nwe can make more money.\n  These things are disastrous.\n  I hope a majority of the Senate tomorrow morning, when we vote on \nthis, will agree that this is a terrible, terrible change in budgeting. \nIt is a terrible change in national policy.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Washington, \nSenator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The budget resolution before us has been termed an historic document. \nIt certainly is. For the last decade, the Congress of the United States \nhas recognized that our public lands are too precious to sell unless \ntheir sale is in the best interest of the public. That is good policy \nand one that has enjoyed strong bi-partisan support.\n  But it is a new day. Today, we may well vote to sell our children's \nheritage to pay our debts. I reject that approach [[Page S7222]] to \ndebt reduction and I reject that approach to disposition of our Federal \nassets.\n  What is at risk? Potentially on the sale block are assets ranging \nfrom oil supplies beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; to \nbattlefields reminding us of the pain and sacrifice of the Civil War; \nto Power Marketing Associations that provide hydroelectric energy, \ntransportation, and resource protection; to endangered wildlife living \nin our National Wilderness Preservation System; to toll-free interstate \nhighways present in every State in the Nation; to public timber sold \nprimarily to small businesses dependent upon National Forests for their \nwood supply.\n  These assets should not be sold to reduce the deficit. And they, \ncertainly, should not be sold to provide a tax cut to wealthy \nAmericans. Instead, our Federal assets should be sold only when, after \nreasoned debate and a full public airing, we decide their sale is in \nthe best interest not only of this generation--but of every generation \nthat follows. We owe our children much more than a balanced budget. We \nowe them their heritage.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote first for Senator Bumper's amendment \nprecluding scoring of the sale of all Federal assets.\n  While I have the floor I want to just mention two other amendments I \nwill be offering tomorrow that my colleagues will be voting on.\n\n\n              sense of the senate resolution on impact aid\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, tomorrow I will send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate that the Federal \nGovernment should live up to its responsibility to educate the children \nof our women and men in uniform through the impact aid program.\n  At this point, I would like to ask unanimous consent to add my good \nfriend, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, as well as Senators \nPressler, Akaka, Hutchison, Levin, Bingaman, Pell, Dorgan, Baucus and \nKerrey of Nebraska as cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, you see, this amendment enjoys strong bipartisan \nsupport because the impact aid program is a vital component of the \neducation portfolio of 48 States.\n  It has strong support because Senators on both sides of the aisle \nknow how important this program is to their States and to the country.\n  More than 40 years ago, the Federal Government established the impact \naid program.\n  Forty years ago--great, forward-thinking legislators recognized that \nthe Federal Government has a responsibility to communities which have \nbeen adversely impacted by Federal activities.\n  Mr. President, this is exactly the underpinning of the legislation we \npassed earlier in this Congress. The unfunded mandates bill corrected a \nlarge-scale shift of costs from the Federal Government to the States \nand to local communities.\n  Impact aid is a good program for States--it lives up to the true \nspirit of local control of education.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not been living up to the \nspirit of the Impact Aid program.\n  Funding levels for impact aid have been so far below authorized \nlevels that we have unfairly shifted a large portion of funding for \nFederally connected students to local taxpayers.\n  The end result is that, now--in many States--this program covers less \nthan half of the costs to educate each student. The Federal Government \nhas just been shifting its responsibility to the States to make up the \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, when I review the last several years of funding and \nrescissions, I am outraged with the trend I see developing--we have \nbeen abandoning responsibility to our kids by cutting funds for this \nprogram.\n  And, there is no question that the importance of this program has \nincreased over its 40 year history.\n  Its importance has increased not just because it directly affects \nover 2 million students in our Nation--but also because of the tight \nbudgets facing our States today.\n  And, some States--such as my home state of Washington--do not rely \nupon an income tax for State funding. You see, Mr. President, the loss \nof property tax revenues makes State and local education funding even \nmore difficult.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to tell you about a school \ndistrict near Tacoma, WA--it's called Clover Park.\n  Fort Lewis is in the Clover Park school district. Women and men in \nuniform are assigned by the Federal Government to serve our Nation \nthere. And, their kids--like all American children--deserve to be \neducated.\n  They should not be abandoned because their parents live on Federal \nproperty.\n  Impact Aid makes up 7 percent of Clover Park's budget. In Clover \nPark, this money goes directly to the school district and is free of \nbureaucracy.\n  It provides basic support to the school district whose local school \nboard determines how to use the funds.\n  Now, Mr. President, if impact aid funds were cut off, school \ndistricts would have to increase taxes in the Tacoma community. Or, \nClover Park would have to cut teachers and close buildings. Or, the \nschools would have to double-shift students.\n  That is wrong. That is a total abdication of the Federal \nresponsibility to our kids.\n  Of course, we all recognize the budget constraints facing the Federal \nGovernment today.\n  I know tough choices must be made.\n  However, Mr. President, I believe we can achieve meaningful deficit \nreduction without passing on this huge unfunded mandate. And, without \ncompromising our responsibility to our schools and our communities.\n  Mr. President, I want to be sure that adequate resources are put into \nimpact aid. And, this sense-of-the-Senate reconfirms our commitment--on \nboth sides of the aisle--to making that happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to join our bipartisan coalition and support \nthis amendment.\n\n\n                      children's health insurance\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, tomorrow I will send an amendment to the \ndesk. My amendment is very straightforward.\n  It allows the Senate to think twice before we pass reforms to the \nMedicaid system that would result in more uninsured American children.\n  This amendment does not call for one dime of new spending. It is, by \ndefinition, revenue neutral.\n  This amendment simply creates a point of order against any \nlegislation which would cause children currently eligible to receive \nMedicaid to lose their health care benefits.\n  And, that point of order is easily waived by a simple majority vote.\n  Mr. President, as you know, this year, the Medicaid program covers \nhealth care services for over 36 million low-income Americans.\n  Close to half of those Americans are children. Children who have no \naccess to health care insurance on their own. Children with complex \nhealth care needs. And, children, I will say, Mr. President, who don't \nhave well financed lobbyists up here fighting for their interest.\n  Most of the children covered by Medicaid live in low-income, working \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about families who have to choose \nbetween putting food on the table, or getting health care treatment for \ntheir child.\n  I have visited Children's Hospital in Seattle many times.\n  Mr. President, I have witnessed first-hand the decisions these \nparents face.\n  A typical family on Medicaid is a young, happy family, whose life is \nsuddenly disrupted when they find out their child has been diagnosed \nwith cystic fibrosis or leukemia or severe asthma or cancer.\n  One parent has to quit his or her job to stay home and take care of \nthe child. On just one income, family finances become increasingly \ndifficult.\n  Soon the health insurance runs out, and the family is forced to spend \ndown to be able to receive Medicaid, just so their child can receive \ncritical medical attention.\n  The cost of care for the child will be passed along to the American \ntaxpayer. Doctor and hospitals will simply raise their rates. Insurance \ncompanies will do the same.\n  Everyone agrees that there are problems with the Medicaid system that \nneed fixing, and everyone agrees with the need to reduce the Federal \ndeficit.\n  But, I am concerned that we don't become lulled by the mantra of cut, \ncut, cut. [[Page S7223]] \n  As the Congress cuts spending, I just want to make sure we raise a \nred flag when children's health care is concerned.\n  Medicaid is every child's health insurance safety net.\n  My amendment just makes us think twice before we yank that safety net \naway.\n  You will hear some arguments against my amendment today, arguments \nthat--frankly--make little sense.\n  You will hear that this amendment is impeding deficit reduction, and \nimpeding the actions of the Senate.\n  On the contrary, the point of order in this amendment can be waived \nby a simple majority vote--just 50 votes.\n  We have points of order against the mandates of environmental laws--I \njust want to make sure we have a point of order to protect the most \nvulnerable of our population--our children.\n  You will also hear that this amendment says that we do not trust our \nGovernors to protect children when Medicaid is block granted. Trust?\n  Block grants, by definition, shift all responsibility to the States. \nIf any kind of emergency or disaster happens in a State, such as an \nearthquake in California or flooding in the Midwest.\n  I just want to make sure our overburdened Governors do not allow \nhealth care for our children to go by the wayside. This amendment \nsimply makes us think twice about children.\n  This is not a question of trust--it is a question of insurance. That \nis all.\n  Finally, Mr. President, you will hear that this issue will be dealt \nwith in the Finance Committee after the budget resolution is passed.\n  We listened to a prolonged debate this morning on the EITC--which \nwill also be a topic in the Finance Committee's deliberations. If today \nis a good day to talk about EITC, today is a good time to talk about \nchildren's health insurance.\n  Let me conclude with a few words about priorities.\n  When I offered this amendment in the Budget Committee, we were \nimmediately subjected to a lengthy diatribe by the other side that \nsounded more like Presidential campaign speeches than a statement about \nour children's health insurance.\n  That happens all too often. As soon as we talk about children, the \ndebate is trivialized. The discussion is kidnapped.\n  And, so, I stand here again today and ask--what better time is there \nto talk about the future of our children than during this historic \ndebate?\n  We need to know if actions we take here today will hurt our children.\n  My sincere goal with this amendment is to look out for the most \nvulnerable of our population.\n  I know they do not vote. I know they do not give money to political \ncampaigns. But they continue to get sick because their parents cannot \nafford to get them vaccinated.\n  Congress cannot turn its back on its children.\n  My amendment simply ensures that before Congress makes any changes to \nthe Medicaid system, we will take a hard, thoughtful look at the \npossible damage these changes will cause.\n  Let us put a little bit of conscience back into this budget.\n  Let us protect our future.\n  Let us protect our children.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join Budget Committee members on my side \nof the aisle and agree to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to take \n2 minutes from the time controlled by this Senator, to briefly speak on \nthe subject at hand.\n  I first would like to ask if the Senator from Arkansas has added me \nas a cosponsor to his amendment or not? If he has not, I would like to \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to add Senators Murray and \nBradley as my chief cosponsors, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator \nExon, Senator Wellstone, Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein--all as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I also ask unanimous consent I be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment just addressed that the Senator will be offering \ntomorrow, the Senator from Washington, with regard to impact aid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                           amendment no. 1130\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nBumpers to strike the changes made to the asset rule in the budget \nresolution. The recent push to sell off physical assets in an effort to \ngenerate short-term budget savings is not a wise move.\n  The asset rule was put in place in order to discourage these sorts of \nproposals which do not result in any structural decline of the deficit. \nIn fact, many of the recommendations included in this budget resolution \nwill not yield any budget savings over the long term.\n  The savings resulting from the selling off of physical assets in this \nresolution will end up generating only $3.5 billion in receipts over \nthe next 7 years. Many of these proposals end up costing the Government \nmoney in the out-years.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this \neffort to rid the use of this sort of budget gimmickry in an attempt to \nbalance the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe there is 10 minutes reserved on \nthis side. I yield myself 5 minutes to begin with.\n  Is there not 10 minutes reserved for this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am reminded of what President Reagan \nsaid once, ``Here we go again. Here we go again.''\n  I have just heard these speeches that sound as though this is \nsomething that has been dreamed up by this side of the aisle. The \nPresident requested this. Is the other side of the aisle going to \nabandon the President again? The President asked for $8 billion in his \nbudget. He specifically asked for this language. This language is the \nPresident's language.\n  What does it do? It allows scoring of the sales of assets that are \nalready authorized by law to be sold.\n  I would be ashamed to come here with pictures of places in this \ncountry that are loved by all citizens, and imply that anything in this \nbudget resolution will sell one national park or refuge. It is an \nauthorization to score the sale of assets. It is necessary to carry out \nthe President's budget. It is also a fact that people have used this \nbudget gimmickry to prevent the leasing of 1.5 million acres on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska, one of the last great deposits of oil and gas in \nthe United States, because it is considered to be the sale of an asset \nwhen it is leased.\n  The Arctic coastal plain must be authorized by law to be leased. It \nhas already been subject to three environmental studies. There is no \nopposition that I know of to the concept of the Mineral Leasing Act. \nThat law has already been passed. This land should be leased.\n  Oil and gas leases are called a sale under the concept of the Budget \nAct. And since you cannot score that sale, the act of leasing costs \nmoney and, guess what, that prevents us from proceeding to lease the \nland because you cannot score the money that comes in from the lease. \nBut it costs you money to lease it. An absurd conclusion.\n  The President came in and asked for a change in this law. He asked \nthat we change this in his budget this year and he assumed $8 billion \nin asset sales--that must be authorized by law--as part of that budget. \nI notice the picture of the Grand Canyon is right-side-up now, but even \nso the Grand Canyon, if someone wanted to propose to sell it, they \nwould have to come here and secure the passage of a law. The things the \nPresident wants to sell must be authorized by law to be sold. What we \nwant to lease in Alaska must be authorized by law to be leased. I never \nhave heard such a ludicrous argument in my life.\n  I have seen some of this stuff from the extreme environmental \norganizations that send this baloney all over the country and charge \npeople fantastic sums of money. They rival the AARP in terms of the way \nthey raise money and really convince people they are doing good when \nthey are really paying themselves and sending these stupid letters out \nthat imply that [[Page S7224]] somehow the President wants to sell the \nGrand Canyon. It is the President's language. It is not my language. It \nis not the Alaskan language. It is the President's request.\n  I cannot believe what I am hearing on the floor of the Senate. I \nreally cannot.\n  Why do you not recognize the income from the sale of assets? The \nlease of the Alaska oil reserve lands would bring in over $1.4 billion \nin a 4-year period. If it is leased that is money that comes into the \nFederal Treasury. It is not a sale. It is what is paid for the \nprivilege of producing oil and gas from Federal lands.\n  Somehow or other, people have assumed that there is something sort of \nseditious in this concept of the President's, that we are going to \ncount money that comes into the Treasury as money.\n  I have heard arguments on the floor of the Senate that embarrassed me \nbefore but I am embarrassed for those who offer this amendment.\n  In the first place, they attacked their own President, not us. In the \nsecond place, it makes no fiscal sense to say when we sell an asset \nthat produces billions, that we have to go out and borrow money in \norder to balance the budget because we cannot count that money that \ncomes into the Treasury--not in a budget sense. It is there in a \nphysical sense but it is just added to the Treasury. You cannot count \nit under these stupid budget rules that finally even the President of \nthe United States recognized are just that. They are stupid. It is time \nto change them. It is time for us to stop this Mickey Mouse business.\n  Look, a ``For Sale'' sign on the Statue of Liberty. Would the \nPresident suggest selling the Statue of Liberty? Have we suggested \nselling Mount Rushmore? My God, I really cannot believe the depth of \nthis argument, when it comes down to just say anything to scare people \nthroughout the country. ``We are going to sell the national parks.'' It \nis stupid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes off the time of \nthis Senator.\n  I would simply correct my friend from Alaska. The President of the \nUnited States, in his budget, suggested selective sales, including the \nPower Marketing Administration. This Senator and many on this side \nstrongly disagree with the President on the selling of the Power \nMarketing Administration.\n  We went down and had a meeting with him and we will fight that here \nand we will fight it all the way through this budget process. Certainly \nI think we can disagree. I believe the Senator from Arkansas made it \nvery clear in his remarks that he realizes we are not suggesting this, \nbut the main thing the Senator from Alaska is overlooking is the \nproposition in this budget changes the rules that could allow this to \nhappen. They cannot happen under the rules the way they are.\n  We objected to the President of the United States, our President, as \nyou say, doing that. And we certainly object to the Republican Budget \nCommittee going along in unison with the President of the United \nStates, which in and of itself is quite unusual.\n  We oppose your doing it. We opposed the President in doing it. And we \nhope we are alerting the Senate of the United States to this serious \nmistake.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator wish?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I am sorry, I thought the Senator was out of time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska misunderstands \nwhat this debate is about. It is not about what the President \nrecommended. I could not disagree with the President more. I went down \nto the White House and told him, along with the Senator from Nebraska \nand a host of others. This is bad policy and I told the President that. \nHe is my friend but that does not mean I have to agree with him on \neverything and he understands that better than anybody.\n  The fact that the President has proposed asset sales in his budget \ndoes not make it good policy. It is bad policy. I do not care who \nrecommended it.\n  The Senator from Alaska says he is embarrassed. He is embarrassed by \nthis amendment. What we are trying to do is to restore the law where it \nhas been for 10 years. I never heard the Senator from Alaska in the \nlast 10 years say under the budget rule not scoring assets was an \nembarrassment. Now it is an embarrassment. The Senator from Alaska is \nmy friend. He has been trying to get ANWR opened up for oil drilling \nsince, as we say, ``the memory of man runneth not.'' I am not for it, \nand I don't expect to be for it in the foreseeable future.\n  This resolution assumes that we are going to charge the oil companies \n$1.4 billion over the next 7 years for the right to drill in ANWR. What \ndo you do after the scoring period to make up for the lost oil after \nthe first 7 years? You are going to cut discretionary spending again.\n  The budget resolution assumes $1.4 billion from the sale of the power \nmarketing administrations. That is a bad proposition from a business \nstandpoint. No businessman in his right mind would decide whether to \nsell an asset by only considering the lost revenues associated with \nthat asset for a period of 7 years.\n  I will tell you something. If you are willing to sell the Presidio, \nthe Grand Canyon cannot be very far behind.\n  So, Mr. President, I plead with my colleagues not to buy into this \nidea that you can take these one-shot, one-time windfalls from the \nleasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the selling of the \nPresidio, the selling of these power marketing administrations.\n  As I said in the opening of my remarks, my amendment does not \npreclude asset sales. It simply says deal with them in the usual course \nof business and do not score them for budgeting purposes.\n  I am not only not embarrassed, I have never been prouder of an \namendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is it in order now, before using all of \nmy time, to ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Arkansas has 1 minute 48 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Out of the 5 minutes, I yield 3 minutes to Senator \nStevens from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put in the \nRecord section 5 of the President's bill indicating how he would treat \nthe proceeds from the sale of transfer of lands under his proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                proceeds\n\n       Sec. 5. Proceeds from a sale or transfer under this Act \n     shall be recited to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. \n     If the President so designates, the net proceeds shall be \n     included in the budget baseline required by the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and shall be \n     counted for the purposes of section 252 of that Act as an \n     offset to direct spending, notwithstanding section 257(e) of \n     that Act.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am embarrassed for the proponents of \nthis amendment. I am not embarrassed by the President. I think the \nPresident is trying to make some sense out of the Budget Act, and it is \ntime that we considered that.\n  This is an attack on a proceeding to lease the Alaska oil reserve. It \nis not standing up straight. It is a duplicitous amendment. It is an \namendment intended to kill the provision in the budget resolution that \nconsiders it a requirement of the Energy Committee to raise money. One \nof the ways they can raise that money is by bringing forth a bill to \nproceed to lease the one and one-half million acres on the Arctic \ncoastal plain that has a fantastic potential for oil and gas.\n  Furthermore, the Senator from Arkansas said, what happens in the next \nyear? Hopefully in the next year you [[Page S7225]] would discover oil. \nThe last time I remember people standing on this floor saying there is \nno oil was when we were considering legislation to allow leasing on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska, when they said that it would only produce about \n1 billion barrels at the most. Mind you, that would have been the \nlargest deposit on the North American continent. But, as a matter of \nfact, we have already produced 10 billion barrels. Ten billion barrels \ncame out of that bill that came before the Senate. The argument went \nfor days. Finally, the tie had to be broken by the Vice President of \nthe United States.\n  Now, we are in the same situation here. Mr. President, you are going \nto see more wildcats coming across this floor when ANWR is brought up \nthan anything you have here. They have more things they can warn the \npublic of. Look at that. They say we are trying to sell the Statue of \nLiberty. It is absolutely ludicrous again I say. I have never heard an \nargument stretched to that point.\n  This resolution does not authorize the sale of anything. All the \nPresident wants to do is count the money when it is authorized to lease \nor to sell something, and there already are a series of things \nauthorized. The President is going to send up a bill to authorize the \nfurther sale of some of the assets on the Presidio at Monterey in \nCalifornia. As a matter of fact, it has already been leased. Do you \nknow who it is leased to? Former Senator Cranston and the former leader \nof the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev. They have leases there in the \nPresidio already.\n  Now, when you look at it, all the President is saying is that in the \nprocess of acquiring money from the sale or lease of assets that are \nauthorized by law, we ought to count them in the budget process. This \namendment would deny the President that right. It would mean that he \ncould not count the $1.4 billion that will come in the first 4 years of \nthe leasing of ANWR.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from Alaska, my \namendment does not stop the leasing of ANWR. That is not what this \namendment is all about. You can go ahead and lease ANWR. But do not \nscore it in the budget. That has been the law of the land for 10 years.\n  All of a sudden we get this budget resolution presented to us and \nthey say we are going to change the rules. If you can get $2 billion \nfor Presidio, count it, score it. You have $4 billion in here, and next \nyear you may not have $4 billion in asset sales so you are going to \nhave to find it elsewhere. Why, I say to the Senator, you might even \nhave to pay royalties on hard rock mining next year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for just one question? We are \nclosing almost 50 bases in the United States. Why should we not count \nas income those portions of the bases we are going to sell? This \namendment would not allow that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is not a Governor in the United \nStates, including the person sitting in the chair at this moment, who \nis a former Governor, in my opinion, that will take an asset sale or \none-time windfall and put it into his operating budget. My amendment \ndoes not prohibit the sale of those bases. It just says, let's not \nchange the budget rules to mask the deficit by scoring the revenues \nderived from these asset sales.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Bumpers have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest there really are two arguments here. I \nthink the paramount one is to get rid of any authority that the Energy \nCommittee might have in its reconciliation instructions to direct that \nwe begin leasing of ANWR. While asset sales generally seem to be the \nsubject matter, I think that is the prime focus.\n  And let me suggest for a minute a bit of arrogance about the United \nStates, a bit of arrogance about those who think we can just continue \nto lock up our assets because we are so wealthy it does not matter. How \ndoes $180 billion worth of American assets called ``oil'' sound to \naverage Americans--$180 billion worth? We will buy it from other \ncountries because we think we are so strong, so powerful, so \neconomically self-sufficient we can just throw away our assets--$180 \nbillion.\n  Now, I know that people do not like to think of America as being \narrogant about anything; we are humble people. But I submit, Mr. \nPresident, it is arrogance to think that we can throw away $180 billion \nand say we will buy it from the Saudis. After all, it was only ours so \nwhy not just lock it up.\n  Now, if there was harm coming to ANWR, many who will vote against \nSenator Bumpers would vote with him. But that argument about how much \ndamage is going to be done there just will not play too much longer.\n  Now, let me make a second point. Let me make a second point on this \nissue. Mr. President, what happens if we fail to balance the budget and \nthe American dollar keeps coming down? Do you know what might happen, I \nsay to the Senator from Alaska? The Saudi Arabians may say, ``Pay us in \nyen.'' How does that strike you? ``We do not want your American \ndollars. They are not good enough.''\n  Mr. STEVENS. For oil.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For oil. Pay us in yen. We will pay them in yen and \nguess what will happen. Oil prices go up 300 percent in America.\n  Why should we not use our own rather than depend totally upon them?\n  I yield the floor, and if we have no remaining time, I assume we are \nfinished with this amendment and it will be appropriately stacked \ntomorrow by our leader.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7198-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7225-S7229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 RURAL HOUSING GUARANTEED LOAN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nwith respect to the rural housing guaranteed loan program.\n  In reviewing the report accompanying the Fiscal Year 1996 Concurrent \nBudget Resolution, I note that the Senate Budget Committee recommends \n``the reduction or elimination of certain subsidies provided by the \nfederal government for a range of credit programs in the Small Business \nAdministration, the Federal Housing Administration, and the Rural \nHousing and Community Development Service.'' Am I correct in \nunderstanding this to mean that the Budget Committee assumes no savings \nfrom the Rural Housing and Community Development Service's Section 502 \nunsubsidized guaranteed loan program over the next seven years?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Rhode Island is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President. I will oppose the Roth amendment which \ntakes a meat-ax approach to eliminating federal jobs. The \nadministration has made laudable progress by downsizing the government \nby more than a quarter of a million workers by the end of the year. \nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, careful evaluation, \nsystematic studies, and cost-benefit analyses have been used to shape a \nleaner more effective Federal workforce. Because it is not \nbased on such studies and analysis, the Roth amendment, by contrast, \ncould result in the slicing away of essential jobs, such as those \nneeded to get out the social security checks, staff the veterans' \nhospitals, or to protect federal facilities and workers from another \nterrorist incident. Also, the Roth amendment, according to its author, \nassumes the elimination of the Department of Commerce, an action with \nwhich I do not agree.\n                                  afdc\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I intend to propose an amendment that \nwill enable us to improve our welfare system rather than dismantle it. \nUnder my amendment, Aid to Families With Dependent Children will remain \na Federal entitlement program. [[Page S7226]] \n  The amendment I propose will, over 7 years, restore $55 billion to \nincome security programs, including Aid to Families With Dependent \nChildren, Supplemental Security Income and Unemployment Insurance under \nthe jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  My amendment is deficit neutral. It is financed by using part of the \nfiscal dividend that will accrue to the Federal Government if we \nbalance the budget.\n  The budget resolution reported out by the Senate Budget Committee \nreserves the fiscal dividend for tax cuts.\n  I fail to understand how we can justify tax cuts at the same time \nthat we are, for example: withdrawing the Federal guarantee of support \nfor dependent children; reducing government programs like Medicare and \nMedicaid by over 15 percent; and threatening an end to vital public \nservices through the elimination of subsidies for AMTRAK.\n  As I stated on introducing the Family Support Act of 1995 last \nThursday:\n\n       It is beyond belief that in the middle of the Great \n     Depression in the 1930's, we provided for children a minimum \n     benefit to keep them alive, and in the middle of a successful \n     1990's with a 7 trillion dollar economy we're going to take \n     that away.\n\n  Senators who have been following the subject of welfare policy will \nrecognize the bill I introduced last week as a successor to the Family \nSupport Act of 1988, which was adopted in\n this Chamber just this side of 7 years ago, on September 29, 1988, by \na vote of 96 to 1.\n\n  When President Ronald Reagan signed the bill in the Rose Garden on \nOctober 13, he thanked those who, as he said, shared the credit for \n``this landmark legislation'', including Senator Dole, Senator \nPackwood, and Senator Bentsen, as well as Representatives Rostenkowski, \nHank Brown, Michel, Frenzel, and Downey.\n  These members of Congress will be remembered, President Reagan said;\n\n     for accomplishing what many have attempted, but no one has \n     achieved in several decades: a meaningful redirection of our \n     welfare system.\n\n  It will seem unimaginable to us today, but the Family Support Act was \nnot a partisan political measure.\n  Together Republicans and Democrats passed a bill that was based \nlargely on what we had learned during the 1980's about how to get \nwelfare recipients into work. A number of States had used the \nflexibility we gave them in 1981 to do this, and there had been careful \nevaluation of their efforts. The Family Support Act of 1988 recognized \na mutual obligation. The Government would provide training and child \ncare, and help the parent find a job. But the parent had an obligation \nto do what was required.\n  The proposal that is envisaged in this budget resolution is vastly \ndifferent. It gives up entirely on a national commitment.\n  We have a problem in this country that we share with most of the rest \nof the western world, and that is the problem of the breakdown in \nfamily structure. As recently as 1960 the percentage of children born \nto single parents was about 5 percent. A manageable problem. It is now \nabout 33 percent. The same trend is happening in Canada. The out-of-\nwedlock birth rate in the United Kingdom and France exceeds 30 percent, \nvery close to ours.\n  And we do not know what to do about it.\n  Dr. Lawrence Mead, professor at New York University, now visiting \nprofessor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and\n International Affairs at Princeton, testified before the Finance \nCommittee on March 9 of this year. He asked:\n\n       Can the forces behind growing welfare be stemmed? \n     Conservative analysts say that unwed pregnancy is the \n     greatest evil in welfare, the cause not only of dependency \n     but other social ills. On all sides, people call for a \n     ``family policy'' that would solve this problem.\n       But we have no such policy. The great fact is that neither \n     policymakers nor researchers have found any incentive, \n     benefit, or other intervention that can do much to cut the \n     unwed pregnancy rate.\n\n  What we do know is that the program we enacted in 1988, the Job \nOpportunities and Basic Skills Training [JOBS] Program, can have a \nmodest, but important effect.\n  Dr. Mead told the committee that:\n\n       A tough JOBS program appears to be one reason why Wisconsin \n     has reduced its welfare rolls, despite generous welfare \n     benefits. Very likely, JOBS has operated to restrain welfare \n     growth nationwide.\n\n  Lawrence Townsend, Director of the Department of Public Social \nServices of Riverside County, CA, who runs what is recognized as one of \nthe most successful JOBS programs in the country, spoke to the Finance \nCommittee on March 20:\n\n     * * * of the importance of the existence of a Federally \n     mandated, properly focused, and adequately funded JOBS \n     program. If designed properly, the JOBS program can be one of \n     the best vehicles for assisting those who are AFDC-dependent \n     to successfully traverse the road to self sufficiency.\n\n  The Family Support Act of 1995 builds on what we know. Evaluation \nconfirms that the JOBS program works. As a result of evaluation we are \nlearning how programs can perform better, by increasing participation \nrequirements, and placing more emphasis on actual work.\n  States need more flexibility to test new policies. My bill allows \nStates to set their own rules for assets and to design their own rules \nfor eligibility for the Unemployed Parent program--welfare benefits for \n2-parent families. It says that a decision on a waiver will be made \nwithin 90 days.\n  And we can fulfill our obligations to our Nation's children and still \nbalance the budget in a reasonable timeframe if we eschew tax cuts.\n  Faced with a huge budget deficits I have consistently opposed tax \ncuts in any shape or form.\n  As I indicated 10 days ago on ``Meet the Press'':\n\n       I dropped (the President's) tax cut plan the moment I heard \n     about it.\n\n  I oppose the tax cuts advocated in the Contract for America. The \nContract for America's tax proposals were incorporated into the House \nbudget resolution--a resolution that would eliminate the Federal \nguarantee on AFDC for dependent children while providing funding for a \n7-year $354 billion tax cut.\n  And I am opposed to the tax cuts implicit in the budget resolution \nnow before the Senate. You may make the tax cuts appear costless by \nstipulating that tax reduction will be financed with the so-called \nfiscal dividend--estimated by CBO to be about $170 billion.\n  But why should the fiscal dividend be reserved for tax cuts?\n  Who can have a greater claim on our conscience than poor children. I \nam simply asking the Senate to adjust less than one-half of 1 percent \nof total spending provided for in the budget resolution in favor of \nimpoverished children. Have we really come to the point, at the close \nof the 20th century, when that is too much to ask?\n  In a series of speeches in February of this year I opposed the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I stated then, and \nstill believe, that we can and will balance the budget without a \nconstitutional requirement.\n  I noted the progress that had already been made as a result of a $500 \nbillion deficit reduction program enacted in 1993--enacted I might add \nwithout one Republican vote in either the Senate or the House. As a \nresult of deficit reduction measures enacted in 1993, the deficit has \ndeclined for three straight years--from $290 billion in fiscal year \n1992 to an estimated $175 billion for the current fiscal year.\n  Let us proceed with good cheer knowing that we can get a balanced \nbudget without ending an entitlement for dependent children.\n                         Medicare/Medicaid cuts\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this debate is about priorities, fairness \nand choices. We agree on the bottom line. We agree on balancing the \nbudget and bringing this deficit down. But we part company on how to \nget there.\n  I say we should get to the bottom line without putting our seniors, \nour students, our farmers, and our working families in the firing line.\n  I say we should choose quality health care for our seniors over \nunnecessary tax breaks for those who need it the least.\n  In the last couple of weeks I have heard my Republican friends say \nthat their budget resolution does not cut Medicare. They say, ``Only in \nWashington would someone say that reducing the rate of growth from 10 \nto 7.1 percent is a cut''.\n  Well, to this I respond with the following: Only in Washington would \nthey say to a senior citizen--We're not cutting your Medicare, just \nhand over $900 more out of your pocket each year to pay for \nit. [[Page S7227]] \n  But, while we're doing it--remember, it's not a cut.\n  Only in Washington would they propose the largest insurance rate hike \non senior citizens in our country's history, at the same time they hand \nover a new $20,000 tax break to those making over $350,000 a year.\n  But, remember, it's not a cut.\n  Only in Washington would we propose soaking our seniors while we \ncontinue to needlessly funnel billions into the bloated, wasteful \nPentagon.\n  But, remember, it's not a cut.\n  Mr. President, a constituent from Dubuque, Iowa hit the nail right on \nthe head when she wrote me last week. ``How can they reconcile these \ncuts,'' she said, ``and give tax cuts to the more affluent * * * \nmeanwhile nothing is being cut from the Pentagon.''\n  Today, we spend five times more on our military than all of our \npotential enemies combined. If you couple that with what our allies \nspend--today, we are outspending our enemies ten to one. The United \nStates and our allies spend about $510 billion a year. While our \npotential enemies spend about $54 billion combined.\n  And we can't find one thin dime to cut from the military? In fact, \nthis budget increases the Pentagon by $25 billion.\n  Mr. President, let us call this what it is. This is an assault on our \nsenior citizens. A $256 billion assault. By far, the largest Medicare \ncut in history.\n  We have a moral responsibility to bring down the deficit and balance \nthe budget. But it is morally wrong to promise a huge tax cut to the \nwealthy at the same time we ask seniors to take a cut in their health \ncare.\n  It is morally wrong to give a $20,000 gift to the wealthy while we \ncut benefits for seniors who live on less than $20,000 a year.\n  I hear a lot of talk about the Contract With America. What about our \nNation's contract with senior citizens? What about keeping that \ncommitment?\n  Medicare and Medicaid are a basic part of America's contract with \nseniors. And we ought not to break that contract to pay for a tax break \nto those who need it the least.\n  These cuts will hit Iowa particularly hard. Iowa ranks first in \npercent of citizens over age 85 and third nationally in percent of the \npopulation over age 65. The health care system in rural Iowa is already \non the critical list--we have too, few doctors, nurses and other health \ncare professionals and many of our rural hospitals are barely making \nit.\n  And, Iowa hospitals, doctors, and other health professionals depend \nheavily on Medicare payments. In some rural Iowa hospitals, as much as \n80 percent of total patient revenues come from the Medicare system.\n  Iowa hospitals are financially strained and 75 percent of all \nhospitals lost money on patient revenue in 1993. But, according to a \nrecent study conducted by Lewin-VHI, under the Republican plan, Iowa \nhospitals will lose on average $1,276 for each Medicare case in the \nyear 2000. And rural hospitals throughout the United States stand to \nlose $866 per case in the year 2000--Iowa rural hospitals will lose \neven more.\n  But rural hospitals are not the only ones to lose. As rural hospitals \ngo, so goes the rest of the health care system, so goes quality and \naccess to care provided to all Iowans, and so goes our rural economy.\n  If the hospital closes it often means that the doctor's office \ncloses, the pharmacy closes, and the nursing home goes. Pretty soon so \ndoes the local economy. It is a domino effect.\n  Listen to what a doctor in Sibley, IA, had to say:\n\n       In Sibley, we have a very viable, small rural hospital that \n     gives total patient care. We are able to manage most patients \n     efficiently and effectively. But with the proposed cuts in \n     Medicare that the current budget is envisioning, we can see \n     this as a terrible drain on our hospital's economy. The \n     proposed cuts would put our hospital in a losing situation. \n     Further cutting in the funding could certainly endanger the \n     existence of this hospital. In Sibley, the Osceola Community \n     Hospital is the only hospital in a 20-mile radius. This could \n     certainly be a hazard to the health of the general area.\n\n  But Medicare is not the only item on the hit list. What about \nMedicaid? What about long-term care?\n  Instead of improving the system, the Republicans are proposing a $175 \nbillion cut in Medicaid. That will deal a heavy blow to the 6 out of 10 \npeople in nursing homes who are receiving help from Medicaid.\n  These people have used up whatever savings they had before they \nqualified for Medicaid. They are hard working middle-class families \nthat, because of an illness in the family, have lost their life \nsavings.\n  They are not looking for an easy way out or handout. They continue to \nshare in the cost of their care--they use their Social Security and \npension income to pay as much of the bills as they can.\n  But the Republican budget resolution would cut an estimated $299 \nmillion in long-term care spending in Iowa through the year 2000--a \n15.3 percent cut in long-term care spending.\n  Under these cuts, an estimated 5,300 Iowans are expected to lose \ntheir eligibility for Medicaid long term care benefits in 1996--and \nthat could grow to 28,500 by the year 2000. That's a 48 percent \nreduction in the number of long-term care recipients by the year 2000.\n  I also hear a lot about our children in this budget debate. What \nabout kids? This budget resolution places the health care of millions \nof children at risk. Thirteen percent of Iowa's children are covered by \nMedicaid and many of these children are very sick or have severe \ndisabilities.\n  These cuts are going to hurt hard working Iowa families. Let me give \nyou just one example.\n  Deb and Doug live in Lake View, IA, and in 1982 their son Jon was \nborn en route to the hospital--2 months premature. Jon spent 6 weeks in \nintensive care in Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines. When Jon was \n9 months old he was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and severe \ndevelopmental delays. Today, Jon is doing great. He is growing up in \nrural Iowa with his dad, mom, and big brother.\n  Both Deb and Doug work--Doug during the day and Deb at night so one \nof them can always be home to care for Jon. But, Jon is able to stay \nhome because Medicaid help pays for Jon's health care and other \nservices that will help him become an independent working adult.\n  Deb says that Jon would not be the happy healthy kid he is today if \nit wasn't for the help he received through Medicaid. Under this budget \nresolution there are no guarantees that Jon, or others like him, will \ncontinue to received the health care services that he needs to live a \nfull life.\n  The budget resolution before us means that fewer children in working \nfamilies and children with severe disabilities will have access to \nhealth care. Last year, 82 percent of the people who lost their health \ncare coverage were children. Our children deserve a chance. Our \nchildren are our future and if we don't take care of them now we will \npay later--in lower productivity and greater health and education \ncosts.\n  Mr. President, I will end where I began. This is a debate about \nchoices and the future. The future for not just the next generation of \nchildren, but this generation, too.\n  Let us work to cut the deficit without cutting the future for \nseniors, working families, students, and kids. Let's make the right \nchoice.\n                           amendment no. 1123\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during my campaign, I promised the voters \nof Michigan to both oppose any effort to raise their taxes and to \nsupport badly needed tax cuts--especially for the hard working middle-\nclass families in our State. While not perfect, I intend to support the \namendment before the Senate because it first provides for a balanced \nbudget and also provides significant tax relief primarily targeted at \nAmerican families. Indeed, I plan to support any reasonable proposal \nfor middle-class family tax relief brought to the Senate until some \nform of family tax cut is adopted.\n  Although I support much in this amendment, there are certain \nprovisions which I would change given the opportunity. For example, \nwhile I support restraining the growth of mandatory spending, the \nunderlying resolution already slows the growth of Medicare as much as \nmost Governors are willing to support.\n  Furthermore, while I agree that it is possible to reduce \ndiscretionary spending further than the pending budget resolution \nprovides, I do not think it is advisable to do so on a proportionate \nacross-the-board basis. Rather, I believe additional program \neliminations [[Page S7228]] and consolidations in targeted areas is the \nproper course to follow.\n  Given these reservations, I intend to work to see that other spending \nreductions--focused primarily on corporate welfare--are used to help \npay for tax cuts in the event this amendment passes.\n  A final concern I have is with the overall distribution of benefits \nresulting from this amendment. I disagree with those who would set up a \nquota system for tax cuts, measuring the value of each provision by how \nuniformly it distributes its benefits. At the same time, it is easy to \nforget that it is middle-class Americans and their families who pay \nmost of the taxes the Federal Government consumes, and I believe they \nshould be the primary beneficiaries of tax cuts. Thus, if this \namendment or any other tax reduction proposal is adopted, I intend to \nwork with the Finance Committee to ensure that middle-class Americans \nare made the focus of any tax cut passed by the Senate this year.\n                            position on vote\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, due to an unfortunate miscommunication, \nmy vote on the Harkin amendment to restore education funding, which was \nthe second of two back-to-back amendments, was not recorded. There is \nno one in the Senate who is a stronger advocate for education programs \nthan I am, and I am disappointed that this error occurred. If it had \nbeen recorded, my vote would have been ``yea.''\n\n\n  raise taxes on working families to pay for tax cuts benefiting the \n                  wealthy? That's the Republican plan\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the Republican budget resolution, \nthere is only one explicit tax provision. It is not, as many Americans \nmight guess, a measure to provide tax relief. Rather, it is a tax \nincrease, and an egregious one at that. It is egregious because it \ntargets those on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, the families \nthat are working harder than ever and yet are still struggling to \nsupport themselves and their families.\n  This provision would reduce payments under the Earned Income Tax \nCredit [EITC] by $17 billion over 7 years. More than 12 million low-\nincome working families would see their tax bills go up by more than \n$1,500--and the money they have left over for food, housing, clothing \nand medical care go down.\n  Make no mistake, however. The Republicans do plan further action on \ntaxes. They plan to take the savings they achieve from cutting tax \ncredits to low-income working families, cutting education, cutting \nMedicare--and use those savings to fund a tax cut which will largely \nbenefit the wealthiest members of our society.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues have argued that they are not \nraising taxes on low-income workers, that they are merely reducing the \nrate of growth in the EITC program. This semantic exercise does not \nchange one simple fact--this budget resolution will mean fewer dollars \nin the pockets of these workers.\n  As we debate the proper level of funding for the earned income tax \ncredit, we should remember that the number we set will have a very real \nimpact on millions of American families and over 31,000 families in my \nState. I'd like to introduce you to two South Dakota families to \nillustrate my point.\n  Karen Olson and Paul Lovestrand are a married couple who live in \nRapid City, which is located in the western part of my home State. They \nhave three small children--aged 4 years, 2 years, and 7 months. Paul \nworks 60 hours per week as a baker at the Sixth Street Bakery and Deli, \nKaren works two part-time jobs--catering for the same deli and cleaning \na dentist's office.\n  Despite their hard work, Karen and Paul do not have any savings. They \nhave qualified for the EITC for the past 2 years, receiving $600 this \nyear. Karen and Paul relied on their EITC payment to cover the cost of \na needed plumbing job and a repair to the steps of their house that was \nrequired by their insurance company. Without the EITC, they would have \nhad to cut back in other areas to pay these repair bills.\n  Nancy and Ted Lewis also live in Rapid City. They are married with \ntwo small children--aged 3 years and 6 months. Both Nancy and Ted are \ncollege-educated, but they have had trouble finding work since moving \nto Rapid City nearly 3 years ago. Ted holds down two jobs--he teaches \nEnglish at Western Dakota Technical Institute and works at a sign-\nmaking store. Nancy is trained as an art teacher, but cannot find work \nthat would pay more than the cost of child care.\n  For the past 3 years, Nancy and Ted have qualified for the EITC, \nreceiving the maximum amount this year. They have relied on their EITC \npayments for major car repairs, children's clothing and overdue bills. \nThe EITC also allowed them to repay a loan they took out when Ted was \nbetween jobs and rent money was scarce.\n  Karen and Paul and Nancy and Ted are playing by the rules. They are \nworking hard and raising their children in a stable family environment. \nBut even though they are doing everything right, their wages are not \nhigh enough to provide for all of their families' needs.\n  For years, Democrats and Republicans have agreed that the Federal \nGovernment should give families like Karen and Paul's and Nancy and \nTed's a helping hand. By lessening their tax burden, the EITC makes it \na little easier for them to make ends meet. In other words, the EITC \nrewards those who choose work over welfare.\n  But now my Republican colleagues have decided that the EITC program \nis out of control and fraught with fraud and error. These excuses are \nbeing used to justify a cut in funds for the program that President \nRonald Reagan called ``the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the \nbest job creation measure to come out of the Congress.''\n  A quick look at these arguments shows they are without merit. First, \nthe program is not out of control because it is growing at the rate set \nby the Congress. In 1993, an expansion of the EITC was approved. Once \nthis expansion is fully phased in next year, the rate of growth level \nout so as to correspond to the rate of inflation and population growth. \nIndeed, the credit will decline as a percentage of GDP beginning in \n1997.\n  Second, the claims of some Senators that a whopping 35 to 45 percent \nof all EITC payments by the IRS are made erroneously are simply not \ntrue. It is true that an IRS study of 1,000 returns filed \nelectronically in January 1994 found that approximately 25 percent of \nthe EITC benefits claimed were in error. The IRS concluded that many of \nthese errors were unintentional but that some significant fraud also \nexisted.\n  What the critics will not tell you, however, is that the Clinton \nadministration has acted swiftly and aggressively to correct this \nproblem. Specifically, 12 measures to simplify the EITC and reduce \nerroneous or undeserved claims have already been adopted. The critics \nconveniently leave out another very important fact. The study that they \nrely on was conducted before any of the administration's anti-error \nprovisions were put in place.\n  Mr. President, there can be no justification for this rollback of the \nEITC, other than a desire on the part of my Republican colleagues to \nfind ways to pay for their tax cut plan, which will largely benefit the \nwealthy. Putting the burden of paying for that ill-advised plan on low-\nincome families is simply inexcusable.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, when I was elected to the Senate in \n1992, I came to Washington committed to taking bold action in order to \nbalance the Federal budget and eliminate the national debt. I knew that \nthe tough decisions necessary to reach these goals would require \ntremendous political courage by individual Members of Congress. Frankly \nMr. President, it was not until the Republican Party assumed control of \nthe Congress last November and Senator Domenici assumed the \nchairmanship of the Budget Committee that I began to see the sort of \ncourage necessary to put America's financial house in order.\n  Despite having control of the White House and both chambers of \nCongress from 1992 to 1994, the Democrat Party failed to offer a plan \nto balance the budget. Instead, President Clinton gave America its \nlargest tax increase ever and proposed a government takeover of health \ncare. This is just the type of behavior which voters have come to \nexpect from President Clinton. When faced with an impending financial \ndisaster his administration offered this [[Page S7229]] Nation higher \ntaxes and bigger government as the solution. Well, with the support of \nhis congressional allies, President Clinton got his tax increase, but \nhis big-government approach to health care crashed and sank on the \nrocks of old-fashioned American common sense.\n  That was the last Congress. What plan has the President offered \nduring the 104th Congress to balance the budget? In the words of \nSenator Dole, President Clinton has been AWOL on the budget--``absent \nwithout leadership.'' I just don't understand it. Every time that \nPresident Clinton stares a balanced budget in the eye, he blinks. \nFirst, he actively fought against the balanced budget amendment, and \nthen he refused to offer his own plan for bringing the Federal budget \ninto balance. Moreover, when his cabinet informed him that we are \nfacing an imminent Medicare crisis, the President did nothing. Perhaps, \nthat is what he does best: nothing.\n  When President Clinton does meekly act to fulfill his constitutional \nresponsibilities, such as proposing his own budget plan, even his own \nparty cuts and runs. Last week the Senate rejected the Clinton budget \nby a vote of 99 to 0. No one voted for the Clinton budget. No \nresponsible Member of Congress would dare vote for a budget which would \nhave increased the deficit from $176 billion this year to $276 billion \nin the year 2000 by which time we would have added $1.2 trillion to the \nnational debt. And yet this is what President Clinton proposed.\n  President Clinton may be content to sit in the Oval Office at the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue and blithely ignore the current budget \ncrisis and the daily mounting debt, but I for one did not leave 45 \nyears of hard work in the private sector to come\n to Washington and turn a blind-eye to our Nation's fundamental \nproblem. That is why I have come to the Senate floor today to assure my \ncolleagues that I am wholeheartedly committed to working with them to \nbalance the budget, and go beyond that to paying down the principal on \nour $4.7 trillion national debt.\n\n  A child born today would have to pay $187,500 over his or her \nlifetime just to pay interest on the national debt. For those concerned \nabout the impact of the proposed budget on children, this per child \ncost imposed by the national debt should be the real focus of our \nconcern for children.\n  We all know that the steps necessary to balance the budget will not \nbe easy. It will require each of us to summon up the courage to cut or \neliminate government programs which in times of a budget surplus we \nmight otherwise support.\n  I recognize that such questions about government programs are \ndifficult, but as the national debt continues to grow out-of-control at \na rate of $20 million per hour, the questions only become more \ndifficult. That is why last week I introduced a welfare reform bill \nwhich addresses the root causes of welfare dependency and runaway \nwelfare costs. It is also why I agreed to co-chair the Senate Task \nForce on the elimination of federal agencies which today will announce \nplans for abolishing the Department of Commerce. Plans for eliminating \nthe Departments of HUD, Energy and Education are in the offing.\n  We must not lack the courage to act together to take bold actions \nsuch as limiting the growth in welfare spending, abolishing unnecessary \nagencies, and reforming Medicare. To do otherwise, will be to tell our \nchildren and grandchildren that the generation which fought and won \nWorld War II and the cold war has now chosen to abdicate its \ngenerational responsibility. A legacy of debt is grossly inconsistent \nwith the self-reliant pioneer values which have built this great nation \nand made it the world's lone superpower.\n  When debate time on the budget resolution has expired and the time \nfor voting occurs, the eyes of the world and our children will be \nfocused on the United States Senate. They will wait to see whether, \nlike the House of Representatives, Members of the Senate possess the \ncourage and vision to support a resolution which provides for a \nbalanced budget.\n  We have already seen the reaction of the world's financial markets \nwhen the balanced budget amendment died in this Chamber not long ago. \nIf we repeat that profile in cowardice we will no doubt reap the \nwhirlwind. We will signal to the rest of the world and more importantly \nto our children that nothing has changed in Washington--the business as \nusual spending spree continues and we have no intention whatsoever to \nmake serious spending cuts.\n  I commend Chairman Domenici for his outstanding leadership in \ndrafting a long overdue plan to end our Nation's experiment with fiscal \nirresponsibility. In my short career in the Senate, I can think of no \nvote more important than this one. Our votes on this budget resolution \nwill clearly define where each of us stands on the most important issue \nfacing our Nation. I intend to stand with those who want to balance the \nbudget by 2002. I intend to stand with those who believe that America's \nfamilies are desperately in need of tax relief.\n  The people of North Carolina who sent me here expect and deserve no \nless.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOSEPH W. CORNELISON\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication, public \nservice, and patriotism of Col. Joseph W. Cornelison, U.S. Army, on the \noccasion of his retirement after 26 years of faithful service to our \nNation. Colonel Cornelison's strong commitment to excellence will leave \na lasting impact on the vitality of our modern war fighters, commanding \nadmiration and respect from his military colleagues and Members of \nCongress.\n  Colonel Cornelison, a 1969 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, is \nserving his last day of a 21 month assignment as the special assistant \nfor Environment and Installations, Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Legislative Affairs.\n  He holds a master's degree in public service from Western Kentucky \nUniversity, and has his juris doctorate from Georgetown University Law \nCenter.\n  From April 1970 to August 1971, Colonel Cornelison was a forward \nobserver, fire direction officer, and artillery liaison officer, 173d \nAirborne Brigade, Republic of Vietnam. He ensured the effective \ndelivery of direct artillery support to an infantry unit in combat. He \nthen served as battery commander, assistant division personnel officer \nand assistant battalion operations officer for 101st Airborne Division \n[Air Assault] in Fort Campbell, KY. As commander, he conducted a \ntactical standdown of a field artillery battery in Vietnam and \nredeployed its personnel and equipment to the United States. In the \npersonnel position, was a key player in the assignment of several \nhundred officers and undertook review of an array of regulatory \nrequirements to identify those that could be eliminated because of \nredundancy, obsolescence or insufficient value. He also organized and \nexecuted an advanced training program for newly assigned personnel.\n  From August 1977 to July 1978, Colonel Cornelison was the law clerk \nto the Hon. Oliver Gasch, judge of U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia. He assisted the judge in management of his civil docket \nwhich included hearings, researching and briefing issues and drafting \nopinions. He then served as trial counsel, chief of administrative law, \nand officer-in-charge of Bamberg Branch Office for the 1st Armored \nDivision in the Federal Republic of Germany. In these three positions, \nhe progressed from serving as prosecutor in criminal trials to \nproviding legal support on issues associated with command to serving as \ncity counsel to a major military community.\n  Colonel Cornelison went to serve as assistant to the General Counsel, \nOffice of the Secretary of the Army, Headquarters, Department of the \nArmy, Washington, DC from June 1982 to December 1983. He developed \nimprovements to debarment and suspension procedures and increasing \nemphasis on [[Page S7230]] contract fraud discovery and avoidance. He \ncontributed to studies of spare parts procurement and of ways to \nimprove contracting for major weapons. His next position was as chief, \nSpecial Litigation Branch (Environmental), Office of the Judge Advocate \nGeneral, Washington, DC from December 1983 to January 1985. He \norganized a team of five attorneys and two engineers to assist \nDepartment of Justice in a lawsuit filed against Shell Oil under the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. \nHe then served as General Counsel [SJA] for U.S. Army South and Joint \nTask Force Panama from July 1985 to June 1989. He managed the delivery \nof all legal services within the command.\n  Colonel Cornelison's next assignment was as special counsel to the \nAssistant Attorney General (Civil Division) for Department of Justice \nfrom July 1989 to June 1990. He was selected to serve in this capacity \nunder a fellowship through the Army War College. He represented DOJ on \nan interagency group responsible for implementing a Presidential \nexecutive order calling for a drug-free, Federal workplace, serving as \nliaison to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, and advising on \nsettlement of litigation. He served as chief, Environmental Law \nDivision, Office of the Judge Advocate General for the Department of \nthe Army from June 1990 to March 1991. He managed the Army's \nenvironmental litigation and provided legal advice to the Army staff \nand executed the Army's environmental program. From March 1991 to \nSeptember 1993, he was executive to the Judge Advocate General for the \nDepartment of the Army. Served as personal advisor and executive \nassistant to the Army's senior military lawyer. He managed an office of \n74 lawyers and 47 support personnel, $3,000,000 budget, and assisted in \nproviding legal support to the Army worldwide.\n  Colonel Cornelison currently is serving as assistant for \nInstallations and Environment, Office of the Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Legislative Affairs. He serves as a liaison between \nCongress and the Office of the Secretary of Defense and as an advocate \nof the Department's legislative program.\n  Our Nation, the U.S. Army, his wife Ella and his family, can truly be \nproud of the Colonel's many accomplishments. A man of his extraordinary \ntalent and integrity is rare indeed. While his honorable service will \nbe genuinely missed in the Department of Defense, it gives me great \npleasure to recognize Col. Joseph Cornelison before my colleagues and \nwish him all of our best wishes in his new and exciting career.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7229-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOUIS HURWITZ\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to \nLouis Hurwitz of Sioux Falls, SD, on his retirement after 57 years as \nexecutive secretary of the Sioux Falls Jewish Welfare Fund, a branch of \nthe United Jewish Appeal. His tireless efforts in assisting the \neducation, well-being, and happiness of countless Jewish refugees \nworldwide is admirable.\n  To understand the depth of Lou's love for and dedication to the \nhappiness of others, one need only review his constant involvement in \nand uncommon generosity to the Sioux Falls community. His persistently \npositive impact on others and his continuous commitment to making a \ndifference cannot be overstated. For six decades, Lou has been \nrecognized repeatedly for his hard work on behalf of the Sioux Falls \ncommunity. His efforts in reaching across religious lines to work with \npersons of all faiths deservedly has earned the respect and affection \nof many people, including myself. I extend my sincere gratitude and \nappreciation to Lou Hurwitz for his selfless service to the people of \nSouth Dakota, the Sioux Falls Jewish community, and thousands of others \nelsewhere.\n  Mr. President, Lou's extraordinary dedication to helping others \nmirrors the teachings of the Hebrew scholar, Maimonides. According to \nthe teachings of Maimonides, the highest level of charity is to enable \nother human beings to help themselves. I am proud of Lou's efforts in \nthat regard. He has enabled countless Jewish refugees around the world \nto become stronger. I congratulate Lou for all he has accomplished. He \nhas left a legacy that always will be a source of pride to all South \nDakotans. I join with Lou's friends and family members in wishing this \nextraordinary man the very best in all he has yet to achieve.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7230-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the impression simply will not go away: \nToday's $4.8 trillion Federal debt is a grotesque parallel to the \nenergizer bunny we see, and see, and see on television. The Federal \ndebt keeps going and going and going--up, of course--always to the \nadded misery of the American taxpayers.\n  So many politicians talk a good game--when, that is, they go home to \ntalk--and ``talk'' is the operative word--about bringing Federal \ndeficits and the Federal debt under control.\n  But, sad to say, so many of these very same politicians have \nregularly voted for one bloated spending bill after another during the \n103d Congress and before. Come to think about it, this may have been a \nprimary factor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators as a result of \nlast November's elections.\n  In any event, Mr. President, as of yesterday, Monday, May 22, at the \nclose of business, the total Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at \nexactly $4,883,843,317,167.73 or $18,539.15 per man, woman, child on a \nper capita basis. Res ipsa loquitu.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7230-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7230-S7231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair very much.\n  I think we have had some tremendous debate on the whole issue of the \nbudget. We have heard people say, yes, there is enough that has been \ntaken out or added or there is too much.\n  The fact is that on this budget debate, whether or not we should \nbalance the budget, if we follow the status quo, which is by far the \neasier thing to do today, because we will not have to make the tough \nvotes if we follow the status quo that we have been on for so many \nyears--the fact is if we follow that status quo, we will lose this \ncountry.\n  The spirited, the polite, partisan debate that we have had during the \ncourse of this discussion will give way if we pursue the status quo to \nan absolute crisis situation. Shock waves will be sent throughout the \nworld if in fact the United States reaches that point of financial \ncollapse. And in that situation, Mr. President, as you well know, there \nwill not be a United States to bail us out.\n  The last balanced budget was 1969. I was a junior in high school in \n1969. Now, I can tell you that was not that long ago. I can relate back \nto that. I now have a daughter who next year will be a junior in high \nschool. So you see, it has been a generation since we have had a \nbalanced budget.\n  In high school, the last thing that I ever thought about as a high \nschool student was a balanced national budget. It just did not cross my \nmind, and yet at that time, we had a balanced budget.\n  But $5 trillion later, I wished that the adults of that era would \nhave realized what should have been done--$5 trillion later. Now I am \nthe father of two great kids, Heather and Jeff. Next year they will \nboth be in high school. But the difference between their being in high \nschool and when I was in high school is that they now will owe, as \nevery other American in this country will owe, $19,000 on the national \ndebt, and they did not do anything wrong except to inherit this $5 \ntrillion debt.\n  In the State of Idaho, the State law requires that we must have a \nbalanced budget every year, and in the same world that our Federal \nGovernment operates today in its red ink, Republican Gov. Phil Batt \ngave the people of Idaho a $40 million property tax relief. The fact of \nthe matter was, it was their money, just as it is the money of the \npeople of America that we are talking about. It is not the Government's \nmoney.\n  So we owe it to our kids to deal with this issue, and we owe it to \nour parents to deal with this issue, our parents who came through the \nrecession and the Depression and tell us the stories of that \n[[Page S7232]] and how it made it very clear to them: You do not live \nbeyond your means. You just do not do that.\n  The interest payments on the national debt are the third largest part \nof the budget. And the interest payments do not buy a single school \nlunch, and they do not buy a single road and they do not make a single \npayment on a Medicare bill.\n  The national debt rises $355,000 every minute. In 1 second, $6,000--\njust now. That is how fast this is growing.\n  All of this talk about budget cuts, a budget cut in Washington means \nsomething very different than a budget cut in Idaho. In the Nation's \nCapital, when a Government program asks for a 5 percent budget \nincrease, and it is only granted a 3 percent budget increase, we do not \ncall that a cut. That is an increase. But that is not how Washington, \nDC, deals with it. We are simply slowing the growth. The budget package \nthat I am backing will bring us a balanced budget over the next 7 years \nby holding the growth of Government spending to around 3 percent a \nyear.\n  What about Social Security and Medicare? Well, we do not touch the \nSocial Security pension trust fund, and we should not because it is not \nthe problem. Medicare, on the other hand, must be fixed. The trustees \nsay that it will be bankrupt in 7 years if the escalating growth is not \nstopped.\n  When you think about that, if you are now 55 years old after spending \na lifetime paying Medicare taxes, there is no assurance that there will \nbe enough money to pay doctor bills when you become eligible. That is \nunacceptable, and that is why we are going to deal with that in this \nbudget.\n  The next tough issue is taxes. I oppose tax increases, but what about \ntax cuts? I will support tax cuts that meet these tests. First, they \nmust not slow the effort to balance the budget. And second, they must \nencourage investment, help families with children, help small business, \nencourage savings that will pay for college, care for the elderly and \nthe purchase of first homes.\n  I will just conclude by saying that after all of this discussion, I \nthink we need to realize that what we are talking about is the money of \nthe American citizen. Again, not the Government's money. It is time \nthat we start leaving more of the American citizen's money with the \ncitizen and not the Government.\n  This 104th Congress, I think, will go down in history as that session \nof Congress that finally stopped the financial decline which would lead \nto the ruin of this country and will return it to a financial stability \nthat we will look back to with a great deal of pride some day.\n  Yes, we have some real tough votes that are facing us. But what \nIdahoans tell me is that we absolutely must balance the Nation's budget \nand we must do it by making it an evenhanded approach so that we can \nlook and see that our neighbors also are taking part in the sacrifice. \nAs long as all of us are sharing in this, this is absolutely the right \nthing to do for this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Pete Domenici and all the \nmembers of the Budget Committee that has brought us this budget \nresolution which is going to put us on that course so that we will have \nfinancial stability, so that the greatest nation in the world can look \nwith pride to know that its future will be bright, that we will avoid \nthat financial collapse we have been headed toward and, again, that all \nMembers of this 104th Congress will know that some day we will be \njudged as that Congress that did the right thing by action and not \nrhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7231-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GETTING THE BUDGET UNDER CONTROL\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would just like to say to my friend from \nIdaho, I appreciate his remarks on the reasons for getting the budget \nunder control and the historic nature of this undertaking. I, too, \nalthough I certainly do not agree with everything in the budget \nresolution and I have supported a number of amendments and will support \nothers tomorrow, I, too, want to add my thanks and congratulations to \nSenator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and others on \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Exon and all who worked so long and hard, \ndisagreeing often, but coming out with this budget resolution that at \nleast is a beginning point in the debate for the road we must travel.\n  It is my hope that I will be able to support this resolution in the \nfinal analysis. It will depend on what amendments are adopted or not \nadopted tomorrow. But I certainly hope that I will be able to support \nit. It is my hope that when it goes to conference, the conference will \nlook carefully at what the Senate did today in turning down the very \nlarge tax cuts that were proposed by the Senator from Texas. All of us \nwould like tax cuts, all of us would like to return that money to the \nAmerican people because it is their money, but I think the public \noverwhelmingly that I represent wants us to get the budget under \ncontrol and does not want us to take steps that will make that more and \nmore difficult.\n  We all know that there is going to be group after group coming here \nthis summer that are going to be complaining about budget cuts, many of \nthem with justification because they are going to be impacted. We all \nknow that after that process starts, it is more likely there is going \nto be fallback in this regard. We all know that we need a reserve fund \nbecause we are going to have difficulties in implementation based on \nany historical examination.\n  So it is my hope that when the conference takes place, that the \nmessage, by a strong vote from the U.S. Senate, to concentrate on \ndeficit reduction and wait until we have really accomplished that \nbefore declaring a dividend I hope sinks in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7232-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7232-S7233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF LES ASPIN\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the death of my \nclose friend and colleague, Les Aspin. Many of us in this body have \nknown Les for many, many, many years and worked very closely with him.\n  Les Aspin devoted his life to public service. In his younger years, \nhe served in the Senate on the staff of our former colleague, Senator \nWilliam Proxmire. He also served as staff assistant to Walter Heller, \nthe former Chairman of President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers \nand on the staff of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.\n  Les Aspin was elected to the House of Representatives in 1970, and he \nimmediately sought and was granted membership on the House Armed \nServices Committee on which he later served as chairman from 1985 \nthrough 1992.\n  I had the great honor and privilege of working with Les since I came \nto the Senate in 1973. From 1987 through 1992, we served respectively \nas chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. During \nthat time, when our chairmanships overlapped, we developed a close \npersonal and professional relationship, and we forged six National \nDefense Authorization Acts during that period.\n  Mr. President, these years were marked by national defense challenges \nof great difficulty and complexity. In 1987, the cold war had begun to \nthaw, but barely so. There were many divisions in Congress on national \ndefense issues, ranging from the size of the defense budget to the \nprocurement of particular weapons systems to the appropriate course of \nnational strategy. At a time when many sought substantial reductions in \nnational defense commitments and programs, Les Aspin provided a voice \nfor a strong national security and a sensible American foreign policy.\n  As the former Soviet Union collapsed, many sought to rapidly \ndismantle our military establishment. Les Aspin recognized the \ncontinuing dangers facing the United States and successfully led the \nHouse of Representatives in support of a measured defense builddown, \nwhich was designed to maintain our military capacity in an era of \ndefense reductions. Les was a particularly forceful advocate for \ndefense conversion and retraining programs designed to assist military \npersonnel, civilian workers, and the defense industry in adjusting to a \nnew era with new challenges.\n  Les was also both an originator and strong supporter in the House, \nand as Secretary of Defense, of the program [[Page S7233]] that is \nknown as the Nunn-Lugar program that works for nuclear and chemical \ndismantlement in the former Soviet Union that has been so effective in \nhelping denuclearize three former nuclear states and also helped in \ndismantling both chemical and nuclear weapons. We have a long way to go \nin that regard, but Les Aspin was on board when that ship was launched, \nwhich is probably our most important national security challenge--that \nis, nonproliferation in the breakup of the Soviet empire.\n  During this entire period, I developed tremendous respect for the \nbreadth of Les Aspin's knowledge and his devotion to the cause of \nnational defense. Les was a brilliant analyst, but he was more than a \nscholar; he was an outstanding legislator and a master at putting \ntogether coalitions in the House of Representatives during a very tough \nperiod of time for national security.\n  I will always treasure the memories of working with Les on the House-\nSenate conferences on the National Defense Authorization Act that were \nenacted during the period in which we chaired our respective \ncommittees. The challenge of crafting a conference agreement was always \ndaunting in the contentious atmosphere of the cold war and post-cold-\nwar eras. Each year, hundreds of language and funding differences \ndivided the two Houses--and we were continually faced with the threat \nof a veto over controversial issues such as the ABM Treaty, abortion, \nand prerogatives of the executive branch.\n  Les and I talked on the telephone and met very frequently, not just \nduring conference but also in the months before we passed either the \nHouse or Senate bill. These meetings were quiet and unpublicized, but \nthey enabled us to shape bills in both the House and the Senate which \ncould be reconciled in conference and also signed into law by a \nRepublican President.\n  Much as I appreciated and admired Les Aspin's policy and legislative \nskills, what I enjoyed most about Les was his sense of humor. \nFrequently, when a conference point reached its most critical point, we \ncould count on a story from Les to break the tension and produce a \nbipartisan compromise. Nobody loved a joke more than Les Aspin, and I \ncan still see that big grin on his face laughing heartily in the middle \nof a conference right at a crucial moment, which gave us the kind of \nbalance, the kind of sense of priorities to understand that it was our \njob to reconcile our differences and to come to conclusions in the \ninterest of national security. He never lost sight of the serious \npolicy issues that confronted us, but he never got personal in his \nfervent support for one position or another.\n  Les Aspin served as Secretary of Defense during a particularly \ndifficult time. I enjoyed working very closely with him and his staff \nduring his tenure as Secretary of Defense. Lacking a cold war enemy and \na national consensus on defense issues, Les was faced with the \nextraordinary challenges of managing a defense builddown while \nretaining essential military capabilities. The complex and new \ninternational circumstances surrounding events in places such as the \nformer Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Haiti added to the complexity of his \ntask. Throughout this period, he continued to work diligently toward \nbuilding a new foundation for our defense needs in the 21st century. \nAnd as Secretary of Defense, he laid a foundation for the defense \ndrawdown that hopefully will avoid the mistakes of the past. At least \nhe did his part.\n  During his years of service as a Member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee and as Secretary of Defense, Les continually fought for a \nstrong, well-equipped, and affordable national security. He was always \non the cutting edge of national defense policy during both the cold war \nand during the post-cold-war builddown. His creative approaches to \nnational strategy, acquisition policies, and defense budget matters \nhave made a lasting and indelible contribution to this Nation's \nsecurity.\n  After his service as Secretary of Defense, he continued to serve our \nNation as chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard, as chairman to the Commission on Intelligence, and as a member \nof the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces. It was in \nthis capacity that I last talked to him on the telephone at length \nabout some of the aspirations he had for changing our intelligence \ncommunity. Les never lost his ardor or his commitment to public \nservice.\n  Mr. President, the Nation has lost a devoted public servant who \ncontributed much and who had so much more to contribute to our national \nsecurity.\n  I have lost a valued friend and a real colleague, a friendship that I \nwill cherish forever, and a man that I will miss very much.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7232-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7233-S7234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LES ASPIN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \ncomments of our distinguished colleague from Georgia. Before he departs \nthe floor, I thought we might put in one additional chapter in \nreminiscing about our dearly beloved friend, Les Aspin. It was a period \nwhen the two Armed Services Committees met, and I was privileged at \nthat time for some 6 years to serve as ranking member, together with \nSenator Nunn as chairman, and Les Aspin as chairman of the House. I \nremember when we would act as the ``big four.'' If the Senator from \nGeorgia will remember that----\n  Mr. NUNN. Along with Congressman Bill Dickinson.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, Congressman Bill Dickinson. There would be absolute \ndeadlock in the conferences. The big four would sort of get off \ntogether, and the other members, I think they were slightly envious in \nsome respects, but in other respects, they were glad they did not have \nto make the decisions the big four had to crank out.\n  Mr. NUNN. I think many times it was like we were the ``little four'' \nrather than the big four.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. But my friend from Georgia is a man of \ngreat patience. Chairman Aspin would always be late, almost invariably \nlate, and he would come in with a great swath of papers under his arm, \ndown the hall with two or three staff people, and he would literally \nflop in the chair. He would consume the entire chair, and the papers \nwould be scattered all over the floor. And, finally, the Senator from \nGeorgia, who at that time was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nwould regain his composure and we would start to resolve the problems. \nBut it was a marvelous chapter in the relationship between the Senate \nand House Armed Services Committee, and Les Aspin was instrumental in \nseeing that we arrived at the proper decision which, almost without \nexception, was in the best security interest of this country. In those \ndays, we had almost no politics that entered into the decision--\noccasionally, a ship here or a tank there, but other than that, it was \nstraightforward, tough decisions on behalf of the country.\n  I join my friend from Georgia in saying how much we will miss our \nfriend. I was with him just 2 weeks ago. I am privileged to serve on \nthe Intelligence Commission, and Les Aspin was the chairman. We went \ndown to one of the Central Intelligence facilities to spend a day. And \nI wish to add, Mr. President, that Zoe Baird is a member of that \ncommission, and she called me just yesterday and expressed her great \nadmiration. I would like to include that in my comments for Chairman \nAspin of the commission. That commission will carry on and do its work, \nbut he laid the foundation. I join my distinguished colleague in paying \nthis brief tribute to our fallen friend.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my friend from Virginia. I remember those days very \nwell, and I will always cherish the memories. I have to say that while \nLes Aspin would consume that chair, my friend from Virginia was usually \nconsuming the sofa.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is quite true.\n  Mr. NUNN. For health reasons, though.\n  Mr. WARNER. In those days I had a bum leg. I think we should end this \nbrief set of comments on behalf of the late Congressman Aspin with a \nsmile on our face, because that is the way he would want it. I am glad \nthat my distinguished colleague from Georgia mentioned the Bottom-Up \nReview. That was a document that was created and is still used as a \nbenchmark for many of our discussions here. He had that foresight and \ncourage. [[Page S7234]] \n  My knowledge and friendship with the late departed Les Aspin began \nwhen I was Secretary of the Navy. He was off frequently as a severe \ncritic of the Department of Defense during that period of time.\n  And I remember so well Melvin Laird was then Secretary of Defense and \nhad a great respect and friendship for Les, but Les was a strong critic \nin those days. Now in hindsight, maybe some of his criticism was well-\ntaken.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7233-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7234-S7236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET RESOLUTION SUPPORT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the Senate budget resolution proposed and brought forward by \nChairman Domenici.\n  Let me first start by congratulating the chairman for the absolutely \ntremendous job he has done. I am sure that there is not a Member of \nthis body who would write the budget the identical way that the \ncommittee has written. I do not suppose the chairman would, either. I \nthink he has done a great job. I want to congratulate him.\n  This is a historic moment. It is a moment where we will really \ndetermine whether this Congress has the courage, has the wisdom, to do \nwhat we all know we have to do.\n  Let me also congratulate my friend from Ohio, John Kasich, chairman \nof the Budget Committee in the House of Representatives. He has done a \ngreat job, as well. For both of them and for the Senate this is a \nhistoric moment.\n  What I would like to talk about this evening, Mr. President, is the \nissue of this budget and how this budget that we will be voting on \ntomorrow, affects young people, affects children.\n  The truth is that we simply have to change the direction of this \ncountry. We have to face reality. We have to face the fact that America \nhas a fundamental choice between two different futures: A future of \nresponsibility and fiscal sanity on the one hand; or a future of \neconomic catastrophe.\n  Catastrophe is a pretty harsh word, Mr. President, but I think it is \naccurate. When we fail to balance the budget for 26 consecutive years, \nwhen we add to the national debt until we are paying more in interest \nthan we are paying for national defense, and when we have a debt that \nis nearly $5 trillion--$5 trillion--and no end in sight, what we have \nis a catastrophe. A catastrophe in the making. No more, nor less.\n  Mr. President, what we are really talking about is not dollars and \ncents. What we are talking about is our children and the quality of \ntheir lives. The sad fact is, Mr. President, that today to many of our \nchildren, America is a very tough place to grow up in.\n  I have previously come to the Senate floor and discussed the issue of \nour children. What I think is the biggest crisis facing this country is \nwhat is happening to our young people. Many of our young children are \ngrowing up in good conditions, but too many of them live in an \nenvironment that makes it very, very difficult for them, very \nproblematic, as to whether they can succeed.\n  I have talked about this. I talked about the fact that this is the \nfirst generation in our history whose life expectancy is no greater \nthan their parents because of deaths from auto accidents, deaths \nbecause of drugs, homicides.\n  A generation where young children are being born, one-third of all \nchildren being born today to parents who are not married; two-thirds of \nthe children born in our inner cities are born to parents who are not \nmarried.\n  Probably, Mr. President, the most disheartening fact of all, is \nprobably something that was encountered last year by the Presiding \nOfficer as he traveled through the State of Missouri campaigning, as I \nfound traveling the State of Ohio, and that is that people today do not \nbelieve their children will have a better life than they had. They do \nnot believe the standard of living for their children will be even as \ngood as they had. That to me is the most disheartening fact of all.\n  What do we do? Government has a role. I introduced my crime bill last \nweek. I talked about the fact I was targeting money for more cities and \nfor police officers to go in there, because too many of our young \npeople live in an unsafe environment.\n  I will continue to talk about that in the months ahead. It is not \njust Government. We all have a responsibility. Communities have a \nresponsibility. There are things Government can do and things that \nGovernment cannot do.\n  What I want to talk about specifically tonight is one thing that \nsometimes we forget does impact on children. That is the huge spending, \nthe huge national debt, and the huge tax burden that we are placing on \nthis generation of parents and on the next generation of our children \nwhen they grow up.\n  We are dealing, Mr. President, with a sad fact that the U.S. Congress \nmakes the situation worse for our children by throwing away so many of \nAmerica's resources in an utterly irresponsible manner. To pay for \nCongress' reckless spending, the Federal Government has to take far too \nmuch money from the parents of these children.\n  When my parents were growing up in the 1930's, their families had to \nwork on an average until March 8 of every year to pay for Congress' \nspending. By the time I was growing up, and my wife Fran was growing up \nin the 1960's, a typical family had to work until April 16 to pay the \ntaxes. Today, 1995, American families have to work until May 6 to pay \ntheir taxes. That is money that is stolen from families, stolen from \nchildren.\n  Sometimes it feels like America's parents are in a tug of war with \nthe Federal Government for the resources they need to raise their \nchildren. Frankly, Mr. President, I am sure they feel on many days that \nthe Government is winning.\n  This budget begins the process of restoring the resources to the \nparents. It is only a beginning, but it is a necessary beginning. We \nask parents today to do a lot.\n  It is time for this Congress and this Government to stop hindering \ntheir efforts and to start helping. I think we sometimes forget, Mr. \nPresident, the tremendous burden the taxes place on the American family \ntoday and how many of the decisions of that family are made, forced to \nbe made, because of that burden. Decisions about whether the mother, \nthe father, both work; whether one spouse holds down two jobs or three \njobs. All these things are impacted by the Federal tax burden. The \nGovernment impacts these families and puts a tremendous burden on these \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I have talked about the fact that for some children it \nis not easy being a kid in America today. We have a lot of problems. \nYet we continue to let the Federal Government deprive young parents of \nthe resources they need.\n  Mr. President, if we do not act now and pass this budget resolution, \nit will get a lot tougher to change things in the future. If we keep \nspending at this rate, by the year 2012, 17 years from today, there \nwill be nothing--nothing--left in the budget for discretionary spending \non our domestic needs. Zero. Every last cent in the Federal budget will \ngo to entitlements and interest payments. Think of that: Every cent \nwill go to entitlements and interest payments.\n  Mr. President, those interest payments did not go to our children. \nThey do not go to the kids. I do not think it is a surprise or a secret \nto also indicate to this body that, frankly, neither does most of the \nentitlement spending, either.\n  Mr. President, just a year before that year 2012, our grandson, \nAlbert, will graduate from high school. In that year, our daughter, \nAnna, if things work out, will be in her first year of college. If we \ndo not act today, Albert and Anna's generation will pay a severe human \ncost.\n  Between today and the year 2025, the Federal debt per person will \ncontinue to rise year after year after year. Today the debt on each \nperson is approximately $18,500.\n  In the year 2025, it is going to be more than $60,000 for every \nsingle man, woman, and child in America.\n  Look at the modest sacrifices this budget resolution proposes, so \nthat we can balance the budget. Then look at the incredible sacrifices \nthat our children will have to make if we do not.\n  In this budget, we slow the rate of increase of fast-growing \nprograms.\n  The alternative is a $60,000 debt burden for every person in America.\n  It is a clear choice, Mr. President. The longer we delay, the more it \nis [[Page S7235]] going to hurt. I say, let our day of reckoning be \nnow, before it really hurts.\n  Many of the Senators speaking here on the Senate floor have focused \non the pain that is contained in this budget resolution. But here are \nthe facts.\n  We are not going to touch Social Security.\n  We are going to let Medicare funding increase, by an average of 7 \npercent. Each year, over the next 7 years. Let us look at children's \nprograms.\n  Chapter 1. No cut.\n  Head Start. No cut.\n  Special education. Spending actually increases.\n  Women, Infants, and Children. Spending goes up.\n  School breakfast. Spending goes up.\n  School lunches. Spending goes up.\n  Over the next 7 years, we propose spending $815 billion on the \nfollowing major means-tested programs affecting child welfare: Food \nStamps. Earned income tax credit. AFDC and child care. Supplemental \nsecurity income. Child nutrition.\n  For many reasons, this is a child-oriented budget.\n  This budget is designed to make tough choices now, so that our \nchildren will not have to face a lot tougher set of choices tomorrow.\n  Contrary to a lot of the rehetoric, we\n   are not taking a meat-ax to this budget. What we have here is a \nscalpel.\n\n  America's fiscal policy today is on a glide path toward total \ncollapse. I think a better way of saying it is we are on a glidepath to \ncrash the plane. Anyone who looks at this budget and complains about \ndeep cuts is on a collision course with reality.\n  If you think there are deep cuts in this budget--wait till you see \nthe cuts that are going to be necessary, a few short years from now, if \nwe do not pass this budget.\n  On the Senate floor, this budget resolution has been called a lump of \ncoal for America's children. To call that absurd would be an \nunderstatement.\n  The alternative to this sensible, child-oriented budget is the \nbankruptcy budget that's already scheduled for the year 2012. That \nbankruptcy budget will become a reality for our children unless we act \nnow.\n  To leave our children flat busted broke, less than two decades from \ntoday, would be a cruel act of child abuse.\n  Fortunately, the American people gave us a clear mandate last \nNovember. It was a mandate for change. When the debt is nearly $5 \ntrillion, and bankruptcy is less than 20 years away, it is time to \nchange course; to choose the future over the past; to do something that \nwill earn the gratitude of the next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. President, the future of our children depends on the choices we \nmake in this budget. Speaking for the people of Ohio, I think we are \nready to do what is right.\n  Let us rescue our children's future. The first step is to pass this \ncourageous budget resolution.\n  This is a moment of history. Each one of us in our daily lives, in \nour public lives, does things. We do things that we think are \nimportant. Frankly, I do not know there is anything we as individuals \nin our public life, or we collectively in the U.S. Senate, can do that \nwill do more to change the direction of this country to have a positive \nimpact on our children and their children, than to pass this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to compliment our distinguished \ncolleague. It was well delivered, the set of comments. Indeed, I felt \nhe explained with great clarity precisely what it is, namely the \nobjective on this side in trying to proceed to reach a balanced budget.\n  I would like to address another aspect of this budgetary problem. \nToday, under the leadership of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and Senator McCain, we had a debate regarding the need for \nadditional funding in this resolution for our national defense. I \nparticipated in that, as did every single Republican on the Armed \nServices Committee. I am pleased to say the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nNunn, likewise participated and indeed supported the amendment. The \namendment was also coauthored by the Senator from Texas, [Mrs. \nHutchison].\n  I would like to expand on some of the points that we made during the \ncourse of the debate today. I commend particularly the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, for his courageous proposal to balance this \nbudget in 2002, but I regret that Senator Domenici was not able to put \nin that budget for the Senate, a level of funding which more closely \nmatched that arrived at by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the security of our Nation as is \nevery Member of the U.S. Senate. We face a world that has dramatically \nchanged in the period that I have been privileged to serve here in the \nU.S. Senate. During the period where we had the cold war with the \nSoviet Union, we were able to make calculations with considerable \nprecision as to the risk this Nation faced from communism led by the \nSoviet Union and its satellite Warsaw Pact nations, and develop in the \ncourse of time the exact weaponry that we believed was necessary to \ndeter that risk. And, together with our allies in NATO, we did achieve \nthe goal of maintaining peace in the European Continent in that period \nat the close of World War II until today. But with the demise of the \nSoviet Union, the risk became more difficult to calculate, and indeed, \nthe range of weapons that this Nation needs and the level of the Armed \nForces required to put in place the deterrent is far more complicated.\n  We now have experienced 10 consecutive years of lowering defense \nnumbers. I repeat that--10 consecutive years. And we are now faced with \na budget resolution that would make it 11 consecutive years.\n  As we speak here tonight, our Armed Forces are preparing, in a sense \non standby, for the possibility of a mission quite different than that \nwe envisioned during the days of the cold war, but no less inherent the \nrisk of the men and women in the Armed Forces who may be called on to \nperform this mission. And that is the mission to assist the United \nNations and NATO in withdrawal of the forces from that geographic area \nonce known as Yugoslavia, namely the UNPROFOR forces.\n  I happen to be of the opinion that those forces have performed a \nsuccessful mission. It is true that combat still rages, tragic \nkillings, particularly in Sarajevo still go on. But had it not been for \nthe presence of the UNPROFOR ground forces--and I wish to include, Mr. \nPresident, the very valuable and essential contribution of the U.S. \nforces in the air, protective role, and the sea role--which closed the \nports going into the Pelagruz.\n  This past Friday, for an example, an article appeared in the Virginia \nPilot. That article was entitled ``Naval Reserve Jets Activated for \nDuty in Bosnia Combat.'' That should really have read, ``activated for \nstandby duty''. But, nevertheless, they were activated. May I read just \na paragraph or two?\n\n       For the first time since the Vietnam War a squadron of \n     Naval Reserve warplanes is being activated and sent to the \n     Mediterranean to join military operations over Bosnia. The \n     deployment is part of the Pentagon's plan to rely more on the \n     select Reserves during the military's downsizing.\n\n  That is a decade of downsizing that I addressed earlier.\n  This particular squadron is one I am familiar with, given they are in \nmy State, and operate EA-6P's, which have a critical role in the \nsuppression of what we call ground-to-air threats. They are few and far \nbetween, these aircraft in our inventory today. When a special mission \nlike this occurs, we have to call on the Reserves and the Guard. I \ncertainly wish to commend the role of the Reserves and the Guard in \nmany operations in that conflict.\n  For example, I made two trips down into Sarajevo, and each time the \ntransportation was provided by C-130's from Zagreb, Croatia, into \nSarajevo and Air Guard units operated those aircraft. The crews were \nAir Guardsmen who had volunteered to come back on a period of active \nduty, some 6 months, some 12 months, and fly those dangerous missions. \nIndeed, those missions were dangerous. On my first trip in, \nregrettably, the aircraft right behind us--and they were staggered \nabout every 30 to 40 minutes to an hour. They were staggered. The \naircraft behind us was shot down with the loss of life. That is the \ntype of risk that the Guard and Reserve units have taken. \n[[Page S7236]] \n  Whether or not you believe that we should put U.S. forces at risk to \ncarry out this ground mission, namely to help extract UNPROFOR, if the \ndecision is made--and as yet it has not been made by the United Nations \nnor NATO--I am certain that the Members of the U.S. Senate will want to \nsupport the President, and provide that aid that is necessary to \nperform the extraction of those troops from the ground areas.\n  I am also certain that every Senator in this Chamber would support \nfunding to ensure that our forces are trained and equipped to \nfacilitate that extraction. That is the type of thing we are talking \nabout here.\n  Last year we had to provide a supplemental. There is no way the \nPresident nor the Secretary of Defense can anticipate the contingency \noperations and the level of funding associated with those operations. \nThat is why we must fully fund the basic budget of the Department of \nDefense and rely less and less on the supplemental type of funding.\n  We learned in Operation Desert Storm that well-trained troops \nequipped with modern weapons and equipment suffer fewer casualties if \nthey are properly trained, properly equipped, and properly supported \nlogistically. That is what we are talking about in seeking this added \nfunding.\n  I regret that the Senate did not adopt that amendment today, and \nsomehow we will have to revisit this issue and do the very best we can \nto make sure that the men and women of the Armed Forces today are as \nequipped, trained, and otherwise supplied as we have done historically \nthroughout these many years since World War II for our forces who \nvolunteer, All Volunteer Forces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nVirginia. I agree with him wholeheartedly. I think when we are here on \nthe floor debating some of the toughest decisions that we are ever \ngoing to make in our lifetime, that these things, like the defense \nbudget that lost today on the floor, will be coming back. We will be \nable to continue to debate the role of defense, and I think when we \nfinish this bill that we will see a little shifting of the priorities \ntowards stronger national defense for just the reasons that the Senator \nfrom Virginia states, that we have things coming up that were \nunforeseen that are not put in the budget, like the need for American \ntroops to help with the U.N. evacuation of Bosnia, which seems to be a \npossibility on the horizon.\n  But the point is that these things are going to happen, and we are \ngoing to have to budget in a way that allows for those eventualities \nand those emergencies.\n  So, I think the point here is that we are here tonight talking about \nsome of the toughest decisions that we are ever going to make. We are \ntrying to do the responsible thing.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Virginia and his leadership in the \nnational defense area. I appreciate his coming out tonight to talk \nabout those priorities.\n  So, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from Texas to \nyield just for a moment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are fortunate that we have the services of the Senator \nfrom Texas on the Armed Services Committee. She was one of the three \nsponsors of the amendment today to try to adjust this funding upward. \nAs we talked, she did so because of the briefings we had before the \nArmed Services Committee. Indeed, the Presiding Officer this evening is \na member of the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania. We have been briefed on the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, an ever-increasing threat, the proliferation of \nshort-range ballistic missiles.\n  We have also been advised by General Clapper, of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, that there are no less than 60 geographic areas in \nthe world today which he considers--repeat, which he considers--could \nerupt into the type of combat which might require the necessity for the \nintervention of our allies, or, indeed, possibly the United States.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas for joining this debate tonight, \nand particularly commend her for her leadership today on an amendment \nto try to restore some of the funding.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I am very pleased \nto have him in support.\n  I want to yield the floor to the Senator from the State of Washington \nbecause I know he has been very active in the budget debate trying to \nsave the Medicare system for the people of this country.\n  That is what we are doing. That is what we have been doing this week \nand what we are going to be doing in the next few days. We are going to \nbe doing the things that are necessary to save the Medicare system so \nthat when our future generations need this care, it will be there \nbecause we have done the responsible thing this week in the Senate.\n  So I am happy to yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Senate is now less than 24 hours from \none of the most consequential votes it has taken literally in decades. \nSometime late tomorrow, it will have the opportunity for the first time \nin more than 25 years to vote for a budget resolution which will very \nclearly and very decisively put this country on a path to a balanced \nbudget. Already, we have seen the positive impact of the very fact that \nthis debate has begun. We have seen it in an increase once again in the \nvalue of the dollar, a value that collapsed on the occasion of the \nfailure of the balanced budget amendment. We have seen it in lower \ninterest rates, lower interest rates that mean that more and more \nAmericans now can purchase the home of their dreams, can borrow money \nto begin or to expand a small business, can begin those businesses \nwhich will provide opportunities for others.\n  This has taken place just because for the first time the people of \nthe United States believe that this new Congress, the House and the \nSenate, are serious about terminating a state of affairs in which each \nyear we add $200, $250, and $300 billion to the burdens imposed upon \nour children and grandchildren for spending for programs we are \nunwilling to pay for.\n  And yet, in spite of the lip service given by almost all Members to \nthe abstract desirability of a balanced budget, resistance will \ncontinue in a rear guard action, in close votes on the floor of this \nbody, from those who are absolutely dedicated to the status quo, who \nfeel that while maybe it might be a good idea someday to have a \nbalanced budget, not, O Lord, in our time, not with our votes. Or, if \nit is desirable to do it now, always in a different way than that \nproposed by what I confidently expect to be a majority of this body \ntomorrow evening.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not think it appropriate for us to disguise \nthe fact that there will be programs reduced, cut, the growth slowed in \nprograms that provide desirable dollars for a wide range of interest \ngroups in this country, and they will let their views be heard. They \nare represented eloquently by Members of this body who can see the \ntrees or perhaps the leaves on the trees but not the forest itself, for \nwhom a balanced budget, fiscal responsibility, the exercise of a moral \nresponsibility to our children and grandchildren not further to subject \nthem to debt is less important than a particular group or a particular \nprogram.\n  And so this contest which began at the beginning of this Congress and \nwill reach one of its climactic votes tomorrow is a contrast between \nthose who believe in, who speak for, who demand a different and more \nresponsible direction for this country and those who, like the \nPresident of the United States, simply believe that the status quo is \nperfectly all right. Their view is the single worst thing we could \npossibly do would be to return a single dollar now being taken in the \nform of taxes from any group in the American people to the pockets of \nthose American people even if that dollar came from a fiscal dividend \nresulting from a balanced [[Page S7237]] budget, came because we will \npay less in interest on the national debt as interest rates decline, \ncame because the economy grew and more people were at work at better \njobs as a result of what we do.\n  It is ironic that the President's chief economic adviser, Laura \nTyson, is quoted as having said recently,\n\n       Any effort to reduce Government spending takes a dollar out \n     of the economy which means a dollar in reduction in demand in \n     the economy so it increases the contractionary risks on the \n     economy.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that states all too well the views of this \nadministration and of those who oppose this budget resolution. Their \nview is that the only real prosperity comes from dollars spent by the \nFederal Government. In fact, that statement by Ms. Tyson is so \nextraordinary that one would expect her to suggest to us that we \nperhaps spend another $100 billion during the course of this year \nborrowed from whoever would lend it to us because obviously that is the \nroad to prosperity. If we cannot subtract $1 billion because it will \nhave a contractionary effect, presumably we add $1 billion or $10 \nbillion or $100 billion so we can spend our way into prosperity. But \nthat is exactly what this administration has been doing, and it does \nnot work.\n  Not only will this budget benefit the economy, not only will it mean \nmore dollars in the pockets of individuals as they look to purchase \ntheir homes or start or expand their businesses or look for new \nopportunities, it will also mean a discipline on the Government itself. \nPerhaps we will not end up having 163 different and competing job \ntraining programs. Perhaps we will not have dozens or more of competing \nspecific kinds of educational programs or subsidies for one business or \ngroup or another. Perhaps--and I am convinced this will be the case--we \nwill use this budget to reform the Medicare health insurance fund so \nthat it will actually be there in 7 years for the people who need that \nhospital insurance. Certainly this administration has ignored \ncompletely the voices of its own trustees of the Medicare hospital \ninsurance fund who have told us and the administration that something \nmust be done or that insurance fund will go bankrupt.\n But that is later; that is in the time of another President, another \nCongress; they can worry about it.\n\n  That seems to be the status-quo view which we are fighting so \ndiligently to change.\n  So, Mr. President, it is well worth our while, well worth the while \nof those Senators who have chosen to be here this evening to take one \nlast opportunity to speak to their colleagues and to the country about \nthe radical change in direction that we propose, a direction of fiscal \nresponsibility, a direction of exercising our responsibilities to \nfuture generations, a direction which can lead us to prosperity, a \ndirection which can benefit every citizen in this country. That, on the \none hand, and, on the other hand, a passionate defense of the status \nquo: Nothing is wrong with this Government; all of the programs it has \nought to be continued; we cannot do anything; we should go on automatic \npilot.\n  That is a disappointing set of criticisms of our society today, Mr. \nPresident. It is not what last fall's election was about. I hope that \nwith the help of the majority of my colleagues that tomorrow a majority \nin this U.S. Senate will put this country on a different path, a path \nthat it has not trod for many years, a path to a better America.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7236-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7237-S7240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WAGING WAR AGAINST THE HUMAN SPIRIT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the budget \nresolution setting the spending levels for the next 5 years, we do so \nwith the knowledge that one of our greatest challenges is moving the \nNation's needy from governmental dependence to economic independence.\n  One of our challenges is to ensure that hope and opportunity are \ndefining characteristics for all Americans. This was the challenge 30 \nyears ago when the great movement reshaping world politics was the end \nof colonialism. John Kennedy celebrated the ``desire to be \nindependent,'' as the ``single most important force in the world.'' \nEventually this movement revealed its power from Asia to Africa to \nSouth America.\n  The problem with imperialism was not just its economic exploitation, \nit was its influence on culture. It undermined traditional ways and \ninstitutions, and it was inconsistent with human dignity.\n  Why? Because imperialism rewarded passivity and encouraged \ndependence, required citizens to live by the rules of a distant elite. \nIt demanded people be docile in the face of a system that they could \nnot change. It was an attack, not just on national sovereignty, but on \nnational character.\n  What our Washington-based welfare system has done, particularly to \nwomen and children, has been to fashion a new form of colonialism. It \ncreated an underclass that is paid to play by the rules that lead to \ndependence, rather than act with independence and dignity. Our welfare \nsystem rewards behavior that keeps people powerless. It thwarts the \nefforts of private and religious charitable organizations to care for \nthe needy. It discourages the genuine compassion of the American \npeople. Our welfare system has waged a war against the human spirit.\n  Our goal in welfare should not be to maintain an ``underclass\" in as \ncomfortable as possible circumstances. Yet that is precisely what our \nwelfare system has done. Cash benefits anesthetize their suffering. \nFood stamps relieve their hunger. Health care and housing are provided. \nBut the hope, the dignity, and the integrity of independence are \nforgotten.\n  Consider, just briefly, what our current welfare system has wrought. \nThe numbers alone are enough to numb the senses. Since 1965, we have \nspent more than $5 trillion, a cost higher than that of waging the \nSecond World War--fighting poverty. Yet today, there are more people, a \ngreater percentage of Americans, living in poverty than ever before. \nAnd our safety net has not acted well, the safety net has become more \nlike quicksand.\n  In 1965, when President Johnson launched the war on poverty, there \nwere approximately 14.7 million children in poverty. They constituted \nabout one in every five children in America. But in 1993, there was a \ngreater percentage of children in poverty than there were in 1965 when \nthe Great Society programs were launched. It is pretty clear that the \nGreat Society experiment has not been so great for America's children.\n  Of all age groups in the nation today, children are the most likely \nto be poor. In 1991, a study of the poverty rates in eight \nindustrialized nations revealed that American children were almost \nthree times as likely to be poor as children from the other nations \nstudied.\n  The character of the poverty we face today is also a more deeply \nentrenched poverty in which generations of people are born, live, and \ndie without the experience of holding a job, of owning a home, or of \ngrowing up with a father's love and discipline.\n  Go to our inner cities--or just a few blocks from this building--and \nyou will meet a generation fed on welfare and food stamps, but starved \nfor nurture and hope. You will meet young teens in their third \npregnancy. You will meet children who are not only without a father, \nbut do not know any children with a father. You will talk with sixth \ngraders who do not know how many inches there are in a foot--having \nnever seen a ruler--and with first graders who do not know their ABC's \nbecause no one ever took the time to teach them.\n  The political elites that have spent and taxed in recent decades have \nredistributed wealth beyond the dreams of Roosevelt and Johnson \ncombined. But in the Government's war on poverty, poverty is winning \nand the casualties are the poor, and the casualties are our children. \nThe casualties also include the future, because we have piled budget \nafter budget high with debt. Hope and opportunity are missing in \naction. Programs and policies that once were judged by the height of \ntheir spending must now be judged by the depth of their failure. This \nis no longer a source of serious debate, no longer a matter of partisan \npolitics, but it is a matter of national concern--it is a concern that \nhas been reflected in our news magazines, on the covers of U.S. News \nand Newsweek, and Time. [[Page S7238]] \n  I have a belief that is confirmed by the record of our times, and it \nis this: That the greatest, most insistent human need is not the need \nfor subsistence, nor handouts, nor dependence--it is the need for \nindependence. Not the kind of independence that suggests one person can \nlive without another. No, quite the opposite.\n  The independence of which I speak is the independence born of \neconomic self-sufficiency and opportunity. The independence to dream, \nto pursue and fulfill our deepest wishes and our personal potential.\n  This is something, Mr. President, that social architects cannot \nbuild, they cannot plan. It is not structure, it is spirit. It is \nsomething that our welfare system has lacked for the last 30 years as \nwe have sought to merely spend our way into a new kind of opportunity. \nBut we have spent our way past opportunity into peril.\n  I believe it is time again to create a welfare system that helps, not \nhurts, those it seeks to serve. And such a system would be a major part \nin controlling the spending which has plagued this Nation and now \nthreatens future generations. A system that helps rather than hurts. A \nsystem that serves is the standard by which welfare reform must be \njudged, not just the utopian ideal.\n  Today, I introduced the Communities Involved in Caring Act. We call \nit CIVIC. We do not expect this Act--a package of 5 bills--to be the \nlong-awaited answer to all of our welfare problems by itself. But we do \nbelieve that it is a significant step toward restoring opportunities of \ndignity through independence and access to the world of upward \nmobility.\n  The act is predicated on three fundamental beliefs:\n  First, that States need the maximum flexibility possible to reform \nwelfare systems.\n  Second, that our intermediary organizations--especially private and \nreligious charitable organizations--need to be utilized in welfare \nreform.\n  Third, that intermediary organizations need not only money, but they \nneed volunteers; they need the personal participation of individuals to \nflourish.\n  The CIVIC Act which I introduced earlier today would block grant \nWashington's four main welfare entitlement programs--AFDC, Food Stamps, \nSupplemental Security Income, and Medicaid--to the States. It starts by \ncapping the spending on AFDC, Food Stamps, and SSI, and then Medicaid \nwould be limited in growth to 105 percent each year--meaning of 105 \npercent of each previous year. Given the fact that Medicaid has been \ngrowing at well over 10 percent a year, this would be substantial \nrestraint in the program's growth, but not a cut in the program.\n  The programs under the block grants would also be extricated from \ntheir existing bureaucracies--at HHS, Agriculture, etc.--and turned \nover to the Department of the Treasury to be distributed to the States. \nThe unique feature of this proposal is that the money would go directly \nfrom the Department of the Treasury to the States, and it would not be \na part of any bureaucracy in Washington, D.C. that would consume much \nof the money before it ever gets to the States.\n  Mr. President, Treasury's oversight role would be minimal because the \nonly qualifications on the block grants would be:\n  First, that States would be required to require welfare recipients to \nwork. How best to do that. The nature of the work. The level of the \nparticipation. All of those issues should be and would be left to the \nStates to determine; and\n  Second, that States that decrease illegitimacy, using existing \ngovernmental statistics as a measure, will be able to use a portion of \ntheir block grant for elementary or secondary education or any other \npurpose they desire.\n  The CIVIC Act also provides explicit authority for States to contract \nwith nongovernmental organizations, including private and religious \ncharitable organizations, and other institutions, in the effort to help \nsolve the welfare problem.\n  We have all heard the stories of small organizations that are hugely \nsuccessful in helping America's poor. Unfortunately, many of these \nprograms have been constrained from receiving Federal funds because all \ntoo often those Federal funds would require radical changes in their \nbeliefs, their structure, their facilities, their program, or their \norganization--changes that would rob these programs of the very \ncharacteristics and attitudes that make them successful.\n  However, under the CIVIC Act, States would be able to utilize their \nFederal block grant funds by either contracting with these \norganizations directly or by giving welfare recipients certificates so \nthat they could choose which programs to get involved in.\n  The final element of the CIVIC Act allows individuals who volunteer \nat least 50 hours per year, or approximately 1 hour a week, to \ncharitable institutions that serve the needy eligible for a $500 tax \ncredit for monetary donations to such charitable organizations. Just as \nthe welfare recipients should work for their benefits, so the citizens \nwho want enhanced tax benefits for their contributions should also work \nand volunteer in the organizations they contribute to.\n  Mr. President, it is all about opportunity; it is about working \ntogether. When he traveled through America more than 100 years ago, the \ngreat French observer, Alexis de Tocqueville, was struck by how caring \nAmericans were for each other.\n\n       The Americans . . . regard for themselves, constantly \n     prompts them to assist one another and inclines them \n     willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property \n     for the welfare of others.\n\n  What the Act I introduced today seeks is to undo 30 years of \nWashington discouraging that very basic American instinct to help one \nanother. The ideas in the Act are not new. They are, in fact, old ideas \nin America. They have been tested and found successful.\n  About 100 years ago, cities like New York were littered with \nalcoholics and addicts. Orphaned children roamed the streets. And if \nall of New York City's liquor shops, houses of prostitution, gambling \nhouses, and other low-life establishments had been placed on a single \nstreet, they would have extended from Manhattan's City Hall to the City \nof White Plains more than 30 miles away. On that street, there would \nhave been a robbery every 165 yards and a murder every half mile. And \nin Brooklyn, one out of every ten people got food from public \nstorehouses.\n  These pathologies met their match, Mr. President, in society's \nintermediary, nongovernmental, voluntary, private \ninstitutions of charity and assistance. Their warm-hearted and hard-\nheaded approaches--and you can have a warm heart and a hard head when \nit comes to making sure that we change such circumstances--helped save \nwomen and children and men. As the historian Marvin Olasky notes, ``The \nsolutions these reforms came up with forestalled an epidemic of \nillegitimacy and saved thousands of children from misery.''\n  I believe that as we confront our own social pathologies today, we \nmust do it the same way--with the ideas that have worked in the past \nand yet with new ideas for the 1990's--even though they may have been \nthe standard fare of the 1890's. We must meet our challenges with a \ngreater role for States and a greater role for intermediary \ninstitutions, nongovernmental organizations, private charities--both \nlarger ones like the Salvation Army and Goodwill, and smaller ones like \nBest Friends and the Sunshine Mission.\n  So while the CIVIC Act begins the process of moving welfare from \nWashington to the States, it also begins the vital task of \nreinvigorating our private, nongovernmental organizations which can \nhelp meet the deepest needs of our citizens, organizations that we know \nwill help solve our welfare problems.\n  The change that we want to see will not occur overnight. Neither will \nit come without hard work or thorough debate. The end of colonialism \nwas not an easy process either. For independence means risk, the \nsacrifice of security.\n  Well, security, coupled with dependency is a bad bargain. Economic \nmobility means work; it means hard work. But no nation and no people \nwho have ever tasted the sweet fruits of freedom has ever called for a \nreturn to its colonial dependency.\n  I believe that if we want to make sure that we are free and we remain \nfree, we must reform the welfare system. It can be a part of a large \nreform in which we reform the financial integrity of America, for we \ncannot hold [[Page S7239]] hostage future generations to the spending \nof the present.\n  As we seek to pass the budget in the hours ahead in this Chamber, it \nwill be a pleasure to do so in a way that not only puts us on a footing \nof sound financial integrity, but establishes us on a path toward \neconomic independence and opportunity for individuals --through a \nreformed welfare system, characterized by block grants maximizing the \nStates' flexibility and innovation, and characterized by Government \njoining hands with nongovernmental agencies in order to bring to the \nbattle the energies and talents of this great Nation's private \ncitizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMissouri. He was a former Governor, so he is one of the experts that we \nare going to have in this body when we deal with the very, very tough \nissue of choices as we reform the welfare system.\n  I think it is really appropriate that he has taken a leadership role \nin this. Once again, what we are showing tonight is the tough decisions \nthat must be made to balance the budget, which the people of America \nasked us to do. So I appreciate the Senator waiting for so long and \ngiving that great talk about the bill he introduced today and the \nchoices that we are going to face today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nkind words.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleagues this \nevening in continuing this discussion. By noon tomorrow, we will have \nhad 50 hours of talking about the budget. I guess after 50 hours, your \neyes kind of glaze over. But the fact is that there is nothing more \nimportant that we will talk about during this Congress. It becomes \ndifficult to find something new to say about the issue after 50 hours. \nBut maybe that is not important. Maybe the important thing is to stress \nthose things that are necessary, those things that are important, those \nchoices that we do have.\n  It has been 10 days since the Republicans presented a balanced budget \nplan, which America has been waiting for. In that time, the deficit has \nincreased another $4.9 billion. It added $19 for every American.\n  The Republicans are working to end Government's relentless borrowing. \nThe Republican plan would balance the budget by the year 2002 by \nslowing the growth in the Federal spending from 5 percent to 3 percent.\n  It protects Social Security, saves Medicare from bankruptcy, \nmaintains a Social Security safety net, reduces the size of the Federal \nGovernment, and moves power out of Washington and back closer to the \npeople.\n  Republicans want to transform Government to make it more efficient \nand more responsive and less expensive. Democrats, meanwhile, are \nstanding up for the status quo. They have offered no plan to balance \nthe budget.\n  Mr. President, this debate has been characterized by almost everyone \nwho has risen, has stood up and said, ``I want to balance the budget \nbut we cannot cut''--blank--and fill in the blank. Medicare, earned-\nincome tax credit, defense, education, whatever.\n  So we always say we want to balance the budget--but for a million \nreasons we cannot do it. I am confident that we shall for the first \ntime in 25 years balance the budget--tomorrow. Starting on the path to \nbalance the budget.\n  It is awfully hard. These are large figures, talking about $5 \ntrillion. Who knows what $5 trillion is. I read something the other day \nthat sort of personalizes this. I thought it was interesting.\n  Someone asked, how do we identify the Federal budget with something \nthat is closer to a personal budget? This is what the answer was, and I \nthought it was interesting: Suppose you have an income of $125,000 \ncoming not from work but from contributions of all your friends and \nrelatives who work. You are not satisfied with what $125,000 can buy \nthis year, so you prepare for yourself a budget of $146,000 and charge \nthe $20,300 difference to your credit card on which you already carry \nan unpaid balance of $452,248, boosting that to $472,548 on which you \npay interest daily. Multiply that by 10 million and that is what our \nGovernment did in fiscal year 1994.\n  This is clearly the most important element of debate for this year. \nNot just because of the dollars, as important as they may be, but \nbecause we have an opportunity to examine and to change and to look at \nthe role of Government, look at those things that should logically and \nlegitimately be done by the Federal Government, do something about \nthose that should be done in private sector. To take a look at the size \nof Government. Clearly, voters said last year, Government is too large \nand costs too much.\n  So we have a chance to do that. We have a chance to make major \nchanges, the first really major changes in 25 years. To do that, and I \nbelieve very strongly and we have done some of this, we have to make \nsome procedural changes. We cannot simply continue to do what we have \nbeen doing and expect to get different results. We have to do things \nlike line-item veto, which we worked on. Have to do something about \nunfunded mandates. I think we should do something about term limits. I \nthink we should have had a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and we will go back to do that.\n  We did not accomplish that. We failed by one vote in this Chamber. \nNow we have the opportunity to do what many opponents of the balanced \nbudget amendment said, and that is we do not need an amendment, we just \nbelly up to the bar and do it. That is what we have an opportunity to \ndo.\n  The record is not good. Sure, we can do it and we will do it. We have \nnot done it for 25 years. We will raise the debt limit to $5 trillion \nthis summer. The administration budget has $250 billion in deficits out \nas far as we can see. The size of Government is growing. So for the \nfirst time we have an opportunity to do something different.\n  Clearly, there are different philosophies about Government. There are \ndifferent philosophies about what the size should be. That is fine. \nThat is the way it should be. That is what elections are for, so people \ncan make a decision between two choices.\n  There are those in this body and other bodies and in this country who \nsay the Government should be larger, the Government should do more. In \nfact, the Government does a better job of spending dollars than \nfamilies do and businesses do. That is, I suppose, a legitimate view. \nIt is not my view.\n  So we do have differences and there are differences. The Republicans \nwould like to have a smaller Government that costs less, that is more \nlean, and efficient.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, have moved toward more Government and \nmore spending. Republicans want to transform Government, something that \nis more efficient, to deliver services more efficiently. Welfare is an \nexcellent example. Nobody wants to eliminate welfare. We want to be \nable to help people who need help, but to help them back into the work \nsector. We want a Government that is more responsive, that is more \ncustomer oriented. One that is less expensive.\n  The administration, on the other hand, and our friends on the other \nside of the aisle, support the status quo. There is no plan to balance \nthe budget.\n  The President, as was suggested yesterday, is AWOL, absent without \nleadership, on finding a way to balance the budget. No options on how \nto save Medicare despite the fact that the trustees have said in no \nuncertainty that if we do not do something, in 2 years we will be \ndealing with the reserves, and 7 years Medicare will be broke. No \nwelfare reform proposal.\n  We have an opportunity to do something. The administration's track \nrecord, of course, over the past several years has been to raise taxes \nand expand the Federal Government. The 1993 budget, the largest tax \nincrease in history, nearly $260 billion. We hear it was just on the \nhighest percent--not so. Gas tax--my State has probably the largest per \ncapita gas tax increase of all because of the miles we travel.\n  Mr. President, we do have a chance to do something. If spending \nremains at the same level for the Government programs in order to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, we would have to raise taxes by \n$935 billion, $7,400 for every American taxpayer. That is the choice. \nWe either level off growing or we raise taxes. [[Page S7240]] \n  We have a vision of keeping our promises to make Government smaller, \nto reject the status quo, balance the budget by the year 2002, protect \nSocial Security, save and improve Medicare, and return power to the \ncommunities and to our families and the States.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased we are moving in this direction. I feel \nconfident there will be a positive vote tomorrow, to make these kinds \nof changes. I thank my colleagues for continuing to point out the \nchoices that we have before the Senate. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis budget plan. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would thank the freshman from \nWyoming, the freshman Senator, for adding to this debate. He has really \nbeen there through all these days, talking about the important issues \nthat we are facing and the tough decisions that we are going to have to \nmake. I appreciate the fact that he has just hit the ground running in \nthe U.S. Senate, and I am pleased he stayed tonight along with his \nwife, to make the remarks that he did. We appreciate it very much.\n  Now I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7237-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PRESIDENTS ``SECRET'' BUDGET PLAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

It will balance the budget within 10 years.\n  Mr. President, if this is true--and I suppose I ought to hope it is \ntrue because I have been praying for a balanced budget from this White \nHouse for a long time--it is truly an amazing story. First of all, it \nundercuts all the wailing we have been hearing from the White House \nabout the effect on the economy and the public of setting an arbitrary \ndate for a balanced budget. That is making fun of us Republicans for \ntrying to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  It seems that all we have heard for the last month out of the White \nHouse is, ``What is magic about a certain date to balance the budget?'' \nIf you balance the budget you would ruin the economy. If you balance \nthe budget you would do this to that group, or that to another group. \nNow, all of a sudden in the Washington Post, the President says that he \nwants to balance the budget--albeit in 10 years.\n  I think even members of the President's own party and members of the \nPresident's party in both chambers of the Congress had earlier \ndisagreed openly with the White House on this point. There was \ndisagreement on what to do. Do you know what? The Members of the \nDemocratic Party up here on the hill, they look to the President for \nleadership.\n  The message they got was to stay the course. The President said just \nkeep to it, stay the course. That is, offer nothing in rebuttal to the \nRepublican attempt to balance the budget. No vision from the White \nHouse; no alternative from the White House.\n  And, do you know what? The Members up here on the Hill were very \nobedient, listening to their President. So they refrained from offering \ntheir own balanced budget alternative, or any other comprehensive \nalternative to the Republican efforts to balance the budget.\n  So, the members of the Democratic Party stood idly by during this \nbudget debate and risked their credibility because they wanted to \nfollow their leader, our President of the United States. Now, with this \nnew development that the President is for a balanced budget, albeit in \n10 years, they, the members of the Democratic Party in the Congress of \nthe United States in both Houses of the Congress, also are undercut by \ntheir President just like members of the White House staff have been. \nJust like he undercut the recent arguments of everybody on his staff \nthat was trying to defend his position of just stay the course. Do not \noffer an alternative.\n  Second, this also says that the Republican vision of a balanced \nbudget is right after all, and it is filling a very enormous political \nvoid. The American people know where we stand and they do not know \nwhere the other side stands. The American people know what the \nRepublican Party stands for. They do not know what the Democratic Party \nstands for. They do not know because for several months, until this \nvery day, they were told a balanced budget did not matter. They were \ntold that we should not have an alternative, as Democrats, to what the \nRepublicans were trying to do.\n  Also, there is a third aspect to this. Because, in filling that void \nand because the President is now coming around to accepting the premise \nof the Republican vision for the future, this new development is a \npowerful demonstration of the President's lack of leadership. Because, \nyou know what? The lack of leadership demonstrates followership. It \nleaves a perception of a desperate move to be included. The President \nof the United States wants to be relevant, finally, in the debate for a \nbalanced budget.\n  It shows that our Republican call for the other side to put up or be \nsilent has had an effect. It shows that we have opened up a big \nweakness in the other side's flank, namely its very own credibility. \nBecause you cannot talk the talk until you walk the walk. Everyone \nknows that. Everyone outside of Washington.\n  Now, obviously the President knows it as well. The time to show \nrelevance and to show leadership on the part of the President was last \nFebruary. That is when the President proposed. The Congress is now \ndisposing. The process has passed the President by. The ship of state \nhas left the dock.\n  It is as if the President is trying to rush ahead to the next port to \ncatch up with the ship. The problem is the ship is not scheduled to \nstop there. And it will not.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I think it is clear that the \nleadership, the vision, and the direction for this ship of state are \ncoming from this side, the Republican side of the aisle. It all happens \nto be reflected in the budget debate of the last 4 days, the amendments \noffered by the other side, the absence of a comprehensive balanced \nbudget alternative from the other side. And I think it will be \ndemonstrated by the overwhelming vote for a balanced budget tomorrow.\n  Now, the President of the United States, on the other hand, missed \nthe boat. His party is still standing on the dock. He stranded them \nthere. He asked them to wait there until he could catch up with the \nship out at sea, but it is too late. We Republicans have a vision and \nwe have a plan to steer this country to the safe waters.\n  I ask, where is theirs? Where is their comprehensive alternative plan \nto balance the budget? Where is their coherent vision? Where is theirs?\n  It is lacking. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7240-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7240-S7242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to pick up where the Senator \nfrom Iowa left off. I think he made some very good points with respect \nto where the President's budget is. I noted also the same Washington \nPost article today. It suggests ``President to Counter Hill Budgets. \nPlan Would End Deficits in 10 Years.''\n  This was not released by the White House. This was released from a \nprivate interview up in New Hampshire that was leaked out somewhere, \nthat the President is coming up with this secret plan to balance the \nbudget in 10 years.\n  It struck me. It tickled my memory, that I heard this about this 10-\nyear plan before. It was from my first year in the Congress. I \nremember, as a member of the Budget Committee, I was a freshman member \nof the Budget Committee and then chairman of the Budget Committee, Leon \nPanetta, now over at the White House, came up with a 10- \n[[Page S7241]] year balanced budget. They worked on it most of the fist \nyear that I was there and I think released it in about October of the \nyear. It was after the debate. This was for the next fiscal year.\n  It was interesting. I do not know whether the budget the President is \nconsidering is going to look like the budget the Congressman--then \nChairman of the Budget Committee--Panetta offered. But at the time, to \nget to a balanced budget--this was in October of 1991, I refer to the \nCongressional Quarterly article--at the time Chairman Panetta said that \nit would take $1.3 billion in cuts or tax increases to get to a \nbalanced budget in 10 years. What we are doing here in the Senate today \nwith Senator Domenici's budget, the Republican budget, is roughly a \ntrillion dollars, not quite a trillion dollars in spending reductions \nto get to a balanced budget. Then we have obviously interest savings \nwhich get us the rest.\n  I had the Budget Committee staff run the numbers. If the President is \nproposing to get to a balanced budget over 10 years, not 7 years, he \nwill not be able to do so by cutting the trillion dollars over 10 \nyears. That is the fallacy. You cannot just cut $1 trillion over 10 \nyears, and balance the budget because you have to get on sort of a \nlonger curve. Your spending cuts do not occur early enough. You build \nup more debt. It is a lot more costly to balance it over a longer \nperiod of time. The Budget Committee told us that it would require $1.6 \ntrillion in spending cuts or tax increases to balance the budget in 10 \nyears, $1.6 trillion.\n  The $1.3 trillion in the Panetta proposal of 1991 included deeper \ncuts in defense, entitlement spending reductions--I remind people \nentitlements are things like Medicare, Medicaid, welfare spending, \nthings that are now being lambasted by the other side of the aisle--a \nbroad cut back in the size and cost of government, and $250 billion to \n$400 billion in new taxes; $400 billion in new taxes.\n  Is this a harbinger of things to come? Have we fished out of the \nfiles from the old Budget Committee in 1991 the 10-year budget proposal \nfor the Clinton administration to balance the budget with a third of \nthe money coming from new taxes? But this is just all speculation \nbecause we have not seen the President's budget.\n  So I have the unpleasant task of returning to the floor to add to the \nlist of numbers on my chart of days with no proposal to balance the \nbudget from President Clinton. Since I had objections from the other \nside of the aisle about using staff to actually put my numbers up, I \nwill do the chore myself, and put ``day 6,'' potentially a significant \ndate.\n  We might have learned about the secret budget, the existence of this \ndocument. We may have learned just from some of the detective work I \nhave done that there may be a plan out there that existed a few years \nago that may be resurrected because under the democratic rule in the \nHouse of Representatives this balanced budget that the Budget Committee \nchairman put together never saw the light of day, never was voted on, \nnever was debated in committee, never moved past the draft stage.\n  Maybe we will get it past the draft stage this time. Maybe the former \nchairman of the Budget Committee will be able to resurrect this \nhandiwork that he did some 4 years ago and bring it on the scene as the \nnew budget for the President.\n  I will tell you that it would be a long time coming, not just the 6 \ndays, but to provide some leadership out of the White\n House on this very important issue to this country.\n\n  I remember during the Republican administrations the then-chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Chairman Leon Panetta, coming to the floor time \nafter time after time making statements about how it was the \nresponsibility of the President to be relevant to the situation, to not \nput up these budgets that were dead, that had no chance, but to be bold \nand to move forward.\n  I quote from March 13, 1986. This is Leon Panetta speaking:\n\n       We begin a game of ``budget chicken'' in which we wait for \n     the other side to make the tough choices that have to be made \n     to try to get our budget in line. It is a lousy way to do \n     business; we all understand that. It is what gave birth to \n     the Gramm-Rudman approach, and it is what creates the \n     frustration that we now deal with here.\n       The hope is that the President would exercise leadership in \n     presenting a budget to the Congress that is realistic and \n     that is serious. But instead of pulling together, he pulls \n     apart. Instead of providing leadership, he plays games. The \n     danger is that we too fall into the same trap. This budget is \n     wrong; we know it is wrong, and it will fail for several \n     reasons.\n\n  Just as the President's budget came to the floor of the Senate. It \nwas wrong, and it failed completely, and did not get one vote.\n  I say that the former Congressman from California, Leon Panetta, made \na good point about that back on May 1, 1990, talking about a Bush \nbudget. He said:\n\n       The fact is that the test of a budget is not what it says \n     it does nor even its author. It is whether or not you get a \n     majority of votes on the floor of the House and in the \n     Congress. That is the ultimate test of the success or failure \n     of any budget.\n\n  The fact is that the test of a budget is not what it says or does or \neven its author. It is whether or not you get a majority of votes on \nthe floor of the House and in the Congress. That is the ultimate test \nof the success or failure of any budget.\n  That speaks volumes about the President's budget that he sent up \nhere; speaks volumes about how serious the President was when he \npresented his budget to the U.S. Congress and in the U.S. Senate of \nwhich there are 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats. He got no votes.\n  Then chairman Panetta went on to say:\n\n       According to that test, the President's budget is a \n     failure. The failure to offer the budget by the President \n     also makes clear how tough it is to develop a budget that \n     balances the priorities, that recognizes that we have to \n     provide new directions for this country and that tries to \n     achieve a majority vote on the floor of the House.\n\n  How things can come back to haunt you. We had a chairman of the \nBudget Committee who was pleading for the President of the United \nStates to provide leadership, to stand firm, and move our country \nforward in a bold, new way. Now that person sits as the right hand man \nof the White House, and from all the press reports is advising the \nPresident to do just the opposite. I guess it all depends on where you \nsit.\n  I must read one more thing that Leon Panetta said during his time in \nCongress because my staff gave it to me. I actually thought it was \nsomething that I had just said the other day because I was talking \nabout the fact that my father is an immigrant to this country and how \nimportant it was for us to leave the next generation better off than \nthe generation that we now live in.\n  Back on May 4, 1989, Congressional Record, Leon Panetta said:\n\n       We have presented over the last 8 years a pleasant message \n     that somehow everyone can have a free lunch in this country. \n     That is not the case. That is not the message that my parents \n     heard when they came to this country as immigrants with \n     little education, little money, but a great deal of hope. \n     They came for the opportunity that this country offered and \n     the willingness to make a sacrifice for their children so \n     their children could enjoy a better life. We now face a \n     situation where our children may not enjoy a better standard \n     of living than we had. That, I think, is the worst testament \n     in terms of the future that we face in this Nation.\n\n  He is right. That is the biggest question that faces us. What are we \ngoing do leave to the next generation? He was right in 1989. He was \nright in 1986. He was right in 1990, and hopefully he will convince the \nPresident to be right in 1995 to join the debate, to lead, to be \nrelevant, to show this country, to show this Congress what direction he \nbelieves we should take to balance this budget.\n  I hope this is the last day; I hope that day 6 was lucky, that this \nlittle inkling that we got about this secret budget might come out \nsomewhere, that there is a plan, and that we will be able to know this \nplan. I do not want to be up here for the next 129 days between now and \nthe end of the fiscal year talking about why the President has not come \nto the party and express his vision for the future of this country.\n  I am confident tomorrow we will pass the balanced budget resolution. \nI hope it is bipartisan because I know there are many on the other side \nof the aisle who also would like to see this budget brought to balance.\n  I wish to commend the Senator from New Mexico for his fine work on \nthis budget. I wish to commend the Presiding Officer for the tremendous \njob she [[Page S7242]] has done every day of this debate in rallying \nthe forces to come here to the floor to talk about the positive aspects \nand how meaningful it is to get to a balanced budget for this country \nand not just the next generation. A lot of the talk is just for the \nnext generation. When we talk about Medicare, it is not the next \ngeneration. It is this generation of Medicare recipients. When we talk \nabout economic growth, it is this generation that is going to benefit \nfrom lower interest rates and higher growth rates.\n  This balanced budget is for everyone. As the Senator from New Mexico \nsaid in answering the question Senator Lautenberg posed: Whose side are \nyou on? We are on America's side. We are on the side of all Americans. \nThat is the beauty of a balanced budget. It is good for everyone. It is \nnot about class warfare. It is not about picking winners and losers. It \nis about giving everyone opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise to commend my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, the Presiding Officer, and especially the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, for the outstanding work that has \nbeen shown over the last several days as we have presented a budget \nthat will be balanced by the year 2002.\n  I would like to turn to answer a simple question, and that is who \nwill benefit from the balanced budget plan proposed by the Republican \nmajority this week. The answer? The American family.\n  The debate over the past week has been fascinating. We have heard a \nlot of rhetoric, especially from the other side of the aisle, about how \ncutting spending will hurt our children, affect our seniors, and hurt \nthe middle class. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nhave us believe that the entire Government is going to shut down and \nthat disaster is imminent with our budget.\n  But what they will not tell you is that the Republican budget will \nhave tangible positive benefits for whom? The American family. Benefits \nthat the American family will see in their checkbook, in their family \nbudgets, and in their overall standard of living.\n  According to economists, one of the most significant benefits of a \nbalanced budget is increased productivity. What does that mean? Let us \ntalk a little bit about what productivity means to that individual \nfamily, that typical family in America. Increased productivity, a \nproduct of this balanced budget, means that Americans will produce more \nin the same amount of hours. There will be more produced for a given \namount of work. And why do we have increased productivity from \nbalancing the budget? Why does increased productivity result from \nspending no more than we take in each year?\n  Because, very simply, the Government, we, will borrow less, and that \nleaves more for investment by the private sector, by individuals, by \nindividual businesses, and greater investment by those businesses and \nindividuals results in better technology and better working conditions. \nIt is this investment that allows our workers to produce more in the \nsame amount of time. And so what does this concept of increased \nproductivity which clearly stems from a balanced budget mean to the \nindividual family, to you, to me, to our children, to our \ngrandchildren?\n  From this first chart, the first thing that increased productivity \nmeans is greater income for the American family. If we accomplish more \nwhile we are at work, increased productivity, we will make more money \nto buy homes, to send our children to school, to buy clothes for our \nchildren, to provide for our own retirement.\n  According to the Commerce Department, median family income fell last \nyear under President Clinton's watch by 1.9 percent. In contrast, over \nthe next 10 years, by balancing the budget, the General Accounting \nOffice says that earnings would be increased by approximately an extra \n2.9 percent. That would mean an extra $1,200 per year for each American \nfamily by passing tomorrow this balanced budget proposal.\n  Under a status quo budget right now, income of the average family in \n2025 without a balanced budget, for example, under the President's \nproposal would be $35,900. Under the Republican proposal, that same \nincome of the average family in 2025 but with a balanced budget would \nbe $48,200, a difference of over $12,000 by having a balanced budget.\n  Yes, increased incomes for the American family mean greater economic \nsecurity for us, for this current generation, and for that next \ngeneration. With $12,000 more a year, our families will be able to save \nmore for their own retirement rather than having to rely on the \nGovernment today, as so many people do today. They will be able to pay \nfor their own health care, and they will be able to pay for education \nfor their children. The investment of this kind of extra money for the \nAmerican family can only mean great things for our economy and for our \npeople.\n  Let me turn to the second chart. Are there other benefits of \nincreased productivity which will result from the balanced budget? Mr. \nPresident, if we are accomplishing more during work hours, we will \nactually have to work less to accomplish the same amount. This means \nmore time at home, more time with our families, more time with our \nchildren, our grandchildren to play baseball, to go to a guitar \nrecital, to read a book.\n  Indeed, a typical family workday is 8\\1/2\\ hours. Increased \nproductivity means that workers can provide the same level of output in \nfewer hours leaving more time for family, more time for leisure. In \ntraveling the State of Tennessee, I know that Americans feel they are \nworking hard to get ahead, and today they are not making progress. The \nmedian income is declining today. It is tough on families. It is tough \non moms and dads who struggle to keep the house clean, food on the \ntable, and the family running, and it is tough for those individuals. \nAs we balance this budget and make this proposal, they worry: Will \ntimes be better? The message that we must get out is yes, with a \nbalanced budget, there is increased productivity, increased time to be \nwith one's family.\n  The Republican budget, when you break it down, will actually ease \nthat burden through increasing the efficiencies of our businesses and \nour workers.\n  Let me turn to the third chart, Mr. President. Probably the most \ntangible benefit that we will see from balancing our budget is lower \ninterest rates. The Congressional Budget Office has told us that \ninterest rates will be lower by almost 2 percent if we balance the \nbudget. Other economists, such as the independent forecasting group \nfrom DRI McGraw-Hill, predict lower interest rates of up to 2.5 \npercent, lower than they would be with a budget which is not balanced. \nThat translates very directly into lower costs for typical purchases by \nthe American family.\n  The examples are depicted. It means when lower interest rates take \neffect, that on the $75,000 30-year mortgage to this family, there will \nbe a savings of $1,246 if we have a balanced budget.\n  Or that same family will save $1,000 over the life of a loan on a \n$15,000 car if we pass this balanced budget proposal.\n  And that same family will save $36 per year on an average balance of \n$1,800 on a credit card if we pass this balanced budget proposal.\n  And that same family can save $1,128 over the life of a loan on a \nsmall business or on farm equipment or on this typical tractor.\n  Mr. President, these are the kinds of savings that are very real that \nwill affect every household in this country if we are successful in \npassing the balanced budget plan tomorrow. There is absolutely no \nquestion that the Republican budget, yes, will be tough. It will be \ntough, and everybody is going to have to sacrifice for it to take \neffect. But there is no question that this Republican budget does \nprovide real, tangible benefits for all Americans and all American \nfamilies.\n  Increased incomes, less work time, lower interest rates--all will \ncontribute to a much higher quality of life for the American family.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider \nthese positive beneficial effects to the family as [[Page S7243]] we \nvote on this historic--very historic--budget package tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7242-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7243-S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PROMISES KEPT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nTennessee, a new Member of the Senate, for helping us with this debate, \nfor helping us point out the important decisions that we are making \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  It has really been wonderful to see the freshmen Senators, the new \nSenators, like the Senator from Tennessee and like the Senator in the \nchair, tonight adding to the debate and adding to the energy and \nvitality of the changes that we are making for America, the changes \nthat the people asked for in 1994 so forcefully by giving a mandate to \nCongress to do the right thing, to keep the promises that were made.\n  The American people have seen time after time after time politicians \nmaking great speeches, beautiful speeches at conventions and big events \nand rallies and they see them make the promises and they see the \npromises broken almost the day after the election. Now, for the first \ntime in years, the American people are going to see the promises being \nkept.\n  I think you are seeing such clear differences between the leadership \nthat the President has shown versus the leadership that the Members of \nCongress are showing now finally.\n  The President's theme has been balance the budget on the backs of the \nMedicare recipients and the welfare recipients and education. That is \nthe theme that we see recurring on the floor of the Senate day after \nday after day after day--the class warfare: ``Oh, yes, they are \nbalancing the budget, but they are doing it at the expense of the \npeople in our society who are receiving Medicare and welfare.''\n  That is all we have heard. Where is their plan? Where is their \nsuggestion? As the Senator from Pennsylvania said earlier tonight, \ntheir Chief of Staff has said, ``It's a big game of chicken. If you put \nyour budget out there and we're going to slash it to ribbons. If we put \nour budget out there, you are going to slash ours to ribbons.'' So who \ngoes first?\n  Mr. President, the Republicans are going first. We are putting \nsomething on the table that makes sense. We are taking the bold step \nand we are protecting Medicare for the future, and we are going to have \na welfare system that tries to bring people up, not hold them down for \ngeneration after generation, and to give the taxpayers of our country \nthe opportunity to see that it does not pay not to work if you can.\n  So, Mr. President, where is the President of the United States in \nthis debate? He gave a budget to the Congress. We voted on it. It was \nthe first vote we took in this budget debate. It was a budget which \nwould increase the Federal deficit from $203 billion in 1994 to $276 \nbillion in the year 2000. In fact, the Clinton budget, submitted to \nthis Congress, called for another $1.2 trillion in deficit spending \nover the next 5 years.\n  That is the budget he has presented until yesterday. And yesterday \nthe President said, ``I'm going to give you a balanced budget.'' We are \n4 days into the budget debate and the President says, ``I'm going to \ngive you a balanced budget.'' Where was he in the first year of his \nterm? Where was he in the second year of his term? And where was he \nwhen we started the hearings in the Budget Committee when Senator \nDomenici was trying for a consensus, trying to bring everyone into the \nprocess, where was the President then? Where is the alternative now? \nThere is no alternative except the one on the table that the Budget \nCommittee has put forward which will balance the budget of this country \nby the year 2002.\n  It is the budget that is going to protect Medicare for our future \ngenerations. It is the budget resolution that says to our children, we \nare not going to turn our backs on you.\n  Finally, we have drawn the line in the sand, and we are going to do \nwhat is right for this country. This is, indeed, a moment in history. \nTomorrow, we are going to make history in America. The other body is \ngoing to do what the House of Representatives did last week, and we are \ngoing to keep our promise to the American people.\n  Do all of us like everything in the budget? Absolutely not. There is \nprobably not one Member of the Senate that says this is a perfect \nbudget. Not even Senator Domenici likes everything in this budget that \nhe worked so hard to bring out of that committee with the strong vote \nthat he did. In fact, today I voted to change the budget, to give more \nto national defense because I am so worried that we are shortchanging \nour national defense in this country, and I wanted to try to change the \npriorities.\n  Other people have been offering amendments to add to education. \nOthers have offered amendments to add to Medicare funding. Others have \noffered amendments for all different things that they think should be a \npriority.\n  But, Mr. President, this is a good, solid, balanced budget.\n  It is a balanced budget in the sense that, of course, it is going to \ntake away deficits after 7 years. But it is a balanced budget in that \nit has taken into consideration what the Federal Government should be \ndoing. And it is cut from some of the areas where the Federal \nGovernment has gotten too involved and in fact has encroached on our \nState governments and our local governments. It has cut back in those \nareas.\n  We are going back to the concept of a Federal Government that has \nspecific powers and everything is not reserved to the Federal \nGovernment. It is going to be left to the States and to the people. \nThat is the 10th amendment to the Constitution, and we are going to \nresurrect it and we are going to start with the budget that we are \ngoing to adopt tomorrow. We are going to give the power back to the \npeople and back to the governments that are closest to the people, and \nthat is where we are going to stop the spending binges from the Federal \nGovernment--and, oh, by the way, the strings that go with the spending \nbinges. That is as costly as anything we do. The strings we attach to \nthe State government when we send them the money, we are going to take \nthe strings away; we are going to send them block grants. They have the \nability to make the decisions for what is best for the people in their \nStates. They are the closest to the people, and they should be \ndetermining what their priorities are. We do not need to tell them what \nto do in Washington, DC.\n  So tomorrow is the beginning of a new day in America. It is the \nbeginning of the time that we are going to take the ship of state and \nwe are going to start the turn in the right direction. We are going to \nprovide a future for our children and grandchildren. We are going to \nkeep our promises. We are going to fulfill the mandate that the people \ngave to us.\n  The President has talked a good game. He is a great speaker. He has \nmade a lot of promises. But what has he done? He has given us a budget \nthat does not balance. He has passed the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of America. He has financed our debt with short-term borrowing. \nAnd we are going to have to pay the price down the road for that \nmistake. And he has woefully underestimated the need for a strong \nnational defense. We are going to start turning this country in the \nright direction. We started in January, and we are going to take a \nmajor step tomorrow to do the right thing for the people of this \ncountry.\n  We are working very hard, Mr. President, to do what we believe is the \nright thing to do for our children, for our senior citizens, for the \npeople that are truly needy, and for the people who are out there \nworking for a living to be able to keep the taxes that they earn for \nthemselves and not give it to the Government to determine the \npriorities for their families. And we are going to work for that small \nbusiness entrepreneur to be able to make it and to live the American \ndream and to grow and to prosper and create the jobs that will give \nothers the opportunity to live the American dream of doing better for \ntheir families than they have been able to have as they immigrated into \nour country, or as they were the first member of their family to get a \ncollege education. That is who we are working for, Mr. President, and \nthat is what this balanced budget is going to ensure will continue to \nbe the American dream. That is why we are here [[Page S7244]] tonight \nat 10:30 p.m. eastern time, to talk about the importance of doing the \nresponsible thing. The easy thing? No. The tough decisions, the right \ndecisions, and the responsible decisions that we were elected to come \nto Washington to make.\n  Mr. President, we are on the eve of a very historic time, and I am \nproud that I believe we are going to do the right thing tomorrow. The \nSenate is going to put aside all of the differences that we might have \nand priorities and pass a balanced budget that will start our 7-year \nmarch to the time when we will begin to start paying down that long-\nterm debt.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I am soon going to move to close. Does \nthe Senator from Iowa have anything further?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. No.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7243-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7244-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Forces.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7244-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO EMIGRATION LAWS AND POLICIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF \n               ROMANIA--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 51\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies of \nthe Republic of Romania as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of \nTitle IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the Act'').

A bill to increase the special assessment for felonies and \nimprove the enforcement of sentences imposing criminal fines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the crime victims assistance improvement act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto assist those who are often ignored in our ongoing struggle against \ncrime: the victims: The Crime Victims Assistance Improvement Act \nincreases and improves collection of crime fines which are deposited \ninto the crime victims fund. This fund provides desperately needed help \nto crime victims across this country.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been supported by the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, the American Legislative Exchange \nCouncil, Crimestrike, and the Arizona Department of Public Safety.\n  First, this bill doubles the mandatory special assessment charged to \nevery convicted Federal felon. The current special assessment is $50 \nfor each [[Page S7245]] individual felon, and $200 for an organization. \nThe money from these special assessments goes directly into the crime \nvictims fund. So doubling the assessments will double the amount of \nmoney going into the crime victims fund.\n  This means that more rape and assault victims will get counseling, \nmore battered women and children will get shelter, more families of \nmurder victims will get money to defray funeral expenses. It means more \nhelp for more crime victims in every State of this Nation.\n  Second, this legislation increases, to 20 years, the statute of \nlimitations for the collection of these special assessments. Currently, \nthe Government loses the right to collect this money from convicted \nfelons after 5 years, which means vital resources are lost in the \neffort to assist crime victims. Criminal debtors should not be allowed \nto get away with defying a court order to pay. Increasing the statute \nof limitations significantly increases the amount of time that the \ngovernment has to track down deadbeat criminals and make them meet \ntheir obligation.\n  This legislation also requires an enforceable payment schedule for \nspecial assessments, orders of restitution and additional fines charged \nto convicted Federal criminals. Current law only allows the judge the \noption of setting up a payment schedule. A mandatory schedule for \npayment of the money owed will enhance collections and improve debt \nmanagement. Ultimately, it means more dollars in the crime victims \nfund.\n  Fourth, this legislation prohibits delinquent criminal debtors from \nreceiving Federal benefits, such as grants, contracts, loans, \nprofessional and commercial licenses and other Federal assistance \nprograms. If convicted criminals are not meeting their financial \nobligation to crime victims, then they certainly should not be allowed \nto benefit from Federal assistance programs.\n  Fifth, the bill addresses a particularly absurd loophole in current \nlaw which allows delinquent criminal debtors to collect money from the \nCrime Victims Fund if they themselves become victims of crime. It is \nironic, and yet tragic, when a convicted criminal debtor in turn \nbecomes a victim of crime; but it is unfair that such an individual, \nwho is delinquent in payments to the crime victims fund, and has not \nmade a good faith effort to meet his or her obligation, is allowed to \nreceive assistance from the program.\n  The intent of this legislation, however, is not to deny needy people \nfrom assistance if they are making a good faith effort to meet their \nfinancial and legal obligations. Payment schedules certainly could be \namended by a court to address exigent circumstances.\n  Finally, this legislation establishes that crime victim compensation \npayments shall not be counted as income for purposes of eligibility for \nunrelated federally-funded general assistance programs.\n  Let me relate the story of a 2-year-old-boy from Iowa. After his \nfather was brutally, murdered, this boy's mother had no means of \nsupport and was placed on AFDC rolls, which qualified the family for \nMedicaid. The State victims compensation program also provided this \nyoung victim and his mother $2000 for loss of support. This one-time \ncompensation payment was considered as income, however, so the \nGovernment was forced to cut off this child's Medicaid benefits for \nnearly a year. This is not right and it must be changed.\n  Mr. President, crime continues to plague our Nation. Figures from the \nU.S. Justice Department show that one violent crime is committed in \nthis country every 16 seconds. Yet the unmet need for victim assistance \nand compensation is enormous. The number of victims' compensation \nclaims has increased by 10 to 20 percent each year for the past 5 \nyears, but many of those claims are being turned down because of a lack \nof funding.\n  In my home State of Arizona, we are receiving fewer dollars from the \ncrime victims fund at a time when serious crime is increasing. In 1993-\n94, 16 Arizona agencies that applied for crime victim assistance grants \nreceived no funding at all. The funding requests that were rejected \nincluded victim witness programs, domestic violence agencies, as well \nas child abuse and sexual assault programs.\n  The victims compensation system is also overburdened. Families with \nlimited financial resources must face the initial trauma of the crime \ncoupled with the additional concerns of medical expenses, funeral bills \nand other crime-related losses. We need more resources to help these \nvictims, especially those in financial distress, and the Crime Victims \nAssistance Improvement Act will help tremendously in this endeavor.\n  Doubling the amount of special assessments, increasing the statute of \nlimitations on collections, setting up specific payment schedules, and \nkeeping delinquent criminal debtors from benefiting from the crime \nvictims fund are effective methods for channeling money from the \ncriminals who committed the crimes to the victims who are living with \nthe aftermath. We must let criminals know that fine payment is not an \noption, it is an obligation that they must and will meet.\n  Mr. President, this legislation enhances collections of criminal debt \nand improved administration of the crime victims fund to keep pace with \nthe growing needs of crime victims, and I urge timely consideration and \npassage of this measure. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Smith, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 842.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nfor charitable contributions to certain private charities providing \nassistance to the poor thereby improving Federal welfare efforts \nthrough increased activity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                       welfare reform legislation\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the budget \nresolution, setting spending levels for the next 5 years, we do so with \nthe knowledge that one of our greatest challenges is moving our \nNation's needy from governmental dependence to economic independence. \nOne of our challenges is to ensure that hope and opportunity are \ndefining characteristics of all Americans.\n  This was the challenge 30 years ago, when the great movement \nreshaping world politics was the end of colonialism. John Kennedy \ncelebrated the ``desire to be independent,'' as the ``single most \nimportant force in the world.'' Eventually this movement revealed its \npower from Asia to Africa to South America.\n  The problem with imperialism was not just its economic exploitation. \nit was its influence on culture. It undermined traditional ways and \ninstitutions. It was inconsistent with human dignity.\n  Why? Because imperialism rewarded passivity and encouraged \ndependence. It required citizens to live by the rules of a distant \nelite. It demanded people be docile in the face of a system that they \ncould not change. It was an attack, not just on national sovereignty, \nbut on national character. What our Washington-based welfare system has \ndone, particularly to women and children, has been to fashion a new \nform of colonialism. It created an underclass that is paid to play by \nrules that lead to dependence. It rewards behavior that keeps them \npowerless. It thwarts the efforts of private and religious charitable \norganizations to care for the needy. It discourages the genuine \ncompassion of the American people. It has waged war against the human \nspirit.\n  Our goal in welfare should not be to maintain the underclass as \ncomfortably as possible as wards of the state. Yet that is precisely \nwhat has been done. Cash benefits anesthetize their suffering. Food \nstamps relieve [[Page S7246]] their hunger. Health care and housing are \nprovided. But the hope, dignity, and integrity of independence are \nforgotten.\n  Consider, just briefly, what our current welfare system has wrought. \nThe numbers alone are enough to numb the senses. Since 1965, we've \nspend more than $5 trillion--a cost higher than that of waging the \nsecond world war--fighting poverty. Yet today, there are more people \nliving in poverty than ever before, and our safety net has become more \nlike quicksand.\n  In 1965, when President Johnson launched the War on Poverty, there \nwere approximately 14.7 million children in poverty. They constituted \nabout one of every five children in America. In 1993, there were 14.6 \nmillion children in\n poverty. They constitute a little more than one in every five American \nchildren. Of all age groups, children are the most likely to be poor. \nIn 1991, a study of the poverty rates in eight industrialized nations \nrevealed that American children were almost three times as likely to be \npoor as children from the other nations studied.\n\n  The character of the poverty we face today is a deeper, more \nentrenched poverty in which generations of people are born, live, and \ndie without the experience of holding a job, owning a home, or growing \nup with a father's love and discipline.\n  Go into our inner cities--go just blocks from here--and you will meet \na generation fed on welfare and food stamps but starved of nurture and \nhope. You will meet young teens in their third pregnancy. You will meet \nchildren who are not only without a father, but do not know anyone who \nhas a father. You will talk with sixth-graders who do not know how many \ninches are in a foot, having never seen a ruler, and with first-graders \nwho do not know their ABC's or numbers because no one ever took the \ntime to teach them.\n  Thirty years ago, Robert Kennedy reflected on welfare and said this:\n\n       Opponents of welfare have always said that welfare is \n     degrading, both to the giver and the recipient. They have \n     said that it destroys self-respect, that it lowers incentive, \n     that it is contrary to American ideals. Most of us deprecated \n     and disregarded these criticisms. People were in need; \n     obviously, we felt, to help people in trouble was the right \n     thing to do. But in our urge to help, we also disregarded \n     elementary fact. For the criticisms of welfare do have a \n     center of truth, and they are confirmed by the evidence.\n\n  Robert Kennedy's warnings were not heeded.\n  The political elites that followed him have spent, and taxed, and \nredistributed wealth beyond the dreams of Roosevelt and Johnson \ncombined. But in the Government's war on poverty, poverty is winning \nand the casualties are the poor. Hope and opportunity are missing in \naction. Programs and policies that once were judged by the height of \ntheir aspirations must now be judged by the depth of their failure.\n  I have a belief that is confirmed by the record of our times. It is \nthis: The greatest, most insistent human need is not subsistence, not \nhand-outs, not dependence, but independence. Not the kind of \nindependence that suggests people do not need one another or that \nsuggests that every man is an island. Quite the opposite, the \nindependence of which I speak is the independence born of economic \nself-sufficiency and opportunity. The independence to dream, pursue, \nand fulfill our deepest wishes and our personal potential. This is \nsomething that the social architects cannot plan or build. It is not \nstructure, it is spirit. It is something that our welfare system has \nlacked for at least the past 30 years. It is a reality that we continue \nto ignore only at our peril.\n  We stand at a time of unique opportunity. There is a mainstream \nmovement of values sweeping this land. It is a movement reflected on \nthe covers of popular magazines like Newsweek and US News who lament \nthe absence of shame and the lack of fathers.\n  I believe it is time again to create a welfare system that helps, not \nhurts those it seeks to serve. That is the standard against which \nreform must be judged--not some utopian ideal, but the cold, hard \nrealities of our present welfare system.\n  Today I will introduce the Communities Involved in Caring [CIVIC] \nAct. We have neither the aspiration nor the expectation that it alone \nis the long-awaited answer to our welfare problems. But we do believe \nthat it is a significant step toward restoring the opportunities of \ndignity through independence and the access to the world of upward \nmobility.\n  This act is predicated on three fundamental beliefs. First, that \nStates need to be given maximum flexibility in reforming their welfare \nsystems. Second, that our intermediary organizations--especially \nprivate and religious charitable organizations--need to be utilized in \nwelfare reform. Third, that intermediary organizations need not only \nmoney, but volunteers, to flourish.\n\n\n                              block grants\n\n  The CIVIC Act block-grants Washington's four main welfare entitlement \nprograms--AFDC, Food Stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and \nMedicaid--to the States. It does this first by capping the spending on \nAFDC, food stamps, and SSI at either an average of fiscal year 1992-94 \nlevels, or at fiscal year 1994 levels, whichever is higher. This cap \nwould then apply for the next 5 years. For Medicaid, which is currently \ngrowing at rates exceeding 10 percent per year, spending would be \ncapped at a rolling 5-percent increase for the next 5 years.\n  These programs would then be extricated from their existing \nbureaucracies--HHS, Agriculture, et cetera--and given to the \nDepartment of Treasury to distribute to the States.\n  Treasury's oversight role would be minimal because the only \nqualifications on the block grants would be the following. First, \nStates would be required to make welfare recipients work. How best to \ndo that. The nature of the work. The level of participation. All of \nthose issues would be left to the States to determine. Second, States \nwhich decrease illegitimacy, using existing governmental statistics, \nwill be able to use a portion of their block grant for elementary and \nsecondary education or any other function they desire.\n\n\n                involvement of intermediary institutions\n\n  The CIVIC Act also provides explicit authority for States to contract \nwith intermediary organizations--including private and religious \ncharitable organizations--to help solve the welfare problem.\n  We have all heard the stories of small organizations that are hugely \nsuccessful in helping America's poor. Unfortunately, many of those \nprograms have been constrained from receiving Federal funds because all \ntoo often those Federal funds would require radical changes in the \nprogram--changes that would rob the programs of the very \ncharacteristics that make them successful.\n  Under the CIVIC Act, States would be able to utilize their Federal \nbloc-grant funds by either contracting with these organizations \ndirectly or by giving welfare recipients certificates so that they can \nchoose which programs to get involved in.\n\n\n  tax credit eligibility for volunteering at charitable organizations\n\n  The final part of the CIVIC Act makes those people who volunteer at \nleast 50 hours per year, or approximately 1 hour per week, to \ninstitutions that serve the needy, eligible for a $500 tax credit for \nmonetary donations to such charitable organizations. Just as welfare \nrecipients should work for their benefits, so our citizenry should work \nfor charitable organizations in order to receive a tax credit. It is \nall about responsibility. It is all about opportunity.\n  When he travelled through America more than 100 years ago, the great \nFrench observer Alexis de Tocqueville was struck by how caring \nAmericans were for each other. ``The Americans, . . . regard for \nthemselves,'' he wrote, ``constantly prompts them to assist one another \nand inclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and \nproperty to the welfare of [others].'' What this act seeks to undo is \n30 years of Washington discouraging that very basic American instinct \nto help one another.\n  These ideas are not new ideas. They are, in fact, ideas that have \nbeen tried, tested, and found successful. About a hundred years ago in \ncities like New York, alcoholics and addicts littered the sidewalks. \nOrphaned children roamed the streets. And if all New York City's liquor \nshops, houses of prostitution, gambling houses, and other low-life \nestablishments would have been placed on a single street, \n[[Page S7247]] they would have extended from Manhattan's city hall to \nthe city of White Plains more than 30 miles away. On that street, there \nwould have been a robbery every 165 yards and a murder every half mile. \nAnd in Brooklyn, 1 out of every 10 people got food from public \nstorehouses.\n  These pathologies met their match through society's intermediary, \nnongovernmental, organizations. Their warm-hearted and hard-headed \napproaches helped save women and children and men. As the historian \nMarvin Olasky notes, ``The solutions these reforms came up with \nforestalled an epidemic of illegitimacy and saved thousands of children \nfrom misery.''\n  I believe that as we confront our own social pathologies, we must, we \nmust do it the same way--with new ideas for the 1990's that were the \nstandard fare of the 1890's. We must meet our challenges with a greater \nrole for States and a greater role for intermediary organizations--both \nlarger ones like the Salvation Army and the Goodwill and smaller ones \nlike Best Friends and the Sunshine Mission.\n  So while the CIVIC Act begins the process of moving welfare from \nWashington to the States, it also begins the vital task of \nreinvigorating our intermediary organizations--organizations which can \nhelp meet people's deepest needs, organizations that we know will help \nsolve our welfare problems.\n  The change that we want to see will not occur overnight. Neither will \nit come without hard work and thorough debate. The end of colonialism \nwas not an easy process either. For independence means risk, the \nsacrifice of security. Economic mobility means work, hard work. But no \nnation and no people who have ever tasted the sweet fruits of freedom \nhas called for the return of its colonial rulers.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Coats, Mr. Bradley, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 847. A bill to terminate the agricultural price support and \nproduction adjustment programs for sugar, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 AGRICULTURAL PRICE SUPPORT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Reid, Bradley, \nCoats, Cohen, Lautenberg, and Kyl to announce the introduction of \nlegislation to repeal the sugar program. This legislation will \neliminate the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [USDA] price support, \nsubsidized loans, producer assessments, and marketing allotments for \nsugar.\n  The sugar program is big government at its worst. At a time when the \nAmerican people are demanding that the Federal Government assume a more \nlimited role in society, this program goes in the opposite direction. \nInstead of leaving the sugar industry to market forces, the USDA wields \nthe heavy hand of government intervention.\n  Why should Congress repeal the sugar program? That is a good \nquestion, and I will give you but a few examples:\n  It has been estimated by the General Accounting Office [GAO] that the \nprogram costs consumers and sweetener users an average of $1.4 billion \nannually. The producers who sell the most sugar reap the biggest \nbenefit. Right now, the world sugar price is half that of the United \nStates.\n  The sugar program stifles competition. In 1991, the GAO estimated \nthat 42 percent of the program's benefits went to only 1 percent of the \ngrowers. The 33 largest sugar plantations receive over $1 million each \nyear.\n  The U.S. has generally supported free and fair trade. How can we \njustify artificially inflating the price of a domestic commodity just \nto enrich and protect a particular industry? This legislation would not \nimpact existing rules on tariffs and quotas. Therefore, there would be \nno dumping of foreign sugar into the U.S. market.\n  Like most Americans, I strongly support reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit. Due to import tariffs and a 1.1 cents-per-pound tax on \nproducers, the sugar program operates a no-net-cost to the Federal \nbudget. While this is true, the program costs the American taxpayers \n$1.4 billion. The sugar program is a regressive tax, which imposes a \nmuch greater burden on those who spend a great deal on consumption. \nUnder the present system, the benefit of reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit is far outweighed by the high cost to the American consumer.\n  One of the greatest environmental crises facing the State of Florida \nis the degradation of the Everglades. The Everglades is a national \ntreasure, which is threatened by phosphate and pesticide runoff. The \nsugar program's continued high price supports have for years stimulated \noverproduction in the Everglades agricultural area. In effect, the \nFederal Government has encouraged the destruction of the Everglades \nthrough heavy-handed government intervention and misguided attempts to \nregulate the economy.\n  The repeal of the sugar program would have a minimal, if any, impact \non jobs in the sugar industry. The American sugar industry, the pro-\nsugar lobby, has estimated a job loss of 420,000. This is factually and \nstatistically untrue. The Census Bureau and the USDA have estimated \nthat the sugar industry only accounts for 46,000 jobs. In fact, even \nwith the program, sugar industry jobs fell by 18 percent between 1982 \nand 1992. It is believed by many economists that any job losses in the \nsugar industry would be offset by gains realized in the sweetener \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, the time for wasteful and inefficient commodity \nprograms like the sugar program has come to an end. I hope the Senate \nwill move quickly to pass this legislation and send a message to the \nrelatively few that benefit from this program that the American \nconsumer deserves a better deal.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join Senator \nGregg and Senator Reid to introduce legislation to eliminate the sugar \nprogram. The Federal Government has been meddling in the sugar market \nfor over 200 years, and I believe the time has come to end what has \nbecome a wasteful practice.\n  The supporters of the sugar program argue that the system operates at \nno cost to the Federal Government, and therefore there is no need to \neliminate this harmless program. Technically speaking this assertion is \ntrue; the Federal Government does not send checks to sugar growers. But \nthe federal government does artificially raise the price of sugar by \nlimiting imports, and, as a result, American consumers pay an \nadditional $1.4 billion each year for sweetened products, according to \nthe Government Accounting Office. So while Americans may not pay for \nthis program through higher taxes, they do pay for it every time they \nbuy a soda, or a candy bar, or anything else which contains sugar or \nother sweeteners.\n  The supporters of the sugar program argue that this program is vital \nto the livelihoods of family farms. Unfortunately this program, like \nmany other agricultural subsidies, was designed to help family farms, \nbut actually tends to support big businesses. Seventeen of the over \n1,700 sugarcane farms received roughly 58 percent of the benefits of \nthis program in 1991. One family in florida receives an estimated $65 \nmillion a year as a result of the artificially high prices. Mr. \nPresident, this certainly does not fall within my definition of a \n``family'' farm.\n  Finally, the supporters of the sugar program argue that the \nelimination of this program will kill the domestic sugar industry. \nWhile there will likely be some changes to the industry if this program \nis eliminated, I take issue with the argument that there is no life \nafter subsidies. During World War II, a price support system was \nestablished for potatoes. Several years later Congress abolished the \nprogram. But the potato industry remains vibrant in the United States \nto this day. From Maine to California, farmers continue to grow \npotatoes without the benefit of a subsidy they once enjoyed.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to end the sugar program. Simply \nstated, its benefits go primarily to a select few, while its costs are \nborne by every consumer in America. Because food accounts for a higher \nshare of the household budget of low-income families, these higher \ncosts are especially regressive. For the sake of these families, I hope \nthe Senate will pass this important legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7244-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7247-S7248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 230\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor \n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\nof S. 230, a bill to prohibit United States assistance to countries \nthat prohibit or restrict the transport or delivery of United States \nhumanitarian assistance.\n\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from Montana [Mr. \nBurns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 256, a bill to amend title 10, \nUnited States Code, to establish procedures for determining the status \nof certain missing members of the Armed Forces and certain civilians, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 456\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from Florida \n[Mr. Graham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 456, a bill to improve and \nstrengthen the child support collection system, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 630\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 630, a bill to \nimpose comprehensive economic sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n                                 S. 647\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] was added as a cosponsor of S. 647, a bill to amend section \n6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 \nto require phasing-in of certain amendments of or revisions to land and \nresource management plans, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 770\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the names of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun], and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 770, a bill to provide for the relocation of \nthe United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 798\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 798, a bill to amend \ntitle XVI of the Social Security Act to improve the provision of \nsupplemental security income benefits, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Connecticut \n[Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 833, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to more accurately codify the depreciable \nlife of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 34\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 34, a \njoint resolution prohibiting funds for diplomatic relations and most \nfavored nation trading status with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \nunless the President certifies to Congress that Vietnamese officials \nare being fully cooperative and forthcoming with efforts to account for \nthe 2,205 Americans still missing and otherwise unaccounted for from \nthe Vietnam War, as determined on the basis of all information \navailable to the United States Government, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7247-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7248-S7257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET CONCURRENT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                BRADLEY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1122\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Moseley-Braun, \nMr. Glenn, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Lieberman) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution (S.

SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the prohibition on scoring asset sales has discouraged \n     the sale of assets that can be better managed by the private \n     sector and generate receipts to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit;\n       (2) the President's fiscal year 1996 budget included \n     $8,000,000,000 in receipts from asset sales and proposed a \n     change in the asset sale scoring rule to allow the proceeds \n     from these sales to be scored;\n       (3) assets should not be sold if such sale would increase \n     the budget deficit over the long run; and\n       (4) the asset sale scoring prohibition should be repealed \n     and consideration should be given to replacing it with a \n     methodology that takes into account the long-term budgetary \n     impact of asset sales.\n       (b) Budgetary Treatment.--For purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the amounts realized from \n     sales of assets shall be scored with respect to the level of \n     budget authority, outlays, or revenues.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (d) Treatment of Loan Assets.--For the purposes of this \n     section, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a loan \n     shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 207. CREDIT REFORM AND GUARANTEED STUDENT LOANS.\n\n       For the purposes of allocations and points of order under \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and this resolution, the \n     cost of a direct loan shall be the net present value, at the \n     time when the direct loan is disbursed, of the following cash \n     flows for the estimated life of the loan:\n       (1) Loan disbursements.\n       (2) Repayments of principal.\n       (3) Payments of interest and other payments by or to the \n     Government over the life of the loan after adjusting for \n     estimated defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and other \n     recoveries.\n       (4) In the case of legislation increasing direct loan \n     commitments for a program in which loan commitments will \n     equal or exceed $5,000,000,000 for the coming fiscal year (or \n     for any prior fiscal year), direct expenses, including--\n       (A) activities related to credit extension, loan \n     origination, loan servicing, training, program promotion, \n     management of contractors, and payments to contractors, other \n     government entities, and program participants;\n       (B) collection of delinquent loans; and\n       (C) writeoff and closeout of loans.\n\n     SEC. 208. EXTENSION OF BUDGET ACT 60-VOTE ENFORCEMENT THROUGH \n                   2002.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as amended by sections \n     13112(b) and 13208(b)(3) of the Budget Enforcement Act of \n     1990), the second sentence of section 904(c) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (except insofar as it \n     relates to section 313 of that Act) and the final sentence of \n     section 904(d) of that Act (except insofar as it relates to \n     section 313 of that Act) shall continue to have effect as \n     rules of the Senate through (but no later than) September 30, \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 209. REPEAL OF IRS ALLOWANCE.\n\n       Section 25 of House Concurrent Resolution 218 (103d \n     Congress, 2d Session) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 210. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       The Senate adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, \n     and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of \n     the Senate, and such rules shall supersede other rules only \n     to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     the Senate) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  EXON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1124\n\n  Mr. EXON (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Bradley) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of S. 507, the False Identification Act of 1995, and I wish \nto congratulate the distinguished Senator from South Dakota for \noffering this important piece of legislation. S. 507 makes it a crime \nto transport through the mails false drivers licenses and other forms \nof ID to minors and lowers the number of false forms of ID necessary to \ntrigger criminal liability from 5 to 3. And what do children do with \nphony drivers licenses? They purchase beer and liquor, gain admittance \nto bars and taverns, and purchase pornographic materials. A lot has \nbeen said recently about the need to protect our children from growing \nup too fast. S. 507 is an important step in that direction, by striking \nat unscrupulous, profiteering adults who provide children with the \nmeans of obtaining liquor and pornography.\n  Let me be clear on one fact about this legislation and the illicit \nsale of false identification which is not mentioned in the body of S. \n507. The distribution of false ID cards directly involves interstate \ncommerce, Mr. President.\n  I ask that a copy of advertisements, from the National Examiner be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n                             Miscellaneous\n\n\n                             i.d. cards $10\n\n       Professional high quality equipment, expert settings, \n     lamination.

This publication, which is openly available at \nsupermarkets and convenience stores across the country, contains \nadvertisements for--in the words of one of the advertisements--phony \ndrivers licenses.\n  Mr. President, I submit that there is no socially redeeming use for \nphony drivers licenses. Indeed, the only conceivable use of such \ndocuments is to subvert State and Federal law. And as the Supreme Court \nrecently reaffirmed in United States verses Lopez, on page 9 of the \nslip opinion, ``The power of Congress to keep the channels of \ninterstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been \nfrequently sustained, and it is no longer open to question.'' Simply \nput, Mr. President, S. 507 helps to ensure that interstate commerce \nwill not be used to further immoral activities, like providing children \nwith phony drivers licenses so that they can purchase liquor and beer \nillegally. That is why I am pleased to support S. 507.\n  From the beginning of our country, States have prohibited the sale of \nliquor to children. S. 507 helps those States by providing Federal help \nto combat what is essentially a Federal problem--the interstate \ntransfer of false forms of ID to children. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 507.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7258-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7258-S7259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         THE DEATH OF LES ASPIN\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post \ncarried a fine editorial describing the long and distinguished public \ncareer of the Honorable Les Aspin, the former Secretary of Defense and \nour former colleague. The editorial observed that Secretary Aspin ``was \nabove all a man engaged in the most important, high-stakes issues of \nhis time.''\n  Having read this excellent account of Les Aspin's three decades of \nservice to his country, I do not know what more I could say about my \nfriend. I would accordingly ask that the editorial from today's \nWashington Post be printed in the Record, and I urge every Senator to \nread it.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 1995]\n\n                               Les Aspin\n\n       We are trying to recall a moment in the past several \n     decades when someone or other--or this political group or \n     that party wing or the other lobby--wasn't mad at Les Aspin. \n     And we come up empty. That is because the former defense \n     secretary and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, \n     who died of a stroke at the age of 56 on Sunday, was above \n     all a man engaged in the most important, high-stakes issues \n     of his time. From his days as a college academic star and \n     then a Defense Department whiz kid, as an internal government \n     Vietnam War critic, a teacher and, for 22 years, a member of \n     Congress from Wisconsin, Les Aspin never [[Page S7259]] lost \n     either his capacity to master the most complicated issues of \n     public policy or his frankly kid-like, ebullient enthusiasm \n     for trying to resolve them. He was also a politician, and \n     generally a pretty successful one.\n       Some of the problems Mr. Aspin had, especially on the Hill, \n     were the all but inevitable lot of anyone trying to navigate \n     the shoals of military defense policy in a (then) majority \n     Democratic Party that was bitterly and irreconcilably divided \n     between hawks and doves; unsurprisingly, his maneuverings as \n     chairman of Armed Services frequently infuriated one or the \n     other side, especially in the unending struggle over \n     developing weapons systems. His own inclinations evolved from \n     the more dovish to the more hawkish over the years. As Bill \n     Clinton's first defense secretary, Mr. Aspin had the equally \n     challenging job of trying to reconcile Pentagon thinking with \n     Democratic Party thinking in the matter of Mr. Clinton's \n     proposals for altering the status of gays in the military. \n     His most notable accomplishment as secretary was the review \n     of Pentagon budgeting and procurement procedures that he \n     worked up in his 11 months there. His most notable public \n     stand was that taken--rightly, in our view--in support of \n     President Bush's policy on Kuwait at a time when so many \n     other Democratic Party leaders in Congress were in doubt or \n     in flight.\n       Mr. Aspin was humiliated by being pushed out of the Defense \n     Department by Mr. Clinton and the other rivalrous members of \n     Mr. Clinton's national security team. But the thing about the \n     former defense secretary was that he couldn't stay humiliated \n     or give vent to personal bitterness over such things. He came \n     back to serve as head of the Clinton advisory group reviewing \n     national intelligence. The faults for which Mr. Aspin was \n     allegedly fired--imprecision, inability to manage the huge \n     defense establishment and slowness in coming to clear-cut \n     action decisions--were presumably real. Such defects would \n     certainly go with the general makeup of the man: \n     intellectually restless, always turning the thing over and \n     over in his mind, more given to trying to imagine and grasp \n     all the aspects of a problem than to measuring or indexing \n     them. We can understand how this came to grief for Mr. Aspin \n     in the Clinton administration. But you need only read the \n     recently published confessional book by Mr. Aspin's \n     predecessor and onetime employer, Robert McNamara, to \n     understand, as well, that an opposite, superefficient turn of \n     mind is not exactly the key to defense policy salvation. \n     Maybe Les Aspin was the wrong man for his months in the \n     Clinton Cabinet. The same cannot in any respect be said of \n     his roughly three decades of productive public \n     service.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7258-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DICK COMBS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the death \nof a close friend, Mr. Dick Combs. Dick died last Wednesday from \ncomplications after heart surgery.\n  Over the years, he touched the lives of many people in northern \nKentucky. Dick was a very special man, but one thing in particular made \nhim one of a kind. It was his trademark green comb. Everytime he \nintroduced himself to someone he would hand them a green pocket comb \nwith his name on it. There's probably not a person in northern Kentucky \nthat hasn't combed his or her hair with a comb from Dick. But this \nwasn't his only trademark, he was also seen nearly everyday driving \naround town in his 1968 red convertible Ford Mustang, smiling and \nwaving to everyone he passed. And who could forget his old fishing hat, \nan item he would never leave the house without.\n  The World War II veteran was elected Kenton County commissioner in \n1984, a victory that is in the record books and the subject of \npolitical trivia questions across the Bluegrass State. Dick was the \nfirst Republican in 75 years to win a seat on the fiscal court. He also \nserved as a member of the Kenton County GOP executive committee, the \nNorthern Kentucky Area Planning Commission, the Boone-Kenton Cable TV \nBoard, and he was a founding member of the Northern Kentucky Salvation \nArmy Advisory Board.\n  With all his political activities you would think that Dick wouldn't \nhave time for anything else. But that wasn't the case, he always found \ntime for his true loves: his family and his community.\n  He kept busy in the community by getting involved in the Fort \nMitchell Kiwanis and Optimist clubs, the Northern Kentucky Chamber of \nCommerce, and the American Animal Association. His care and support for \nstray animals was even recognized by the animal rights community, who \nendorsed his candidacy. Dick would go out of his way to help his animal \nfriends. He would even go as far as leaving his garage door open at \nnight so any stray animal could have a safe haven from the elements.\n  Dick was also a deacon at Fort Mitchell Baptist Church for more than \n35 years. There wasn't a Sunday that went by that Dick wasn't standing \noutside the church greeting every parishioner that walked through the \ndoors. To some it may have seemed like a small gesture, but to \nchurchgoers it wasn't a Sunday without seeing his smiling face. His \nabsence at church last Sunday was felt by members young and old, \nincluding a young boy who cried when he didn't see Dick at the church's \ndoor.\n  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in extending my heartfelt \nsympathy and prayers to his family and to all those whose lives he \ntouched. Dick, will be missed.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7259-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7259-S7261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    THE 40TH ANNUAL DETAILED FINANCIAL REPORT OF SENATOR PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it has been my practice in each of \nthe 40 years I have spent in public life to volunteer a detailed \naccounting of my finances.\n  I ask that my financial report for 1994 be printed in the Record.\n  The financial report and related announcement follow:\n\n                              ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n       For the 40th consecutive year that he has held public \n     office, U.S. Senator Paul Simon, D-Ill., has released a \n     detailed description of his income, assets and liabilities.\n       Simon has been making the voluntary annual statements \n     longer than any other national officeholder. Simon set his \n     policy when he left the newspaper publishing business he had \n     established to enter public service during his eight years in \n     the Illinois House of Representatives, six years in the \n     Illinois Senate, four years as lieutenant governor, 10 years \n     in the U.S. House of Representatives and now 10 years in the \n     U.S. Senate. The listing predates disclosure requirements of \n     state and federal law and continues to exceed those \n     requirements. Senate rules today require only the listing of \n     income within broad brackets. Simon's practice also has set \n     the standard for many officeholders in Illinois.\n       Simon also continues to exceed Senate requirements by \n     listing detailed income for his wife, Jeanne.\n       The Illinois senator lists 1994 income for himself and \n     Jeanne Simon totaling $206,287. The figure includes Paul \n     Simon's Senate salary, Jeanne Simon's per diem compensation \n     as chair of the National Commission on Library and \n     Information Science, and reimbursements to Paul and Jeanne \n     Simon for travel and other expenses.\n       The Simons had assets of $514,579.79 and liabilities of \n     $124,667.44 for a net worth of $389,912.35. Earlier \n     disclosures have shown Simon  to be one of the least wealthy \n     members of the United States Senate.\n       The detailed 1994 financial report of Senator Paul Simon \n

LUM, RETIRING PROFESSOR OF MUSIC, EMERITUS, AT \n                        THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is a pleasure and a privilege for \nme to rise today on the floor of the Senate to honor my dear friend and \ncollege classmate, Prof. Richard ``Dick'' S. Lum, on his retirement \nfrom the University of Hawaii after a lifetime of dedicated service to \nthe students and people of Hawaii. He retires after a distinguished 25-\nyear tenure as director of bands at the university and professor of \nmusic, emeritus.\n  Professor Lum's contribution to concert and band music has brought \nhim many well-deserved accolades and honors. In the span of his long \nmusical career, he has earned and garnered more awards and has been \nrecognized by more organizations than any other person I can think of. \nMahalo, Dick, for your complete commitment to music.\n  Professor Lum has been rightfully credited for building our State's \nconcert and marching bands into nationally recognized organizations. He \nlaid the foundation for the McKinley High School Band to gain national \nprominence and is the person primarily responsible for the growth of \nband programs in Hawaii. His vision, hard work, and grooming of young \nband directors made possible the tremendous growth of the many fine \nprograms that exist today.\n  Dick served as president of the Hawaii Music Educators Association \nand is the founder and past president of the Oahu Band Directors \nAssociation. He was also State chairman of the College Band Directors \nNational Association and the National Band Association. He has guest \nconducted the United States of America Armed Services Bicentennial Band \nfrom Ft. Meade, MD, the University of Tennessee Band, the Arizona State \nUniversity Band, and other outstanding university bands. In 1971, \nRichard was invited to membership in the American Bandmasters \nAssociation, and in 1973, was inducted into the prestigious Phi Beta Mu \nas honorary national member. In 1978, he was selected by the School \nMusician Magazine as one of the outstanding conductors in the United \nStates and Canada for the school year 1974-75. In 1979, he was selected \nby the All-American magazine as Band Director of the Year.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me, his family, friends, \nand peers in honoring Prof. Richard S. Lum for this outstanding \ncontribution to music in our State and country. Mahalo, Dick, for \neverything you have done for music in your lifetime, and your \nexcellence in service. Thank you for a job well-done and may God's \nblessing be with you and your family.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7261-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7261-S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          RELIGION IN SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on May 17 the Christian Coalition \nannounced its ``Contract With the American Family,'' a cornerstone of \nwhich is a constitutional amendment to allow ``communal prayer in \npublic places, such as schools, high school graduation ceremonies, and \ncourthouses.''\n  The coalition's ``communal prayer'' proposal will surely provide the \nbasis for some spirited debate in Congress in the upcoming months. \nBefore this debate begins, however, I think it is crucial for people on \nboth sides of these issues to understand fully the current state of the \nlaw regarding prayer in schools and other public places. Only by \nunderstanding what is and is not allowed under current Supreme Court \ncases involving the Constitution's religion clauses and under other \nlaws regarding religion can we intelligently determine whether the \nproposed changes to these laws make sense.\n  In the hopes of beginning this educational process, I will ask to \nhave printed in the Record a short report entitled ``Religion in the \nPublic Schools: A Joint Statement of Current Law.'' This publication, \nprepared with the endorsements of 35 organizations, sets forth in a \ndetailed and clear way the state of the law regarding numerous \nreligion/school issues: from the question of what types of student \nprayer are constitutionally protected, to the question of whether \nstudents may be exempted from wearing particular types of gym clothing \nthat they regard, on religious grounds, as immodest.\n  As the preface to this report states: ``On some of the issues \ndiscussed in this summary, some of the organizations, have urged the \ncourts to reach positions different than they did.'' However, the 35 \norganizations that have issued this report agree that the statements on \nthe law included in the report provide an accurate overview of the law \nregarding religion in schools. Given this agreement, the report \nprovides a valuable service to those of us striving to understand these \nimportant and highly charged issues.\n  At the outset of the debate, I have heard a lot about how our courts \nhave kept and continue to keep religion out of our schools. It is my \nhope that this report will help demonstrate that the relationship \nbetween religion and education is in fact a far more complex one that \ncannot be described in absolute terms. Religion and education coexist \ntoday in a delicate balance, and if we choose to disrupt this balance, \nwe should understand exactly what we are doing. This report is an \nimportant step in the direction of understanding, and I urge each of my \ncolleagues to devote some time to it in the upcoming weeks.\n  I ask that the report be printed in the Record.\n  The report follows:\nReligion in the Public Schools: A Joint Statement of Current Law, April \n                                  1995\n\n       The Constitution permits much private religious activity in \n     and about the public schools. Unfortunately, this aspect of \n     constitutional law is not as well known as it should be. Some \n     say that the Supreme Court has declared the public schools \n     ``religion-free zones'' or that the law is so murky that \n     school officials cannot know what is legally permissible. The \n     former claim is simply wrong. And as to the latter, while \n     there are some difficult issues, much has been settled. It is \n     also unfortunately true that public school officials, due to \n     their busy schedules, may not be as fully aware of this body \n     of law as they could be. As a result, in some school \n     districts some of these rights are not being \n     observed. [[Page S7262]] \n       The organizations whose names appear below span the \n     ideological, religious and political spectrum. They \n     nevertheless share a commitment both to the freedom of \n     religious practice and to the separation of church and state \n     such freedom requires. In that spirit, we offer this \n     statement of consensus on current law as an aid to parents, \n     educators and students.\n       Many of the organizations listed below are actively \n     involved in litigation about religion in the schools. On some \n     of the issues discussed in this summary, some of the \n     organizations have urged the courts to reach positions \n     different than they did. Though there are signatories on both \n     sides which have and will press for different constitutional \n     treatments of some of the topics discussed below, they all \n     agree that the following is an accurate statement of what the \n     law currently is.\n\n\n                            student prayers\n\n       1. Students have the right to pray individually or in \n     groups or to discuss their religious views with their peers \n     so long as they are not disruptive. Because the Establishment \n     Clause does not apply to purely private speech, students \n     enjoy the right to read their bibles or other scriptures, say \n     grace before meals, pray before tests, and discuss religion \n     with other willing student listeners. In the classroom \n     students have the right to pray quietly except when required \n     to be actively engaged in school activities (e.g., students \n     may not decide to pray just as a teacher calls on them). In \n     informal settings, such as the cafeteria or in the halls, \n     students may pray either audibly or silently, subject to the \n     same rules of order as apply to other speech in these \n     locations. However, the right to engage in voluntary prayer \n     does not include, for example, the right to have a captive \n     audience listen or to compel other students to participate.\n                  Graduation Prayer and Baccalaureates\n\n       2. School officials may not mandate or organize prayer at \n     graduation, nor may they organize a religious baccalaureate \n     ceremony. If the school generally rents out its facilities to \n     private groups, it must rent them out on the same terms, and \n     on a first-come first-served basis, to organizers of \n     privately sponsored religious baccalaureate services, \n     provided that the school does not extend preferential \n     treatment to the baccalaureate ceremony and the school \n     disclaims official endorsement of the program.\n       3. The courts have reached conflicting conclusions under \n     the federal Constitution on student-initiated prayer at \n     graduation. Until the issue is authoritively resolved, \n     schools should ask their lawyers what rules apply in their \n     area.\n\n\n     Official Participation or Encouragement of Religious Activity\n\n       4. Teachers and school administrators, when acting in those \n     capacities, are representatives of the state, and, in those \n     capacities, are themselves prohibited from encouraging or \n     soliciting student religious or anti-religious activity. \n     Similarly, when acting in their official capacities, teachers \n     may not engage in religious activities with their students. \n     However, teachers may engage in private religious activity in \n     faculty lounges.\n\n\n                        Teaching About Religion\n\n       5. Students may be taught about religion, but public \n     schools may not teach religion. As the U.S. Supreme Court has \n     repeatedly said, ``[i]t might well be said that one's \n     education is not complete without a study of comparative \n     religion, or the history of religion and its relationship to \n     the advancement of civilization.'' It would be difficult to \n     teach art, music, literature and most social studies without \n     considering religious influences.\n       The history of religion, comparative religion, the Bible \n     (or other scripture)-as-literature (either as a separate \n     course or within some other existing course), are all \n     permissible public school subjects. It is both permissible \n     and desirable to teach objectively about the role of religion \n     in the history of the United States and other countries. One \n     can teach that the Pilgrims came to this country with a \n     particular religious vision, that Catholics and others have \n     been subject to persecution or that many of those \n     participating in the abolitionist, women's suffrage and civil \n     rights movements had religious motivations.\n       6. These same rules apply to the recurring controversy \n     surrounding theories of evolution. Schools may teach about \n     explanations of life on earth, including religious ones (such \n     as ``creationism''), in comparative religion or social \n     studies classes. In science class, however, they may present \n     only genuinely scientific critiques of, or evidence for, any \n     explanation of life on earth, but not religious critiques \n     (beliefs unverifiable by scientific methodology). Schools may \n     not refuse to teach evolutionary theory in order to avoid \n     giving offense to religion nor may they circumvent these \n     rules by labeling as science an article of religious faith. \n     Public schools must not teach as scientific fact or theory \n     any religious doctrine, including ``creationism,'' although \n     any genuinely scientific evidence for or against any \n     explanation of life may be taught. Just as they may neither \n     advance nor inhibit any religious doctrine, teachers should \n     not ridicule, for example, a student's religious explanation \n     for life on earth.\n\n\n                    student assignments and religion\n\n       7. Students may express their religious beliefs in the form \n     of reports, homework and artwork, and such expressions are \n     constitutionally protected. Teachers may not reject or \n     correct such submissions simply because they include a \n     religious symbol or address religious themes. Likewise, \n     teachers may not require students to modify, include or \n     excise religious views in their assignments, if germane. \n     These assignments should be judged by ordinary academic \n     standards of substance, relevance, appearance and grammar.\n       8. Somewhat more problematic from a legal point of view are \n     other public expressions of religious views in the classroom. \n     Unfortunately for school officials, there are traps on either \n     side of this issue, and it is possible that litigation will \n     result no matter what course is taken. It is easier to \n     describe the settled cases than to state clear rules of law. \n     Schools must carefully steer between the claims of student \n     speakers who assert a right to express themselves on \n     religious subjects and the asserted rights of student \n     listeners to be free of unwelcome religious persuasion in a \n     public school classroom.\n       a. Religious or anti-religious remarks made in the ordinary \n     course of classroom discussion or student presentations are \n     permissible and constitute a protected right. If in a sex \n     education class a student remarks that abortion should be \n     illegal because God has prohibited it, a teacher should not \n     silence the remark, ridicule it, rule it out of bounds or \n     endorse it, any more than a teacher may silence a student's \n     religiously-based comment in favor of choice.\n       b. If a class assignment calls for an oral presentation on \n     a subject of the student's choosing, and, for example, the \n     student responds by conducting a religious service, the \n     school has the right--as well as the duty--to prevent itself \n     from being used as a church. Other students are not \n     voluntarily in attendance and cannot be forced to become an \n     unwilling congregation.\n       c. Teachers may rule out-of-order religious remarks that \n     are irrelevant to the subject at hand. In a discussion of \n     Hamlet's sanity, for example, a student may not interject \n     views on creationism.\n\n\n                  distribution of religious literature\n\n       9. Students have the right to distribute religious \n     literature to their schoolmates, subject to those reasonable \n     time, place, and manner or other constitutionally-acceptable \n     restrictions imposed on the distribution of all non-school \n     literature. Thus, a school may confine distribution of all \n     literature to a particular table at particular times. It may \n     not single out religious literature for burdensome \n     regulation.\n       10. Outsiders may not be given access to the classroom to \n     distribute religious or anti-religious literature. No court \n     has yet considered whether, if all other community groups are \n     permitted to distribute literature in common areas of public \n     schools, religious groups must be allowed to do so on equal \n     terms subject to reasonable time, place and manner \n     restrictions.\n\n\n                        ``see you at the pole''\n\n       11. Student participation in before- or after-school \n     events, such as ``see you at the pole,'' is permissible. \n     School officials, acting in an official capacity, may neither \n     discourage nor encourage participation in such an event.\n\n\n            religious persuasion versus religious harassment\n\n       12. Students have the right to speak to, and attempt to \n     persuade, their peers about religious topics just as they do \n     with regard to political topics. But school officials should \n     intercede to stop student religious speech if it turns into \n     religious harassment aimed at a student or a small group of \n     students. While it is constitutionally permissible for a \n     student to approach another and issue an invitation to attend \n     church, repeated invitations in the face of a request to stop \n     constitute harassment. Where this line is to be drawn in \n     particular cases will depend on the age of the students and \n     other circumstances.\n                            equal access act\n\n       13. Student religious clubs in secondary schools must be \n     permitted to meet and to have equal access to campus media to \n     announce their meetings, if a school receives federal funds \n     and permits any student non-curricular club to meet during \n     non-instructional time. This is the command of the Equal \n     Access Act. A non-curricular club is any club not related \n     directly to a subject taught or soon-to-be taught in the \n     school. Although schools have the right to ban all non-\n     curriculum clubs, they may not dodge the law's requirement by \n     the expedient of declaring all clubs curriculum-related. On \n     the other hand, teachers may not actively participate in club \n     activities and ``non-school persons'' may not control or \n     regularly attend club meeting.\n       The Act's constitutionality has been upheld by the Supreme \n     Court, rejecting claims that the Act violates the \n     Establishment Clause. The Act's requirements are described in \n     more detail in The Equal Access Act and the Public Schools: \n     Questions and Answers on the Equal Access Act*, a pamphlet \n     published by a broad spectrum of religious and civil \n     liberties groups.\n\n\n                           religious holidays\n\n       14. Generally, public schools may teach about religious \n     holidays, and may celebrate the secular aspects of the \n     holiday and objectively teach about their religious aspects. \n     They may not observe the holidays as religious events. \n     Schools should generally excuse students who do not wish to \n     participate in holiday events. Those interested in further \n     details should see Religious Holidays in [[Page S7263]] the \n     Public Schools: Questions and Answers*, a pamphlet published \n     by a broad spectrum of religious and civil liberties groups.\n\n\n             excusal from religiously-objectionable lessons\n\n       15.Schools enjoy substantial discretion to excuse \n     individual students from lessons which are objectionable to \n     that student or to his or her parent on the basis of \n     religion. Schools can exercise that authority in ways which \n     would defuse many conflicts over curriculum content. If it is \n     proved that particular lessons substantially burden a \n     student's free exercise of religion and if the school cannot \n     prove a compelling interest in requiring attendance the \n     school would be legally required to excuse the student.\n                            teaching values\n\n       16. Schools may teach civic virtues, including honesty, \n     good citizenship, sportsmanship, courage, respect for the \n     rights and freedoms of others, respect for persons and their \n     property, civility, the dual virtues of moral conviction and \n     tolerance and hard work. Subject to whatever rights of \n     excusal exist (see para.15 above) under the federal \n     Constitution and state law, schools may teach sexual \n     abstinence and contraception; whether and how schools teach \n     these sensitive subjects is a matter of educational policy. \n     However, these may not be taught as religious tenets. The \n     mere fact that most, if not all, religions also teach these \n     values does not make it unlawful to teach them.\n\n\n                              student garb\n\n       17. Religious messages on T-shirts and the like may not be \n     singled out for suppression. Students may wear religious \n     attire, such as yarmulkes and head scarves, and they may not \n     be forced to wear gym clothes that they regard, on religious \n     grounds, as immodest.\n\n\n                             released time\n\n       18. Schools have the discretion to dismiss students to off-\n     premises religious instruction, provided that schools do not \n     encourage or discourage participation or penalize those who \n     do not attend. Schools may not allow religious instruction by \n     outsiders on premises during the school day.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7261-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the tragedy that took place on \nApril 19 at the Federal building in Oklahoma City was an unspeakable \nhorror. This was a cowardly and heinous act by deranged people whose \nobsessions led to the killing of innocent men, women, and children. I \nwant the people who perpetrated this act to be hunted down and to be \nappropriately, quickly, and harshly dealt with by our criminal justice \nsystem.\n   The tragic bombing at Oklahoma City has sparked a debate in our \ncountry about how to prevent a tragedy of this type from occurring \nagain. It is important to understand that in a free country it is \nvirtually impossible to provide any ironclad protection against the \nviolent acts of deranged people. But part of being free is the \nrequirement to ensure civil order. That is the job that we ask our law \nenforcement officials to do.\n   The question we must now ask ourselves is how can we protect \nAmericans without infringing on the liberties guaranteed by the \nConstitution. People have a constitutional right to criticize their \ngovernment and the institutions of this Nation. This right not only \napplies to people we like--our neighbors and our friends--it also \napplies to people we do not like and associations we do not care for. \nThis right must be preserved.\n   The Oklahoma City bombing has also sparked a debate about militia \ngroups in our country. People have every right to join organizations. \nHowever, I have heard some militia leaders say the Federal Government \nis their avowed enemy when they have been interviewed on television \nprograms. Some of them talk in terms of violence and battles. I think \nthat is an unhealthy attitude and I think that thinking can lead to \nviolence.\n   I want to emphasize my commitment to preserving the fundamental \nfreedoms that are guaranteed to all Americans under our Constitution. \nBut I also want to emphasize that I join those in our country who want \nto send a message to the people who cross the line between criticizing \nour government and advocating or resorting to violence or terrorism. \nThere is no constitutional right to commit violence in our country. \nThere is no constitutional right to kill innocent men, women, and \nchildren. And those who do should be dealt with aggressively by our law \nenforcement agencies.\n   It is important that we discuss these issues in a thoughtful, \nreasonable, and constructive way. In America, we can disagree without \nbeing disagreeable. We can have a debate without shouting. And we can \nwork together to fix things that are wrong in this country and to make \nthis a better place. Most importantly, we should protect and cherish \nour constitutional rights. One of those rights is to live in a free \ncountry--free from the unspeakable horrors that were perpetrated on \ninnocent people in Oklahoma City.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7263-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         IN HONOR OF ABBA EBAN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise this morning to honor a \ngreat statesman on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n  Abba Eban--statesman, diplomat, scholar, and author--was born in \nSouth Africa on February 2, 1915. As a young man growing up in London, \nMr. Eban learned fluent Hebrew and became an active member of the \nZionist movement.\n  He studied at Cambridge University, and became a lecturer in Hebrew, \nArabic, and Persian literature.\n  Mr. Eban served in World War II, where he was assigned to Jerusalem \nas liaison officer of Allied Headquarters. After the war, he entered \nthe service of the Jewish agency in Jerusalem. In 1947, he became the \nagency's liaison officer with the U.N. Special Commission on Palestine.\n  In 1948, Mr. Eban was appointed as Israel's representative to the \nUnited Nations and in this capacity, he appeared before the General \nAssembly to plead successfully for his country's admission to the \nUnited Nations.\n  In 1950, Abba Eban was appointed Israel's Ambassador to the United \nStates. At 35, he was the youngest person to hold such a high rank in \nWashington's diplomatic corps.\n  In 1959, after returning to Israel, Mr. Eban was elected to the \nIsraeli Knesset as a member of the Labor Party. He joined the Cabinet \nas Minister Without Portfolio, was appointed Minister of Education and \nCulture in 1960, and in 1963, he became Deputy Prime Minister under \nPrime Minister Levi Eshkol.\n  In 1966, Mr. Eban became Israel's Minister for Foreign Affairs, a \nposition he held until June 1974.\n  Through the years, Mr. Eban has been recognized in numerous arenas \nfor his diplomatic prowess and his contributions to the state of \nIsrael. He holds honorary doctorates from several universities, \nincluding New York University, Boston University, the University of \nMaryland, and the University of Cincinnati. He is a fellow of the World \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, and the only living member of the \nOrator's Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Eban recently served as host and narrator of ``Israel: A Nation \nis Born,'' a five-part historical television mini-series, documenting \n40 years of Israel's history.\n  Mr. President, the Israeli people have been fortunate to count Mr. \nEban among their leaders. He has consistently represented the Jewish \nstate with dignity, with strength and with aplomb. As he celebrates \nthis birthday, we should all take this opportunity to celebrate his \nmany accomplishments.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7263-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7263-S7267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               HYDROGEN--AN ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE FUTURE\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have long advocated greater \ninvestment in the development of sustainable hydrogen energy. Hydrogen \nhas a tremendous potential to be the energy carrier of the future. It \nis an ideal energy source as it is plentiful, efficient and clean \nburning. An excellent article describing the many advantages of \nhydrogen as an energy source appeared in the March 19, 1995 edition of \nthe Los Angeles Times Magazine. I urge all of my colleagues to read \nthis article and I ask that the text of the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Los Angeles Times Magazine, March 3, 1995]\n\n                          Harnessing the Big H\n\n\nHydrogen Seems the Ideal Energy Source--Plentiful, Efficient and Clean. \n       Can Something This Perfect Be Real? Just Ask the Japanese\n\n                           (By Alan Weisman)\n\n       West of Denver, Interstate 70 enters Golden, Colo., and \n     begins to curl through the foothills of the Rockies. There is \n     bisects an unassuming clump of brick buildings--the National \n     Renewable Energy Laboratory. [[Page S7264]] Among the \n     government's national laboratories, NREL is modest, operating \n     on a fraction of the billions commanded by atomic research \n     giants like Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. \n     Inside, there are no monstrous particle accelerators; \n     experiments here are more likely to proceed in test-tube \n     racks, bell jars and small glass beakers, like the one John \n     Turner is filling with a clear solution of water and \n     household lye.\n       Turner, a chemist with a graying blond beard and gold-\n     rimmed glasses, sticks a narrow glass slide, coated on one \n     end with a black, mica-like substance, into the lye solution. \n     The humming lab ventilators mask the sound of the vehicles \n     whizzing by on the nearby interstate, but Turner has spent \n     most of his career here, and during those years he's always \n     had the cars in mind. As he aims a pencil-thin beam from a \n     high-intensity lamp at the flask, he puts it this way: \n     ``Suppose someone announced he intended to ship millions of \n     gallons of a carcinogenic, explosive fluid that emits toxic \n     fumes through our downtown and then store it underground in \n     our neighborhoods. People would rise up in anger, right?''\n       Wrong. Just outside on I-70, cars are spraying residues of \n     that very poison all over the mountains. After 11 decades of \n     tinkering, their internal combustion engines are miracles of \n     technology with hundreds of moving parts. Yet various laws of \n     physics still limit their ability to extract energy from \n     petroleum. Nearly three-fourths of its potential simply \n     radiates away or pours, partly combusted, out the tailpipe, \n     rising in geologic layers of brown murk until the Rockies \n     themselves dwindle to ghostly smudges.\n       John Turner is among a cadre of scientists trying to \n     suppress what he regards as humanity's most pervasive, and \n     self-inflicted, epidemic. In a little more than a century, \n     since Thomas Alva Edison invented the light bulb and Henry \n     Ford began to mass-produce automobiles, man-made energy has \n     become the most addictive drug in history. Everybody today \n     was born into the this dependency: No one any longer can \n     imagine life without electricity or motorized vehicles. To \n     slake our craving, we must dose ourselves and our \n     surroundings daily with deadly filth. This ritual is now \n     doomed to spread, as China, India and other developing \n     nations bestow family cars and refrigerators upon 2 billion \n     new recruits to the industrial age.\n       Getting an entire world to kick a habit is futile, so \n     Turner is trying to at least find us a clean needle. As the \n     beam strikes the shiny black square centimeter of \n     semiconductor glued to the submerged portion of his slide, \n     the surrounding liquid begins to fizz. Electrons stimulated \n     by light, he explains, are rushing to the semiconductor's \n     surface, hitting water molecules and splitting them into \n     their component parts: oxygen and hydrogen.\n       He watches the tiny bubbles rise. ``For years,'' he says, \n     ``this has been the Holy Grail of photoelectric chemists. \n     We're witnessing the direct conversion of solar energy into \n     hydrogen.''\n       Cape Canaveral, June, 1994: A group of visiting scientists \n     and engineers is touring the John F. Kennedy Space Center in \n     blue-and-white air-conditioned buses. They're here for the \n     World Hydrogen Energy Conference, a biennial event born of \n     the energy crisis 20 years earlier. Although the price of \n     petroleum has since calmed considerably (adjusted for \n     inflation, it's actually cheaper than pre-1973), a \n     groundswell of concern, coupled with numerous breakthroughs, \n     has ballooned this gathering to nearly 600 researchers from \n     34 countries. They've come to Canaveral this year for \n     inspiration: The huge tank on the pad, where the shuttle \n     Columbia will presently lift spaceward, is filled with pure \n     hydrogen.\n       Since even before the moon shots, all U.S. astronauts' \n     heat, electricity and drinking water have been derived from \n     hydrogen. The U.S. space program is the first step toward \n     realizing these scientists' dream: to switch the planet from \n     an economy fueled with dirty coal and petroleum to one run on \n     clean hydrogen.\n       The idea of something so ubiquitous--hydrogen is the most \n     abundant element composing three-fourths of the mass of the \n     universe--replacing diminishing fossil fuels seems the stuff \n     of fiction. Once, in fact, it was: In 1870, Jules Verne's \n     ``Mysterious Island'' described a world that would one day \n     derive ``an inexhaustible source of heat and light'' from \n     water's component parts.\n       Back then, Verne didn't realize that this source was also \n     virtually pollution-free. The cycle is so elegant it seems \n     nearly miraculous: Separate water into its two constituent \n     gases, hydrogen and oxygen. Burn the hydrogen for fuel, and \n     it re-couples with oxygen to form water again. No nasty \n     particulates, no insidious carbon monoxide, no eye-stinging \n     ozone or sulfur dioxide (at high temperatures, however, \n     small, controllable amounts of nitrous oxides can form when \n     hydrogen is burned in the presence of air). Mainly, though, \n     hydrogen's exhaust is plain water vapor--which can then be \n     recaptured and neatly converted again to hydrogen.\n       According to Bill Hoagland, founder of NREL's hydrogen \n     program, it would take less than a gallon of water to get the \n     same range from hydrogen that cars currently get from a \n     gallon of gasoline. Because hydrogen can be made anywhere. \n     I'm told repeatedly, there would be no more dependency on \n     imported oil. No more OPEC. Maybe no more global warming, \n     either, because it emits no greenhouse gases. As for \n     hydrogen's unfortunate association with bombs and blimps, \n     like the ill-fated Hindenburg, Hoagland reminds me that \n     fossil fuels also readily explode, and studies rate hydrogen \n     safer because it's nontoxic and dissipates quickly.\n       It seems like the perfect fuel. Yet, these scientists \n     insist, it's been under-researched, under-funded and \n     virtually ignored in Detroit, which perseveres in its \n     allegiance to petroleum, and in Washington, which persists in \n     keeping troops ready to defend the Persian Gulf.\n       So why aren't we leaping at this chance to end pollution, \n     energy wars and economic bondage to a few privileged \n     locations that float atop the earth's ebbing supplies of oil? \n     Much of it comes down to money and the seemingly \n     incontestable reign of the petroleum industry. Unlike natural \n     gas, to which hydrogen is often compared, you can't dig a \n     hole and find it. To tap hydrogen's energy, you have to \n     expend energy because it's always combined with something \n     else. Having to un-combine it makes it more expensive, at \n     least in the near term, than crude petroleum products, \n     including natural gas. And no alternative-energy constituency \n     has the clout to buck powerful fossil-fuel lobbies and find a \n     way to pay for retrofitting the world for a brand-new \n     technology.\n       Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy allots hydrogen \n     about one-ninetieth of what it spends on continuing petroleum \n     research. (And two-thirds of the DOE's budget doesn't go for \n     energy at all, but for nuclear weapons research and cleanup.) \n     Nor has the public thus far demonstrated much interest in \n     trading the ease of dirty energy, available at the turn of an \n     ignition key or click of a light switch, for a major \n     commitment to something cleaner and renewable.\n       Yet the learned crowd gathered at the World Hydrogen \n     Conference is convinced that hydrogen's time must come. \n     Fossil fuels will become expensive again; even today, their \n     true price isn't revealed at the gas pump, where the numbers \n     don't include the cost of pollution and the expense of \n     protecting our interests in the Persian Gulf.\n       Other countries are less reluctant about hydrogen than the \n     United States. Two years ago, Japan, an island nation \n     frightened by the prospect of rising seas if the icecaps \n     start to melt, unveiled a multibillion-dollar, 28-year \n     program to form a global hydrogen system. The Japanese are \n     talking power plants, cars, buses, planes, ships and rockets, \n     all over the world, all fueled with renewable hydrogen.\n       And there's a recent surprise announcement by Daimler-Benz, \n     the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, that has excited many \n     people here: The German auto maker claims it has cleared the \n     major obstacles to producing the first commercially viable \n     hydrogen-powered automobile. Unless Mercedes is just trying \n     to spook the competition, hydrogen's prospects have suddenly \n     improved faster than anyone dared hope. The Mercedes in \n     question runs on a fuel cell, a refillable device that, like \n     a battery, chemically converts fuel directly to electricity \n     without having to burn it. Fuel cells can function on \n     methanol or natural gas, but with hydrogen, they're up to \n     three times more efficient than conventional engines.\n       The most advanced models, including the one Daimler-Benz \n     uses, come from the Vancouver-based Ballard Power Systems \n     Inc., which designed fuel cells for the Canadian defense \n     department, using technology NASA developed for the Gemini \n     mission and then shelved. Originally large, boxy affairs of \n     stackable metal plates separated by membranes resembling \n     plastic wrap, Ballard's fuel cells are now small enough to \n     fit inside a minivan chassis. ``when we start producing them \n     in volume,'' says Ballard co-founder Keith Prater, a former \n     University of Texas chemist, ``the price will shrink, too.''\n       Surrounded by conference booths promoting the latest in \n     photovoltaics, fuel cells and electrolyzers--devices that \n     separate water into oxygen and hydrogen--I asked Princeton \n     physicist Joan M. Ogden if the United States is letting the \n     future slip away to foreign competitors. She tells me of a \n     recent, unreleased General Motors study admitting that non-\n     polluting fuel cells could be\n      mass-produced for the same cost as a conventional engine. \n     ``Actually, they should cost less, because they have no \n     moving parts,'' she says. ``They'll also last longer and \n     be cheaper to maintain.'' But while Mercedes, BMW and \n     Mazda race to bring a hydrogen car to market, U.S. auto \n     makers, by comparison, don't seem very interested.\n       A few years ago, Ogden quit Princeton's glamorous fusion \n     energy program to engage in relatively impoverished research \n     in renewable hydrogen. ``Fusion will take decades,'' she told \n     aghast colleagues. ``I want results in my lifetime.'' Soon \n     after, she co-authored a book that proposed making hydrogen \n     by splitting water with electricity from solar photovoltaic \n     (PV) cells. (In this process, as electricity made from \n     sunlight passes through a pair of electrodes immersed in \n     water, hydrogen bubbles collect around one pole and oxygen \n     around another.) Although PV is still expensive, Ogden argued \n     that mass production and technological improvements would \n     lower costs until they intersect with rising oil prices.\n       The book has been alternately praised and scorned, the \n     latter because of a map showing how much of the United States \n     would have to be covered by photovoltaic cells to produce \n     sufficient hydrogen to meet the total U.S. annual energy \n     needs. The area is [[Page S7265]] denoted by a circle that \n     reaches from Albuquerque nearly to the Mexican border. \n     Critics who derisively try to guess the value of all that \n     real estate miss the point, she insists. No one ever \n     suggested putting all the PV in the same place.\n       ``Obviously, deserts are ideal, because they get the most \n     sun, and minimal rainfall is enough to make plenty of \n     hydrogen. But I did a little calculation once. Let's say \n     2,000 people who work at Princeton drive there every day. If \n     I wanted to run their cars on hydrogen, how much roof space \n     would I need to cover with PV to make enough hydrogen fuel \n     for them? I figured that by putting panels on fewer than half \n     the university rooftops, even with New Jersey's humble \n     sunshine levels, we could convert all those cars to hydrogen. \n     Think if we did that all over the country.''\n       That same afternoon, Peter Lehman, an environmental \n     engineer from Humboldt State University in Northern \n     California, tells me what it would take to do the same for \n     the 9 million cars in the Los Angeles Basin: ``An area about \n     340 square miles. About two-thirds the size, say, of Edwards \n     Air Force Base.''\n       Cover Edwards Air Force Base with shiny photovoltaic \n     panels?\n       ``Sure. It would mean a fairly dramatic reorientation of \n     priorities, and a huge expenditure, probably like building \n     the interstate highway system. That took $100 billion and 34 \n     years. But we did it because as a society we decided it was \n     important. Wouldn't you think that eliminating all smog might \n     be important?''\n       All week, people here have been repeating a mantra of \n     massive American investments in the future that paid off, \n     like the Marshall Plan, the interstate highway system and--\n     especially during a pilgrimage to the old Apollo launching \n     pad--President Kennedy's decision to put men on the moon. \n     Although these ventures involved enormous expense, they were \n     embraced by the public because of visionary, daring \n     leadership, but they also coincided, rather than conflicted, \n     with powerful interests. A commitment to transform America's \n     energy infrastructure to accommodate clean hydrogen would, I \n     suspect, evoke awesome resistance from the petroleum and auto \n     industries. And decisions these days seem dictated more by \n     the global marketplace than by the foresight of leaders.\n       Yet the one vision these scientists from Argentina, Egypt, \n     Russia, Germany and Japan tell me may save civilization from \n     choking on its own exhaust emanates from California. They \n     refer specifically, and reverently, to mandates by the \n     California Air Resources Board and the South Coast Air \n     Quality Management District, which require that zero-emission \n     vehicles (ZEVs) constitute 2% of all cars sold in the state \n     by 1998 and 10% by 2003.\n       The allure of these requirements is the fact that, with one \n     out of 18 Americans living in the L.A. Basin alone, whoever \n     can first manufacture a viable car that meets this standard \n     will get rich. Everybody assures me that batteries aren't \n     going to do it; the acceleration is rotten, the range is too \n     short, and they must be recharged by plugging into dirty \n     power plants that only shift the pollution elsewhere. The \n     assumption here is that the only way to build a real ZEV is \n     by using a hydrogen fuel cell, and California's regulations \n     will help force that technology into existence. The air \n     quality district's chief scientist, Alan Lloyd, who's \n     speaking at the conference, agrees.\n       Lloyd's problem though, is that he is not exactly \n     considered a prophet in his own land. Rather than instilling \n     native pride, California's world champion air-quality laws, \n     which some believe have wrecked the state's economy, have \n     barely survived legislative plots to scuttle them.\n       And despite the vaunted environmental pedigree of Vice \n     President Al Gore, the Clinton Administration hasn't been \n     much help either. While a few projects like experimental wind \n     farms have been encouraged, federal efforts have focused more \n     on improving energy efficiency than on developing clean new \n     sources. Most frustrating to Alan Lloyd is a multimillion-\n     dollar Administration program called PNGV: The Partnership \n     for a New Generation of Vehicles, whose goal is to deliver a \n     prototype car that gets triple today's expected gas mileage--\n     about 80 miles per gallon--by the year 2004. ``Which means \n     that after 10 years, they'll develop a vehicle that will be \n     illegal in California because it's too dirty,'' he says, \n     gazing heavenward. ``That's unacceptable. A new-generation \n     vehicle should be fuel-efficient and clean. Leadership should \n     come from the White House, but their agenda is being driven \n     more from Detroit.''\n       Other energy advocates claim the technology for an 80-\n     m.g.g. vehicle already exists, but the Administration has \n     simply caved in to the Big Three auto makers and the oil \n     industry. But since I haven't seen filling stations \n     dispensing hydrogen on American street corners, I ask Lloyd \n     if a fuel-cell vehicle designed to run on the stuff is really \n     practical.\n       In the interim, there are lots of ways to make hydrogen \n     besides solar energy, Lloyd explains. Using steam, it can be \n     derived from natural gas or even mixed with it--known as town \n     gas, that was what America once burned for light and cooking. \n     Hydrogen improves the potency and lowers the emissions of \n     natural gas, and with some modification it might even be \n     shipped through natural gas pipelines. As for a dearth of \n     service stations: a similar alarm was once sounded by buggy-\n     whip manufacturers.\n       The real obstacle, Lloyd says, is America's current lust to \n     pawn the future for the sake of profits today. ``While \n     Detroit hires 100 attorneys to defeat every new emissions \n     standard we establish, Japan assigns 1,000 engineers to meet \n     the challenge.''\n       Maintaining energy's status quo might make some sense, or \n     at least some money, for purveyors of petroleum and internal-\n     combustion engines. But the conference's keynote speaker \n     assures us that the decision won't really be theirs. \n     University of Colorado physicist emeritus Albert A. Bartlett \n     says he knows little about hydrogen but something about basic \n     arithmetic. He's particularly drawn to calculating the time \n     it takes for things to double. This is pertinent, he says, to \n     consumption of fossil fuels, because it allows the petroleum \n     and coal industries to deceive the world about how long those \n     resources will actually last.\n       To illustrate what he means, he proposes that we imagine a \n     species of bacteria that reproduces by dividing in two. Those \n     two become four, the four become eight, and so forth. ``Let's \n     say we place one bacterium in a bottle at 11 a.m., and at \n     noon we observe the bottle to be full. At what point was it \n     half full?'' The answer, it turns out, is 11:59 a.m.\n       ``Now, if you were a bacterium in that bottle, at what \n     point would you realize you were running out of space? At \n     11:55 a.m., when the bottle is only one-thirty-seconds full, \n     and 97% is open space, yearning for development?''\n       Everyone giggles. ``Now suppose, with a minute to spare, \n     the bacteria discover three new bottles to inhabit. They sigh \n     with relief: They have three times more bottles than had ever \n     been known, quadrupling their space resources. Surely this \n     makes them self-sufficient in space. Right?''\n       Except, of course, it doesn't. Bartlett's point is that in \n     exactly two more minutes, all four bottles will be full. \n     Likewise, when President Jimmy Carter noted that in each of \n     three previous decades the world had burned more fuel than \n     had been consumed previously in all of history, it meant that \n     fuel consumption was doubling every decade. That rate slowed \n     temporarily with the energy crisis, but now, with world \n     population rising and today's breakneck industrialization in \n     the Third World, the exponential gobbling of limited \n     resources is again accelerating.\n       ``It's seriously misleading when we hear, for example, that \n     at current levels of output and recovery coal reserves can be \n     expected to last 500 years. We get the mistaken impression \n     that there's 500 years' worth of coal left, forgetting that \n     the sentence began with `at current levels.' That's 500 \n     years, only if there's no growth of production.''\n       And petroleum? ``In 1993, they announced the largest \n     discovery of oil in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 20 years: \n     700 million barrels. It sounds like an enormous number, until \n     you realize that we Americans go through roughly 17.7 million \n     barrels a day. Divide 700 by 17.7. It'll last about 40 \n     days.''\n       The auditorium is now silent. ``That indicates,'' he tells \n     us, ``that we've already made the big petroleum discoveries. \n     Now we're picking around the edges, getting the last ones.''\n       In 1975, during the depths of the energy crisis, Tom Harkin \n     arrived in Washington as an Iowa congressman. In his first \n     year on the House Science and Technology Committee, he \n     decided that the threat to the future of energy was genuine. \n     Then Carter was elected President, and, to Harkin's relief, \n     the Administration began dispensing billions and creating \n     incentives for solar, photovoltaic, wind and ocean thermal \n     energy.\n       Then the next President, Ronald Regan, dismantled Carter's \n     solar-heating apparatus on the White House roof and all the \n     tax breaks and funding for alternative-energy research along \n     with it. During those lean years, Harkin, now a senator, \n     joined forces with longtime hydrogen zealot Sen. Spark M. \n     Matsunaga of Hawaii to convince whomever they could that \n     hydrogen wasn't some dumb fantasy. After Matsunaga's death in \n     1990, Harkin and the only other hydrogen devotees around, \n     Reps. George E. Brown, Jr. (D-Colton) and Robert S. Walker \n     (R-Pa.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), pushed through a five-\n     year research bill in his memory.\n       The appropriation was minimal, but after Clinton and Gore \n     were elected, Harkin was sure that would change. Shortly \n     after their inauguration, he presented the new Administration \n     with a 40-page proposal for a sustainable energy future based \n     on hydrogen. It showed how, by using solar photovoltaic \n     electricity to split water, hydrogen actually becomes a way \n     to store the power of the sun, because it can be burned at \n     night or shipped to cold climates where solar energy is \n     scare. It explained that the cheapest way to produce hydrogen \n     could be through ``electro-farming'': using marginal land to \n     grow energy crops like switch grass, which could be reduced \n     to hydrogen in a simple device called a biomass gasifier. The \n     gasifier, in turn, would run on excess heat from a hydrogen \n     fuel cell, providing power for the farm.\n       Harkin also rebutted the myth that hydrogen is more \n     dangerous than traditional fuels, a belief dating to the 1937 \n     explosion that destroyed the German airship Hindenburg. The \n     36 who died, he explained, were killed in the falll, not from \n     burning hydrogen, which simply floated away (as it would have \n     had the Exxon Valdez transported hydrogen instead of oil). In \n     fact, the 61 Hindenberg survivors [[Page S7266]] would not \n     have lived had the blimp carried natural gas.\n       But, Harkin concluded, in order to make fuel cells or \n     hydrogen cars affordable, they have to be mass-produced, and \n     before manufacturers will mass-produce them, delivery \n     systems-hydrogen pumps at the corner gas station-have to be \n     in place. That won't happen until there's mass demand for \n     them, and so on. This classic chicken-and-egg dilemma, he \n     argued, could be resolved by a federal commitment to a \n     comfortable transition from fossil fuels.\n       He didn't get very far. ``I told the President he should \n     grab the public's imagination the way Kennedy did with the \n     moon shot, by announcing in his first State of the Union \n     speech that the U.S. was going all out for hydrogen and fuel \n     cells. He looked at me like I was slightly nuts.''\n       Later Harkin ran into Al Gore in the Executive Office \n     Building. If the government purchased large quantities of \n     photovoltaics, he told the vice president, it would lower the \n     cost immensely. The same for fuel cells. No luck there, \n     either. Instead, the tiny hydrogen coalition in Congress \n     actually has had to fight the Administration's proposed cuts \n     in funding provided by the Matsunaga Act.\n       In Washington, Harkin's hydrogen consultant, Sandy Thomas, \n     shows me a chart of the Department of Energy's budget. Out of \n     $18.6 billion, $10 billion goes for nuclear-weapons research \n     and cleanup. ``That's even though we aren't building nuclear \n     weapons anymore. It's an upper-middle-class welfare program \n     for nuclear scientists. Then there's nearly $1 billion for \n     fossil-fuel research and conservation, even though they're \n     running out; $300 million for atomic fission, though we've \n     stopped building nuclear reactors, and nearly half of a \n     billion for fusion, the practical application of which even \n     its most optimistic proponents admit it at least 40 year \n     away.''\n       ``And for hydrogen research?'' I ask.\n       ``Ten million.\n       I gape. ``I know,'' he says. ``We've argued for shifting \n     even $100 million out of DOE's nuclear-weapons fund. But \n     those decisions are made at the top. It's hard to get Hazel \n     O'Leary's ear on this one.''\n       At a White House conference on environmental technology in \n     December, chaired by Gore, Energy Secretary O'Leary admits to \n     me that in the wake of a new Republican Congress that \n     threatens to cut not just budgets but the entire DOE, she \n     questions the wisdom of bank rolling fission. On hydrogen, \n     however, she doesn't yield. ``I'm not an apologist for \n     traditional energy. We've backed some exciting research into \n     wind power. But my strong opinion is that hydrogen isn't \n     there yet. We have to be willing to deliver more mature \n     technologies to market first. Excepting fusion, I think our \n     investments fairly represent the energy marketplace for the \n     near and midterm.''\n       At the conference, Gore, five Cabinet officers and \n     President Clinton's science adviser meet with 1,400 \n     industrialists, entrepreneurs and environmental \n     representatives to discuss how the U.S. can prosper in the \n     growing international market for clean, green technology. \n     There are seminars on environmental export financing and \n     transitions to industrial ecology--yet barely any mention of \n     energy, except for a small workshop on fuel cells and another \n     on transportation technologies.\n       In the latter, I join a study group chaired by Ford's \n     representative for the Partnership for a New Generation of \n     Vehicles. Among the points we've asked to consider are the \n     prospects for introducing alternative fuels like hydrogen for \n     motor vehicles in the near future. The first to speak up is \n     General Motors' federal research coordinator. ``Very dim. As \n     long as gas and diesel stay around $1.20, consumers have no \n     incentive to use anything else.'' Alternative fuels, he says, \n     all lack the energy density of petroleum, so it will always \n     cost more to get the same amount of power.\n       No one contradicts him, so Ford moves on to the next \n     question. I interrupt. ``Wait, Isn't the whole reason for \n     this conference the idea that consumer demand today involves \n     things other than price, such as products that don't pollute \n     us to death?''\n       ``I'll believe that,'' GM replies, ``when Californians \n     start buying the 50 miles-per-gallon vehicles that are \n     already available. The fact is, they don't want cars that are \n     more efficient or cleaner.''\n       ``So how would you get people to buy this thing?'' I yell \n     to Thomas Klaiber, but he doesn't hear me, because a low-\n     slung, Class C racing series model and a black, V-12 600SL \n     roar past us at that instant, one on either side. We're on \n     the Mercedes-Benz test track in Stuttgart, Germany. Klaiber, \n     a mechanical engineer, is head of the Daimler-Benz hydrogen \n     fuel cell group, the van he's driving is the hydrogen-powered \n     vehicle that prompted Mercedes' grand announcement.\n       If this is really the future we're driving into, at a top \n     cruising speed of 50 miles per hour, it's a little like \n     riding the tortoise while being passed by a flock of jeering \n     hares. Even Mercedes buses are passing us as we negotiate \n     banked curves and climb steep little hills that suddenly \n     appear in the middle of the straightways. Yet the van itself \n     feels surpringly normal. Amid the surrounding internal \n     combustion thunder, the most noticeable difference is how \n     quietly it runs. The fuel cell itself make no sound. There's \n     only the hum of an air compressor.\n       Some significant technology challenges remain unmet, \n     however. Much of the cargo area is filled with fiberglass \n     pressure tanks. Although hydrogen has up to three times the \n     efficiency of gasoline, its lightness gives it such low \n     density that even when compressed. its storage requires at \n     least four times the space of a conventional gas tank. This \n     is fine for the fuel-cell buses that Ballard Power Systems is \n     operating successfully in Vancouver, because there's plenty \n     of room on their roofs to store hydrogen. To partly alleviate \n     this problem for passenger cars, Daimler-Benz plans to shrink \n     the fuel cell to one-fourth it current size, even as it \n     increases horsepower.\n       ``The alternative is we store the hydrogen in metal \n     hydrides,'' Klaiber says, referring to a process in which \n     certain metals absorb hydrogen like a sponge, then release it \n     when heated. ``They're fine for commuter cars; citizens \n     tested a fleet for us in Berlin for four years. But for a \n     range of 250 miles, you'd need a ton of hydrides. Too much.''\n       I have just come from Munich, where I rode in a silver 7-\n     Series BMW that uses a third storage option, liquid hydrogen, \n     exactly like the space shuttle. Its ride, acceleration, speed \n     and internal combustion engine made it virtually \n     indistinguished from a regular car. Underneath the chassis, \n     however, was a doubled-walled tank to keep the fuel at -423 \n     degrees F. But even with that much insulation, too much \n     hydrogen boils off after three days, making it impractical, \n     say, to leave a liquid hydrogen car in an airport parking lot \n     during summer.\n       Plus, it takes one-third the energy of hydrogen to cool it \n     to a liquid state. So the simplicity and high efficiency of \n     fuel cells, which runs at normal temperatures, seem to be \n     winning the race to the future-whenever that is.\n       Riding with Klaiber, it doesn't feel distant. His face is \n     glowing, almost cherubic. He confesses that he loves driving \n     this thing just because he knows it's so clean.\n       We pull over. He doesn't turn off the engine but finds a \n     paper cup and holds it over the exhaust pipe. ``Drink?'' he \n     offers.\n       It's pure, distilled water.\n       Consumers, I'm told by hydrogen skeptics, won't buy a \n     vehicle whose power and performance fall short of what we've \n     grown to expect from our automobiles. In the Daimler-Benz \n     headquarters,\n      Mercedes' vice president of marketing for passenger cars, \n     Jochen Placking, shows me a typical ad they use for the \n     United States: a convertible speeding across a New Mexico \n     desert. ``We're selling freedom. The limitless power to go \n     explore.''\n       In the halls here, decades of Mercedes advertising posters \n     show women with long, shapely legs protruding from fur coats, \n     leaning against gorgeous roadsters. How can you make an \n     environmentally correct car into a sexy status symbol, like a \n     sports coupe?\n       Placking strokes his mustache. ``We'll have to find a way \n     to make clean cars fascinating,'' he says. ``Like selling \n     people on safe sex.''\n       It's not an altogether encouraging analogy, especially in \n     the context. Germany, world leader in hydrogen research \n     investment--about $12 million a year since the late 1970s \n     until it was blindsided by the expense of reunification--is \n     hardly the renewable-energy economy I imagined. An official \n     from the state of Bavaria's electric utility, which has the \n     world's biggest hydrogen pilot facility, admits there are no \n     plans to scale up to a full-sized working plant. So what will \n     they do in 30 years, when Bavaria's aging nuclear plants mut \n     be phased out and fossil fuels are expected to be scarce?\n       ``I can't answer that question. Nobody can. Nobody gives a \n     damn about the future.''\n       Back in my own country, I share this story with Michael \n     Heben, a lanky young materials scientist at the National \n     Renewable Energy Laboratory. Even at BMW and Daimler-Benz, I \n     tell him, hydrogen only gets a small chunk of the research \n     budget compared to conventional engines. I suppose it's not \n     in a company's interest to invent something that renders its \n     most successful product obsolete.\n       Heben shrugs. He reminds me we've seen computers grow \n     smaller, faster and cheaper at a breathless pace, all because \n     a couple of kids in a garage dared to try to build something \n     better. When Edison was inventing light bulbs and \n     phonographs, electricity cost 300 times what it does now. As \n     soon as people saw what it could do, they started using it en \n     masse, and the price became practical. Maybe, he suggests, \n     one key discovery will do the same for hydrogen--like the \n     semiconductor work of John Turner, who's splitting water \n     without the intermediate step of first making photovoltaic \n     electricity.\n       Other researchers here are cultivating strains of algae \n     that exhale hydrogen. Heben himself is after a revolutionary \n     way to store it. He's trying to prove that submicroscopic \n     tubes made of activated carbon, developed at IBM, suck up \n     hydrogen atoms via capillary action, like a straw. A fuel \n     tank full of the tough, light tubules, each about a billionth \n     of a meter in diameter, could actually hold far more diffuse \n     hydrogen gas than a tank that was empty.\n       ``Our goal should be a vehicle that performs like today's \n     cars: same size, weight, acceleration, frequency of \n     refueling. With good, compact, energy-efficient storage, \n     there's no reason we can't do that with clean hydrogen.''\n       On NREL's lean hydrogen budget, he's currently able to \n     create enough of a soot-like substance, which contains carbon \n     nanotubules, to coat the inside of a countertop bell jar. To \n     scale up to working size will cost a lot more. At this point, \n     he has no idea where funds will come from, but something \n     makes him believe they will. [[Page S7267]] \n       ``We're so close. so much has been accomplished with just a \n     little. If we really decided that we wanted a clean hydrogen \n     economy, we could have it by 2010. No more oil spills. Fresh \n     air in Denver and L.A. Think of it.''\n       Maybe he's right. Curiously, amid panic over Republican \n     threats to dismember research budgets, hydrogen may prove to \n     be not just a survivor but also a winner. The new chairman of \n     the House Committee on Science is Bob Walker, longtime \n     science mentor to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and hydrogen \n     ally of Tom Harkin.\n       In his office, decorated with pictures of the space \n     shuttle, Walker reminds me that one of the most powerful \n     forces in the marketplace is ``the love Americans have for \n     roaming the planet freely in their own cars. Hydrogen will \n     make that possible when the present technology gets too dirty \n     to extend into the future.'' He has introduced legislation \n     calling for a quadrupling or research funds for hydrogen over \n     the next three years. Part of the money will be matched by \n     non-federal sources and part expropriated from technologies. \n     Walker believes are either futile or outmoded.\n       He has little pity for industries that resist change, \n     including auto makers. ``If Edison were to invent the light \n     bulb today, the headlines would read, `200,000 candle makers \n     lose their jobs.' We've been through this before, like when \n     cars put blacksmiths out of business. It's wrenching, but \n     overall our national competitiveness gets stronger. The same \n     thing will happen in energy. The people themselves will \n     demand it.''\n       He pauses to gaze at a plaque naming him the latest \n     recipient of the National Hydrogen Assn.'s Spark M. Matsunaga \n     Award. ``Driving on the interstate, I watch them stringing \n     fiber-optic cable up the median strip for the Internet. The \n     government talks about the Internet but can't come up with a \n     structure. Meantime, it's happening because people want it. \n     When they realize they need clean hydrogen, somebody will \n     find a way to supply that, too.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7263-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE ADMINISTRATION'S MIGRATION AGREEMENT WITH CUBA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, the \nadministration concluded a migration agreement with Cuba that I hope \nwill be the first step in the direction of a rational policy toward \nCuba.\n  Under this agreement, most of the 15-20 thousand Cubans that have \nbeen housed in Guantanamo Bay for the past several months will be \nparoled into the United States, with those paroles to count, on a 3-\nyear prorated basis, against the 20,000 minimum Cuba-to-America \nimmigration numbers agreed upon by the Cuban and American governments \nlast fall. Cuba has also agreed to accept back those Cubans at \nGuantanamo who are excludable under U.S. law because of criminal \nhistories, infectious diseases, etc. Thus, within the limits set out in \nlast fall's agreement between Cuba and the United States, this \nagreement has solved the costly and potentially explosive detention of \nthe Cubans at Guantanamo.\n  As part of this new policy, the Attorney General has also announced \nthat those attempting in the future to emigrate to the United States \nfrom Cuba illegally--rather than through the process agreed upon last \nyear--would be subject to interdiction and forced repatriation to Cuba, \nfrom where they could apply for asylum at the Cuban Interests Section \nin Havana.\n  Although I have some concerns about the second half of this new \napproach--in particular, the policy of interdiction and repatriation of \nfuture migrants from Cuba--and urge the Attorney General to implement \nsufficient procedural protections for those Cubans with valid asylum \nclaims, in general I view this agreement as a significant step forward \nin our relations with Cuba.\n  Unlike our policies toward Cuba over the past 35 years, the agreement \nrepresents a rational and cooperative response to a U.S.-Cuba \nimmigration problem that has caused this Nation nothing but headaches \nin the past. If our government could approach every U.S.-Cuba issue \nwith the pragmatism that is reflected in this agreement, I believe that \nour long-sought goal of democratization of Cuba would be much closer to \nour grasp than this goal is now.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a May 4 editorial on the \nagreement with Cuba from the Chicago Tribune. This editorial ends with \na call to President Clinton to apply the tools of constructive \nengagement in our relations with Cuba, and recognizes that these tools, \nnot a doctrinaire and obsolete policy of Castro-baiting, hold the keys \nto a successful Cuba policy.\n  The editorial follows:\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, May 4, 1995]\n\n                    A Welcome Change in Cuba Policy\n\n       Ever since 1959, when Fidel Castro descended from the \n     Sierra Maestra to enter Havana spewing Marxism like cigar \n     smoke, Cuba has been a misplaced comma that jumbled an \n     otherwise cogent political essay called the Monroe Doctrine.\n       In a commendable turn of direction. President Clinton \n     reinjected logic into U.S.-Cuba relations by ending 35 years \n     of preferential treatment for Cuban refugees. Clinton ruled \n     Tuesday that Cubans will no longer receive automatic asylum \n     but must pass the same hurdles as any other refugee reaching \n     our shores.\n       Although Clinton's decision will be analyzed in terms of \n     the Cuban-American vote and hemispheric diplomacy, its \n     inspiration was purely practical.\n       At present, 20,000 Cuban refugees are stuck in tents at the \n     Guantanamo Bay Naval Station; their $1 million-a-day tab for \n     room and board comes from the Pentagon budget, which means \n     the taxpayers' pockets.\n       The refugees are getting restless. Clinton wants to avoid \n     ugly riots, so a final exemption will be granted to accept \n     that group. Any other ``raft people'' will be turned back to \n     Cuba.\n       Clinton has firmly announced that this nation, not Castro, \n     controls America's borders. In addition, Clinton has denied \n     Castro the foreign policy weapon of ``boatlift diplomacy,'' \n     which capitalizes on the pitiful sight of refugees foundering \n     abroad unseaworthy craft en route to the promise of Florida's \n     beaches.\n       There are two glaring holes in the president's program, \n     however.\n       First is a threat that anyone among the Guantanamo refugees \n     with a criminal record will be denied entry. What's this? \n     Clinton thinks Castro is going to open up his secret police \n     files for perusal by Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     officers? Doubtful.\n       And second is the quid pro quo from Castro, who has \n     promised to allow his people free access to the American \n     interest section in Havana. There they may file a formal \n     request for U.S. entry, which will be weighed by the INS like \n     those of potential immigrants worldwide. But Catro's promise \n     may be meaningless. In Cuba, one of the last remaining \n     communist states on Earth, pressures both subtle and overt \n     can be applied to frighten away potential applicants.\n       By ending three decades of automatic asylum for Cubans, \n     Clinton has demoted Castro from top devil of the Caribbean, \n     much to the heartfelt anguish of expatriate Cubans and Cuban-\n     Americans.\n       If that is to be Clinton's new policy, then it is time to \n     apply the tools of constructive engagement--as with China, a \n     few steps at a time--using the full range of American \n     diplomacy, trade and culture to push Cuba toward democracy \n     and a rational relationship with its giant northern neighbor.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7267-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7267-S7268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        SPEECH OF AMY BRINDLEY TO STRIKING UNITED RUBBER WORKERS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I would like to submit into \nthe Record a statement from a 16-year-old in Des Moines named Amy \nBrindley. Amy is the daughter of a striking URW member who works at the \nBridgestone/Firestone plant in Des Moines. She gave this moving speech \nin April to a rally of striking workers and their families. I think all \nSenators should read the words of this impressive young American. I ask \nthat her statement be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                         Speech by Amy Brindley\n\n       As a teenage daughter of a United Rubber Worker, who's been \n     on strike for the past 9 months, I'd like to point out that \n     this strike involves many, many people and is just NOT \n     limited to the union members and their employer. Bridgestone/\n     Firestone has invaded the lives of the entire family with \n     their inexcusable hunger for corporate greed.\n       I feel that is important to recognize the numerous family \n     members who have fallen victim to the ruthless demands set \n     forth by Bridgestone/Firestone.\n       Being a teenager is never easy, but having to deal with the \n     additional stress this labor dispute has brought about, has \n     made it even more challenging. Many friendships have been \n     broken apart throughout this strike. I, myself, have had \n     friendships that have suffered great setbacks because of my \n     pro labor beliefs. I believe that it is the lack of education \n     that a lot of people have concerning the Union. I strongly \n     believe that we need to educate and promote the values and \n     the importance regarding unions. As members of the United \n     Rubber Workers are attempting to hold on to what fellow \n     members have fought to gain in the past years of joining \n     together at the bargaining table. If we don't educate people, \n     what will the future hold, not just for my generation but the \n     following generations also?\n       I am a junior at Southeast Polk High School. As juniors, we \n     are offered the opportunity to go to Washington D.C. and New \n     York for the United Nations Trip. This trip is only offered \n     to juniors. Because of the strike it was financially \n     impossible for me to go with my fellow classmates. It was \n     very [[Page S7268]] difficult for me to watch my friends, \n     including my best friend, as they prepared for this venture \n     with great anticipation, and again when they returned and \n     shared with me their special memories that I was not a part \n     of. Under different circumstances I would have been among my \n     fellow classmates, but again, due to Bridgestone/Firestone's \n     desire for complete control, I was cheated out of a \n     significant, once in a life time opportunity.\n       One of Bridgestone/Firestone's most appalling scare tactics \n     that has personally touched myself and my family was the \n     elimination of health care benefits, 90 days into this \n     strike. My sister, Angie, and I are both insulin dependent \n     diabetics. Consequently, it is of utmost importance that we \n     have medical insurance to maintain and control this dreaded \n     disease. It has been impossible for us to find an alternate \n     insurance policy that covers our diabetes. Therefore, my \n     parents have been forced to pay the enormous monthly premiums \n     for the company's Cobra Coverage, adding to the already \n     overwhelming financial burdens families are facing during \n     this work stoppage due to this strike.\n       I have briefly touched on just a ``few'' of the intrusions \n     this company has used to manipulate the lives of innocent \n     people. But, on the other hand, some things I don't think \n     this heartless company counted on, is that I've also gained \n     many things. Things that you can't put a material value on. \n     Such as, a new understanding of what the union is truly \n     about, the importance of solidarity, the significance of the \n     support that we've received from fellow unions and citizens. \n     The outpouring of generosity so many different individuals \n     have extended has been astounding. Even though Bridgestone/\n     Firestone has taken away our paycheck and temporarily left us \n     financially strapped; they'll NEVER take away our dignity!\n       Thank you.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/23/senate-section/article/S7267-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 1995\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE.
