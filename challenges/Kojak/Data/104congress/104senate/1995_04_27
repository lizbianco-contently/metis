All of life is sacred to You. Forgive our imposed \ndichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Every person, situation, \nand responsibility is sacred because everyone and everything belongs to \nYou. Give us a renewed sense that all that we have and are is Your \ngift. So may we cherish the wonder of life You have entrusted to us and \nlive with an attitude of gratitude. May this gratitude be the motive of \nour work today in this Senate. We want our work to be an expression of \nour worship of You. Therefore we make a renewed commitment to \nexcellence in everything we do and say.\n  All this is rooted in the inseparable relationship between intimacy \nwith You and the integrity of our leadership. You've shown us that \nauthentic intimacy results when the real I meets the true You in an \nhonest, open, unpretentious relationship. It's when we come to You as \nwe are that You whisper in our souls, ``You are loved now!'' Then the \nconsistent experience of Your unqualified love gives us the courage to \nbe genuine, loyal, and faithful to You in our relationships with others \nand our responsibilities as leaders to whom You can entrust authority \nand power to govern this Nation.\n  Thank You for this time of quiet with You in which we can receive the \npeace of knowing that we are loved and forgiven, the healing of the \nhurts of harbored memories, the answers to problems that seem \nunsolvable, and the vision for our Nation that otherwise would be \nbeyond our human understanding. We praise You that to know You is our \ngreatest joy and to serve You is life's greatest delight. In the name \nof Him who is the way, the truth, and the life. Amen.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5739-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the opportunities of this 104th \nCongress are substantial. They are substantial not only because every \nCongress has great opportunity, but they are substantial because we \nhave a significant opportunity to change the direction in \n[[Page S5740]] which the country has been going for at least the last \nthree decades.\n  The elections of November 8 provided a new chemistry for the Congress \nand a new potential for a change in direction. It is a change in \ndirection which the people of America sorely need and desperately want. \nIt is a change brought about by the popular recognition that over the \nlast three decades or so, the Government of the United States has not \nbeen advocating a set of values necessary for the success and survival \nof this society in the next generation.\n  The Government has been validating irresponsibility through the \nCongress' conduct and Congress' programs since at least the midsixties, \nif not before.\n  Most of us know that responsibility is the key to a successful \nsurvival for this society in this century and in the next. If we want \nto sink, we can continue on our current track. But if we want to swim \nand survive, we are going to have to change, and the opportunity of \nthis Congress is to change the way that Washington does business.\n  Let me just suggest a few ways in which Government has been \nvalidating irresponsibility. For the past several decades, the modus \noperandi of this Congress has been to spend more than it receives.\n  This deficit problem which we have had year after year after year, \nwhich has been growing larger and larger and larger, has been a way \nthat the Government has subtly, if not intentionally, been teaching \nirresponsibility. It is just that simple. When Government tells us what \nis legal and what is illegal, it begins teaching us, and when by its \nconduct it shows that it is not important to pay your debts, that you \ncan simply pile up irresponsibly mountains of debt that the next \ngeneration will have to sustain, that is a way of teaching \nirresponsibility. It is a way of saying to this society that you do not \nhave to be responsible. It displays before the entire Nation, before \nevery man, woman, and child, a kind of conduct which is destined to \nfailure over the long term, designed inevitably to fail and to sink.\n  Similarly, for the last 30 years or so, Congress has been passing \nlaws and then exempting itself from them. I cannot imagine a less noble \nthing for leadership to do than to enact laws which it says apply to \neveryone else but do not apply to leaders. We know that real leadership \nis to carry the burden forward first, to catch the vision of the noble \nfirst, to do what is right first; not to send someone else into battle \nfirst, not to push others into good behavior while we lag behind and \nlanguish in behavior which is unacceptable.\n  The Congress has validated irresponsibility by saying the rest of the \nworld has to have a level of responsibility and care but that we could \nexempt ourselves.\n  Of course, the Congress was similarly irresponsible when it tried to \nrun everyone else's business and not run its own.\n  The unfunded mandates of the last three decades are another way that \nGovernment has validated irresponsibility in the culture. Congress said \nto the people of America that we are not going to be responsible and it \nis not important to be responsible because, rather than take care of \nour own business responsibly, we are going to try with mandates to tell \nState and local governments how to do their business. We will even try \nto tell business how to conduct their business, but we will not do our \nown business that way. We will exempt the Federal operations from many \nof the regulatory impacts to the society, and we will direct the \nspending of State and local governments in spite of the fact that their \nview of the circumstances and understanding of the challenges is far \nsuperior to our own.\n  This character of conduct by the Government over the last three \ndecades has literally validated irresponsibility in the society, and it \nis no wonder that the news magazines of late have headlined things like \nshame, or the absence of shame, in society, the absence of \nresponsibility, the absence of the internal guideposts to good \nbehavior.\n  When the biggest, perhaps, teacher of all in America, the Government, \nhas by its own behavior been teaching irresponsibility over the last \nthree decades, we have really hurt this culture. We have validated \nirresponsibility, not, however, just in the way we conduct our own \naffairs. Government has been validating irresponsibility in the kind of \nprograms it promulgates.\n  Look at the welfare system. We have not said to this society, on \nwelfare, that you will have to be good, that you will have to be moving \nin the right direction in order to have our assistance. We have not \nsaid that you will have to stop illegitimacy or that you will have to \nstart to work or that you will have to be industrious. No, we have not. \nWe have just said that no matter how irresponsible you are, we will \ncontinue to write the check and to pay the bills.\n  Or in the criminal law area we have not really been a society of \nresponsibility. We have been confused about who the victim was and who \nthe criminal was. We have said that the guy pulling the trigger was \nreally the victim, that society had not treated him well and he was \nprobably excused for pulling the trigger. The person who took the \nbullet probably was encouraged to say: ``I should not have been walking \nin this neighborhood at this time. After all, I probably invited the \ncrime or the assault.''\n  The truth of the matter is that is the height of irresponsibility. \nOur criminal law system, our programs, have not been oriented toward \nresponsibility. They have validated irresponsibility. Our program for \nwelfare has not been an encouragement for responsibility but has \nvalidated irresponsibility.\n  For three decades we have been looking at this validation of \nirresponsibility, and now we come to 1995, to the 104th Congress, and \nour chance is to change from a culture of irresponsibility to a culture \nwhich demands responsibility.\n  That is what the first 100 days were about, that is what the next 100 \ndays are about. And that is why we need to move forward with an agenda \nfor the American people to reinvest our society with governmental \nleadership that points toward responsibility.\n  Let me just suggest how fundamental those changes are. Instead of \nspending beyond our means, instead of spending without regard to who \nwill pay, we are going to start producing balanced budgets; instead of \nvalidating the irresponsibility of not paying our debts, we are going \nto demand a culture of responsible behavior by paying for what we \nconsume; instead of saying that there is a set of laws for the Congress \nand then a bigger and broader set of laws for the citizenry, we are \ngoing to say, no, we want to be responsible.\n  With the Congressional Accountability Act, the first thing we did was \nto pass laws that said we would live under the same laws under which \nthe citizens of America live. That pushes us toward a culture of \nresponsibility. Instead of telling other governmental entities and \njurisdictions how to consume their resources and deploy them with \nunfunded mandates, we have said we will stop doing that; we will start \nacting responsibly.\n  The real challenge for us is to move from a culture of \nirresponsibility to a culture of responsibility and for Government to \ntake the lead.\n  Look at what is happening in the welfare area, and this is why it \ndesperately needs reform. Instead of saying to people, no matter how \nirresponsible you are, we will promote that and validate it and as a \nmatter of fact we will fund it--instead of doing that, we are going to \nsay, no, you have to behave in certain ways; you have to improve your \nperformance; you have to work; you have to treat your children with \ndignity and give them a chance to break the cycle of dependency and \npoverty. That is responsibility, and we are moving in that direction.\n  I submit to you that in the area of the criminal law, we will have a \nmove toward responsibility. We will deny the culture of \nirresponsibility, and we will demand the culture of responsibility. And \nthat is what Government should do. It should set an example. It should \nteach with its conduct and with the programs that it promulgates. It \nshould promote responsibility. And that is why the first 100 days were \nimportant, 100 days that began this session, and that is why the rest \nof this session is of monumental importance.\n  It is very important that we carry through on this change from \nvalidating irresponsibility, which is the past, to promoting \nresponsibility and demanding accountability, which is the future.\n  [[Page S5741]] So we must again visit the balanced budget question. \nWe must move forward with a real balanced budget to respond to the \ndemand of the people that we institute a culture, at least a \ngovernmental culture of responsibility that will set an example for \nthis society. We must move forward on the reforms which are before us. \nWe cannot stop now. We must continue to address the agenda of the \nAmerican people.\n  This is the great opportunity of this Congress, that we change the \nway Washington does business. And by changing the way Washington does \nbusiness, we signal to America that there is a new demand for \naccountability and responsibility in this society: We no longer spend \nmoney we do not have; we no longer fail to live under the laws which we \npass; we no longer try to direct the activities of other governmental \nentities. No, our conduct will be responsible instead of \nirresponsible--pay our debts, live under the laws we pass. Yes, we will \nstop telling governments much better prepared to make decisions than we \nare how those decisions ought to be made. All of those things are \nincluded in the monumental changes sweeping through the Congress. But \nthe sweeping through is not complete. Sweeping through is a process, \nand it is a process which we must continue, which we must extend, which \nwe must, as a matter of fact, complete. We must have the discipline and \nthe determination to carry through on these programs.\n  We are in the midst of a debate on the question of product liability. \nThe question is whether companies will be held responsible for things \nthey really had nothing to do with, whether rental car companies that \nhad nothing but ownership of a car which was stolen or otherwise \nwrongfully taken will be held accountable for millions of dollars of \ndamage done with the car.\n  We have a tremendous energy that is pent up, a momentum in the \nculture of irresponsibility, and it is not easy for us to stop the \nspending, to stop the conduct which has promoted and validated \nirresponsibility for the last several decades. It is something on which \nwe have made a great start and from which we should not turn. It is a \ntask which we must continue.\n  So as we review, looking back, the significant achievements of the \nfirst 100 days, let us never forsake the potentials of the next 100 \ndays. I think we have reached a threshold, a tipping point. We have \nreached an opportunity to continue to institute as a regular means of \noperation this culture of responsibility in Government. Let us make \nsure that in these next 100 days we do not turn back; that we continue \nto move forward on the agenda of the American people.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When President Clinton recently issued a warning against \nintemperate speech, Mr. President, a lot of people took those remarks \nas an attack on radio talk show hosts. But I would like to point out \nthat the talk show hosts by no means have a corner on that market, and \nthat we should all focus our attention on the rhetoric that is used by \ncertain public interest groups and ourselves alike when we try to raise \nmoney through the coffers of public interest groups for our political \ncampaigns.\n  I would particularly, Mr. President, like to call your attention to a \nrecent letter issued by the National Rifle Association under the \nsignature of its executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.\n  This 5-page poison-pen letter is a revolting example of hateful, \nincendiary, irresponsible speech. It seeks to whip the readers into a \nfrenzy against the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n  Mr. President, this letter is obscene. While the ostensible purpose \nof this letter is to raise money for the National Rifle Association, it \nmay well have the unintended and unfortunate side effect of stoking the \nfires of militant groups across this country of whom our citizens now \nhave cause to fear.\n  In his letter, Mr. LaPierre says that the Federal ban on \nsemiautomatic weapons ``gives jack-booted Government thugs more power \nto take our constitutional rights away, break in our doors, seize our \nguns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.''\n  Mr. LaPierre further continues in his letter:\n\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the Government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder \n     law-abiding citizens.\n       Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge . . . Waco and the Branch \n     Davidians . . . Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for \n     Federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm \n     trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.\n       Not today, not with Clinton.\n\n  In another part of the letter, Mr. LaPierre warns that what he sees \nas the attack on the second amendment to the Constitution ``is only the \nfirst in a long campaign to destroy the freedoms at the core of \nAmerican life.'' The letter continues:\n\n       You can see it when jack-booted Government thugs, wearing \n     black, armed to the teeth, break down a door, open fire with \n     an automatic weapon, and kill or maim law-abiding citizens.\n\n  Mr. LaPierre calls for a ``major show of force'' by America's 80 \nmillion gun owners. Mr. LaPierre concludes:\n\n       This, the battle we're fighting today, is a battle to \n     retake the most precious, the most sacred ground on Earth. \n     This is a battle for freedom.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, these are very stirring words indeed, and I am \nsure it has been quite a success for the national fundraising \nactivities of the National Rifle Association. It has been a great \nfundraising tool.\n  I noticed yesterday that Mr. LaPierre told a reporter, and I quote, \n``the last thing the NRA wants is a fight with the ATF.'' Mr. \nPresident, I would be hard pressed to conclude that, based upon the \nincendiary, obscene nature of this letter that Mr. LaPierre sent across \nour country.\n  Let me make it very clear that I am not today blaming the National \nRifle Association for the explosion in Oklahoma City, but I am \nsuggesting that I think that any reasonable person would conclude that \nthe words Wayne LaPierre has been using, the images he has been \nconjuring up has played directly into the fears that exist in the types \nof groups that apparently are responsible for the bombing and other \nterrorist attacks.\n  In that regard, the paid lobbyists and the chief fundraiser for the \nNational Rifle Association have been tossing kerosene onto the fire. \nThe leaders of the National Rifle Association must realize that these \nwords have consequences and rights are accompanied by responsibilities. \nA loose tongue, Mr. President, can be just as dangerous as an \nunholstered gun when either is employed by an irresponsible person.\n  The National Rifle Association takes great pride in touting its \nprograms to train responsible gun owners. I hope that its leadership \ntoday will now realize the need to teach and practice itself the \nresponsible use of free speech.\n  Before the folks at the National Rifle Association start accusing \nthis Senator of trying to take away their first amendment rights, as \nwell as their second amendment rights, let me make it very plain that I \nhave no intention of taking action to forcibly muzzle any of them \nthrough any action by the Congress of the United States. I am not \nquestioning the right of the NRA to say what it wishes in its \nfundraising letters. But I do believe, Mr. President, that Wayne \nLaPierre should be absolutely ashamed of what he has written in this \nletter to his members of the National Rifle Association.\n  Just because in our society one might have the right to do something \nor to say something does not mean that he should say it. Just because \none has the protection of the first amendment in our Constitution is no \nreason \n[[Page S5742]] to abuse that protection or to abuse the first \namendment.\n  Politicians and lobbyists, unfortunately, have relied much too \nheavily on the language of hyperbole to claim its share of the \nmarketplace of ideas. This letter, written by the executive vice \npresident of the National Rifle Association, is certainly not the only \ninstance of hyperbole and the National Rifle Association is certainly \nfar from its only practitioner.\n  Mr. President, I today am not attacking the members of the National \nRifle Association, but I cannot believe--knowing many good members of \nthat organization--I cannot believe that the National Rifle Association \nmembers support their organization, their leadership demonizing a \nFederal law enforcement official or an agency.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have, I might ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I can remember about 35 years ago when I \nwas first elected to a position of State representative of Ouachita \nCounty. During my first term in office, I first heard of the National \nRifle Association. I would like to tell you about it, if I might.\n  Over one weekend during that first term of my first session, a young \nchild, 5 or 6 years of age, in a grocery store parking lot saw a gun \nrack in a truck in the next vehicle, got out of his parents' car while \nthey were in the store, got into the truck, took the rifle from the gun \nrack and killed himself accidentally. The town became very upset, and \nthey asked me to see if there was anything we could do about it.\n  I introduced the next week, at the behest of the Arkansas Game and \nFish Commission, with the support of law enforcement officials \nthroughout the State, a very simple proposal that said something like \nthis: That no automobile--truck or car--in the incorporated city limits \nof any community in our State of Arkansas shall be able to carry a \nloaded shotgun or a rifle. Pretty simple. It passed 99-0 in the house \nof representatives.\n  It went to the State senate and, Mr. President, that is when I first \nheard of the National Rifle Association.\n All of a sudden, throughout America, there was a bulletin that \nRepresentative Pryor is trying to take your guns away in the State of \nArkansas, and if this happens, it is going to happen all across the \ncountry and we need to stop it now.\n\n  Needless to say, Mr. President, my bill did not become law. It died \nin the State senate of Arkansas. I remember still getting hundreds of \ntelegrams and letters from all over our country protesting this \nlegislation.\n  But there is one I especially recall, one specific letter I received \nduring that battle. It was from a former college roommate I had from \nthe University of Arkansas, and it went something like this: Dear \nDavid, I never knew all that time that I was your friend and roommate \nat the university that you were a Communist.\n  Well, Mr. President, that is what we have today--the selling of fear. \nIt is continuing and it must stop. I am hopeful, Mr. President, that \nthe membership of the National Rifle Association will question some of \nthe positions of its leadership in attempting to sell fear at this most \nincendiary time in our Nation's history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nLaPierre be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       National Rifle Association.\n       Dear Fellow Americans: I've worn out a lot of shoe leather \n     walking the halls of Congress. I've met key leaders, I've \n     talked with old allies, I've met with the new Congressmen and \n     many staff members.\n       What I'm hearing and seeing concerns me.\n       Many of our new Congressmen are ignoring America's 80 \n     million gun owners. Some have forgotten what we did to elect \n     them. Others say our demands to restore our Constitutional \n     freedoms are ``politically out of line.''\n       Don't get me wrong, not all of them are like this. Senator \n     Phil Gramm, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Congressman Bill \n     McCollum, Bill Brewster and Harold Volkmer are all coming to \n     our aid. But too many others are not.\n       And without a major show of force by America's 80 million \n     gun owners, America will resume its long march down the road \n     to gun bans, destruction of the Constitution and loss of \n     every sacred freedom.\n       I want you to know I'm not looking for a fight.\n       But when you consider the facts of our current situation, \n     you too, will see we have no other choice.\n       Fact No. 1: The Congress' leading anti-gunners, Senators \n     Dianne Feinstein, Ted Kennedy and Congressmen Charles Schumer \n     and Major Owens all survived their last elections.\n       They've pledged to fight us to the bitter end for Brady II \n     and its ammo taxes, licensing and registration schemes, gun \n     rationing, bureaucrats with the power to determine if you \n     ``need'' a gun and yes, the repeal of the Second Amendment.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law is a failure.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law has become one \n     more tool that government agents are using to deny the \n     Constitutional rights of law abiding citizens.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives \n     jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our \n     Constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, \n     destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.\n       Schumer, Feinstein, Kennedy, Owens and the rest of the \n     anti-gunners want more and more gun control.\n       It can be something small and subtle like a regulation \n     expanding the disqualification criteria for the Brady Law. \n     They're fighting for anything that makes it harder for you to \n     own a gun.\n       The gun banners simply don't like you. They don't trust \n     you. They don't want you to own a gun. And they'll stop at \n     nothing until they've forced you to turn over your guns to \n     the government.\n       Fact No. 2: If the anti-gunners fail to achieve their goals \n     in Congress, they have a fall-back position in Bill Clinton, \n     the most anti-gun President in American history.\n       In two short years, Bill Clinton launched two successful \n     attacks on the Constitution. He signed two gun control bills \n     into law. He has sworn to veto any repeal of the semi-auto \n     ban and any restoration of our Constitutional rights.\n       His Interior and Agriculture Departments have set their \n     sights on closing hunting lands.\n       And his Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to \n     take jurisdiction over existing uses of lead. This, of \n     course, includes gun ranges and spent shot.\n       What's more, gun owners aren't the only ones Clinton's EPA \n     has set its sights on. They're after fishermen, too. They \n     want to BAN the use of small lead fishing sinkers and, of \n     gravest concern, they want to stop the home casting of these \n     sinkers.\n       If fishing sinkers are on the Clinton bureaucrat's list, \n     you know what's next: lead shot, lead bullets, bullet casting \n     and reloading.\n       Clinton's State Department is also adding to the attacks on \n     gun owners and our Constitutional freedoms. In December, he \n     signed the Summit of the Americas agreements which pledges \n     that the U.S. Government will push for additional gun \n     control.\n       Over in the Justice Department, Clinton's Attorney General \n     Janet Reno has signaled her intent to ``squash'' the states' \n     rights movement and deny states their Constitutional power.\n       And worst of all,\n       Fact No. 3: President Clinton's army of anti-gun government \n     agents continues to intimidate and harass law-abiding \n     citizens.\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder \n     law-abiding citizens.\n       Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge . . . Waco and the Branch \n     Davidians . . . Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for \n     Federal agents wearing nazi bucket helmets and black storm \n     trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.\n       Not today, not with Clinton.\n       Our calls to investigate these outrageous assaults on our \n     Constitutional freedoms are routinely silenced by the anti-\n     gun media. But that's no surprise.\n       Fact No. 4: They've launched a new wave of brainwashing \n     propaganda aimed at further destroying our Constitutional \n     freedoms.\n       CBS, ABC, NBC, USA Today, Time, Newsweek and The New York \n     Times have launched another round of phony polls and slanted \n     stories to help the anti-gunners achieve their goals.\n       Their latest phony poll shows 70% of America support the \n     ``semi-auto'' assault weapon ban.\n       That's simply not true. When it's explained that ``semi-\n     autos'' are used in less than a fraction of one percent of \n     crimes; that the ban only affects the law-abiding; and, that \n     the ban is only one more way to deny Constitutional rights to \n     the law-abiding, support for the ban drops to 30%.\n       But the media still uses this 70% statistic to trumpet the \n     call for gun control.\n       What scares me the most about this 70% number is that the \n     media has brainwashed 70% of Americans into believing that \n     the government--and not each individual--is responsible for \n     their personal protection.\n       Even worse, this 70% number means that there are enough \n     people who can be brainwashed by the media to vote for a \n     repeal of the Second Amendment if it were put to a vote.\n       The media, Clinton, the anti-gunners in Congress . . . this \n     combination is a powder keg that could blow at any moment and \n     it's set squarely underneath the Constitution.\n       And what this means is:\n       [[Page S5743]] Fact No. 5: Congress must be forced to \n     restore the Constitution, repeal the gun bans, investigate \n     abuse by government agents and focus the public debate on \n     criminal control, not gun control. . .\n       . . . Or what we're seeing now will only be a momentary \n     patch of sunshine on the road to doom for the Second \n     Amendment and our Constitution.\n       There is hope, though. Despite the current situation, I'm \n     encouraged by you and your fellow NRA members.\n       Everywhere I go, to every gun show, every NRA-ILA \n     grassroots operation, every Friends of NRA Dinner, even in \n     cabs and airports around the country, I run into NRA members \n     who understand the stakes and stand ready to fight.\n       The question I hear from almost every one of these NRA \n     members is the same: ``What can I do next?''\n       If you're one of those members, I want to thank you for \n     your courage, your conviction and your spirit. You keep me \n     going. You keep me on the road. You give me strength to lead \n     the battle.\n       And if you want to join me in taking the next step, I need \n     you to do these two things today.\n       First, I need you to sign the enclosed Petitions to the \n     United states Congress.\n       These petitions are addressed to the leaders of the U.S. \n     Congress, Senator Robert Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich, and \n     your U.S. Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Alfonse M. \n     D'Amato and Congresswoman Sue Kelly.\n       Please be sure to sign all five petitions, then fold them \n     and place them in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope \n     addressed to me at NRA Headquarters.\n       These petitions spell out, in black and white, our agenda \n     of repeal, reform, investigate and limit government power.\n       In the first amendment of the Bill of Rights, we are \n     guaranteed the right to ``petition our Government for a \n     redress of grievances.''\n       And that's exactly what we're going to do: redress our \n     grievances in the biggest and most powerful display of \n     political clout and commitment to the Constitution.\n       I want to personally deliver your five petitions, and the \n     petitions of all 3.5 million of your fellow NRA members--17.5 \n     million petitions in all--to Congress.\n       And I want to show the leadership in Congress, and your \n     Senators and Congressmen from New York, that the number one \n     priority in their Contract With America must be defending and \n     restoring our Constitutional freedoms.\n       17.5 million Petitions to Congress is the largest ``redress \n     of grievances'' since the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     were written.\n       So I KNOW Congress will get the message. And I know they'll \n     act on our agenda of Repeal, Reform and Investigate if only \n     you and I speak out.\n       Your Petitions to Congress also sends another message--a \n     message not spelled out on the Petitions themselves.\n       Each Congressman, on the average, will receive 8,000 \n     Petitions from NRA members demanding action. 8,000 messages \n     from angry voters sounds an alarm in every Congressman's \n     head.\n       You see, most Congressional elections were won or lost by \n     5,000 votes or less. So, they'll realize that failing to \n     defend the Second Amendment and failing to retake the \n     Constitutional freedoms lost to the anti-gunners, could \n     result in big losses at the next election!\n       That's why it's critical you take a few minutes to sign \n     your Petitions to Congress and return them to me as soon as \n     possible.\n       These petitions are our D-Day.\n       Armed with these petitions and our First Amendment rights, \n     we are going to storm Congress, knock out anti-gunner \n     strongholds and recapture every bit of ground we lost since \n     Bill Clinton took office.\n       And if we're successful, these petitions will be the \n     turning point in the history of the Constitution. . . . A day \n     when our sacred right to keep and bear arms will be secure \n     for the next generation of law-abiding Americans.\n       Second, when you return your signed Petitions to Congress, \n     I need you to make a special contribution to the NRA of $15, \n     $20, $25, $35, $50 or the most generous amount you can \n     afford.\n       Most Americans don't realize that our freedoms are slowly \n     slipping away.\n       They don't understand that politicians and bureaucrats are \n     chipping away at the American way of life.\n       They're destroying business, destroying our economy, \n     destroying property rights, destroying our moral foundation, \n     destroying our schools, destroying our culture . . .\n       . . . Destroying our Constitution.\n       And the attack, either through legislation or regulation, \n     on the Second Amendment is only the first in a long campaign \n     to destroy the freedoms at the core of American life.\n       You can see it in the gun bans, certainly. But you can also \n     see it in closed ranges, closed hunting lands, confiscated \n     collectors' firearms, banned magazines and ammunition taxes.\n       You can see it when jack-booted government thugs, wearing \n     black, armed to the teeth, break down a door, open fire with \n     an automatic weapon, and kill or maim law-abiding citizens.\n       America's gun owners will only be the first to lose their \n     freedoms.\n       If we lose the right to keep and bear arms, then the right \n     to free speech, free practice of religion, and every other \n     freedom in the Bill of Rights are sure to follow.\n       I am one American who is not going to sit on the sidelines \n     and watch this happen.\n       And if you want to help me stop this destruction of the \n     Constitution, then I hope you can make that special \n     contribution of $15, $20, $35, $25 or $50 to the NRA today.\n       With your special contribution, I'll have the financial \n     ammo I need to keep Congress focused on the mission we've \n     assigned them.\n       First, with your help, I will expand our petition campaign \n     to involve as many of America's 80 million gun owners as \n     possible.\n       If we can double the number of Petitions flooding Congress, \n     we'll double the speed Congress deals with our demands to \n     Repeal, Reform and Investigate. And with double the show of \n     clout, we'll wipe out anti-gunner opposition.\n       Second, with your special contribution, I can increase the \n     NRA's public exposure on talk shows, at rallies and shows, in \n     radio and T.V. advertising and through broadcasts like the \n     NRA's Town Meeting that first sounded our alarm in 16 million \n     households, last summer.\n       Part of our problem is that far too few Americans \n     understand what's at stake in these battles.\n       My ultimate goal is to educate the American people that \n     this issue is not just about guns, not just about hunting, \n     not just about personal protection; this issue is about \n     freedom--Your Freedom.\n       I want to use the power of T.V. and radio to show the \n     American people that, if the NRA fails to restore our Second \n     Amendment freedoms, the attacks will begin on freedom of \n     religion, freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search \n     and seizure. . . .\n       . . . And that unless we take action today, the long slide \n     down the slippery slope will only continue until there's no \n     freedom left in America at all.\n       I know you see it. The elbow room you have to hunt, shoot \n     and live life the way you see fit is slowly disappearing.\n       And the truth is, NRA members have been hardened by \n     legislative battles. And only NRA members have the courage, \n     the conviction to draw the line in the sand.\n       That's why I'm hoping you can take a few moments to sign \n     and date the enclosed Petitions and return them to me with \n     your special contribution of $15, $20, $25, $35, $50 or more \n     in the enclosed postage-paid envelope today. Or, you can \n     charge by phone by calling 800-547-4NRA today.\n       You know, besides going shooting, I love to go to football \n     games. And every time I go, I always hear my fellow fans talk \n     about the impact of ``the 12th man.''\n       The 11 players calling the plays and doing the hitting get \n     a lot of their motivation from the 12th man in the stands. \n     I'm talking about the crowd who cheers wildly when our team \n     is on the offense, and drowns out the signals of the opposing \n     team when they're on the defense.\n       I need you to be that 12th man.\n       I need you to sign your Petitions to Congress and return \n     them to me today. That simple act will give our allies the \n     political courage to do what's right, to push ahead with our \n     agenda of Repeal, Reform and Investigate.\n       Likewise, your signed Petitions to Congress will confuse \n     and demoralize the anti-gun team and their agenda of bans, \n     taxes, intimidation, harassment and destruction of the \n     Constitution.\n       I know I've said what I'm about to say before. But this is \n     a message that resonates with NRA members across the land. \n     It's something I hope you, too, will say whenever you have \n     the occasion to defend our Constitutional freedoms.\n       This, the battle we're fighting today, is a battle to \n     retake the most precious, most sacred ground on earth. This \n     is a battle for freedom.\n       Please tell me you're ready to take the next step by \n     returning your signed Petitions to Congress and special gift \n     to me in the enclosed postage-paid envelope today.\n       Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Yours in Freedom,\n                                                   Wayne LaPierre,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n       P.S.--As a special thank you for making a special \n     contribution of $25 or more, I'd like to send you a copy of \n     my national best-selling book, Guns, Crime, and Freedom. \n     Guns, Crime, and Freedom is 263 pages of truth about guns, \n     gun control, gun owners, the anti-gun media and what's \n     happening to our freedoms.\n       I hope you'll read it and use it in your own personal \n     campaign in New York to defend the Constitution. Use Guns, \n     Crime, and Freedom to help you keep the pressure on Congress, \n     write letters to the editor and teach other Americans about \n     the battle we're fighting today. Thanks again for your \n     support and friendship.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before I commence my remarks I want to \ncongratulate Senator Pryor on the very bold and very strong statement \nthat he has made this morning. I think he is right on the mark. I say \nto Senator Pryor that, like he, we have a lot of good, decent, hard-\nworking, law abiding NRA members in the State of Iowa--there are \nhundreds--like I am. I know that they are as repulsed by Mr. LaPierre's \nletter as the Senator from \n[[Page S5744]] Arkansas. It is a shame when you have an organization \nwith a lot of fine people in it that do abide by the law, that do want \nto instill in people a respect for guns and to teach them how to use \nthem legitimately, responsibly, and to have an organization, then, \ntaken over by the likes of Wayne LaPierre, and to really take what \ncould otherwise be a decent organization which could instill in young \npeople a healthy respect for firearms and hunting, and to move that \norganization, as he has done with this kind of letter, into almost an \norganization that would be disrespectful of our Constitution and \ndisrespectful of the United States of America, I know he does not speak \nfor the members of the NRA that live in Iowa.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If I might say, I appreciate the Senator's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa [Mr. Harkin] is recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business for a period of not more than 10 \nminutes\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5741-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5744-S5745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICARE TICKING TIME BOMB\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, yesterday I began discussions on the \npending insolvency of Medicare, predicted to occur in the year 2002, \njust 7 years from today.\n  I called Medicare a ticking time bomb. I expressed my concern that \nthis body has not addressed that ticking time bomb. We must act now to \npreserve Medicare, to protect it, to save it, to disarm that ticking \ntime bomb.\n  I will continue those discussions this morning.\n  Congress and all Americans must realize that it is the Federal \nGovernment, through the Medicare program, that is the purchaser of \nhealth care for this country's seniors and people with disabilities. \nThe same Government that brought you $100 hammers is also shopping for \nscalpels and stethoscopes. The Federal Government spends more money on \nhealth care than individuals, and more than employers. But, it's not \nour money. If it were, we would likely be more prudent consumers. We \nwould likely react more quickly and more responsibly to skyrocketing \ncosts.\n  So whose money do we spend? For the answer, we should revisit the \ncreation of the program and remind ourselves of its intended role in \nour health care system when it was created in 1965. Also it is time to \nunderstand the shortfalls of the program.\n  Because the program was created to increase seniors' access to acute \ncare, Congress mandated participation for hospital services, called \nMedicare part A. After seniors pay for a relatively low deductible--\n$716 in 1995, Medicare fully covers expenses for 60 hospital days. If a \nsenior's hospitalization exceeds the 60 days in 1 year, he or she is \nresponsible for a co-insurance fee--$179 per day for the 61st through \n90th days, and $358 per day beyond that.\n  Medicare part A comprises 63 percent of all Medicare spending. It is \nfunded by the Medicare portion of the Social Security payroll tax--a \ntax of 2.9 percent of all income--split evenly between employer and \nemployee. Taxes collected from today's workers go directly to pay for \nservices delivered to today's beneficiaries. It is important to \nunderstand that contributions to Medicare do not actually sit in the \nhospital insurance [HI] trust fund and wait for you. Rather, they are \npaid out immediately to meet the needs of today's seniors and people \nwith disabilities. Beginning in 1997, the part A expenditures will \nexceed total income annually.\n  Medicare's part B goes to pay doctor bills and is voluntary. It is \nfunded 30 percent from beneficiary premiums and 70 percent by automatic \nwithdrawals from Treasury general revenues. Today, a senior opting for \nMedicare part B pays $46.10 each month and is responsible for a $100 \nannual deductible and 20 percent co-insurance for most services. \nGeneral revenues provide a 70 to 75 percent premium subsidy and cover \n80 percent of most services.\n  Theoretically, the funding arrangement for part A--the hospital \ninsurance--would work fine if the demographics of the population were \nconstant, if medical technology were constant, and if the growth of \noverall expenditures were constant. But, as we all know, this is not \nthe case.\n  First--and most importantly--the elderly population is growing much \nfaster than the overall population. In 1990, 2.1 million Americans \nqualified for Medicare. But in the year 2020, 3.9 million new enrollees \nwill qualify--almost twice as many new enrollees will be qualifying \nthat year. And who pays the bill? The working generation, which is not \ngrowing nearly as fast. When Medicare was created, two workers would \ncover the costs of the Medicare beneficiary. By the time I qualify for \nthe program, it will take four workers to cover the same cost.\n  Consider the consequences of delaying Medicare reform. I have three \nsons: Bryan is 7 years old, Jonathan is 9, and Harrison is 11. In the \nyear 2020, they will be 32, 34, and 36 years old. I will be 68 and \neligible for Medicare benefits. My sons and their generation will pay \nfor the services for my generation. It will take the taxes of all my \nthree sons plus another individual just to pay for my own Medicare \nbenefits. It is intolerable to punish our children, the next \ngeneration, with this inequity.\n  Second, medical breakthroughs are allowing people to live healthier \nand longer lives. Take my own field of heart disease as an example. \nThirty years ago, there were few heart intensive care units in the \ncountry. Coronary artery bypass surgery had never been performed. \nCardiovascular drugs were in their infancy. Heart transplants were but \na dream for the future. Today, because of advances in medical science \nand technology, people who used to die of their heart disease are \nliving 10, 20, or 30 years longer, and those new technologies are \nexpensive.\n  Back to my earlier question, ``Whose money is this?'' Medicare is \npaid for by three vehicles: a 2.9 percent payroll tax, split by \nemployers and employees; general revenue tax dollars; and beneficiary \npremiums, copayments, and deductibles.\n  I think it is safe to say that taxpaying workers are more watchful of \nthe money coming out of their pockets than is the Federal Government. I \nknow the employers are. We have recently seen their impact on the \nhealth care system as they have struggled with increasing costs. I have \nwitnessed through my own parents that seniors are prudent purchasers of \nhealth care services. Since Medicare was not designed as a \ncomprehensive insurance program, seniors already shop for additional \nhealth care coverage. Most seniors today live within a fixed budget. \nThey are careful to judge the value of their health care dollar.\n  By failing to mend this program, we are failing all of these groups \nwho will suffer from our inattention in the years to come. Yet, there \nis an ongoing premise that the Federal Government should not attempt to \nmanage its spending of the Medicare dollar. Every other purchaser has \nto manage his or her money. Why should the Federal Government be \nexempt?\n  And, how does this country pay for our failure to manage the Medicare \nProgram? First, employers pay in the form of higher health care costs. \nFor the last 10 years, Congress has chosen to repeatedly cut payments \nto physicians and hospitals for services delivered. This reduces \nprogram costs incrementally, but does little to reduce the overall rate \nof growth of expenditures. Lower Medicare payments, especially when \ncoupled with even lower Medicaid payments, simply lead providers to \nshift costs and to charge self-pay and privately insured patients more. \nThis increases everyone's insurance premiums. In east Tennessee, a \nrecent survey of physician fees found that the private sector is paying \nphysicians, on average, 220 percent above Medicare rates. Depending on \nthe specific procedure, these private plans are paying anywhere from 43 \nto 461 percent above Medicare rates. Without Medicare reform, private \nhealth insurance will continue to climb even further out of reach and \nall Americans will suffer reduced access and thus reduced overall \nquality.\n  Second, the working generation pays for our mismanagement of Medicare \nthrough increased taxes. Over the last \n[[Page S5745]] 30 years, Congress has dramatically expanded both the \ntax base and the tax rate supporting the Medicare trust fund. \nInitially, Medicare relief on a 0.6-percent payroll tax on the first \n$6,600 earned. Today, the program relies on nearly a 3-percent payroll \ntax on all income earned. Next year for the first time in its history, \nthe trust fund will begin spending more money than it is taking in. \nWithout reform, a tax increase is around the corner. And at best, this \ntax increase would only prolong the program a few years.\n  Third, beneficiaries pay for Medicare's failures. Skyrocketing costs \nof the program force the same rate of growth on the direct expenditures \nby our seniors and disabled. Their out-of-pocket costs are directly \nrelated to overall program costs. Medicare does provide a generous \nsubsidy, making it a better deal than anything else out there. But not \nall services are covered, the coinsurance and deductibles are \nsubstantial, and premiums are calculated to cover a defined amount of \nprogram costs. Only 1 out of 10 or 11 percent of seniors rely solely on \nMedicare for their health care insurance. Most seniors still purchase \nprivate supplemental medical coverage or have access to additional \nemployer-sponsored coverage. Beneficiary costs will continue to climb \nas the overall program spending spins out of control.\n  Medicare is an entitlement. I do not suggest we take away that \nconcept. However, I do ask us to remember what it entitles us to. Quite \nsimply, the entitlement was intended to provide access to the private \nsystem. Our predecessors did not create a system which limited \nbeneficiaries to public hospitals or Government-employed physicians. \nRather, it provided financial access to private physicians and \nhospitals, the same providers Americans used before they turned 65.\n  If we viewed the Medicare subsidy today as it was originally \nintended--allowing beneficiaries to use it to access private coverage--\nseniors would then be able to choose health care plans that better meet \ntheir needs. Today they do not have that choice. We should provide that \nchoice to our seniors.\n  Mr. President, I will continue this discussion over the next several \ndays as we look forward to better ways to save, to preserve our \nMedicare Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5744-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, earlier today my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, spoke about a very disturbing letter circulated by the \nNational Rifle Association [NRA]. I commend him for his remarks. I do \nnot want to get into a lengthy discussion of this issue, but I urge all \nof my colleagues, regardless of where you stand on the issue of gun \ncontrol, to read this letter, which was sent out by the NRA under the \nsignature of Mr. Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president.\n  I do not know of anyone here, no matter how strongly they feel about \nthe legitimate issue of what we do about gun control, that would not be \noffended by this letter and the language in it.\n  Again, I am not going to spend a great deal of time here this \nmorning, but there is language in the letter which talks about:\n\n       . . . jack-booted government thugs [given] more power to \n     take away our Constitutional rights, break in our doors, \n     seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill \n     us;\n\n  That is how the letter refers to our Government and the hard-working \nmembers of our Federal law-enforcement agencies. And the letter goes \non, in reference to the Clinton administration:\n\n       . . . if you have a badge, you have the Government's go \n     ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder law-abiding \n     citizens;\n\n  And there is even more:\n\n       Waco and the Branch Davidians . . . Not too long ago it was \n     unthinkable for Federal agents wearing Nazi bucket helmets \n     and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding \n     citizens.\n\n  Law-abiding citizens? People who shot Federal agents, who burned \ntheir own buildings, and killed their own families and friends? I mean \nthis is incredible.\n  And this is not a letter from some fringe organization. It is a \nletter from the NRA--a national organization that usually has \ncredibility. Quite simply, the NRA ought to know better.\n  Please read this letter. It is five or six pages. And if you are not \nas offended as I have been by reading it, I will be surprised.\n  Someone needs to ask for a retraction of this letter. Put aside the \ntragic events in Oklahoma for a moment, I do not want to suggest that \nthis letter is linked to that terrible tragedy. I do not want to cloud \nthe issue. But someone needs to apologize for this letter. It goes way \nbeyond the kind of rhetoric that is appropriate on these issues.\n  Remember this letter went, apparently, to millions of homes. I have \nno problem with people sending out fundraising letters and even using \nstrong language in those solicitations. But the NRA's letter goes way \nbeyond the pale. At first, I was so shocked, I thought it might be a \nhoax. But apparently it was not. I understand the NRA has confirmed \nthat it sent the letter.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to read the letter and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                       National Rifle Association.\n       Dear Fellow Americans: I've worn out a lot of shoe leather \n     walking the halls of Congress. I've met key leaders, I've \n     talked with old allies, I've met with the new Congressmen and \n     many staff members.\n       What I'm hearing and seeing concerns me.\n       Many of our new Congressmen are ignoring America's 80 \n     million gun owners. Some have forgotten what we did to elect \n     them. Others say our demands to restore our Constitutional \n     freedoms are ``politically out of line.''\n       Don't get me wrong, not all of them are like this. Senator \n     Phil Gramm, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Congressmen Bill \n     McCollum, Bill Brewster and Harold Volkmer are all coming to \n     our aid. But too many others are not.\n       And without a major show of force by America's 80 million \n     gun owners, America will resume its long march down the road \n     to gun bans, destruction of the Constitution and loss of \n     every sacred freedom.\n       I want you to know I'm not looking for a fight.\n       But when you consider the facts of our current situation, \n     you too, will see we have no other choice.\n       Fact No. 1: The Congress' leading anti-gunners, Senators \n     Dianne Feinstein, Ted Kennedy and Congressmen Charles Schumer \n     and Major Owens all survived their last elections.\n       They've pledged to fight us to the bitter end for Brady II \n     and its ammo taxes, licensing and registration schemes, gun \n     rationing, bureaucrats with the power to determine if you \n     ``need'' a gun and yes, the repeal of the Second Amendment.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law is a failure.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the Brady Law has become one \n     more tool that government agents are using to deny the \n     Constitutional rights of law abiding citizens.\n       It doesn't matter to them that the semi-auto ban gives \n     jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our \n     Constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, \n     destroy our property, and even injure or kill us.\n       Schumer, Feinstein, Kennedy, Owens and the rest of the \n     anti-gunners want more and more gun control.\n       It can be something small and subtle like a regulation \n     expanding the disqualification criteria for the Brady Law. \n     They're fighting for anything that makes it harder for you to \n     own a gun.\n       The gun banners simply don't like you. They don't trust \n     you. They don't want you to own a gun. And they'll stop at \n     nothing until they've forced you to turn over your guns to \n     the government.\n       Fact No. 2: If the anti-gunners fail to achieve their goals \n     in Congress, they have a fall-back position in Bill Clinton, \n     the most anti-gun President in American history.\n       In two short years, Bill Clinton launched two successful \n     attacks on the Constitution. He signed two gun control bills \n     into law. He has sworn to veto any repeal of the semi-auto \n     ban and any restoration of our Constitutional rights.\n       His Interior and Agriculture Departments have set their \n     sights on closing hunting lands.\n       And his Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to \n     take jurisdiction over existing uses of lead. This, of \n     course, includes gun ranges and spent shot.\n       What's more, gun owners aren't the only ones Clinton's EPA \n     has set its sights on. \n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\n     They're after fishermen, too. They want to BAN the use of \n     small lead fishing sinkers and, of gravest concern, they want \n     to stop the home casting of these sinkers.\n       If fishing sinkers are on the Clinton bureaucrat's list, \n     you know what's next: lead shot, lead bullets, bullet casting \n     and reloading.\n       Clinton's State Department is also adding to the attacks on \n     gun owners and our Constitutional freedoms. In December, he \n     signed the Summit of the Americas agreements which pledges \n     that the U.S. Government will push for additional gun \n     control.\n       Over in the Justice Department, Clinton's Attorney General \n     Janet Reno has signaled her intent to ``squash'' the states' \n     rights movement and deny states their Constitutional power.\n       And worst of all,\n       Fact No. 3: President Clinton's army of anti-gun government \n     agents continues to intimidate and harass law-abiding \n     citizens.\n       In Clinton's administration, if you have a badge, you have \n     the government's go-ahead to harass, intimidate, even murder \n     law-abiding citizens.\n       Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge . . . Waco and the Branch \n     Davidians. . . . Not too long ago, it was unthinkable for \n     Federal agents wearing nazi bucket helmets and black storm \n     trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens.\n       Not today, not with Clinton.\n       Our calls to investigate these outrageous assaults on our \n     Constitutional freedoms are routinely silenced by the anti-\n     gun media. But that's no surprise.\n       Fact No. 4: They've launched a new wave of brainwashing \n     propaganda aimed at further destroying our Constitutional \n     freedoms.\n       CBS, ABC, NBC, USA Today, Time, Newsweek and The New York \n     Times have launched another round of phony polls and slanted \n     stories to help the anti-gunners achieve their goals.\n       Their latest phony poll shows 70% of America support the \n     ``semi-auto'' assault weapon ban.\n       That's simply not true. When it's explained that ``semi-\n     autos'' are used in less than a fraction of one percent of \n     crimes; that the ban only affects the law-abiding; and, that \n     the ban is only one more way to deny Constitutional rights to \n     the law-abiding, support for the ban drops to 30%.\n       But the media still uses this 70% statistic to trumpet the \n     call for gun control.\n       What scares me the most about this 70% number is that the \n     media has brainwashed 70% of Americans into believing that \n     the government--and not each individual--is responsible for \n     their personal protection.\n       Even worse, this 70% number means that there are enough \n     people who can be brainwashed by the media to vote for a \n     repeal of the Second Amendment if it were put to a vote.\n       The media, Clinton, the anti-gunners in Congress . . . this \n     combination is a powder keg that could blow at any moment and \n     it's set squarely underneath the Constitution.\n       And what this means is:\n       Fact No. 5: Congress must be forced to restore the \n     Constitution, repeal the gun bans, investigate abuse by \n     government agents and focus the public debate on criminal \n     control, not gun control. . .\n       . . . Or what we're seeing now will only be a momentary \n     patch of sunshine on the road to doom for the Second \n     Amendment and our Constitution.\n       There is hope, though. Despite the current situation, I'm \n     encouraged by you and your fellow NRA members.\n       Everywhere I go, to every gun show, every NRA-ILA \n     grassroots operation, every Friends of NRA Dinner, even in \n     cabs and airports around the country, I run into NRA members \n     who understand the stakes and stand ready to fight.\n       The question I hear from almost every one of these NRA \n     members is the same: ``What can I do next?''\n       If you're one of those members, I want to thank you for \n     your courage, your conviction and your spirit. You keep me \n     going. You keep me on the road. You give me strength to lead \n     the battle.\n       And if you want to join me in taking the next step, I need \n     you to do these two things today.\n       First, I need you to sign the enclosed Petitions to the \n     United states Congress.\n       These petitions are addressed to the leaders of the U.S. \n     Congress, Senator Robert Dole and Speaker Newt Gringrich, and \n     your U.S. Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Alfonse M. \n     D'Amato and Congresswoman Sue Kelly.\n       Please be sure to sign all five petitions, then fold them \n     and place them in the enclosed, postage-paid envelope \n     addressed to me at NRA Headquarters.\n       These petitions spell out, in black and white, our agenda \n     of repeal, reform, investigate and limit government power.\n       In the first amendment of the Bill of Rights, we are \n     guaranteed the right to ``petition our Government for a \n     redress of grievances.''\n       And that's exactly what we're going to do: redress our \n     grievances in the biggest and most powerful display of \n     political clout and commitment to the Constitution.\n       I want to personally deliver your five petitions, and the \n     petitions of all 3.5 million of your fellow NRA members--17.5 \n     million petitions in all--to Congress.\n       And I want to show the leadership in Congress, and your \n     Senators and Congressmen from New York, that the number one \n     priority in their Contract With America must be defending and \n     restoring our Constitutional freedoms.\n       17.5 million Petitions to Congress is the largest ``redress \n     of grievances'' since the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     were written.\n       So I KNOW Congress will get the message. And I know they'll \n     act on our agenda of Repeal, Reform and Investigate if only \n     you and I speak out.\n       Your Petitions to Congress also sends another message--a \n     message not spelled out on the Petitions themselves.\n       Each Congressman, on the average, will receive 8,000 \n     Petitions from NRA members demanding action. 8,000 messages \n     from angry voters sounds an alarm in every Congressman's \n     head.\n       You see, most Congressional elections were won or lost by \n     5,000 votes or less. So, they'll realize that failing to \n     defend the Second Amendment and failing to retake the \n     Constitutional freedoms lost to the anti-gunners, could \n     result in big losses at the next election!\n       That's why it's critical you take a few minutes to sign \n     your Petitions to Congress and return them to me as soon as \n     possible.\n       These petitions are our D-Day.\n       Armed with these petitions and our First Amendment rights, \n     we are going to storm Congress, knock our anti-gunner \n     strongholds and recapture every bit of ground we lost since \n     Bill Clinton took office.\n       And if we're successful, these petitions will be the \n     turning point in the history of the Constitution . . . . A \n     day when our sacred right to keep and bear arms will be \n     secure for the next generation of law-abiding Americans.\n       Second, when you return your signed Petitions to Congress, \n     I need you to make a special contribution to the NRA of $15, \n     $20, $25, $35, $50 or the most generous amount you can \n     afford.\n       Most Americans don't realize that our freedoms are slowly \n     slipping away.\n       They don't understand that politicians and bureaucrats are \n     chipping away at the American way of life.\n       They're destroying business, destroying our economy, \n     destroying property rights, destroying our moral foundation, \n     destroying our schools, destroying our culture . . .\n       . . . Destroying our Constitution.\n       And the attack, either through legislation or regulation, \n     on the Second Amendment is only the first in a long campaign \n     to destroy the freedoms at the core of American life.\n       You can see it in the gun bans, certainly. But you can also \n     see it in closed ranges, closed hunting lands, confiscated \n     collectors' firearms, banned magazines and ammunition taxes.\n       You can see it when jack-booted government thugs, wearing \n     black, armed to the teeth, break down a door, open fire with \n     an automatic weapon, and kill or maim law-abiding citizens.\n       America's gun owners will only be the first to lose their \n     freedoms.\n       If we lose the right to keep and bear arms, then the right \n     to free speech, free practice of religion, and every other \n     freedom in the Bill of Rights are sure to follow.\n       I am one American who is not going to sit on the sidelines \n     and watch this happen.\n       And if you want to help me stop this destruction of the \n     Constitution, then I hope you can make that special \n     contribution of $15, $20, $25, $35 or $50 to the NRA today.\n       With your special contribution, I'll have the financial \n     ammo I need to keep Congress focused on the mission we've \n     assigned them.\n       First, with your help, I will expand our petition campaign \n     to involve as many of America's 80 million gun owners as \n     possible.\n       If we can double the number of Petitions flooding Congress, \n     we'll double the speed Congress deals with our demands to \n     Repeal, Reform and Investigate. And with double the show of \n     clout, we'll wipe out anti-gunner opposition.\n       Second, with your special contribution, I can increase the \n     NRA's public exposure on talk shows, at rallies and shows, in \n     radio and T.V. advertising and through broadcasts like the \n     NRA's Town Meeting that first sounded our alarm in 16 million \n     households, last summer.\n       Part of our problem is that far too few Americans \n     understand what's at stake in these battles.\n       My ultimate goal is to educate the American people that \n     this issue is not just about guns, not just about hunting, \n     not just about personal protection; this issue is about \n     freedom--Your Freedom.\n       I want to use the power of T.V. and radio to show the \n     American people that, if the NRA fails to restore our Second \n     Amendment freedoms, the attacks will begin on freedom of \n     religion, freedom of speech, freedom from unreasonable search \n     and seizure. . . .\n       . . . And that unless we take action today, the long slide \n     down the slippery slope will only continue until there's no \n     freedom left in America at all.\n       I know you see it. The elbow room you have to hunt, shoot \n     and live life the way you see fit is slowly disappearing.\n       And the truth is, NRA members have been hardened by \n     legislative battles. And only NRA members have the courage, \n     the conviction to draw the line in the sand.\n       That's why I'm hoping you can take a few moments to sign \n     and date the enclosed Petitions and return them to me with \n     your special contribution of $15, $20, $25, $35, $50 or more \n     in the enclosed postage-paid envelope \n     [[Page S5747]] today. Or, you can charge by phone by calling \n     800-547-4NRA today.\n       You know, besides going shooting, I love to go to football \n     games. And every time I go, I always hear my fellow fans talk \n     about the impact of ``the 12th man.''\n       The 11 players calling the plays and doing the hitting get \n     a lot of their motivation from the 12th man in the stands. \n     I'm talking about the crowd who cheers wildly when our team \n     is on the offense, and drowns out the signals of the opposing \n     team when they're on the defense.\n       I need you to be that 12th man.\n       I need you to sign your Petitions to Congress and return \n     them to me today. That simple act will give our allies the \n     political courage to do what's right, to push ahead with our \n     agenda of Repeal, Reform and Investigate.\n       Likewise, your signed Petitions to Congress will confuse \n     and demoralize the anti-gun team and their agenda of bans, \n     taxes, intimidation, harassment and destruction of the \n     Constitution.\n       I know I've said what I'm about to say before. But this is \n     a message that resonates with NRA members across the land. \n     It's something I hope you, too, will say whenever you have \n     the occasion to defend our Constitutional freedoms.\n       This, the battle we're fighting today, is a battle to \n     retake the most precious, most sacred ground on earth. This \n     is a battle for freedom.\n       Please tell me you're ready to take the next step by \n     returning your signed Petitions to Congress and special gift \n     to me in the enclosed postage-paid envelope today.\n       Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n           Yours in Freedom,\n                                                   Wayne LaPierre,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n       P.S.--As a special thank you for making a special \n     contribution of $25 or more, I'd like to send you a copy of \n     my national best-selling book, Guns, Crime, and Freedom. \n     Guns, Crime, and Freedom is 263 pages of truth about guns, \n     gun control, gun owners, the anti-gun media and what's \n     happening to our freedoms.\n       I hope you'll read it and use it in your own personal \n     campaign in New York to defend the Constitution. Use Guns, \n     Crime, and Freedom to help you keep the pressure on Congress, \n     write letters to the editor and teach other Americans about \n     the battle we're fighting today. Thanks again for your \n     support and friendship.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator John Stennis will long be \nremembered as the ``conscience of the Senate'' for his personal \nreligious convictions and his many years of work on the Senate code of \nethics. I will always think of him as a friend, and as one of the most \neffective chairmen of the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee. We shared many of the same beliefs in that the United States \nshould always strive for the most effective Armed Forces in the world, \nand his leadership was always deserving of respect and admiration.\n  Despite physical ailments and the death of his beloved wife of 52 \nyears, Senator Stennis remained committed to this body and to his \ncountrymen. He could always be found in his offices, never leaving \nuntil the Senate had adjourned for the day. He never gave up when he \nbelieved that he was right.\n  We need men and women who will fight for what they believe, and we \nshould look to John Stennis as an excellent example of the \nforthrightness and dedication necessary to be effective leaders today.\n  Since Senator Stennis retired from this body in 1989, the Senate has \nbeen denied his wisdom and his leadership. Our entire country mourns \nhis loss.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5747-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    KOREAN AGREED NUCLEAR FRAMEWORK\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I find myself in the unfortunate position \nof once more coming to the floor to briefly discuss the lack of \nprogress being made in the implementation of the United States-North \nKorea Agreed Nuclear Framework.\n  During the recent recess, talks in Berlin between us and the North \nKoreans broke down. The point of contention continues to be the DPRK's \nobstinate refusal to accept two light-water reactors of South Korea \nmanufacture as called for in the agreement. Mr. President I--and, I am \nsure, our negotiators headed by Ambassador Galucci--have grown weary of \nthe North's negotiating tactics. Last-minute brinkmanship has failed to \nwork for them in the past; I am unsure why they think if they continue \nto pursue that course we will eventually relent.\n  Korean's have a saying about the futility of trying to influence \nsomeone too stubborn to listen: ``reading into an ox's ear.'' At the \nrisk of reading into the ``Pyongyang ox's'' ear, let me say it one more \ntime. As I have said before as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East \nAsian and Pacific Affairs, we should not accept any deviation from the \nagreed framework on the part of the DPRK. As called for in the \nagreement, North Korea must accept the two light-water reactors from \nSouth Korea. It must not refire its Yongbyon reactor. It must cease its \nattempts to produce fissile material. It must take steps toward \ninitiating and maintaining a bilateral relationship with the South. The \nconsequence for their failure to live up to the agreement is very \nstraight-forward: a return to the Security Council and the imposition \nof tough sanctions.\n  Mr. President, this is their choice--in black and white. There is no \nsubtlety, no innuendo, no hidden message. Our negotiators have done an \nadmirable job in continuing to press the North Koreans; I urge them to \nstick to their guns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5747-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, yesterday, the Supreme Court \noverturned the Gun Free Schools Zones Act, a 1990 law sponsored by \nSenator Kohl and others that made it a felony to bring a gun within \n1,000 feet of a school. The case revolves around a San Antonio youth \nwho was tried for bringing a .38 caliber to school, and the decision \nhas ignited widespread debate because it reverses decades of Supreme \nCourt precedent.\n  However, as a result of this controversy, it is extremely important \nto clarify the status of a separate, recently passed law, which has a \nsimilar name--the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994--but remains firmly in \nplace.\n  Parents, teachers, and school officials must know that gun possession \non campus cannot be tolerated, that the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 \nremains in place, and that in order to receive Federal education funds \nevery school district in the Nation must soon have in place and \nfunctioning a policy that assures that any youngster who brings a gun \nto school will be expelled for not less than 1 year.\n  The following points must be clearly understood:\n  First, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 was not struck down by the \nSupreme Court yesterday.\n  Instead, the Court struck down a 1990 criminal law with a similar-\nsounding name--but a different legal status.\n  Second, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 will not be swept away by \nthe Court's decision.\n  By simply requiring schools to have a zero tolerance policy as a \ncondition of receiving Federal education funds, the Gun-Free Schools \nAct does not rely on the commerce clause for its authority.\n  Third, the Gun-Free Schools Act remains in place, and zero tolerance \npolicies are already showing positive results.\n  [[Page S5748]] Many school districts such as New York, Los Angeles, \nand San Diego that have already implemented zero tolerance policies are \nseeing fewer guns brought to school, and as a result fewer student \nexpulsions.\n  In San Diego, gun possession on campus was cut in half during 1993, \nthe first year of that district's policy, and there have been only 5 \ngun possession cases during this year.\n  Under the Gun-Free Schools Act, States have until October 1995 to \nenact or revise their own zero tolerance policies for school districts, \nrequiring that students caught with guns on campus be expelled for not \nless than a year.\n  Fourth, the Court's decision to revoke Federal law does not affect \nState laws outlawing gun possession on campus.\n  Forty States, including California, have their own criminal statutes \nmaking gun possession on or near a school a State crime.\n  California's statute, signed into law by Pete Wilson, makes \npossession of a gun within 1,000 feet of a school a felony crime.\n  The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994, which I have strongly supported, \nwas passed last year in response to the increasing gun violence on \nschool grounds, and the failure of many schools to respond clearly and \nforcefully to the presence of guns on campus.\n  In 1993, a Los Angeles high school student was shot waiting in line \nfor lunch, and two other California high school students were killed \nwithin a 1-month period.\n  Over 100,000 guns are brought to school each day, according to \nseveral recent surveys and national projections.\n  There have been 105 violent school-related deaths in just the last 2 \nyears, according to the Centers for Disease Control--caused by guns, \nknives, and other weapons.\n  In a nationwide survey, the CDC also found that 1 in 12 students \nbrought\n a gun to school in 1993--up from 1 in 24 just three years before.\n\n  However, in too many school districts students who bring guns to \nschool are simply given a short suspension, counseling, or transferred \nto another school.\n  By requiring that offenders be expelled from the regular school \nprogram, the Gun-Free Schools Act mirrors policies in a growing number \nof State education codes and urban school district policies.\n  School violence--especially deadly violence--must be the Nation's top \neducational priority.\n  Sixty-five students and six school employees were shot and killed at \nU.S. schools during 1985-90, according to the Center To Prevent Hand \nViolence.\n  Without being safe in school, neither teachers nor students can be \nexpected to focus on learning.\n  In conclusion, there must be no uncertainty about the status of the \nGun-Free Schools Act of 1994. Gun possession on campus cannot be \ntolerated, the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 remains in place, and in \norder to receive Federal education funds every school district in the \nNation must soon have in place and functioning a policy that assures \nthat any youngster who brings a gun to school will be expelled for not \nless than 1 year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5747-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TULLAR BROTHERS NAMED KENTUCKY'S SMALL BUSINESS PERSONS OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \naccomplishments of two fellow Kentuckians who exemplify the American \nentrepreneurial spirit. William and Michael Tullar are brothers from \nGrand Rivers, KY, who are being honored in our Nation's Capitol on May \n2, 1995, as Kentucky's Small Business Persons of the Year by the Small \nBusiness Administration.\n  The Tullars' Livingston County business, known as Patti's 1880s \nSettlement, began in 1977 as a six-room motel and expanded to include \nHamburger Patti's Ice Cream Parlor which was named for the Tullars' \nmother.\n  Over the last few years, Tullar Enterprises, Inc., has grown into a \nfamily retreat which reflects the historical heritage of the region. \nLog cabins purchased throughout Kentucky and Tennessee were restored \nand are used for clothing boutiques, gift shops, and a clubhouse for \nthe settlement's miniature golf attraction. In addition, the Tullars \nhave created a country escape with landscaping that includes creeks and \nwaterfalls.\n  The Tullars were selected for this honor on the basis of their \nstaying power, growth in number of employees, increases in sales, \ncurrent and past financial reports, their innovative ideas, and their \ncontributions to community oriented projects. I am also pleased to note \nthat they were the Small Business Administration's 1994 Kentucky Blue \nChip Winners.\n  I applaud the Tullars' can-do attitude and their belief in running a \nfirst-rate business. These qualities have earned them distinction \nwithin Kentucky's small business community and I am proud to witness \ntheir recognition at the national level. My best to them on this \nauspicious occasion and my wishes for continued success.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5748-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5748-S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TAKE OUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage girls and young \nwomen throughout the Nation to aspire and work hard to make their \ndreams a reality. In honor of national Take Our Daughters to Work Day, \nI have with me today my own daughter, Sara.\n  When I was young, many women did not work outside the home. The women \nwho did work were teachers, nurses, and waitresses. Life has changed a \nlot since then. Young women today have more options and greater \nopportunities than ever before. There are over 58 million working women \nin this country today. There are 3.8 million women working in jobs not \ntraditionally held by women--occupations such as engineering, medicine, \nmechanics, construction trades, farming, forestry, and transportation. \nThey are even Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  Although it is encouraging to reflect on the changes that have been \nmade by women since my childhood, I believe that the job choices \navailable to young women today are not merely a matter of luxury. The \nreality is that many of our young women ultimately will be responsible \nfor the financial well-being of their families. Women's employment is \noften critical to keeping families above the poverty line. Children \nwhose mothers work are less likely to be poor, whether they live with \none parent or two.\n  The ability of young women to realize their goals of good paying, \nrewarding employment are hampered, however, by lack of involvement by \nparents toward their child's education. I was reading the Seattle Times \nlast Sunday, and Erik Lacitis, a staff columnist for the Times, \nsuggested that parents visit their child's school, a sort of Take Your \nParent To School Day. Mr. Lacitis comments that,\n\n       In talking to teachers over the years, what they tell me is \n     that a number of you [meaning parents] are strangers to your \n     kid's schools *** have you ever spent time in their \n     classrooms, say, volunteering to carry out a project with the \n     kids?\n\n  He ends his editorial by saying that one of the best things that \ncould happen to schools is the presence of parents in the classroom \nregularly.\n  I could not agree more. I wholeheartedly support the idea of taking a \nchild to work. I believe it is important for young people to see what \ntheir parents, and role models, do for 8 hours or more a day. It is \nimportant for us to show them they can achieve the same thing, and even \nmore. However, I also feel that we need to see and experience what our \nchildren are doing for 8 hours of their day. It would show our children \nthat we care about what they are learning in school, and would \nemphasize the importance of education in achieving their long-range \ngoals.\n  Mr. President, I feel that it is very important for me as a woman, as \na mother, and a Member of the U.S. Congress to encourage girls and \nyoung women throughout the Nation to realize their potential.\n  I never dreamed that I would become an elected official, much less a \nU.S. Senator. Today, I have the opportunity to be a role model for my \ndaughter Sara and for other women across the country. Young women need \nto understand that they don't have to give up one part of their lives \nfor another. Women should not have to choose between careers and \nfamilies. I work long hours for the citizens of my home \n[[Page S5749]] State of Washington as a U.S. Senator, but also dedicate \na lot of energy, caring, and love as a parent to my son and daughter.\n  Today is an important day in America. Across this Nation, parents are \ntaking their daughters and other young women to work. They are helping \nto broaden young women's horizons, to show them the range of options \navailable to them in the future.\n  I hope this day is a day when young women everywhere recognize that \nif they work hard and believe in themselves, they can be whoever they \nwant to be. I am a U.S. Senator today because I learned to face tough \nchallenges with courage, to take risks, not to be afraid to try, and to \nalways dream the impossible.\n  Finally, I would like daughters across this Nation to remember a \nlesson I was taught early on: When others say you can not make a \ndifference, they are usually just afraid you will.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5748-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID JOLLY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, tomorrow, in Missoula, MT, a man who has \ndone a great service for our Nation's national forests will be honored \nby his friends, family, and colleagues. David Jolly, the Regional \nForester for the U.S. Forest Service's northern region, is retiring \nafter almost 34 years of public service.\n  Dave's career in the forestry and natural resources field has been \nlong and distinguished. His work has taken him around the country where \nhe has lived in eight States and in Washington, DC. Dave was born in \nKnoxville, TN. He grew up in a small town called Norris, TN, where his \nfather worked as an economist for the Tennessee Valley Authority's \nForestry Department headquarters. In this environment, Dave developed a \ngreat passion for forestry as a young boy. He completed a pre-forestry \nprogram at the University of Tennessee then went on to receive a degree \nfrom North Carolina State in forestry in 1961. During his college \nyears, Dave served his country in the U.S. Naval Reserve.\n  Dave began his forestry career in the summer of 1961 working as a \nresearch aid for the Weyerhauser Co. in Centralia, WA. Later that same \nyear, he got his first job with the U.S. Forest Service as a forester \non the Francis Marion National Forest in South Carolina. From there, \nhis career took off as he went on to become district ranger on the \nOuachita National Forest in Arkansas, then deputy forest supervisor on \nthe Ozark and St. Francis National Forests in Arkansas.\n  In 1972, he furthered his education in public policy at the \nUniversity of Washington, then went on to work in the Forest Service's \nsouthern regional office in Atlanta. In 1976, he became forest \nsupervisor of the Shawnee National Forest in Illinois. In 1982, he \nbecame deputy director of the Forest Service's Timber Management \nProgram in Washington, DC. From there his career continued to flourish \nas he became deputy regional forester, then regional forester, of the \nagency's southwestern region overseeing the National Forests in Arizona \nand New Mexico. In 1992, I am proud to say, he came to Montana to \noversee the northern region. This was no easy task managing such a vast \nregion of forests and rangeland in Montana and Idaho but Dave did an \nexemplary job.\n  I personally came to gain a deep respect for Dave when the Department \nof Agriculture last year announced its intention to close region 1. \nDave played no part in this misguided decision. And, personally, I \nsuspect he shares my view that region 1 should remain open.\n  Yet Dave is a professional. He has never let his personal views be \nknown. But he has done a first-rate job of communicating with me, \nregion 1's employees, and the people of Montana. He has heard our \nconcerns. He has provided the best information possible. In short, Dave \nJolly is a class act.\n  I understand that Dave and his wife Peggy share a love of Montana and \nthe great outdoors. I am pleased to hear that they plan to stay in \nMontana for awhile. Dave plans to do a lot of fishing in his \nretirement--what better place than Montana? I am sure than in between \nfishing trips, Dave will maintain his lifelong interest in forestry. He \nis a member of the Society of American Foresters, Rotary International, \nand the Society for Range Management. I wish Dave and his family much \nhappiness in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5749-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week is Crime Victims' Rights Week. It \nwas so designated by the President long before the devastating events \nin Oklahoma City last Wednesday. Our hearts go out to the families and \nvictims of that terrible criminal act.\n  I know that the Attorney General and entire Federal, State, local, \nand international law enforcement community are dedicated to bringing \nthose responsible for this heinous act to justice.\n  I rise today to commend those who are working so hard on behalf of \nall crime victims in crime victims' assistance and compensation \nprograms.\n  Over the last 15 years we have made strides in recognizing crime \nvictims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to \nhave played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act \nof 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and \nRestitution Act of 1990 and the other improvements we have been able to \nmake.\n  Indeed, only last year, in the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, \nCongress acted to make tens of millions of dollars available to crime \nvictims. No amount of money can make up for the harm and trauma of \nbeing the victim of a crime, but we should do all that we can to see \nthat victims are assisted, compensated, and treated with dignity by the \ncriminal justice system.\n  With this in mind, I was shocked to find that the House-passed \nlegislation that would devastate funding for crime victims' assistance \nprograms and funding for child advocacy centers in the so-called \nPersonal Responsibility Act, H.R. 4. Among the most important advances \nachieved over the last few years has been our attention to crime \nvictims. We need to do more, not less.\n  The House bill would have the effect of reversing recent progress by \nprohibiting the use of the crime victims fund for victims' assistance. \nThat is the effect of section 371(b)(2) of the House-passed bill. \nBuried in the fine print in a section entitled ``other repealers'' is \nthe end of the Federal Crime Victims' Assistance Program. That is wrong \nand I strenuously oppose such efforts.\n  We in the Senate should use this week, Crime Victims' Rights Week, to \ndeclare our opposition to the House's short-sighted legislation. No one \nshould need a reminder of how important our crime victims' assistance \nprograms are.\n  For those who do, there is the recent, tragic examples of the bombing \nof the Oklahoma City Federal building and the gut-wrenching events that \noccur all too often in all too many of our urban and rural \njurisdictions throughout the country.\n  Recognizing appropriate rights of crime victims is essential to \nsecuring dignity and a proper place in the criminal justice process for \ncrime victims and their families. Last year, the Violent Crime Control \nAct included provisions to ensure a right of allocation for victims of \ncrimes of violence or sexual abuse. This is the right to be heard at \nsentencing, the opportunity for the crime victim to speak to the court \neither directly or through a family member or legal representative. I \nfully support that addition to Federal law.\n  Indeed, I plan to introduce a bill that would extend that right to \nall Federal crimes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5749-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5749-S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, much has been said and written in the \nlast 8 days since the bombing in Oklahoma City. And we have all been \nshocked and angered by the panoply of images dominating our television \nscreens and newspapers.\n  One hundred and ten dead have so far been recovered from the rubble, \nand there is fear that many more lie beneath slabs of cement and \ntwisted girders.\n  So many of those killed or injured were public sector employees, and \nI believe we should take a moment to consider their sacrifice.\n  All too often, its easy to abuse those who work in Government jobs. \nThey are called bureaucrats and accused of \n[[Page S5750]] wasting time around water coolers or with their feet up \non their desk.\n  But the blast offers another image--as survivors huddled on the \nsidewalk waiting amid the smoke and debris, as investigators swarmed to \nthe site and rescue workers began probing through the chasm that had \nbeen the Alfred T. Murrah Federal Building.\n  In the faces of that day we see Federal employees devoted to their \njobs. We see them as people who deserve great respect. They were \nalready hard at work that Wednesday morning when the bomb exploded at \n9:04 a.m. They were serving the public in 1 of 15 Federal agencies, \nincluding Social Security, Secret Service, Veterans Affairs, Customs, \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency, housed in that Federal building.\n  Among those who gave their lives was a Secret Service agent who \nworked for five Presidents and a Department of Defense special agent \nwho happened to stop by the Federal building shortly before 9 a.m.\n  In fact, at the Oklahoma Office of Housing and Urban Development, 35 \nout of 100 employees in the office at the time of the blast are either \ndead or missing and believed dead.\n  Of course, Federal employees were not the only casualties.\n  There was the 37-year-old nurse who ran into the building after the \nexplosion to save lives only to lose hers.\n  There were those in the Social Security office to enroll a 3-month-\nold, and, then there were the children in the day care center. Who \nshall ever forget the picture of the infant in the firefighter's arms?\n  The men and women who worked in the Murrah Building did not take \ntheir jobs for the money, for these were not high-paying jobs. They did \nnot take these positions because they were glamorous, for these \npositions often meant simply trying to solve everyday problems of \nordinary Americans.\n  I submit to you that the unsung heroes of the public sector--the many \nworkers who perished in this terrorist attack--were doing their best to \nserve the public.\n  It is their memory I honor today.\n                             among the dead\n\n  At least six agents from the Secret Service agency, located on the \nninth floor of the Federal building:\n  Donald Leonard had helped protect seven Presidents in his 25-year \ncareer. Before joining the service, he was an Army military police \nofficer and worked for the Treasury Department.\n  Agent Alan Whicher, 40, had protected President Clinton and just 2 \nmonths ago had taken a promotion to assistant special agent in charge \nof the Oklahoma City office.\n  Agent Cindy Campbell Brown had married a fellow agent 40 days \nearlier. Her new husband was still working in the Phoenix, AZ office. \nThey were waiting for transfers so they could work in the same office.\n  Agent Mickey Maroney worked his entire career for the agency and that \nmorning he had swapped shifts.\n  The Social Security Administration, located on the first floor \nallowing for easy access for constituents, was another agency with \nsevere casualties:\n  Sharon Louise Wood-Chesnut, 47.\n  Julie Welch, 23, worked with Spanish-speaking customers at the Social \nSecurity Administration. She was engaged to marry an Air Force \nlieutenant who was assigned to Tinker Air Force Base, east of Oklahoma \nCity.\n  Ethel Griffin, 55, was a service representative for the Social \nSecurity Administration. She was an avid craftswoman and loved her \nhobby. She is survived by her husband, Bruce, two sons, and three \ngrandchildren.\n  Other agencies, too, lost valuable workers:\n  Drug Enforcement Agency office assistant Carrol J. ``Chip'' Fields \nworked on the ninth floor of the building. She is survived by her \nhusband and a 21-year-old son.\n  Highway safety inspector Michael Carrillo, 44, had just returned to \nOklahoma to raise his three children. He was a veteran of the Vietnam \nwar.\n  Department of Housing and Urban Development's five attorneys, many \nsupervisors and support staff.\n  Army Recruiter Sgt. Lola Rene Bolden. Her two children, ages 13 and \n11, will now go to Alabama to live with their grandmother.\n  Marine Corps recruiter Sgt. Benjamin Davis, 29, was at the recruiting \nstation when the bomb exploded. He is survived by his wife and one \ndaughter.\n  Building inspector Steven Curry, 40, who worked for the General \nServices Administration. He leaves behind his wife and two teen-age \nchildren.\n  Department of Defense special agent, Larry Turner, was heading out of \ntown on assignment. He stopped by the Oklahoma City office shortly \nbefore 9 a.m. He, too, was among those killed.\n  Federal Credit Union loan officer Robbin Huff, who was expecting her \nfirst child in June, was killed.\n  Other credit union employees who died included: 32-year-old Christi \nJenkins and 23-year-old Frankie Merrell.\n  Many other Government workers who survived saw their lives shattered:\n  Edye Smith works as a secretary at the IRS office located just five \nblocks away from the Federal building. That morning, she took her two \nsons--3-year-old Chase and 2-year-old Colton--to the child care center \nlocated on the first floor of the Federal building. Her 2-year-old ran \nup to her as they said goodbye and said: ``I love you, Mommy.'' It was \nthe last time Edye ever could see her children. Edye's brother, police \nofficer Daniel Cross, found the two young boys. Both had been killed.\n  Twenty-year-old Aren Almon had just taken a new job at an insurance \ncompany. On April 18, her daughter, Baylee, had her first birthday. The \nnext morning, at 7:45 a.m., Aren took her daughter to the child care \ncenter. Her daughter was the child wearing yellow booties who was \ncarried out by a young firefighter shortly after the bomb exploded. The \nphoto of the young victim and the firefighter, Chris Fields, appeared \non newspapers all across the country and--without words--conveyed the \nhorror of this attack.\n  Still, too, innocent taxpayers looking to the Federal Government for \nhelp also saw their lives taken away:\n  Mike and Kathleen Turner left their 4-year-old daughter, Ashley, with \nMike's parents that Wednesday morning. At first, when news of the \nexplosion was reported, neither parent worried since their daughter was \nsafely tucked under the care of doting grandparents. Mike's parents, \nhowever, had made a morning appointment at the Social Security office. \nThey, of course, would have made sure to take Ashley with them. \nAshley's name appeared on the list of those killed by the bomb. \nAshley's grandparents appear to have died as well.\n  Thirty-six-year-old Pamela Argo worked hard--during the day as a \nhospital administrator and moonlighting as a caterer. Seven weeks \nbefore, her husband died. On Wednesday morning, she had gone to apply \nfor SSI benefits. She, too, died.\n  Cheryl Hammon accompanied her daughters, Felicia and Dana, to the \nFederal building to get a Social Security card for Dana's 3-month-old \nson Gabreon. Cheryl, Gabreon, and Dana's daughter, Peachlyn, were \npresumed dead. Dana survived after having her lower right leg \namputated.\n  Joe Mitchell was about to turn 65, so he and his wife of 30 years, \nLeigh, headed down to the Social Security office in Oklahoma City. \nShortly after 9 a.m., a Federal worker took Joe to a back office in the \nSocial Security office to fill out some paperwork. His wife stayed in \nthe lobby. The building was then rocked by the explosion. Joe survived. \nThere has been no sign of his wife since then.\n  The list, of course, goes on and on.

We're people like you and me, with kids and \n     families.\n\n  As mayor and now as Senator, I have seen the hard work of public \nworkers--paving our streets, serving in hospitals, fighting fires, \npatrolling our neighborhoods, assuring Social Security checks arrive on \ntime, serving in our armed services, assisting our veterans.\n  [[Page S5751]] It's fitting that we pay tribute to the dedication of \nthose who were busily working in the public's interest at the moment of \nthat terrible blast.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5749-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRAGEDY IN OKLAHOMA CITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the recent \ntragedy in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, throughout our land, so many have already spoken out \nso eloquently about this, that I can add but little to what has already \nbeen said. The suffering of the victims, the inhumanity and cowardice \nof the bombers, the compassion and heroism of our community of \ncitizens, and our solemn resolution to exact justice and punishment--\nall of these have been powerfully attested to already.\n  I will therefore limit myself to praise a particular aspect of our \nPresident's handling of this crisis.\n  There has been so much of our American democracy which has shown \nitself to be worthy of praise and of pride in this last week--from the \nbehavior of ordinary citizens in a time of trial, on up through the \nlabors of rescue and medical teams, through to the highest ranks of our \nlaw enforcement agencies, and up to the conduct of the President. I \ntrust that terrorists the world over would be rightly awed and cowed by \nthe great skill, energy, and resolution that has been displayed.\n  In the wake of such a horrible tragedy, there is a terrible feeling \nof powerlessness, and it exists for all of us, even those of us at the \nhighest levels of government. We had to hope that the perpetrators \nwould be caught. Many had to wait and to hope that loved ones would be \nfound alive. Even those who were actively engaged in bringing relief \nand justice had to contend with so many factors outside of their \ncontrol.\n  When I think of what the President faced, I am reminded in a small \nway of Dwight Eisenhower's recollection of the Normandy invasion. He \nhad done all he could to plan and to provide, but once he issued the \nfateful order--``Let's go!''--his subordinates scrambled to carry out \ntheir tasks, and he was left alone with a sudden realization: that he \nwas now powerless to do more than to hope that his orders would be \ncarried out successfully.\n  I can only imagine that a similar anxiety must have gripped the \nPresident as he issued orders which he hoped\n would bring answers--and arrests--in the wake of this tragedy. He must \nindeed believe himself to be fortunate that law enforcement agents \nacross the country worked so doggedly and so well, and so successfully, \neven as much remains to be done.\n\n  But even with everything the President had to hope for in terms of \ncarrying out an investigation, there still remained a duty that was \nhis, and his alone, as President of the United States. There is no way \nfor a President to delegate the responsibility of speaking for the \nNation, and of providing a voice of resolution and reason when events \nhave gone awry.\n  This action of the President has served this country so well in the \ndays after the tragic event. Yet now there appears to be some \nscapegoating by him today. He first voiced the Nation's determination \nto bring the criminals to justice. He had steadfastly resisted the \ntemptation to blame the tragedy on specific ethnic or ideological \ngroups. And he gave voice to what so many Americans were feeling, the \nfundamental commitment to law and to peaceful order shared by nearly \nall Americans, no matter where they stand politically.\n  It is not a duty to be underestimated. At a time when so many \nAmericans must necessarily feel themselves powerless to fight back \nagainst this cowardly attack, the need is great to have their feelings \nexpressed, and to have them channeled into a constructive collective \nresponse to this tragedy.\n  In those first few days, the President, even as he worked to comfort \nthe victims of the attack, succeeded in drawing a clearly understood \nline as to where this Nation stands. He asserted with great force and \nclarity that, on the one hand, Americans have a right to be suspicious \nof government, and to exercise their first amendment rights, their \nsecond amendment rights, and every other protected right. But this \nNation cannot and will not tolerate the exercise of rights that include \nviolent attacks on Federal officials, on their children, or anyone \nelse.\n  I pray that none of us, including the President, become vindictive \ntoward any group in America--whether they are Islamic Americans, \nconservative organizations, talk show hosts, or anyone else--we must \nremember that virtually all of these people are as horrified by this \nviolence as are we.\n  The President spoke well soon after the tragedy when he left no doubt \nthat Americans are not divided over these matters, but united in our \ncommitment to law and order, in a way that law-abiding Americans as \nwell as terrorists should be able to understand. And this was an \nimportant cathartic process for Americans as we coped with this \ntragedy.\n  I close by giving my thanks to those in our government who have \nworked so hard in these last days to ``bind the Nation's wounds.''\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to join with my colleagues in \nadopting Senate Resolution 110 which condemns the horrendous violence \nthat happened in Oklahoma City and urges the administration to bring to \njustice those responsible for committing this evil crime. In addition, \nthe measure expresses our deepest sympathy to the families that have \nlost so much and conveys our gratitude to all the Americans who have \nbeen assisting in rescue efforts.\n  Today, I would like to recognize those individuals from Nevada who \nhave joined in the heartbreaking struggle to help our friends in \nOklahoma. Dr. Scott Bjerke, a specialist in critical care at University \nMedical Center's trauma unit, Dave Webb, a fire specialist with the \nU.S. Forest Service, Metro Police Sgt. Bill Burnett, and Clark County \nfire paramedic coordinator chief Steve Hanson all are members of Clark \nCounty's elite 60 member Urban Search and Rescue Task Force which \nheaded to Oklahoma City to assist rescue workers. In addition, the \nClark County American Red Cross has sent Caroline Johnson, officer for \nthe disaster computer operations, to Oklahoma City. In times of \ntragedy, there are always heroes. All the Americans who have been \ndevoting endless time and emotions to ease the pain of so many are the \ntrue heros of this tragedy. I am proud that Nevadans have united \ntogether with the country during this time of such need. I thank these \nindividuals for their commitment to others.\n  Although we cannot ever heal all the wounds both emotional and \nphysical from this tragedy, I hope that those in Oklahoma will know \nthat Nevadans are praying for them and somehow that will lessen their \npain.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5751-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 956, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 956) to establish legal standards and \n     procedures for product liability litigation, and for other \n     purposes.\n       Pending:\n       Gorton Amendment No. 596, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my strong \nsupport for the Product Liability Fairness Act, which is the pending \nlegislative business before the Senate. Balanced reforms in this \nmeasure will help to promote fairness in the product liability system, \nhelp injured people get fair compensation for their injuries, allow \nbusinesses to get out of unjustified lawsuits, and improve safety \nconditions for working men and women in this country. With these \nreforms in place we will help alleviate the problems that undermine the \npresent system.\n  I want to commend at the outset the principal authors of this \nlegislation, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia and Senator Gorton of \nthe State of Washington, for their hard work. They have worked \ntirelessly on this effort for a number of years. I am pleased to have \njoined them in that effort over \n[[Page S5752]] the last several years, and as an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  It is very clear that our current product liability system does not \nwork. It is broken. I think we have a need and an obligation to try to \nfix it. Over the years a wide range of my constituents--consumers, \nmanufacturers, small businesses, and working men and women--have \nidentified the key problem. Far too often the results you obtain in a \nproduct liability case depend not on the merits of your claim but on \nyour ability to afford good counsel.\n  The statistics confirm what our constituents have been telling us. \nUnder the present system, injured people must wait too long for \ncompensation. Generally it takes an average of 2\\1/2\\ years for a claim \nto be resolved. A recent study by the GAO found that it can take up to \n5 years for a victim to receive their justified compensation. The \ndelays in the present system can--and I think do--lead to inadequate \ncompensation. Many seriously injured people who lack the resources to \npay their medical bills and support their families while waiting a \ndecision cannot afford to go 5 years without compensation. They have no \nchoice but to settle, and to settle in many cases for inadequate \namounts.\n  While the present system is not serving the needs of our injured \ncitizens well, it is also failing to meet the needs of American \nindustry and business. Many of these industries are reluctant to \nintroduce new products. When they look at their potential future \nliability, they see the different and distinct laws of 55 different \nStates and territories staring back at them.\n  This uncertainty is particularly difficult for smaller businesses who \ncannot afford the huge legal costs of the present system. In too many \ncases companies are forced to run up enormous legal bills only to be \nvindicated by the courts at a far later date. Who is well served by a \nsystem that stifles innovation? Who benefits when businesses are forced \nto defer investment on research and development? Who wins under that \nkind of system? Of course, no one does. If American businesses are \nunable to bring innovative products to the marketplace or are forced to \ntake healthful products off the market then we all lose.\n  Let me be specific. The search for an AIDS vaccine is a good example. \nThe Commerce Committee of this body has heard testimony from Biogen, a \ncompany in the State of Massachusetts. It stopped work on an AIDS \nvaccine because of product liability fees.\n  Even more disturbing is the way in which the current product \nliability system threatens entire industries. The contraceptive \nindustry is one example. A 1990 report issued by the National Research \nCouncil and the Institute of Medicine concluded:\n\n       Product liability litigation has contributed significantly \n     to the climate of disincentives for the development of \n     contraceptive products.\n\n  As the American Medical Association points out, 25 years ago there \nwere 13 American pharmaceutical companies researching potential \nproducts in the areas of contraception and fertility. Now there is only \n1--from 13 companies down to 1. Clearly, we need to change the system \nthat has bred these kinds of results. I think we can and we must do \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, with the passage of the Product Liability Fairness Act \nwe will do better. This legislation would improve the product liability \nsystem for everyone. I want to emphasize that. This ought not to be a \ncase of pitting attorneys against businesses and businesses against \nconsumers. Everyone will benefit as a result of the improvements in \nthis bill--the injured people who need fast and fair compensation, \nconsumers who need quality products to choose from, and those American \nenterprises who are on the cutting edge of international competition, \nand the workers who depend on a strong economy to support their \nfamilies.\n  The moderate reforms in this measure would reduce the abuses in the \ncurrent system without eliminating solid protections for those who are \nvictimized by defective or dangerous products.\n  I know my colleagues, Senators Rockefeller and Gorton, have already \ngone through the bill in great detail. So I will just highlight some of \nthe key provisions.\n  First, this measure would provide a far more uniform system of \nproduct liability. By adding more certainty to the system, the \nexcessive costs in the present system would come down. This potential \nbenefit motivated the National Governors Association to support this \nproduct liability reform measure. The association has said:\n\n        The United States needs a single predictable set of \n     product liability rules. The adoption of a Federal uniform \n     product liability code would eliminate unnecessary costs and \n     delay the confusion in resolving product liability cases.\n\n  Why is it important to quote the Governors here? Because some of the \nopponents of the bill have asked why we should be making changes at the \nFederal level when tort law is usually left to the States. That \nposition ignores the fact that 70 percent of all products now move in \ninterstate commerce. If the Governors of this country contend that a \nuniform Federal code in this area makes sense, then I think we ought to \nlisten to what they are saying.\n  The provision in the bill that encourages the use of alternative \ndispute resolution would also help reduce the excessive costs in the \ncurrent system. Currently, too much money goes to transaction costs--\nprimarily attorneys' fees--and far too little goes to the legitimate \nvictims that have been hurt.\n  A 1993 survey of the Association of Manufacturing Technology found \nthat every 100 claims filed against its members cost a total of $10.2 \nmillion. Out of that total of $10.2 million, the legitimate victims \nreceive only $2.3 million, with the rest of the money going for legal \ncosts and transactional costs. Clearly, we need to implement a better \nsystem in which the money goes to those who need it--injured people.\n  Consumers would also benefit from a statute of limitations provision \nthat preserves the claim until 2 years after the consumer should have \ndiscovered the harm and the cause. In many cases today injured people \nare not sure what caused their injuries, and by the time they figure it \nout they have often lost their ability to sue. This legislation would \nprovide relief for people in such situations and allow them adequate \ntime to bring a lawsuit.\n  This legislation also includes a number of provisions that are simply \ncommon sense. Under the bill defendants would have an absolute defense \nif the plaintiff, the one who is claiming the injury, was under the \ninfluence of intoxicating alcohol or illegal drugs and the condition \nwas more than 50 percent responsible for that person's injuries.\n  This provision, it seems to me, is nothing more than simple common \nsense. Why should a responsible company have to pay for the actions of \nsomeone who has, unfortunately, used alcohol or illegal substances? The \ncompany should not be held responsible, it seems to me, for that kind \nof an injury.\n  The bill also institutes reforms to assist product sellers. They \nwould only be liable for their own negligence or for failure to comply \nwith an express warranty. Product sellers who are not at fault could \nget out of cases before running up huge legal bills.\n  But as an added protection for injured people, this rule would not \napply if the manufacturer could not be brought into court or if the \nclaimant would be unable to enforce a judgment against the \nmanufacturer. So we have provided a sense of balance here to try to see \nto it that people are not left without any recourse at all.\n  Striking a balance is at the heart of this bill. Again I wish to \ncommend my colleagues from Washington and from West Virginia. This is a \nbalanced approach. We need to keep that in mind. There are a lot of \namendments that will be offered, and some may seem appealing, but when \nyou consider them keep in mind the totality of what has been done and \nthe balance we have struck.\n  This bill also contains an important section on biomaterials authored \nby my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. That provision is \ndesigned to ensure that manufacturers of lifesaving and life-enhancing \nmedical devices would have access to raw materials which are absolutely \ncritical in this important industry. In recent years, the supply of raw \nmaterials has been threatened by litigation. Those are the facts. I \ncommend my colleague from Connecticut for crafting a very promising \nsolution to that problem.\n  [[Page S5753]] The provisions that I have outlined here, Mr. \nPresident, demonstrate the balance that this legislation strikes \nbetween consumers and businesses. In the final analysis, the reforms in \nthis bill should strengthen our product liability system for everyone.\n  Of course, some of my colleagues are opposed to the measure--that is \nto be expected. They have raised some concerns, and certainly we look \nforward to the debates in the coming days. But I hope that we can avoid \nsome of the inflammatory rhetoric that has characterized the debate on \nthis issue in the past. This is a critically important issue involving \nthe rights and responsibilities of injured people, of working people, \nof American industry, and we ought to treat it with the seriousness it \ndeserves.\n  My involvement with this issue goes back to the early 1980's, Mr. \nPresident. At that time I had serious concerns about some of the \nproduct liability proposals before Congress. Along with our colleague \nwho retired from the Senate, Jack Danforth, of Missouri, and with the \nhelp of Judge Guido Calabresi, who was the dean of Yale Law School at \nthe time, we put together several proposals to deal with product \nliability. We never got very far with them. In fact, I do not think we \ngot our ideas out of the Commerce Committee. We have come a long way. \nWe are getting closer and closer to passing much-needed legislation in \nthis area.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support, if necessary, cloture motions \nto allow us to at least have a chance to debate these issues and to \ndetermine whether or not the majority of this body wants to support \nthis legislation.\n  Let me also say--and my colleague from Washington certainly is aware \nof this particular concern--there is a lot of attention being paid to \nthe punitive damages section. I have concerns about setting limits in \nthis area. I would much prefer a system that has been tried in a few of \nour States where the jury determines whether punitive damages should be \nawarded, but then have the judges determine the amount. In determining \nthe amount, the judge would follow a set of guidelines. This approach, \nwhich is the law in Kansas, addresses the concern about excessive or \n``runaway'' jury verdicts, while preserving the court's ability to \npunish certain egregious behavior.\n  I will not take the time here this morning to go into a longer \ndiscussion of this issue because I want the thrust of my remarks to be \nfocused on the totality of the bill.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think this bill strikes an excellent balance. \nIt is long overdue and represents a great step forward. Because we are \nso close to enacting these responsible reforms, I caution my colleagues \nagainst expanding the scope of the bill. For example, I know that some \nof my colleagues want to add medical malpractice provisions to the \nbill. I think that would be a mistake because it would jeopardize our \nability to get this legislation enacted.\n  Because of these concerns, I will not be offering as an amendment a \nsecurities litigation reform bill that I coauthored with my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Pete Domenici. Clearly there is a temptation to deal \nwith various areas of the law under the broader heading of legal \nreform. But we need to be sensitive to the particular problems in each \narea of the law and not lump matters together.\n  So I will oppose efforts to expand the scope of this bill. If someone \nwere to offer my bill on securities litigation reform as an amendment, \nI would oppose it. As many years as I have spent on it, it does not \nbelong on this bill. So I hope my colleagues will keep this measure \nnarrowly focused and help move it forward.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the pending business? Are we operating under any \nunanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an agreement to recognize the \nmajority leader to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am authorized to report that the majority leader does \nnot intend to take advantage of his right to offer an amendment at this \npoint. As a consequence, the floor is open for amendments. I understand \nthat the Senator from Kentucky intends to offer an amendment on medical \nmalpractice, which is a very broad and significant amendment, and I \nhope can be concluded during the course of the day but nevertheless \ndeserves considerable debate.\n  I think I also should like to announce that, of course, it is really \nthe turn of the opponents to this bill to offer an amendment, and if \nany of them wish to do so at the conclusion of this debate, I would \nappreciate their informing me or my colleague from West Virginia so \nthat we can try to see to it that amendments are dealt with in a fair \norder.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I should like to say how \nmuch I admire the forceful and cogent and persuasive remarks of my \nfriend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.\n  If I may make one or two more comments on a point of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Perhaps the most important of all of the points had to do with the \nbalance that adheres in this bill. It is the result of the work of many \nyears and work among Members of somewhat varying opinions other than \nthe proposition that something is broken and needs to be fixed in \nconnection with our product liability laws. So we have not gone all the \nway as far as we might in drafting this bill.\n  We have attempted not to go from one extreme to the other extreme, \nbut to come up with a solution that is fair to litigants, and that \nnonetheless will encourage the research and development of new \nproducts, marketing the new products, and the creation of economic \nopportunity in this country.\n  I was particularly struck by the forceful way in which the Senator \nfrom Connecticut spoke of the balance, the way we reached these goals. \nI also understand his concern with the present provisions on punitive \ndamages. We and others are working together to see whether or not we \ncannot come up with a superior solution to that which is included in \nthe bill at the present time.\n  But I do want to thank him for his most eloquent statement.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will shortly be offering an amendment, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington indicated, with reference to the \nmedical malpractice crisis that we have in our country. I will be \noffering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Kassebaum.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, would expand the product liability \nbill to include health care liability cases. Medical malpractice reform \nis a perfect fit with the product liability reform effort underway here \nin the Senate. Overlap exists between these two issues, and if we do \nnot reform them together, we could make the liability system even more \ncomplicated than it is now.\n  Take, for example, Mr. President, a lawsuit over an adverse reaction \nto a drug. The injured patient is likely to sue the doctor who \nprescribed the drug, as well as the manufacturer and the seller.\n  Now, Mr. President, if we only pass a narrow product liability bill, \nthe drugmaker and seller would be covered under the product liability \nreform, but the case against the doctor would proceed under different \nrules. The result could be two separate cases involving the same set of \nfacts.\n  Is that an improvement in the legal system? I think hardly is that an \nimprovement.\n  So I say to my colleagues who support product liability reform, let \nus take a new look. Medical malpractice reform needs to accompany \nproduct liability reform. The problems within our health care liability \nsystem establish the need for the reforms contained within this \namendment.\n  First of all, Mr. President, the liability system impedes access to \naffordable health care for many in our country. The Office of \nTechnology Assessment reports that half a million rural women do not \nhave access to an obstetrician to deliver their babies. Now, I know \nthat is an acute problem in rural areas of Kentucky. The American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that more and more \nobstetricians are giving up the practice and restricting themselves \nonly to gynecology, one of \n[[Page S5754]] every eight, according to their 1990 study.\n  Let me share a few statistics with you. In Georgia, 75 counties lack \nmaternity care; in Alabama, 2 counties; in Colorado, 19 counties have \nno maternity care whatsoever.\n  During the health care debate last year, I received a letter from Dr. \nLeonard Lawrence, president of the National Medical Association, whose \nmembership consists of African-American doctors. He wrote, Mr. \nPresident:\n\n       Minority physicians are particularly impacted by the \n     current medical malpractice crisis. The combined costs of \n     liability insurance and the threat of malpractice suits have \n     caused many of our members to stop practicing in high-risk \n     areas. The effects of these trends are painfully evident in \n     minority communities. Minority physicians who have \n     traditionally made a commitment to serve Medicaid patients \n     are being forced to discontinue these services.\n\n  Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues who are opposing the \nlegal reform effort argue that reform will have an adverse effect on \nwomen and low-income minority individuals. Well, this information \ndemonstrates that our failure to enact reform is what harms the women \nand minorities in the United States who need medical care.\n  The second problem caused by the medical liability system is the \ndecline in medical innovation. While doctors, as we know, practice \ndefensive medicine by ordering unneeded tests and procedures, they are \nalso less likely to take risks with treatment procedures and surgery \nbecause of the chances of getting sued. According to the General \nAccounting Office, a doctor has a 37-percent chance of being sued \nduring the course of his or her practice.\n  And there is the related issue of biomaterial access on which Senator \nLieberman has been our most conspicuous leader. We need to ensure that \nraw material suppliers will sell their products to those who make \nimportant lifesaving devices.\n  A third problem, Mr. President, concerns the erosion of the doctor-\npatient relationship caused by defensive medicine. The dean of the \nUniversity of Kentucky Medical School called my office this week to \nstress the importance of health care liability reform. He explained how \nhard it is to get young doctors to develop clinical skills when they \ncan order a battery of expensive tests which will protect them in case \nof a lawsuit. Apparently, the chance of being sued has nothing to do \nwith whether the doctor acted negligently. GAO reports that nearly 60 \npercent of all claims are dismissed without a verdict or a settlement.\n  Medical malpractice victims suffer from the same unpredictability of \nour civil justice system as other injured persons. Cases take too long \nto conclude, anywhere from 2 years to more than a decade. Of every \ndollar spent in the liability system overall in the United States, only \n43 cents goes to the injured party. A full 57 cents of every dollar \ngoes to the system itself, the lawyer and the court costs.\n  So, Mr. President, our goals here are basic and fundamental. First, \nto promote patient safety. Second, to compensate injured patients fully \nand fairly, but not to enrich the lawyers and the system; make health \ncare more affordable and accessible; contain the costs of the liability \nsystem; strengthen the doctor-patient relationship; and, finally, \nencourage medical innovation.\n  Before I explain what our amendment does, I want to be clear about \nwhat it does not do. First of all, there is no cap on pain and \nsuffering in this amendment. Doctors' groups advocate a cap on \nnoneconomic damages of $250,000. The House included such a provision in \nits legal reform bill last month, but we chose to omit a cap on pain \nand suffering for several reasons.\n  First, there are circumstances where an individual suffers a serious \ninjury but may have minimal or no economic losses. It seems harsh--not \nonly seems harsh, it would be harsh--to tell such victims who have lost \na limb or a sense of hearing, for example, that because they can go \nback to work, their damages are limited.\n  For too long, the proponents of reform have been attacked as trying \nto deprive victims of their rightful compensation. So we felt in \nintroducing our medical malpractice bill that we could offer many, many \nsignificant improvements to the system short of limiting pain and \nsuffering. Pain and suffering are part of compensatory damages awarded \nin an effort to make the victim whole. We can reform the liability \nsystem to make it more certain and more fair without limiting an \ninjured party's right to be made whole, and that is why we omitted such \na provision. There may be amendments offered to put a cap on pain and \nsuffering, but that is not something that this Senator could support.\n  The second issue we omitted from our bill was the so-called FDA \ndefense. That provision enables a company which obtained FDA approval \nfor its device or a drug to be shielded from punitive damages. During \nlast year's debate on a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed \nto product liability, this issue was prominently discussed. Several \nSenators cited their opposition to this provision which was included in \nlast year's product liability bill, and they cited that as their reason \nfor opposing cloture.\n  So we wanted to avoid that controversy connected with the full \nmedical malpractice bill. The FDA amendment may or may not be offered \nat some course during this debate and, as with the cap on noneconomic \ndamages, I welcome the debate. There is no reason not to discuss those \nissues and let them come to a vote if others would like to proceed with \nthat. But it is important to remember that with regard to the concern \ndrug manufacturers have, they still would benefit to some extent by the \ncap on punitive damages.\n  As for our amendment, let me explain what is in it. I talked about \nwhat is not in it, now let me talk about what is in it.\n  First of all, it is basically the same bill with some changes --no, \nit is basically the same bill that myself, Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Kassebaum introduced which was referred to the Labor Committee.\n  She, along with other members of that committee, made significant \nchanges in the bill from its introduction as S. 454. The amendment \ncontains a uniform 2-year statute of limitations, which is the same \nstatute of limitations contained in the product liability bill.\n  The amendment addresses punitive damages in much the same way that \nthey are handled in the product liability bill. Our amendment sets out \nthe standard for awarding punitive damages, either intent to injure, \nunderstood the likelihood of injury and deliberately fail to avoid \ninjury, or acted with conscious, flagrant disregard of a substantial \nand unjustifiable risk. Punitive damages may be handled in a separate \nproceeding, and the amendment sets out the eight factors that the court \nmay consider in determining the amount. The amount of punitive damages \nis limited to three times the economic damages or a quarter of a \nmillion dollars, whichever is greater.\n  The definition of ``economic damages'' specifically includes \nreplacement services in the home, such as child care, transportation, \nfood preparation and household care. We sought to be as comprehensive \nas possible to make clear that those individuals who do not work \noutside the home would be made whole for their losses. The fact that an \ninjured individual does not earn a significant or, for that matter, any \nsalary will not mean that there would be no economic losses.\n  I am aware in the Labor Committee that Senator Dodd successfully \noffered an amendment to eliminate the cap on punitive damages. We have \ndeclined to incorporate that amendment into this floor amendment \nbecause without a cap on punitive damages, you do not have uniformity, \nyou have no chance of getting predictability into the system. To do so \nwould make the medical malpractice section inconsistent with the \nproduct liability provisions, and it is important to keep these two \nissues on very similar tracks.\n  The amendment provides for periodic payment of future damage awards \nthat exceed $100,000. Periodic payments must be made in accordance with \nthe Uniform Periodic Payments of Judgments Act.\n  The amendment abolishes joint liability for noneconomic damages, \nincluding punitive damages.\n  Like the product liability proposal, the medical malpractice \namendment provides that defendants are only responsible for their \nproportionate share of the harm caused. Like the proponents of the \nproduct liability bill, we \n[[Page S5755]] seek to put an end to lawsuits brought against a party \nbecause of its deep pocket. The amendment also reforms the collateral \nsource rule to prevent double payment for the same injury. Amounts \nreceived by the individual from other sources, except those amounts \npaid by the individual or close family member, would be deducted from \nany damage award. The amount of the reduction would be determined in a \npretrial proceeding, and evidence regarding the reduction could not be \nintroduced at trial.\n  Further, Mr. President, the amendment limits lawyers' contingency \nfees to one-third of the first $150,000 and 25 percent of any amount \nover $150,000. Clearly, that benefits the victim so that the victim \ngets more of the money in these cases.\n  The amendment encourages States to adopt alternative dispute \nresolution and requires the Attorney General to develop guidelines for \nthe States. The amendment sets forth a number of ADR options, including \narbitration, mediation, early neutral evaluation, early offer, use of \ncertificates of merit and no fault.\n  The amendment also contains a separate subtitle on protecting the \nhealth and safety of patients. It provides that 50 percent of punitive \ndamage awards go to the State for licensing and disciplining health \ncare professionals, as well as for reducing malpractice-related costs \nfor health care providers who volunteer in underserved areas.\n  In addition, this subtitle requires the Agency for Health Care Policy \nand Research to establish a panel on patient quality and safety. Within \n2 years, this agency would take the work of the panel and establish \nguidelines for health care quality assurance, patient safety, and \nconsumer information.\n In the interim, this agency would report to Congress on the work of \nthe panel in these areas. Credit goes to Senator Jeffords for his hard \nwork on this provision and the great improvement he made on the \noriginal bill.\n\n  Finally, I want to mention the preemption provision. The opponents of \nlegal reform have all of a sudden become advocates for States rights. \nThey accuse the proponents of reform of hypocrisy for wanting to \nestablish Federal standards in these areas. But I argue we are not the \nhypocrites. First of all, we are not changing the substantive law of \nnegligence. Whether a doctor or hospital was negligent in the provision \nor administration of health care will still be a matter of State law. \nWe are not creating any Federal cause of action where none exists. \nNeither product liability cases nor medical malpractice cases will wind \nup in Federal courts if they could not be there today.\n  Second, Congress has the ample power to set national standards in \nthis area. As in the product liability arena, health care is a national \nissue. We spent weeks debating this subject last year. Medical products \nand drugs are in the stream of interstate commerce. Health maintenance \norganizations and other health care providers are national--I repeat \nnational--organizations operating throughout many States. And health \ninsurance is generally sold on a nationwide basis. While a particular \ndoctor-patient relationship may be local in nature, the delivery of \nhealth care is part of interstate commerce.\n  Moreover, the Federal Government, through Medicare and Medicaid, \nfunds a substantial part of the health care system. So the preemption \nprovisions strikes a balance in creating a minimum national standard. \nThose States which have enacted, or which in the future enact \nadditional restrictions on limitations, will supplement these national \nstandards.\n  I am aware that Senator Abraham, in the Labor Committee markup, \nsuccessfully offered an amendment to allow States to opt out of \nnational standards contained in this amendment. We have declined to \ninclude his amendment since we believe that preemption strikes the \ndelicate balance needed in this area.\n  There is much more to say about this amendment, and I am sure we will \nall have an opportunity to express our points of view during the course \nof the debate. The effort here is to improve and strengthen the bill so \ndoctors and hospitals are treated similarly to medical device and drug \nmanufacturers and sellers.\n  Mr. President, this is indeed a national problem.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 603 to Amendment No. 596\n\n(Purpose: To reform the health care liability system and improve health \n care quality through the establishment of quality assurance programs)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mrs. Kassebaum, proposes an amendment numbered \n     603 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas].\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 604 to Amendment No. 603\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the consideration of health care liability \n             claims relating to certain obstetric services)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 604 to amendment No. 603.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will read the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.    . SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CERTAIN OBSTETRIC SERVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of a health care liability \n     claim relating to services provided during labor or the \n     delivery of a baby, if the health care professional or health \n     care provider against whom the claim is brought did not \n     previously treat the claimant for the pregnancy, the trier of \n     the fact may not find that such professional or provider \n     committed malpractice and may not assess damages against such \n     professional or provider unless the malpractice is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence.\n       (b) Applicability to Group Practices or Agreements Among \n     Providers.--For purposes of subsection (a), a health care \n     professional shall be considered to have previously treated \n     an individual for a pregnancy if the professional is a member \n     of a group practice in which any of whose members previously \n     treated the individual for the pregnancy or is providing \n     services to the individual during labor or the delivery of a \n     baby pursuant to an agreement with another professional.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an amendment to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kentucky which addresses, overall, malpractice \nliability. This has to do with specific problems that arise in rural \nareas. It seems to me that rural area families across America deserve \naccess to quality health care, and that is a problem we deal with from \ntime to time. We need to search for solutions that reduce infant \nmortality rates, provide comprehensive prenatal care and yet allow for \nus to stand ready to serve in times of emergency. The rural obstetric \ncare amendment is part of that solution.\n  This amendment to rural obstetric care compliments the effort of the \nSenator from Kentucky. It addresses a specific problem in rural areas, \nrecruiting and retaining obstetric providers. It helps women obtain \nquality prenatal care and assists rural communities in developing a \nreliable and successful health care delivery system.\n  Some of these liability problems are unique to rural areas, such as \nlimited access, of course, to patient medical care and the history of \nthese patients through a period of time. Some areas in my State have \nlittle or no opportunities for prenatal care. The long distance of \ndriving exists. I think, particularly, of one good-sized town of \nRawlins, WY, in which, quite often, expecting mothers do the prenatal \ncare in Rock Springs or in Laramie, WY, both of which are more than 100 \nmiles away; and, quite often, they need emergency care in Rawlins when \nthe delivery time comes, and they find themselves going \n[[Page S5756]] for emergency care to a different physician. That is \nbasically what we are really talking about here. Because of these \ndistances and because of the unique rural problems, there is a dropout \nrate in delivery. So that providers delivering a baby often are \nproviders that have not had an opportunity to see the mother prior to \nthe treatment.\n  Shortage of practitioners in obstetrics, to a large extent, is due to \nhigh insurance premiums. So this amendment simply raises the \nevidentiary standards to clear and convincing for health care services \nprovided during labor or delivery of a baby. It only applies to health \ncare professionals who did not previously treat the individual. It does \nnot apply to providers who are on call or filling in for colleagues who \nare expected to have that information.\n  So it is a rather simple amendment that provides for this movement to \na higher level of evidentiary standard. There are, of course, a number \nof questions that could be asked that are somewhat mythical, I think. \nFor instance, does this exempt certain groups of providers? It does \nnot. The usual standard--the preponderance of evidence--remains in \nplace for the doctor's own patient. Two is that it imposes an unusually \nhigh burden of proof. That is also not true. The clear and convincing \nstandard is only slightly higher than the standard preponderance of the \nevidence and is significantly less than the standard of beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Some ask, does it eliminate the right to trial? It \ndoes not. Women are still permitted to sue the provider. And if \nnegligence is found, the woman recovers full damages.\n  Does it discriminate against women? Wrong. Women in rural areas would \nbenefit. The intent of the amendment is to encourage health care \nprofessionals to continue providing obstetrics to women who may not \nhave a physician or who are unable to get to their physician.\n  Let me quote from Phyllis Greenberg, executive director of the \nSociety for the Advancement of Women's Rural Health Research:\n\n       Unintended adverse reactions in a few should not create a \n     threat of liability so great as to disadvantage the many who \n     benefit.\n\n  Part of the benefit of the amendment would be to have an impact and \nto reduce malpractice premiums for obstetric providers in rural areas.\n  Let me share a little bit of the problem that we have in some rural \nareas. Let me compare the premium rates in Wyoming for health care \nproviders: $42,275 a year for OB/GYN specialists, compared to $9,800 \nfor pediatricians, $9,700 for internal medicine, $27,000 for general \nsurgery, $17,000 for emergency physicians, $10,000 for general \npractitioners without OB/GYN services coverage. On the other hand, \n$26,000 for general practitioners who have OB/GYN.\n  We can see clearly that practitioners in small towns that have \nrelatively few opportunities for obstetric services simply do not do it \nunless it is an emergency and because of the cost.\n  Further comparing Wyoming's $42,000 average malpractice premium for \nOB/GYN among the Rocky Mountain States, $22,000 in Idaho, $23,000 in \nUtah, $25,000 in Montana. So we have a problem and one that I think \ncould be relatively easily mitigated here.\n  It complements State obstetric liability laws; 25 States have \nstatutes on the book recognizing the need to provide relief for \nobstetric providers, full-fledged immunities for drop-in delivery \ncases.\n  We think, also, that it would help recruit and retain obstetric \nproviders. In rural areas of 105 family practitioners, in Wyoming only \n27 provide obstetric services. For specialists, there are only 25 OB/\nGYN providers in the State delivering babies. That is 52 physicians \ntrained in obstetrics to cover 90,000 square miles.\n  In the city of Sheridan there are only two providers. We used to have \neight. One current provider watched his premium rise from $4,000 a year \nin 1978 to $35,000 a year in 1995.\n  There is some background for this proposal, and this amendment was \nincluded in Jim Cooper's Managed Competition Act last year and the \nRowland-Bilirakis Consensus Act of last year. Bob Michel's Affordable \nHealth Care, a new act, included provisions of this kind. Majority \nleader Bob Dole's alternative health reform proposal includes this as \nwell.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment to the bill of the Senator from \nKentucky helps women and families across rural America obtain quality \ncare. It helps rural communities fend off physician shortages, plaguing \nhealth care service delivery systems. It lowers health care costs, so \nconsumers may pay the true cost of medical service instead of that cost \ninflated by malpractice premiums, and it complements overall \nmalpractice reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be good enough to yield briefly for a \nquestion or two on his amendment?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the chance to address the Senator on the \namendment. I believe this was a matter that was given some \nconsideration in the Human Resources Committee and eventually dropped \nin the final legislation that was passed out of the committee.\n  Let me ask a question: For example, effectively this immunizes a \ndoctor from any negligence suit, am I correct, if that doctor had not \ntreated the patient prior to the time of delivery?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No, I think the Senator is not correct. It simply raises \nthe standard of evidence to the immediate level. It does not immunize \nif there is malpractice here, if liability is here. The difference and \nthe purpose here is that this physician who delivers this baby has not \nbeen a physician that has been in the case for prenatal care and, \ntherefore, is given, under this amendment, simply a clear and \nconvincing standard as opposed to the preponderance of evidence. I \nthink the Senator is not correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator explain why we are having a different \nstandard for the delivering of babies, why we have a different standard \nthan the preponderance of the evidence?\n  What is the Senator's reason, again, if the Senator would share it. \nThis is somewhat different. I asked to have the amendment read because \nwe had an amendment that was also focused upon obstetricians in the \nearlier draft of the malpractice legislation, and now we have another \napproach.\n  I am just trying to understand. I think it is a different standard \nthat would be for those doctors that would come on and treat an \nexpectant mother. Can the Senator indicate to the Senate why we ought \nto have a different standard, why doctors ought to be held to a \ndifferent standard at the time of the delivery of a baby from the \npreponderance of the evidence standard? What is the rationale? What is \nthe justification of that?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think the justification is to provide delivery services \nfor mothers in a community where there would not be services otherwise.\n  For instance, a general practitioner who might normally deliver \nbabies, because of the cost of malpractice insurance simply does not do \nthat. So the expectant mother has, through the pregnancy, gone to \nLaramie, 150 miles away.\n  But then comes an emergency. What we are doing is we are saying to \nthis physician, although the physician does not do this as a normal \nthing, who is not able to pay this extraordinary amount of money, that \nwe will provide some sort of a higher standard here because the \nphysician is doing this not as a regular practice but as an emergency \ntreatment process.\n  It is not designed to have anyone with less competency. It is not \ndesigned to do that, but to encourage services where there are none.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Senator, is this limited just to emergency \nprovisions? I am still trying to get from the desk a copy of the \namendment. I apologize to the Senator.\n  Is this applied solely to an emergency situation as described in the \nresponse to my question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. It applies only to people, to physicians and providers \nwho have--they are either on call or they are part of a group. In that \ncase we would have expected them to participate in the previous \ninformation regarding this patient.\n  So this applies only when we go to this physician not having been \ninvolved with them previous to that.\n  So, basically, yes, it does limit it only to that circumstance where \nthis \n[[Page S5757]] physician has not been a party to the care prior to the \ndelivery. That is our intention, Senator. If that is not the case, we \nwould like to make it clear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I have the amendment. As the Senator knows well, \neffectively the Senator is saying to the mother and the child, \neffectively, that under this amendment it says, ``The trier of the fact \nmay not find that such professional or provider committed malpractice \nand may not assess damages against such professional.'' You are \nimmunizing, getting a different standard for those doctors.\n  Does the Senator know, could the Senator indicate what the basis is \nfor the amendment, where the hearings were, what the testimony has \nbeen, who we have heard from?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Let me suggest a couple of things. First of all, the \nwhole world is not in boxes. There are differences in terms of the \navailability of services, and we are seeking to deal with that.\n  Second, it does not immunize, and I already have spoken to that. It \nsimply raises that level of evidence. In fact, it says in the \namendment, the Senator I am sure read that, it may not assess damages \nagainst such professional unless malpractice is proven by clear and \nconvincing evidence. So it certainly does not immunize it.\n  Let me say, further, as I said before, the Senator talked about the \nprevious consideration, and it was part of Representative Cooper--we \nworked, as the Senator knows, and the Senator worked very hard last \nyear in health care. These things were not out of the blue. It was in \nMr. Cooper's bill and in the Rowland-Bilirakis bill.\n It was in Bob Dole's bill. It is not a new idea, and indeed has been \ndiscussed at great length.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator's reference with regard to Boston--this \napplies to Boston as well as rural America. The fact is, you have, in \nthis language, ``* * * the trier of the fact may not find that such \nprofessional or provider committed malpractice * * *.'' and then you \nhave, ``* * * and may not assess damages * * *.''\n  It says it ``* * * may not find that such professional or provider \ncommitted malpractice * * *'' That is what the amendment says. You can \ndefine it in whatever way you want, but that is what it says. Then it \ncontinues, ``* * * and may not assess damages against such professional \nor provider unless the malpractice is proven by clear and convincing \nevidence.'' This says ``* * * professional or provider committed \nmalpractice * * *.''\n  I just wonder why we are, with the amendment--we will have a chance \nto talk about this in greater detail--but why we are suggesting this \nparticular amendment to the families of this country? I think whether a \ndoctor is delivering--I can see a circumstance where he is immunizing, \na particular doctor in a group practice, that they are going to send in \nthe person who has not been working with the expectant mother because \nthey want to have a lesser standard, or immunizing the doctor against \nmalpractice.\n  Are we trying to encourage the practice of obstetricians who may have \nlost their licenses or may be under some other kind of penalty? Are we \nimmunizing them against practicing in terms of gross negligence or \nother kinds of negligence?\n  This amendment is very clear, and it does apply to Boston. There is \nnothing in here about rural America. It is talking about all doctors: \n``* * * may not find that such professional or provider committed \nmalpractice * * *'' It says ``* * * and may not assess damages * * *'' \n``* * * and may not assess * * *'' But it says ``* * * committed \nmalpractice * * *.''\n  I do not know--is the Senator familiar with where the greatest number \nof obstetricians are in this country at the present time? And what the \nrates for malpractice insurance are in those particular areas? You have \nthe highest number of obstetricians in the country now out in Long \nIsland. They have the highest rates of malpractice insurance. What is \nthe point the Senator is talking about?\n  Where is the testimony that this is going to produce greater services \nto people in either urban or rural areas?\n  Mr. THOMAS. If the Senator will yield, it was my understanding you \nwere going to ask questions and not----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am asking the question where is the testimony, where \nis the hearing? I will be more precise.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, I already went through that. I told you we went \nthrough that last year in several places.\n  If the Senator will support this, we would be happy to put in, in our \nsecond one here, that is only under the definition by the Public Health \nService of rural areas.\n  I am sure that is not the case. I am sure the Senator is not talking \nabout my amendment. He and I have quite a different view of what we \nought to do on malpractice, and I understand that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just trying to find out what the amendment says. I \nam just reading the language in here----\n  Mr. THOMAS. You are--you are misreading.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What it says on it, and asking for your explanation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We do not read it the same.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have urban areas as well as rural areas. Public \nhealth does that. We have what is in the nature of underserved areas in \nurban areas. So I do not know that helps the Senator's position. I do \nnot understand the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Massachusetts will \nsuspend, the Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have tried to explain the answers. No. 1--let me go on \njust a little bit further.\n  If the Senator would feel more comfortable, we will be happy to put \nin ``* * * as defined by the Public Health Service.'' So it would be, \nindeed, rural areas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, may I ask you, on this point that you just \nmentioned, are you suggesting that the Public Health Service only \ndefines underserved areas as being rural areas?\n  Mr. THOMAS. There is a definition, as the Senator well knows. I will \ncite it for him if he would like; section 330 (b)(3), or 130-27 of the \nPublic Health Service Act, which defines underserved areas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That also includes urban areas; does it not?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suspect so. It defines rural areas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the Senator's point? Are you trying to say you \nwould offer this if I would agree with it? The point I am making is I \ndo not want poor practice in rural areas or urban areas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are not talking about poor practice. We are talking \nabout providing services where there is none, Senator.\n  Furthermore, and then I conclude here, I think if the Senator wants \nto read it fairly, it says ``* * * may not find that such professional \nor provider committed malpractice and may not assess * * *.'' That is \nall one sentence. The Senator divided that.\n  I understand you do not agree. You do not want malpractice insurance. \nI understand you do not want to change the legal system, Senator, but I \ndo. These are the reasons, and I think very legitimate ones.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was going to ask of the Senator, \nfinally, whether he was familiar with the fact the Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Kassebaum, dropped this very provision when these matters were \nbrought to her attention in the course of the committee. They were \ndropped by the Senator. That, you know, happens to be the chairman of \nthe Human Resources Committee, where many of these measures were read.\n  I am asking and inquire why the Senator from Wyoming is convinced of \nit when the other members of that committee, who have prime \njurisdiction, felt they ought to drop it?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will answer the question. I ask if the Senator always \nagrees with the Energy Committee if they drop something?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you could explain why?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will. I have explained. I shall explain one more time.\n  This comes from experience in our own State, Senator. We worked with \nthis sometimes. We have difficulties in \n[[Page S5758]] recruiting physicians for these areas. We are seeking to \nfind a way to provide services, in my case, for areas that are \nbasically rural. I am here to defend my constituency, as you are. We \nhave problems and they are unique problems, and I think this is an \napproach to do that. That is what I am seeking to do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I cannot possibly understand the \nrationale. If I could just have the attention of my friend from \nWyoming?\n  I am prepared to see that the people in Wyoming make up their own \njudgment of malpractice. It is the Senator from Wyoming who is \nsupporting the position that is going to preempt the States. The \nSenator's point is absolutely correct. Malpractice ought to be decided \nin the States. It ought to be decided by Wyoming what is in the \ninterests of Wyoming. I am for it.\n  I think Wyoming ought to make a judgment and decision in terms of the \nstandards, whatever you want to do out there. That is the position of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. That is not what this bill is going to, \nand what the Senator is amending. They are basically preempting the \nStates with one Federal standard. And that is different from the \nproduct liability.\n  Product liability applies to products that are shipped interstate. \nThis is the most sensitive relationship between a doctor and a patient. \nAnd why does Washington know best on this? The Senator has made my \ncase. He ought to oppose the McConnell amendment for the very reasons \nthat the conditions in Wyoming are different from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. THOMAS. May I ask a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They are different from Boston. I will yield for a \nquestion, but I--I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Will you explain to me why you were the major proponent \nof Federal health care last year?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of course. I will be glad to do that. There are very few \npeople who have not heard me explain it.\n  That is because I think decent quality health care for all Americans \nought to be a right and not a privilege, Senator, for Members of the \nCongress of the United States like you.\n  Mr. THOMAS. And the Federal Government ought to provide it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order, Mr. President. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a very good program. I pay $103 a month. The \nSenator from Wyoming pays about $300 a month.\n  The difference with the Senator from Wyoming and Massachusetts is \nthat I want the American people--in Massachusetts and Wyoming--to have \nthe same thing that we have. I was also interested during the time of \nthe Contract With America that we came in and said, ``Look. Whatever \napplies to Congress ought to apply to the American people.'' And \neveryone made their speeches and supported it. That is what we did.\n  The other side of the coin is all of those Members that have the \nContract With America have national health care. They have good health \ncare. They are covered. The Senator from Wyoming is covered, like 40 \nmillion other Americans are not covered, like the additional 1 million \nthat became not covered in the last year of which 800,000 are children \nwho are not covered. The difference with the Senator from Wyoming and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is I would like to make sure that the \npeople of my State and the State of Wyoming have the same thing the \nSenator from Wyoming and I have. That is entirely different from what \nwe are talking about in terms of the malpractice and the whole question \nof liability.\n  Mr. THOMAS. And States rights.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. States rights--the Senator is arguing my position on \nthis issue. If I could, I have the floor. I would like to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from \nMassachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming will suspend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under Senator McConnell's position, effectively you have \npreemption of the States under any of the State laws that apply \nanything that is more favorable than is differentiated from the \nSenator's legislation that advantages the consumers. You preempt State \nlaw; preempt them. This great body of leadership that says, ``Why don't \nwe block grants that Washington does not know best, let us let the \nStates do that'', that is what I am for on the malpractice. That is not \nwhat the McConnell bill does. And the Senator from Wyoming is offering \nan amendment on the McConnell bill that will set Federal standards, and \npreempt States rights. The McConnell bill preempts States rights.\n  When we offered an amendment in the Human Resources Committee to \neffectively eliminate the preemption of States, it was defeated. I \nwould welcome the opportunity to cosponsor a second-degree amendment \nthat will preserve that on the McConnell amendment right now. I welcome \nthe opportunity. If you want to preserve the States rights of what \nWyoming knows and Wyoming knows best, Massachusetts knows and \nMassachusetts knows best, let us do a joint amendment right now to the \nMcConnell amendment. I propose that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am a little puzzled. May I ask a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes; certainly.\n  Mr. THOMAS. First of all, the Senator from Massachussetts talked \nabout the committee, that that which was proposed was dropped at the \nstaff level. It is supported by the chairman. No. 2, the Senator has \ngone on. I watched. Here is the Senator's States rights business from \nlast year. Do not tell me that you are for States rights. Look at this. \nHere is your health care package. Tell me there is States rights in \nthat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator read the malpractice provisions in \nthere where we do not preempt the States? Will the Senator at least be \nhonest enough in terms of talking about this measure of malpractice, be \nhonest enough to look and find out what our committee did with regard \nto States rights last year? That is all we are asking. I mean, let us \nnot get away from the fundamental issue which is before the Congress on \nthe McConnell proposal. That is whether we are going to have a Federal \npreemption of States on the issues of tort reform or whether we are \ngoing to let the States make that judgment and that decision. That is \nthe essential part on the whole tort reform debate that we are having \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senator has offered an amendment to that, not to preserve the \nState of Wyoming rights to make its own judgment. That was not in the \nSenator's amendment. You have gone to effectively immunize \nobstetricians from the malpractice and use a whole different standard \nof evidence at times of trial. That is an entirely different kind of \nissue. If the Senator wants to have Wyoming do what Wyoming wants on \nthis malpractice, the Senator is welcome to have the opportunity to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, unless there is anything further or any other inquiry \nthat the Senator would want, I would like to address the underlying \nmeasure that we have before us.\n  I see the Senator from Kentucky is now here. If I could just ask. As \nI understand it, this effectively, just for general clarification or \npoint of information, this is basically the measure that was reported \nout of the Human Resources Committee without the Dodd amendment and \nwithout the Abraham amendment and as currently being amended by the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, this amendment \nessentially is not what was reported out of the Labor Committee but \nrather the bill introduced earlier in the year by myself, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Kassebaum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The point probably does not make much difference to the \nMembers. Here we have had the measure that was before the Human \nResources Committee and had gone through a period of markup by the \nmembers of that committee and was reported out just a few days ago \nreflecting the members' judgment on the Human Resources Committee. Now \nwe have a different measure here on the \n[[Page S5759]] floor of the Senate. The Senator is obviously entitled \nby the rules of the Senate to proceed in that way.\n  There was a time when we Republicans and Democrats alike were trying \nto see if we could not work out some of the particular measures. Last \nyear, when we dealt with the malpractice provisions, we ended up with a \nvirtually unanimous vote on the malpractice provisions as part of the \noverall health care reform--a lot of diversity in this body, a lot of \nwillingness to spend 2\\1/2\\ days in our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee considering this issue, and, at the end of it, we ended up \nwith a unanimous vote. During the course of the consideration of what \nis basically the underlying McConnell amendment, I offered that as an \nalternative. The measure which had Republican and Democrat support. I \nwill get into more description of it later in the course of this \ndebate. And it was rejected. But, nonetheless, the Human Resources \nCommittee reported out that measure. It was reported out. I thought at \nleast if we are going to be debating the malpractice issue that we \nwould have an opportunity to do so. But that is not the circumstance.\n  Mr. President, let us take in the McConnell amendment the health care \nliability reform. Let us take the findings. Findings become more \nimportant particularly in the wake of what has happened in the last \nhours over in the Supreme Court on the whole issue of handguns. With \nthese findings we are finding out that the Supreme Court is paying \nattention, that they have to relate to the follow-on provisions of the \nlegislation. We are reminded about that. We have been reminded over a \nperiod of years in circuit courts and now certainly by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Let us just begin by taking a look at the McConnell amendment on the \nfindings. It says Congress finds on health care the following: Effect \non health care access and costs. And from the title of this finding one \nwould think that this bill is just what the doctor ordered. At the \nheart of health care crisis facing working families and health care \naccess and cost is that we have 40 million citizens who have no health \ninsurance to protect them against the high cost of medical care, and \neven those who have insurance cannot be confident that it will be there \nto protect them in the future if they become seriously ill. The cost of \nmedical care is burgeoning the family budgets all over this country. \nBut just read on.\n  So we would expect that the rest of the measure will have some \nrelevancy to the effect of health care access and cost. Those are the \ntwo elements in the health care crisis, the 40 million Americans who do \nnot have any, increasing numbers that are losing in the employer-paid \nsystem, and the continued escalation in terms of the health care cost.\n  It goes on. The next provision says the civil justice system of the \nUnited States is a costly and inefficient mechanism for resolving \nclaims of health care liability and compensating injured patients. I \ncertainly agree with that where we have only 10 percent of the victims \nof malpractice ever bringing a suit.\n I have here in my hand Business Week, March 27, shown to me by my good \nfriend, Senator Hollings, from South Carolina, who was here just a few \nmoments ago. It points out in this article of just a few weeks ago:\n\n       One issue often neglected in the debate over malpractice \n     insurance is the system's efficiency in compensating injured \n     patients. The most exhaustive look at this issue is a recent \n     study of 31,000 hospital admissions in New York State by a \n     Harvard University team headed by Paul Weiler, Howard Hiatt, \n     and Joseph Newhouse. Its findings: Some 4 percent of \n     admissions involved treatment-caused injuries. One-fourth of \n     the injuries involved negligence. One-seventh resulted in \n     death.\n       On average, only one malpractice claim was filed for every \n     7.5 percent of the patients suffering a negligent injury and \n     only half of these were ultimately paid. So, ``The legal \n     system is paying just 1 malpractice claim for every 15 torts \n     inflicted in hospitals.'' Those suffering nonnegligent \n     injuries--that is, caused by care not yet deemed \n     inappropriate--got nothing. Thus, the study concludes that \n     rather than a surplus, there is a litigation deficit because \n     so many injured people wind up uncompensated.\n\n  You have the question now about whether the civil system is working \nin a way to try and deal efficiently with the malpractice which is \ntaking place and how can it be done more effectively. We had an option \nand an alternative to do that, which was bipartisan, which has \neffectively been rejected and now we are back to the McConnell \namendment that goes on and talks about, ``The civil justice system of \nthe United States is a costly and inefficient mechanism for resolving \nclaims of health care liability and compensating injured patients.''\n  I would certainly agree with that. And all the material that we have \nlooked at would certainly underscore that.\n  Only 10 percent of the victims of malpractice bring a suit. Many \nvictims who receive awards are undercompensated, due to the caps on \ndamages imposed by almost half of the States. When cases go to trial, \ndoctors win 60 percent of the cases in which, independent studies have \nconcluded, they were, in fact, negligent.\n  So I would support a bill that addresses these problems, although it \ncertainly would not be a serious solution to the problems of cost and \naccess. But this bill only tips the balance further in favor of the \nhealth providers and farther against the working men and women who are \nthe victims of the practice.\n  Let me read on.\n\n       And the problems----\n\n  This is from the measure that we have before us.\n\n       And the problems associated with the current (malpractice) \n     system are having an adverse impact on availability of, and \n     access to, health care services and cost of health care in \n     the United States.\n\n  Two million people lose their health insurance every month, and if \nyou can find one who lost it because of the medical malpractice \nliability system, I would like to meet him.\n  We will spend $1 trillion on health care this year. That number will \ndouble in the next 10 years. Medical malpractice premiums account for \nabout 1 percent of that total and premiums are not even rising \nsignificantly.\n  Even the AMA cites estimates that the costs of ``defensive medicine'' \naccount for only 2.5 percent of health spending. Both the OTA and CBO \nconcluded that tort reform like the kind provided in this bill would \nsimply not produce any reduction in those figures. Is it not time we \ngot serious about dealing with the health care costs instead of \npretending that bills like this will do anything other than victimize \npatients to benefit providers?\n  It is interesting that one of the first measures that we are dealing \nwith on health care, with all of the problems that we are facing, with \nthe number of Americans who are not covered, with the increasing number \nof children who are not covered--and those numbers are increasing--with \nall the problems that our seniors are having in terms of affording \nprescription drugs, all the needs that are there in terms of home \ndelivery services, all the difficulties and challenges that we have in \nterms of the health care crisis, we are dealing with this issue of the \nmalpractice reform in a way that is going to preempt the States from \ndealing with this issue, which they have had for some 200 years, and at \na time where the case I think has yet to be made why this is necessary.\n  And let me just mention very briefly, I hope those who are going to \nsupport it will explain to the Senate why we need it. First of all, the \nnumber of malpractice cases has been declining over the period of the \nlast 5 years.\n  Second, the malpractice premiums for the medical profession have been \ndeclining over the period of the last 5 years.\n  Third, the awards for malpractice that have been made in the various \ncourts have been declining for the last 5 years.\n  And finally, the profits of the industry, the insurance industry in \ndealing with malpractice have been going up through the roof, going up \nthrough the roof. We are not where we had been a number of years ago \nwhen we saw many of these companies saying, look, we just cannot--we \nare going to get out of this whole area of malpractice. We just cannot \nafford it. We just cannot go forward with it. We just cannot deal with \nit.\n  The fact is this malpractice insurance is enormously profitable to \nthe insurance industry. And rather than leaving the insurance industry, \nit is highly competitive and more and more companies are going into \nthis kind of \n[[Page S5760]] coverage. The publications of the insurance industry \nreflect that and the profits of the various companies sustain it.\n  And so we have a situation where there is, Mr. President, an \nimportant need in terms of covering the American people. The best \nestimate is anywhere from 80,000 to 100,000 people die a year from \nnegligence and malpractice--80,000 to 100,000 people die a year, where \nonly a small fraction of negligent malpractice cases are even brought, \nand where review after review of even those that are brought, where \nthere have been findings that there has been review of those cases by \ndoctors and professional groups, suggests that those findings by and \nlarge have been fair and that any review of the total numbers of cases \nthat have been brought over the period of the years would justify \nadditional kinds of findings as well.\n  Here is Business Insurance: ``Insurance Malpractice Coverage in \nStable Condition.''\n\n       Despite the rapid change in health care delivery, the price \n     of medical malpractice and professional liability coverage \n     for health care organizations remains stable and capacity is \n     plentiful. Most hospitals and health care systems will renew \n     their liability coverage as in 1994 in part because of a \n     decrease in claims severity and frequency for most health \n     care organizations.\n\n  It goes on and talks about there is more capacity, there are more \nplayers than 3 years ago.\n\n       It seems like every month a new insurer wants to underwrite \n     medical liability coverage for health care organizations.\n\n  Business Insurance, the publication for the insurance industry, says \nthis is an area to get in, the profits are there. The total numbers, \nthe statistics show that the awards, the numbers of cases, the \njudgments are going down and that the principal problem that is out \nthere is people who are subject to malpractice are not being \ncompensated. And what are we doing here with the McConnell proposal?\n  What are we doing here? We are effectively saying to Wyoming, to all \n50 States, that we know best on the issue of tort reform; that we are \ngoing to have a preemption, one-way preemption. If your State, for \nexample, was to provide some additional kinds of protections in terms \nof consumers, we will preempt you.\n  Now, in the Labor and Human Resource Committee, the Abraham amendment \nsaid: All right, we will preempt you, but if the State wants to get out \nfrom underneath the preemption, that will be accepted. And that was \naccepted by the committee.\n  But not in the McConnell amendment; not in the McConnell amendment. \nIt is a one-way preemption.\n  I see other Members who want to speak to this issue, so at this time \nI will just conclude.\n  It is difficult for me to understand, Mr. President, why we are \ntaking an issue which is so personal, involving a doctor and a patient, \nin which the States have worked out their own accommodations, where the \nCongress is not being pleaded to by the States for Federal action, and \nwhile the industry itself is successful, experiencing record profits in \nthis area--I will get into that later on in the discussion--why we are \nbeing compelled to say that we will have a one size fits all, \neffectively saying that we here on this issue, which is so personal \nbetween a doctor and a patient, so personal, that we are going to have \nto have a Federal solution. And that is what the McConnell amendment is \ndoing.\n  I find it just troublesome, as I mentioned earlier, where we have all \nthe challenges that hard-working families are facing in this country, \nthat workers are facing, wondering whether they are going to continue \nto have the coverage that they have today, where working families are \nworried about whether their parents are going to be covered, where \nworking families read about the cuts in Medicare that are going to be \ncoming down the road, where most of our seniors are paying $1 out of $4 \nin terms of out-of-pocket expenses for additional health care needs. \nThey are concerned about them. They are concerned about their children, \nwhether their children are going to get decent quality health care.\n  And we see, with the Carnegie Commission report and the other \nreports, the total number of children that are not being covered. With \nall the needs that are out there, here comes the U.S. Congress and \nSenate saying, ``On this one, we are going to look out for the industry \nand the AMA.'' That is what this is all about. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, basically, there should be adjustments, there should \nbe changes made in the current system. We ought to be encouraging \nalternative dispute resolutions. We ought to give experimentation to \nthe States to be able to do that.\n  In our proposal last year, we even had limitations in terms of the \ncontingency fees in a bifurcated way, in terms of the early payments \nand later kinds of payment. We dealt with collateral issues. We dealt \nwith the experimentations that would be taking place in States so that \nthey could develop practice guidelines and consider, if they used \npractice guidelines, whether we could create rebuttable presumptions.\n  We talked about encouraging States to develop enterprise liability. \nWe even supported creating no-fault liability so that States would \ncreate the funds and all that individuals would have to be able to do \nis show that need, not even negligence, to be able to recover. We were \nprepared to consider all of those measures.\n  Those of us who are opposed--at least this Senator is opposed--to the \nMcConnell amendment understand that we have to provide some changes and \nsome alterations. We were prepared to do so and are prepared to do so. \nWe made some changes even in this proposal that was initially put \nforward before our committee during the course of the deliberations. \nBut we, at this time, do not have that measure before us.\n  I see other Members who want to speak, and I will come back to \naddress this issue at a later time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor. I wonder if I could \njust for a moment have a discussion with my colleague from Connecticut. \nI know he was here for a while, but I stayed on the floor. I do not \nwant to push in front of him. Would my colleague mind if I went forward \nwith my remarks right now?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my friend \nfrom Minnesota. It may sound a little strange, but if he is prepared to \nspeak at length, I would be happy to allow him to go forward.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I am prepared to speak at \nlength.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I had guessed that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would that be all right?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. I appreciate the Senator's kindness.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was at a gathering yesterday with \ncitizens from all over the country. Their personal stories are often \nnot a part of this debate, but they should be. Many of them have been \ninjured, many of them have been hurt, some of them have lost loved \nones. God forbid that any of this should happen to any of us or our \nfamilies or our loved ones.\n  Mr. President, the question that they were asking was: What is the \npurpose of the underlying bill, this ``Product Liability Fairness \nAct?'' I see nothing fair in it, and I will talk about that, or this \namendment, the McConnell amendment, or the second-degree amendment to \nthe McConnell amendment.\n  What is this rush to somehow protect whom from claimants? Why the \neffort to tip the scales of justice against people who have been hurt, \nall too often in behalf of people who have been negligent, all too \noften on behalf of large corporations, insurance companies, you name \nit?\n  Mr. President, I will get to the specifics of this medical \nmalpractice amendment, and I will talk about the underlying bill as \nwell, but I would like to start out on a more personal note as a \nSenator of Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, let me first of all make it clear that in some \neditorials it has been suggested that this debate is really a debate \nbetween the trial lawyers of the United States of America and the rest \nof the country. That is just simply not true. There are many citizens, \nthe consumers of this Nation, \n[[Page S5761]] that I think also need to be and have been present in \nthis debate.\n  So with a little bit of hesitation, I will use some pictures--but \nthis comes with the permission of Minnesotans, of the families \naffected--because I think the faces of people that are affected by \nthis, I think the people themselves, their voice ought to reach into \nthis Chamber now.\n  Kristy Marie Brecount was a happy--``was,'' past tense--active 7-\nyear-old girl from Edina when she went to the hospital to get her \ntonsils removed, as many children her age do.\n  I do not know where the hospital was and in no way am I suggesting \nthat this was in Edina. That is not the point.\n  It was an elective procedure. The hospital personnel improperly \nhooked up the machine that was to provide the anesthesia for the \noperation. They attached the hoses backward. As a result, she received \n10 times the amount of anesthesia she was supposed to get, leading to a \nfatal cardiac arrest.\n  This is a picture of Kristy.\n  Here are the questions I would ask about this amendment, as I \nunderstand it. And I have not even had a chance to look at all of it, \nbecause it just came up on the floor.\n  If it was clear that the hospital personnel had acted intentionally \nor ``with conscious, flagrant disregard'' for Kristy's safety, do you \nthink, I ask my colleagues, that $250,000 is enough to punish and deter \nthe hospital personnel from doing it again?\n  Is $250,000 too much? And if my colleagues say it all depends on the \nhistory or the size of the hospital, then I would say that is precisely \nthe point. It is a case-by-case situation. So why at the Federal level \npreempt this? Why take away from aggrieved citizens their right to seek \nredress for grievances within our court system?\n  Is $250,000 too much? And if you do not know the statistics, this \ndoes happen to citizens--80,000 deaths a year from negligence, 300,000 \ncitizens hurt or injured a year. And we put caps on punitive damages?\n  Gina Barbaro. Gina had just turned 6 when she got sick with flu-like \nsymptoms. Her mother took her to a chiropractor. Her symptoms at the \ntime were headaches, fever, vomiting, shakes, delirium, rash on her \nfoot, ear, knees, and down her legs. The chiropractor prescribed herbs \nand oils and sent Gina home.\n  By the way, we are not talking about the vast majority of doctors, \nchiropractors, you name it. We are talking about a few, sometimes, if \nyou will, rotten apples in the basket.\n  The chiropractor prescribed herbs and oils and sent Gina home. The \nnext day she was back with worsened conditions and severe redness to \nher right eye. The chiropractor, believing the problem stemmed from \nGina's pancreas, sent her home again. Her temperature reached 105, and \nthe color of the iris of her right eye changed.\n  Upon the third trip to the chiropractor, the chiropractor finally \nsuggested that Gina go to the hospital for evaluation. The hospital \nstaff determined Gina had a virulent strep infection that resulted in \nher losing the sight in her right eye. She also had numerous other \ncomplications. The eye had to be removed. A year and a half later, Gina \ncontinues to have continuing care, including cardiology, ophthalmology, \ninfectious disease, and pediatrics.\n  I just showed you a picture of Gina, and now I ask the following \nquestions: Assuming that the jury finds that the chiropractor's \nnegligence in failing to send Gina to a hospital sooner was 70 percent \nresponsible for her damages, and the negligence of the practice for \nwhich the chiropractor worked was 30 percent responsible because they \nhired the chiropractor in the first place. The jury awards Gina \n$100,000 in noneconomic damages for her pain and suffering and \ndisability and fear.\n  If the chiropractor is unable to pay the full amount of his fair \nshare, who should be stuck with the loss, Gina or the practice? And by \nthe way, Mr. President, to go to one of the points that my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, made, in the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, one of the more important things we did to the \nmedical malpractice amendment yesterday is that we had an opt-out \nprovision.\n  In my State of Minnesota, we have struggled with this question of \njoint liability. I am not a lawyer, but I can see it is a really \ndifficult question. The question: If you are not really responsible for \nthe whole extent of the damage, and maybe only a small percentage \nbecause another party says they are insolvent, bankrupt or whatever, \nshould you have to assume the whole cost? So we tried to work out \ndifferent kinds of formulas at the State level.\n  This amendment preempts States from doing that. I am, in part, here \nto fight for my State. And by the way, Mr. President, it makes no sense \nwhatsoever to me that if you are going to have a Federal preemption--\nand you should not--there are two issues: Why do we have a Federal \npreemption which, as I understand this amendment, goes in only one \ndirection: States are preempted if they want to have stronger consumer \nprotection than the norm we set here, but not preempted from having \nless consumer protection. Talk about a stacked deck. In any case, why \nwould we not, as we did yesterday in committee, at least allow States \nto opt out of this?\n  This amendment professes to reform medical malpractice, but it is \nless about cutting back on the incidence of medical malpractice --how \ndo we prevent this in the first place--than it is about making it \nharder for people to avoid becoming the victims of medical malpractice, \nmaking it more difficult for those victims to receive compensation for \ntheir injuries and making it easier for those who commit medical \nmalpractice to get away with it.\n  This amendment is an attack on consumers. First and foremost--and I \nuse the word ``attack'' carefully--it is an attack on the elderly and \non families with children and on working Americans. Why else would this \nbill devalue compensation for low- and middle-income victims? That is \nright, this amendment says that when a person is hurt, it is their \neconomic damages, usually including lost wages, that they have the best \nchance of getting back. But for noneconomic damages, it will be harder \nto get compensated. In other words, if your damages tend to be more in \npain and suffering and less in lost wages, since you make less money, \nyou are more likely to walk away with a smaller percentage of your \ncompensation, and that is wrong if you have lost a child, or if you are \ninfertile because of malpractice of a doctor, maybe an obstetrician. If \nyou have been maimed, then I do not know why your loss is any less \nimportant than someone else's loss. Since when did we start making a \ncalculation about justice based upon the income and wealth of families?\n  Mr. President, with regard to the second-degree amendment, lessening \nstandards so that an obstetrician does not have to live up to the same \nstandards by way of consumer protection, thus making it more possible \nto be able to deliver that kind of care in rural areas, makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  I am from the State of Minnesota and greater Minnesota, rural \nMinnesota is an important part of our State. Minnesotans want to make \nsure that we have more doctors, nurses, advanced nurse practitioners in \nour communities delivering health care. But I do not believe the \ncitizens in my State believe that the way to get that done is by moving \naway from consumer protection by lessening standards. People want \naffordable care, they want dignified care, they want humane care, and \nthey want high-quality care.\n  Mr. President, yesterday in committee I offered an amendment, and I \ncertainly will offer this amendment on the floor of the Senate. I did \nnot believe we were actually going to have a medical malpractice \namendment on the floor. I offered an amendment in markup that would \nhave opened up the National Practitioner Data Bank--and for those who \nare now listening to this debate, I need to spell out what that is--\ngranting consumers access to the same kind of information about their \ndoctors that hospitals and HMO's currently receive.\n  In other words, if we are really interested in the problem of medical \nmalpractice and we want to prevent it, that is really what people want \nto see happen, that is what doctors and chiropractors and nurses and \nnurse practitioners want to see happen, then one would think that \nconsumers could have the same information, access to the same kind of \ninformation about their doctors that hospitals and HMO's currently \nreceive.\n Eighty thousand people \n[[Page S5762]] die every year due to medical negligence, and consumers \nshould have the right to know whether or not there has been a finding \nagainst the doctor because of malpractice or if a doctor has \nessentially been barred from practicing at a hospital or, for that \nmatter, within a State. By the way, sometimes--and I could give \nexamples--doctors move to other States, change their names, and then \nharm other citizens in the country, and those citizens have no way of \nfinding out, unless they want to go all around the States in 50 \ndifferent court systems. But that amendment was defeated yesterday. \nOnce again, consumers lose and a variety of different powerful trade \nassociations and their Washington lobbyists win. I will most \ndefinitely, Mr. President, offer that amendment on the floor.\n  Mr. President, the plaintiffs ask the question: Why the legislation? \nWhy the legislation that essentially tips the scales of justice against \nus? Victims of malpractice do not know they are victims until they are \ninjured. Perpetrators of malpractice know who they are. They have been \nsued before, and if they do it again, they can expect to be sued again. \nSo they can walk the Halls of Congress in droves, but the victims--the \npeople who will be affected by this amendment--do not even know who \nthey are yet. We can only talk about them in the abstract, though I \nhave tried to give specific examples.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that many of my colleagues feel they have \nto vote for something they can call tort reform, so they can go home \nand tell their constituents that they have struck a blow against the \nlawyers. But I urge them to see past this temptation to the real truth. \nThey are striking a blow, if they support this second-degree or its \nunderlying amendment, against their own constituents, against regular \npeople who, God forbid, one day will be the victim of a bad doctor, bad \ndrug, or defective product. If we pass these amendments, we will be \nhurting people, and that is not something that any of us were elected \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I have to say, on the health care front--and I have a \nfew comments on this overall product liability bill as well--that it is \namazing to me that we go through a health care debate for the better \npart of the last Congress and we have the General Accounting Office and \nthe Congressional Budget Office and they talk about the trillion-dollar \nindustry and how we can contain costs. As I remember the numbers, the \ncost of purchasing medical malpractice insurance, combined with \ndefensive medicine--in other words, doctors say it is not just the cost \nof purchasing insurance--the total amounts to about 2 percent of the \noverall costs in the health care industry. Again, I, too, quote from a \nBusiness Week piece:\n\n       On an average, only one malpractice claim was filed for \n     every 7.5 patients who suffered a negligent injury, and only \n     half of these were ultimately paid. So, ``the legal system is \n     paying just one malpractice claim for every 15 torts \n     inflicted in hospitals.'' Those suffering nonnegligent \n     injuries--that is, caused by care not yet deemed \n     inappropriate--got nothing. Thus, the study concludes that \n     rather than a surplus, there is a litigation deficit because \n     so many injured people wind up uncompensated. So many injured \n     people wind up uncompensated--overall, a very small \n     percentage.\n\n  But let me shout this from the mountaintop that is the floor of the \nU.S. Senate: When the insurance industry moves into this debate and \nthey want to get their way, they do quite well, apparently, given this \nkind of amendment. Last session we learned that the way you can most \neffectively contain health care costs would be to put some limit on \nwhat insurance companies charge. But nobody talks about that. That \nproposal is off of the table.\n  That is not what we want to do. We do not want to focus on containing \nhealth care costs in some kind of fair, rational way. We do not want to \nfocus on how to cover children and women expecting children. We do not \nwant to focus on how we can move forward on home-based long-term care \nso that elderly people, people with disabilities, can live at home in \nas near to normal circumstances as possible and with dignity. We do not \nwant to talk about situations where young people, because they have \ndiabetes or because they have had a bout with cancer, find they are no \nlonger covered by an insurance company, or their rates are so high they \ncannot afford to purchase that insurance.\n  None of that is being done. We do not want to talk about the 40 \nmillion Americans that are uninsured. We do not want to talk about all \nof the American citizens in this country who are underinsured. We do \nnot want to apply the standards we live by, where we have good coverage \nand make sure the citizens we represent get the same coverage.\n  No. Instead, we have an amendment here that is stacked in favor of \nlarge companies and against consumers, against regular people, against \npeople who are injured, against people whose loved ones, in fact, in \nsome cases have died as a result of medical malpractice; there is no \nway people can have information and knowledge about those doctors who \nhave been found guilty of this kind of practice. No, we do not do that, \nnor do we take any effort to prevent it.\n  We do not do anything to protect the consumers. We move away from \nthose standards and we have these caps on punitive damages; we say that \nwhen a child passes away, that is what she is worth. Not to mention the \nfact--and I hate to say this on the floor of the Senate because I \nadmire the vast majority of the medical profession and, for that \nmatter, the health care industry in this country--but, by golly, one of \nthe ways you stop some of this practice by those who really have done \nirreparable harm to citizens, whether they be a doctor or a hospital or \ncorporation, you name it, is you make sure that they know if there is a \nrepeat of this, or they do it again, they will pay dearly.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I took part in an event that I only wish \ncould have been witnessed by every one of my colleagues in the Senate. \nHad they seen it, I cannot believe that we would be here today on the \nfloor of the Senate considering this underlying product liability bill, \nmuch less these amendments.\n  The event was a meeting of people who had been harmed by defective \nproducts and negligent doctors. All of these people have been \nclaimants--the very people that this legislation is designed to protect \nagainst, the very people that these amendments are designed to protect \nagainst. They have all been through the legal process, and without its \nprotections, they would not have gotten what compensation they did \nreceive.\n  Do not let me hear people frame this debate as if it is a debate \nbetween everybody in the United States of America versus the trial \nlawyers. Not true. Having been through the process and seen how \ndifficult it is to even get compensation today for their injuries and \npunish those who hurt them, these people yesterday--and they are here \ntoday as well--have an angry question for supporters of this so-called \nProduct Liability Fairness Act: Why are we doing this? Why are we \ntrying to make it harder for citizens who have been injured by products \nor malpractice, or citizens who have sometimes even been killed because \nof this, to seek redress of grievances in our court system?\n  These citizens I met with yesterday are not the ones with the money \nand sophistication. Rather, they are the ones that are taken advantage \nof. They are the ones that are hurt, the ones that wrongdoers try to \nforce into unacceptable settlements. They were here yesterday bearing \nwitness to the damage that could be wrought by manufacturers of \ndefective products and negligent doctors.\n  They represent the downside of supporting this amendment. They are a \nreminder of why we have a civil justice system that has been called the \ngreat equalizer.\n  Why through this amendment and why through this underlying bill are \nwe trying to move away from a court system that has been a great \nequalizer? It is especially so for citizens who have been hurt, for \ncitizens who sometimes have died as a result of defective products or \nmedical negligence.\n  Mr. President, in this underlying bill there are three basic \nprovisions that have people up in arms. I agree with them 100 percent. \nLimiting punitive damages--which is part of this amendment as well--\nwould have allowed corporations that hurt them to avoid punishment. It \nwould have allowed industry to work them into what is called the death \ncalculus. For those who were listening, that is the calculation by \nwhich a company can decide whether it \n[[Page S5763]] is economically worth it to keep marketing a product \nthat harms consumers. It is where a company can ensure that the bottom \nline is the only line.\n  The cap on punitive damages in this bill also works to discriminate \nagainst lower- and middle-income plaintiffs. People--as I said before--\nlike the elderly, children, and the vast majority of working Americans.\n  Under this bill, a manufacturers' egregious behavior will receive a \nlesser punishment if that behavior is against a person who makes less \nmoney and therefore has lower economic damages. Same with this \namendment on medical malpractice. That is for exactly the same \nbehavior, exactly the same harm and exactly the same defendant. This is \nan absurd result and it is an indefensible one.\n  Mr. President, let me take an example. Jack, a data entry clerk, is \nseverely injured by the explosion of a defective diesel generator made \nby the Acme Generator Co., leaving him in a wheelchair for the rest of \nhis life. His hospital bill is $40,000, but he misses out on 1 year of \nwork, which amounts to $30,000 in lost wages. So his total economic \ndamages are $70,000. The jury determines that Acme's behavior was \negregious enough to merit $500,000 in punitive damages. But this bill \noperates to cap these damages at $250,000.\n  On the other hand, Bob, who sells commercial real estate, receives \nthe identical injury when he uses one of Acme's generators. His \nhospital bill also amounts to $40,000 and he, too, is confined to a \nwheelchair for the rest of his life. When he misses a year of work it \ncosts him $200,000. When the jury tries to punish Acme with $500,000 in \npunitive damages in his case, the punishment sticks.\n  This raises a good question: Why is it less punishable to hurt Jack? \nThere is another good question. Was $250,000 enough to properly punish \nAcme?\n  I say to my colleagues again, it also applied to the amendment on \nmedical malpractice where there is a cap set and it applies again. If a \nperson does not know, if a person has followed these two examples and \nthe answer is they do not know because a person needs more details, \nthen that person has no business voting to support this one-size-fits-\nall underlying legislation or this one-size-fits-all amendment.\n  If the State of Minnesota and the State of Illinois have their own \nmodels and have attempted to deal with some of these tough problems so \nthat we avoid some of the excessive litigation, so that we can figure \nout, I think, a really tough issue with joint liability, then we should \nlet them do so.\n  We certainly should not have an amendment or a bill that represents a \nFederal preemption against State standards only if those standards \nprotect consumers or are stronger on consumer protection. Lower \nconsumer protection is fine. This is the inevitability of a stacked \ndeck.\n  Mr. President, let me put a face on these questions. I want to make \nit clear I have thought long and hard about this. I feel so strongly \nthat this debate has not dealt with people that I have sought \npermission for this, and I would not do it otherwise. Let me put a face \non this.\n  Think of LeeAnn Gryc, from my State of Minnesota, who was 4 years old \nwhen the pajamas she was wearing ignited, leaving her with second- and \nthird-degree burns over 20 percent of her body.\n  An official with the company that made the pajamas had written a memo \n14 years earlier stating that because the material they used was so \nflammable, the company was ``sitting on a powder keg.'' When LeeAnn \nsued for damages, the jury determined that her economic damages were \n$8,500, and also awarded $1 million in punitive damages.\n  This is a picture of LeeAnn, what happened to her. Let me ask, was \nthe jury wrong? Should the company have gotten away with only $250,000 \nin punitive damages, as this bill would have required? Unless a person \nis comfortable answering the question yes, a person should not be \nsupporting this underlying bill.\n  Was this too great an award for this family? Unless a person is in \nfavor of a cap and a person thinks more than $250,000 would be too much \nfor this child and her family, a person should not support this bill.\n  This legislation will have a very, very, real negative impact on \nconsumers. It is unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, when I saw the damage done by defective products to so \nmany people as I did yesterday, I could not help but feel some of the \npain they must have felt and still must be experiencing.\n  What is it like to be blinded, confined to a wheelchair, unable to \nparent a child, lose a child, live with brain damage? These are real \nand palatable harms that many plaintiffs in product liability and \nmedical malpractice actions have to deal with. We should not pass \namendments or legislation that provide them with less protection or \nrestrict their ability to seek legitimate and fair redress for \ngrievances in compensation for what has happened to them and to prevent \nit from happening again to others.\n  Historically, the primary goal of tort law was to compensate the \nvictim, to make the victim whole. This reflects the view that it is \nbetter to have a wrongdoer who was partly responsible for the harm pay \nmore than their fair share, if that is what is necessary to make sure \nthat the victim is fully compensated.\n  It is not an easy choice, Mr. President, to require somebody to pay \nmore than their fair share. This is an issue that I really struggle \nwith. But it is a choice that this legislation seems to be willing to \nlet stand.\n  If the harm is of a particular type, a type that can be shown in \nmedical bills, lost wages, and other things that a person can get \nreceipts for, that is one thing. But for noneconomic damages, like \njuries award for disfigurement, pain and suffering, and inability to \nbear children, the bill says that it is not important to make victims \nwhole if that is the kind of damage they sustain. Two different \nstandards between economic and noneconomic damages.\n  I would be very interested in why some of my colleagues think that \npeople who suffer that kind of harm should be relegated to second-class \nstatus.\n  Mr. President, again, there are faces, there are real people who will \nbe hurt by this legislation.\n  Think of Nancy Winkleman from Minnesota who was in a car crash. I met \nher a few weeks ago. Because a defective car underride bar failed to \noperate properly, the hood of her car went under the back of a truck \nand the passenger compartment came into direct contact with the rear \nend of the larger vehicle. Without the benefit of her car's own bumper \nto protect her, she was severely injured, losing part of her tongue and \nvirtually all of her lower jaw.\n  Despite extensive reconstruction surgery, her face and her ability to \nspeak will never be the same.\n  Real people, real faces. I cannot imagine the pain that Nancy must \nhave undergone, or the pain that she undergoes every day. If one of the \nresponsible parties in her case was unable to pay its fair share, \nshould she go uncompensated for some of that pain? Or should the other \nresponsible parties have to make it up? Unless you are certain that it \nis more important to protect those other responsible parties than to \ncompensate Nancy for her pain, you should not support this bill. If you \ndo, you will be hurting people, real people.\n  Finally, there is the statute of repose prohibiting suits to recover \ndamages for harm caused by defective products that are over 20 years \nold. This is one of the most arbitrary and indefensible provisions of \nthe bill. What possible justification is there for this? After all, if \na product is defective and does not hurt anybody until it is over 20 \nyears old, is the harm of the victim any less? Is the responsibility of \nthe manufacturer any less?\n  Here is a face you can attach to these questions as you consider \nthem. Think of Jimmy Hoscheit--with his permission--who was at work on \nhis family farm when he was a boy. Jimmy, too is a Minnesotan. I met \nhim a few weeks ago. He was using common farm machinery, consisting of \na tractor, a mill, and a blower, all linked together with a power \ntransfer system much like the drive train on a truck. The power of the \ntractor is transferred to the other equipment by way of a spinning \nshaft, a shaft covered by a freely spinning metal sleeve. The sleeve is \non bearings so that if you were to grab the sleeve it \n[[Page S5764]] would stop moving while the shaft and side would \ncontinue to powerfully rotate at a very high speed.\n  Apparently when Jimmy leaned over the shaft to pick up a shovel, his \njacket touched the sleeve and got caught on it. However, instead of \nspinning free of the internal shaft, the sleeve was somehow bound to \nthe shaft, became wrapped in Jimmy's jacket and tore Jimmy's arms off. \nHis father found him flat on his back on the other side of the shaft.\n  The manufacturer could have avoided all of this if it had just \nprovided a simple and inexpensive chain to anchor the shaft to the \ntractor.\n  Now I ask you: Should Jimmy be able to bring a suit against the \nmanufacturer? What if the product was over 20 years old?\n  A similar question can be asked about 6-year-old Katie Fritz, another \nMinnesotan whose family I was actually privileged to meet yesterday. \nKatie was killed in 1989 when a defective garage door opener failed to \nreverse direction, pinning her under the door and crushing the breath \nout of her.\n  I met the Fritz family yesterday, her mother Patty and her sons. It \nis a really courageous family. And it is really hard for them to talk \nabout it. Patty Fritz had tears in her eyes--who would not? I am a \nfather and a grandfather. Mr. President, you are a father. But you know \nPatty and her family have the courage to take what has happened to them \nand be able to speak out in behalf of others.\n  We all know how long some of these machines can last. If that garage \ndoor opener was over 20 years old, Katie's family could not have sued \nthe manufacturer. There would not be any question of capping punitive \ndamages or having joint liability for noneconomic damages they simply \nwould not be allowed in the courthouse door.\n  That is what this legislation does. Explain to me the justice in \nthat? What is the overriding public policy interest that is so \nimportant that this bill should shut Katie's family out of court, or \nother families like Katie's family, out of court? If you are not clear \nabout this, if you are not sure that there is such a public policy \ninterest here, you should not support this legislation.\n  This legislation and these amendments right now before us will hurt \npeople, real people. To me, as I look at this legislation and I look at \nthis amendment before us, this is not a close call. At a time when many \nin Congress are bent on cutting back on regulations that protect the \nhealth and safety of our citizens and on reducing public support for \npeople if they get hurt and need help, the courts are the last resort. \nWe cut back on the regulation, we cut back on the protection, we cut \nback on the ability of public agencies to protect people, and now we \nshut off the courts, the last resort. That is where regular people can \ntry to deal with wealthy, sophisticated defendants on a relatively \nlevel playing field. And now what we are trying to do is change that \nand make it an unequal playing field. And even now it is extremely hard \nto get a reasonable settlement or award. Why are we considering \nlegislation to make it even harder?\n  So I started out talking about the second-degree amendment. Then I \ntalked about the McConnell amendment. Now I have talked about the \nunderlying bill. I urge my colleagues from the bottom of my soul to \nplease oppose not only these amendments, which I did not think would be \non the floor, but this bill. Do not close your eyes. See the faces of \nthe people the bill would hurt. See the faces of the people the bill \nwould hurt. See their faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, once this second-degree amendment of my \ncolleague from Wyoming is disposed of, it is my intention to offer an \namendment to the underlying amendment offered by my colleague from \nKentucky that will strike from that amendment the cap on punitive \ndamages that amendment places on a specific area and that specific area \nis sexual assaults of patients by doctors.\n  Understandably this is a rarity, but the facts are that many times \nwhen punitive damages are awarded by juries against doctors, against \nmedical providers, the juries do it in cases where there have been \nsexual assaults--a case where the patient has been put under \nanesthesia, the doctor then proceeds to sexually assault the patient. \nIt is certainly a rarity. But, Mr. President, I cannot find any moral \njustification for this U.S. Congress saying to the 50 States, saying to \nthe people across this country, in that particular case we deem it wise \nto impose our will on the States and to say, in the case of that sexual \nassault, there is going to be a cap, there is going to be a limit on \nwhat that jury can return in punitive damages against that particular \nindividual.\n  I hope and would anticipate that this amendment will not be a \ncontroversial amendment, it will be something we can all agree on. But \nI wanted to notify my colleagues and Members in the Chamber that in a \nshort period of time I do in fact intend to offer that particular \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the \npending amendment offered on health care liability reform. I heard \nabout it this morning at about 11:15. Today, like so many days in the \nSenate, is a very complicated day. Shortly we will be conducting \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee on terrorism, which I am due to \nchair. There is a ceremony starting in a few minutes on the steps of \nthe Capitol to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. But I wanted \nto come over for just a few minutes to comment about this pending \namendment on health care liability reform.\n  My review so far has been cursory because of the limited time \navailable, but it is my understanding that this amendment, which is a \nfairly thick document, is the bill which was reported out of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee earlier this week. It is my thought that \nthis legislative proposal now offered in the form of an amendment \nreally warrants some very, very considerable study. It is being added \nonto the bill on product liability, which is already complex. The \nhealth care liability reform amendment is really a piece of legislation \nwhich I think requires a committee report, requires time to study and \nto reflect, and some judgment.\n  When we are dealing with the whole area of tort reform, we are \nbuilding on a field which has had encrustations of judicial decisions \nover decades, or really centuries. As I said earlier this week in a \nbrief statement on product liability, some reform, I think, is \nnecessary. And in the practice of law, my profession, I have \nrepresented both plaintiffs and defendants in personal injury cases. \nBut the reform process needs extraordinary care because the common law \nhas developed one case at a time with very careful analysis, contrasted \nwith the legislative process where frequently in hearings only one or \ntwo Senators may be present, and the markups, as carefully as we can do \nthem, do not really produce the kind of legal and factual analysis \nwhich the courts have developed in the common law. But I do think there \nis room for improvement.\n  Last night, I spoke in favor of Senator Brown's amendment to tighten \nup rule 11 to deter frivolous lawsuits. So there are places where we \ncan improve the system with a very, very careful analysis. But I do not \nthink it is realistic to take up this entire legislative package on \nhealth care liability reform with the kind of analysis which is \nrequired to protect the interest of all the parties, both plaintiffs \nand defendants.\n  As is the custom of the Senate under the rules of the Senate on the \npending legislation of product liability, we have a different committee \nreport which analyzes the hearings, sets forth the facts and \nconclusions that Senators may use as a basis for their consideration of \nthe legislation, which we do not have on this amendment.\n  It would be my expectation that the managers would move to table. I \nhave not consulted with them. But the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller, has commented about his interest at least in \nkeeping the current legislation limited to product liability, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington has commented about making sure \nthat any amendment has \n[[Page S5765]] at least 60 votes so that we do not have legislation \nthat will not stand the 60-vote rule on cloture.\n  I note that the majority leader has come to the floor. I shall be \nvery brief.\n  I would like to put in the Record two studies of the malpractice \nfield which I think would be of interest to my colleagues to review, \nand I will read just a couple of paragraphs which articulate the \nconclusions of these studies.\n  First, I refer to an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine of \n1992 entitled ``The Influence of Standard of Care and Severity of \nInjury on the Resolution of Medical Malpractice Claims'' by a \ndistinguished group of doctors.\n\n       Objective: To explore how frequently physicians lose \n     medical malpractice cases despite providing standard care and \n     to assess whether severity of patient injury influences the \n     frequency of plaintiff payment.\n\n  This is a study of a ``total of 12,829 physicians involved in 8,231 \nclosed malpractice cases.''\n  Under the conclusions section, the study essentially reports that, \n``Our findings suggest that unjustified payments are probably \nuncommon.''\n  There is a fair amount to the analysis and a fair amount more to the \nconclusions. But I leave that for the readers in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  I would next cite an article in the New England Journal of Medicine \nfrom July 25, 1991, captioned ``Relation Between Malpractice Claims and \nAdverse Events Due to Negligence'':\n\n       Abstract--Background and Methods. By matching the medical \n     records of a random sample of 31,429 patients hospitalized in \n     New York State in 1984 with statewide data on medical-\n     malpractice claims, we identified patients who had filed \n     claims against physicians and hospitals.\n\n  And the conclusion:\n\n       Medical-malpractice litigation infrequently compensates \n     patients injured by medical negligence and rarely identifies, \n     and holds providers accountable for, substandard care.\n\n  I would also like to put into the Congressional Record, Mr. \nPresident, an article from the New York Times of Sunday, March 5, which \nis particularly applicable to the second-degree amendment which has \nbeen filed here relating to obstetrics. This article reported on a \nstudy of New York hospitals with the captioned headline: ``New York's \nPublic Hospitals Fail, and Babies Are the Victims.'' It is a fairly \nlengthy article. But a couple of paragraphs are worth quoting.\n\n       Each year, for the last decade, dozens of newborn babies \n     have died or have been left to struggle with brain damage or \n     other lifelong injuries because of mistakes made by \n     inexperienced doctors, poorly supervised midwives and nurses \n     in the teeming delivery rooms of New York City's public \n     hospitals.\n       Some of the most prestigious medical schools and private \n     hospitals are paid by the city to provide care in its \n     sprawling hospital system. But an examination by the New York \n     Times shows that many of these private institutions have left \n     life-and-death decisions to overworked nurses and trainee \n     doctors who are ill prepared to make them.\n       The effects can be seen across the system, from the \n     surgical suites to the clinics. But nowhere are the \n     consequences more devastating than in the delivery rooms \n     where the course of a young life will be changed forever by a \n     few minutes delay in the malfunctioning monitor or a lapse of \n     attention.\n       Some hospital and city officials have known about the \n     problem for years, and have worked mightily to keep them from \n     the public. They fear a loss of public confidence and a flood \n     of lawsuits.\n\n  Quoting further from the report:\n\n       These cases are catastrophic and costly. Many of these \n     infants are now grown children suffering from multiple and \n     severe disabilities who require lifetime hospitalization or \n     intensive home care.\n\n  I would also cite a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nindependent arm of Congress, and their conclusions in 1992:\n\n       Restructuring malpractice liability would not generate \n     large savings in U.S. health care costs. Malpractice premiums \n     amount to less than 1 percent of national health care \n     expenditures. Thus, the premiums directly contribute little \n     to the Nation's overall health care costs.\n\n  These are just a few comments, Mr. President, which I say I am \nabbreviating because the distinguished majority leader is on the floor. \nI have other commitments, having come over just when I heard the \nintroduction of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point that the articles that I \nreferred to from the New England Journal of Medicine, the Annals of \nInternal Medicine, and the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n   [From Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. 117, No. 9, Nov. 1, 1992]\n\n    The Influence of Standard of Care and Severity of Injury on the \n                Resolution of Medical Malpractice Claims\n\n (By Mark I. Taragin, MD, MPH; Laura R. Willett, MD; Adam P. Wilczek, \n           BA; Richard Trout, PhD; and Jeffrey L. Carson, MD)\n\n       Objective; To explore how frequently physicians lose \n     medical malpractice cases despite providing standard care and \n     to assess whether severity of patient injury influences the \n     frequency of plaintiff payment.\n       Design: Retrospective cohort study.\n       Setting: Physicians from the state of New Jersey insured by \n     one insurance company from 1977 to 1992.\n       Participants: A total of 12,829 physicians involved in 8231 \n     closed malpractice cases.\n       Measurement; Physician care and claim severity were \n     prospectively determined by the insurance company using a \n     standard process.\n       Result: Physicians care was considered defensible in 62% of \n     the cases and indefensible in 25% of the cases, in almost \n     half of which the physician admitted error. In the remaining \n     13% of cases, it was unclear whether physician care was \n     defensible. the plaintiff received a payment in 43% of all \n     cases. Payment was made 21% of the time if physician care was \n     considered defensible, 91% if considered indefensible, and \n     59% if considered unclear. The severity of the injury was \n     classified as low, medium, or high in 28%, 47%, and 25% of \n     the cases, respectively. Severity of injury had a small but \n     significant association (P < 0.001) with the frequency of \n     plaintiff payment (low severity, 39%; medium severity, 42%; \n     and high severity, 47%). The severity of injury was not \n     associated with the payment rate in cases resolved by a jury \n     (low severity, 23% medium severity, 25%; and high severity, \n     23%).\n       Conclusions: In malpractice cases, physicians provide care \n     that in usually defensible. The defensibility of the case and \n     not the severity of patient injury predominantly influences \n     whether any payment is made. Even in cases that require a \n     jury verdict, the severity of patient injury has little \n     effect on whether any payment is made. Our findings suggest \n     that unjustified payments are probably uncommon.\n       The fear of medical malpractice has resulted in significant \n     physician dissatisfaction and has contributed to the decrease \n     in the number of persons entering the field of medicine (1, \n     2). Further, physicians have stimulated legislation for tort \n     reform, increased the practice of defensive medicine, and \n     avoided ``risky'' patients (3-7).\n       Physicians' apprehensions about malpractice stem from \n     several perceptions (7). Perhaps foremost is the concern that \n     the malpractice resolution process is unfair (8). Because \n     standards are unclear and possibly inconsistent, physicians \n     are afraid of being sued and of losing the case despite their \n     having provided standard medical care (9). Further, juries \n     are seen as unjustifiably rewarding patients solely on \n     account of the severity of their injuries.\n       We explored the influence of physician care and the \n     severity of patient injury on the malpractice process. \n     Contrary to many perceptions, our study suggests that \n     physicians usually win cases in which physician care was \n     deemed to meet community standards and that the severity of \n     patient injury has little bearing on whether a physician \n     loses a case.\n\n\n                                methods\n\n                              Data source\n\n       We obtained our data from The New Jersey medical Inter-\n     Insurance Exchange, a physician-owned insurance company. This \n     company insures approximately 60% of the physicians in New \n     Jersey. Since 1977, demographic information on physicians and \n     detailed descriptive information on every malpractice claim \n     have been entered into a standardized computer data-base.\n\n                      Study design and population\n\n       We did a retrospective cohort study that included \n     physicians insured for any time between 1977 and 1992. During \n     this period, 12,829 physicians were insured and 11,934 cases \n     were filed, of which 80% are currently closed. Because the \n     time from an incident until its resolution can vary greatly, \n     we chose 1 January 1986 as a cutoff point for the incident \n     data because 96% of cases that occurred before this date were \n     closed by 1992. After excluding 14 cases that lacked peer \n     review results, we evaluated 8,231 closed cases.\n\n                            Study variables\n       The insurance company's assessment of whether a physician's \n     actions represent standard medical care is based on medical \n     criteria and is not supposed to be influenced by legal \n     concerns. First, the physician is contacted, and if he or she \n     admits error, the case is labeled ``indefensible--insured \n     admits deviation,'' and no further review is done. Otherwise, \n     the case is reviewed by a claims representative employed by \n     the insurance company. If the physician's performance is \n     thought to be clearly medically defensible, the case is \n     labeled ``no peer review, clearly defensible.'' Otherwise, a \n     peer review process ensues in which a physician from the same \n     specialty is chosen from volunteer physicians, many of whom \n     have performed this \n     [[Page S5766]] service regularly for several years. This \n     physician-reviewer then participates in a discussion of the \n     case with the claims representative, the defense attorney, \n     and the defending physician or physicians. Based on the \n     standard of medical care currently practiced by physicians of \n     similar training and experience in the community, the \n     physician-reviewer classifies the claim as ``defensible'' if \n     standard care was provided, ``indefensible'' if not, and \n     ``defensibility unclear'' if the reviewer is unsure. A slight \n     variance to this standard procedure occurs for neurosurgery \n     and orthopedics cases because, historically, experts hold \n     divergent opinions about the appropriate approach to some \n     routine problems. Therefore, a panel of physicians is used \n     instead of one physician-reviewer, and the majority vote is \n     considered final. For every case, we summarized this process \n     of the assessment of physician care as defensible, \n     indefensible, or unclear.\n       If a plaintiff receives financial compensation through \n     either a settlement or a jury verdict, the terminology \n     ``payment'' is applied. For the subset of payments resulting \n     from a jury verdict, the term ``award'' is used. We created \n     four categories of payment: less than $10,000; $10,000 to \n     $49,999; $50,000 to $199,999; and $200,000 or more. All \n     dollar amounts are adjusted to represent 1990 dollars.\n       The insurance company classifies the severity of the \n     patient's injury using the industry standard National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners Index (10). This index \n     has nine categories of increasing severity. We collapsed this \n     into three categories: low (no injury, minor injury with no \n     disability, or minor injury with temporary disability); \n     medium (major injury with temporary disability, minor injury \n     with moderate disability, or major injury with moderate \n     disability); and high (grave injury with moderate disability, \n     brain injury with impaired life expectancy, or death).\n       The stage of resolution is the point in the legal process \n     at which the case is resolved. A case is created when the \n     insurance company is notified of a plaintiff's claim of \n     damages. A suit occurs when this complaint is filed with the \n     court. Discovery refers to the process by which lawyers \n     collect information about the case.\n\n                          Statistical analysis\n\n       Statistical significance was assessed by chi-square tests \n     as appropriate (11).\n                                results\n\n       The characteristics of the 8231 closed cases are summarized \n     in Table 1. Physician care was considered defensible in 62% \n     of the cases and indefensible in 25%. In almost half of the \n     latter cases, the physician admitted error. The remaining 13% \n     of cases were unclear as to defensibility. Payment was made \n     in 43% of all cases, with 52% for less than $50,000 and only \n     15% for greater than $200,000. The median payment was $45,551 \n     (range, $24 to $3,965,000). The severity of the injury was \n     classified as low in 28% of cases, medium in 47%, and high in \n     25%.\n\n               TABLE 1.--MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CLAIM FACTORS              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Closed Cases(n\n                                                              = 8231)   \n                         Factor                          ---------------\n                                                               n(%)     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhysician care:                                                         \n    Defensible..........................................       5132 (62)\n        No peer review, clearly defensible..............       2378 (29)\n        Insured found defensible by peer review.........       2754 (33)\n    Indefensible........................................       2000 (25)\n        No peer review held, insured admits deviation...        881 (11)\n        Indefensible (breach of standard)...............       1119 (14)\n    Unclear.............................................       1099 (13)\nPayment:                                                                \n    No..................................................       4730 (57)\n    Yes.................................................       3515 (43)\n        \n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5751-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5784-S5798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nMcConnell amendment to the Product Liability Reform Act that is now \nbeing considered before this body. If there was one thing that was made \nclear last year during the health care debate, it was a need for \nmedical malpractice reform, not just to curb the need for defensive \nmedicine--and some still argue about the extent to which that \ncontributes to our rising costs in medical care--but to get a handle on \nthis incredible amount of litigation our society now seems to take part \nin.\n  In Montana I have talked with several of our rural doctors who, \nthrough no fault of their own, have outrageous malpractice premiums. I \nrecently had a primary care doctor in my office who pays $38,000 a year \nin premiums. To those folks who practice in more urban areas and have \nextended practices, $38,000 might not sound like much. But it is a big \nticket in a rural State. To top that off, he is yet to be sued. But, \nyet, to protect himself, he cannot avoid paying this premium. Of \ncourse, we know who pays for that--the people who use his services. On \ntop of this cost of practice, he has overhead expenses, too. It is no \nwonder the cost of services and fees continues to go up. In fact, I was \nastounded to find out the other day from a group of doctors what an \noffice call would cost if it were not for a lot of extenuating rules, \nregulations, insurance, and, yes, Government regulations in their life, \nand how that increases just the price of an office call.\n  The McConnell amendment is a perfect fit on this product liability \nreform bill. I am glad to see the House has included it and that this \nbody is considering it now. The product in this case is health care \nservices. I am not trying to say that people do not deserve malpractice \nawards. As in any business, people are fallible, judgment is not always \ntrue, and accidents do happen. I think we tend to hold health care \nproviders to a higher standard because much of the time they hold our \nlives in their hands.\n  But malpractice claims are made more often than necessary. Of the \nbillions of dollars spent on medical liability, 50 cents of every \npremium dollar goes to the attorneys and not to the injured patients \nthat this system was meant to help. If our goal is to direct health \ncare dollars into the legal system for the attorney fees and court \ncosts, then we should not enact liability reform. However, if the \npatient is our priority, and if quality of care is important to us, \nthen this provision is essential.\n  One area that I am very interested in is the contingency reform \nprovisions in this amendment. This provision will help to address some \nof the sizable costs in the system by limiting an attorney's \ncontingency fee to 33\\1/3\\ percent for the first $150,000 and 25 \npercent of any amount over $150,000. The real travesty of justice here \nis the amount of the health care liability award that goes to the \nattorneys. The contingency fee was intended to be the poor man's key to \nthe courthouse. According to the evidence from a 1990 Harvard medical \nmalpractice study in New York, the contingency fee is not serving this \nfunction very well.\n  Most folks with small health care injury claims never get access to \nthe civil justice system because the contingency fee stimulates lawyers \nto be primarily interested in the big ticket cases. It is the same \nincentive that drives the lawsuit lottery, encouraging lawyers to take \ncases with a sympathetic plaintiff even if there is no negligent care. \nIn many States, the contingency fee is growing. Though traditionally \nthe norm is one-third of the plaintiff's payment, the standard is \ngrowing to 40 percent and, yes, 50 percent contingency fees are \nbecoming more and more common. This fee covers only the attorney's \nprofessional fee. Litigation expenses are deducted separately from the \nplaintiff's recovery and they, too, can be quite high.\n  I am proud to say that the Montana Legislature has just passed \nlegislation to cap the fee and reform our medical liability system, the \nMontana State Legislature that just adjourned prior to the Easter \nbreak. I take my lead from my constituents. I always have and I always \nwill. But I also keep a pulse on what is going on around the Nation.\n  In a recent public opinion strategist poll linking people to groups \nthat represent America's values, I tell you what, attorneys, kind of \nwith us, are running pretty low. But for the sure reason for that, \nmaybe we should examine the system. Incidentally, doctors were near the \ntop of the poll.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell-Kassebaum amendment. \nAfter all, it was just a couple of years ago that Senator Kassebaum \nworked on a medical plan, and this was included in her plan then so \nthis is not a new idea. It is an idea that has been accepted by the \nAmerican people and it is an idea whose time has come. These two \namendments together will meet the needs of the injured patients who \ndeserve to be fairly compensated and society which needs to reduce \ntransaction costs and eliminate windfall judgments. But above all, it \nwill allow us to continue to promote the highest quality medical care \nfor our people, our consumers in this country, and maintain that high \nquality for years to come. It is very important that this be a part of \nthis package whenever we go to conference and when it becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to review for the Members where we \nare this afternoon on the malpractice insurance proposal offered by \nSenator McConnell, and now added to by Senator Kassebaum.\n  Process is really not always important, but the Senate has a process \nto ensure adequate consideration to measures such as these. We will \nhave a chance to revisit the substance of some of these measures during \nthe course of consideration of the McConnell amendment. But since I \nreferred earlier to the actions of our committee, I wanted to at least \ngive the Senate an idea of what we have been doing, and what the result \nof our deliberations has been.\n  The amendment described by the Senator from Kentucky is not the \nproduct of consideration by the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nThat committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Kassebaum, spent a \nfull day this week and half a day earlier this month debating a bill \nvirtually identical to the amendment Senator McConnell has offered \ntoday. Members heard each other's arguments, compared their experiences \nin their own States, and worked in a collegial and good-faith fashion \nto craft a better bill.\n  Three very important amendments were adopted. First, there was an \namendment offered by Senator Dodd that removed the cap on punitive \ndamages, providing a more structured process by which the jury \ndetermines whether the punitive damages are warranted and the judge \nsets the amount.\n  Now, I just want to mention that punitive damages in malpractice \ncases are extremely rare. However, of those cases that do merit \npunitive damages, 68 percent involve sexual abuse of patients by the \nmedical profession. So in addition to a very high standard that was \nestablished in the McConnell bill, there is also a cap on the punitive \ndamages. They establish a very high standard, but make it virtually \nimpossible to reach that very high standard.\n  In the consideration of this bill by the committee, we talked about \nthe egregious nature of sexual abuse in a medical setting, cases in \nwhich a woman is anesthetized and then abused, for instance. We \nthought, even if you are going to have a cap on punitive damages, those \ncircumstances are so outrageous that we should allow an exemption--if \nwomen are able to reach the burden of proof established in the \n[[Page S5786]] legislation, there should be the ability to go above the \ncap in the McConnell amendment. This was virtually unanimously \nsupported by the members of the committee. This is a matter of great \ninterest to the women of this country; not just those who have been \ninvolved in cases with punitive damages, but as a message to all that \nthis is an issue so reprehensible it is going to receive the attention \nof the Congress of the United States.\n  Now, that is out. That is out in the McConnell amendment.\n  We had a good deal of consideration. We had evidence not only of that \nkind of activity, we also had evidence where we had doctors who are \npracticing medicine and committing negligence when they are under drugs \nand also under alcohol. We wanted to have that as an exemption of \npunitive damages. No, that was rejected and it is rejected in the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  We wanted to also lift from punitive damages those circumstances \nwhere doctors have their license suspended and still go ahead and \nperform operations. That was not considered during the course of the \ndiscussion and debate.\n  But we did accept the particular circumstances where punitive damages \nin malpractice, that there was going to be a recognition that in those \ncases that are so heinous with regard to taking advantage of women, \nthat that was going to be addressed.\n  We had a second provision on the issue of damages and that was \noffered by our friend and colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, that \nwas accepted. That provided that the jury would make the determination \nas to whether there should be the punitive damages and the judge would \nmake the judgment to set the amount and there would be a criteria as to \nhow that amount would be reached. That was accepted by the committee \nafter good debate and discussion about reviewing what had happened in \nthe States.\n  I was interested to hear my friend and colleague from Montana say, \n``Well, Montana has just adopted a good program on the issue of \nmalpractice.''\n  Well, he might as well kiss that goodbye, because we are going to \npreempt that under the McConnell amendment.\n  I am not sure that everyone understands in this body, when I listen \nto my colleague say we adopted a program out in Montana and it is on \nthe books now and, thank God, we are going to have a bill that is going \nto reach the needs of the people of program. Well, I am telling you \nthis program is probably going to preempt it in some form or shape and \nthat will be true about Wyoming and Montana and other States.\n  But, nevertheless, we brought about some changes with the Dodd \namendment on the punitive damages.\n  And then we had the Abraham amendment that permitted the States to \nopt out of any and all reforms in this bill. I would have preferred a \nbroader form of nonpreemption language, but the committee debated the \nmatter at length and, with great thoughtfulness, it was the will of the \ncommittee that the preemption should be addressed through the mechanism \nof the Abraham language. And that was after a lot of discussion and \ndebate and a lot of give and take on it. But, effectively, that \nconsideration and those hours of discussion and debate are by the \nboard, and that is gone.\n  Now 2 days have passed since the markup of the committee. No report \nhas been filed explaining what is either in this bill or reported out \nof our committee's bill. At least you should have a report of what came \nout of the committee and then you could explain how that is different \nin the McConnell amendment. But we have not even waited for that \nreport.\n  And the text of the bill itself, as amended in the committee, is not \neven publicly available in typeset for the members of the committee; \nnot even available. And so we are acting on the basis of the \nexplanation of the comments of the Senator from Kentucky and others \nabout the legislation itself.\n  And now the Senator from Kentucky offers the amendment that basically \nignores the work of the committee. That is his right. But it should \ngive some Members pause. Either the committee process is to be \nrespected as a way to improve or refine the legislation or it is a \njoke. The language of the McConnell amendment has been rejected, much \nof it, by the Labor and Human Resources Committee. We considered it and \ndecided it should be reported without taking into consideration the \nDodd and the Abraham amendment.\n  So I hope the Members will recognize the circumvention of the \ncommittees process. He has the right to do so. But it does disregard \nthe orderly and important consideration of complex and far-reaching \nlegislation.\n  But it is interesting, Mr. President, that during the course of the \nconsideration of the amendment in the committee, the whole question \nabout how we should deal with the professional liability premiums for \nobstetricians and gynecologists was considered by the committee as \nwell. That is in the Thomas amendment.\n  And I refer now to an article by the American Medical News that is \nright on point of the Thomas amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From American Medical News, Feb. 22, 1993]\n\n         Quality Assurance Prenatal Systems Reduce Risk for OBs\n\n                            (By Greg Borzo)\n\n       Professional liability premiums for some obstetrician-\n     gynecologists have fallen dramatically in recent years \n     because of greater physician participation in risk \n     management, quality assurance and documentation of care.\n       Patient flow charts, checklists, practice guidelines and \n     comprehensive office-wide management systems have played a \n     big part in the drop, even though many physicians regard such \n     tools as cookbook medicine.\n       ``Because obstetrics is a high-risk area, we and other \n     insurance companies have concentrated our efforts on it,'' \n     said Julie Pofahl, director of risk management, Physicians \n     Insurance Co. of Wisconsin (PIC-W), ``Physicians are \n     improving the quality of care and their record-keeping in a \n     variety of ways, and as a result, we have seen lower \n     frequency and severity of claims.''\n       Their work is paying off. Over the last four years, \n     premiums charged by physician-owned insurance companies have \n     fallen more for obstetrician-gynecologists than for any other \n     specialists, according to the Medical Liability Monitor, an \n     independent newsletter. In 1992, half the companies did not \n     change their premiums, while 35% reduced them an average of \n     8.3%. In 1989, ob-gyns insured by commercial and physician-\n     owned companies saw rates cut an average of 14.5%; in 1990, \n     16.3%, and 1991, 10.9%.\n       One risk management and quality assurance plan, Prenatal \n     Care, appears to be so successful in reducing obstetrics \n     claims that at least three insurance companies are providing \n     it free to any physician they insure, even though it costs \n     more than $500 per system and about $5.40 per patient for \n     materials. Two of them, Colorado Physicians Insurance Co. \n     (COPIC) and Physicians Insurance Co. of Ohio (PICO), also \n     offer a 15% premium rebate to physicians using the system.\n       Prenatal Care, a comprehensive, integrated system marketed \n     by Advanced\n      Medical Systems in Tulsa, Okla., includes a detailed patient \n     questionnaire and a flow sheet to monitor a pregnancy and \n     remind physicians to perform critical tests. It also \n     includes physician and staff training materials and \n     extensive patient educational handouts.\n       A 50-form introductory unit costs $395, an instructional \n     videotape $95 and quarterly updates run $99 a year.\n       COPIC began promoting the system about six years ago, and \n     it appears to have contributed significantly to falling \n     liability rates for obstetricians in Colorado. Statewide, \n     premiums fell from $61,000 five years ago to $33,000 for OBs \n     and remained stable for family physicians who deliver babies.\n       Only one claim has been filed against Colorado physicians \n     who used the system during the past six years, when it was \n     used for more than 70,000 pregnancies and births, according \n     to Arnold Greensher, MD, a co-developer of the system. \n     Nationwide, two claims have been filed in 150,000 cases since \n     the system was developed 14 years ago.\n       ``The system helps organize patient care and makes sure \n     that nothing gets overlooked or forgotten,'' said George \n     Thomasson, MD, a family physician and COPIC's vice president \n     of risk management. ``This is especially important with the \n     growth of managed care, which leads to fragment the delivery \n     of care.''\n\n\n                    slow acceptance outside colorado\n\n       Nationwide, more than 1,500 physicians use the system in 44 \n     states, and more than 55,000 forms were shipped in 1992, Dr. \n     Greensher said. Physician-owned insurance companies in at \n     least eight states are testing, promoting or giving away the \n     system.\n       Louisiana Medical Mutual Insurance Co. (LAMMICO), for \n     example, began providing the system to some of its physicians \n     three months ago and plans to make the system available to as \n     many physicians as possible.\n       But the system isn't in widespread use outside Colorado.\n       [[Page S5787]] Even though PICO provides the system free \n     and offers its doctors a 15% rebate for using it, only one-\n     third of its OBs and family physicians that deliver babies \n     use it. PICO has been promoting the system for two years.\n       ``Physicians have been reluctant to try this because of two \n     things: inertia\n      and the fact that many hospitals mandate the use of certain \n     forms of flowcharts that preclude the use of something \n     else,'' said Mark Hannon, vice president of the doctor-\n     owned firm.\n       PIC-W also provides Prenatal Care to physicians. After 1\\1/\n     2\\ years, it has given away materials to about 250 \n     physicians. ``Some obstetricians say that some of the forms \n     are redundant and the manual is too basic to be very \n     useful,'' Pofahl said. ``The system could be more appropriate \n     for family practitioners than for obstetricians.''\n\n\n                             crowded field\n\n       Users and promoters of the system speculate that it has not \n     caught on more quickly because of cost and competition. For \n     years, a host of prenatal care forms and computerized systems \n     have been available.\n       Chief among them is the Antepartum Record, a five-page form \n     introduced in 1989 by the American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists. More than 600,000 forms were sold in 1992, \n     one version for about 20 cases per form, the other for a \n     dollar.\n       ``A lot of obstetricians already use the ACOG form and have \n     developed other forms and office procedures based on it,'' \n     Pofahl said. ``Many say they like Prenatal Care's system \n     better but that they don't want to switch because they are \n     just getting adjusted to ACOG or other forms.''\n       Others complain about the cost of switching and the \n     inconvenience of using two systems during the interim.\n       While proponents claim Prenatal Care is so comprehensive \n     that it's in a class of its own, physicians, tend to lump all \n     systems and forms together.\n       ``Our is the only true system,'' Dr. Greensher said, ``The \n     other products are just forms.''\n       Steven Komadina, MD, agrees. Last year, he switched from \n     ACOG's form to Prenatal Care's system, which he describes as \n     nearly foolproof and far more comprehensive. He especially \n     likes the patient education component, which helps the \n     patient realize that she is responsible for her health.\n       The Albuquerque obstetrician has less use for the manual, \n     but says it's helpful for nurse practitioners, physician's \n     assistants and family physicians.\n       ``It's helping to relieve a crisis in rural Torrance \n     County, about 100 miles away, by giving family physicians \n     there the competence and confidence to provide prenatal \n     care,'' Dr. Komadina said. ``Over half the 250 women \n     delivering there receive no prenatal care.''\n       Risk-management directors, however, wonder whether the \n     system is used by physicians who need it most. LAMMICO told \n     several ``problem'' physicians last year that it would not \n     insure them unless they used Prenatal Care.\n       ``Doctors who have tried the system up until now are \n     probably the ones with a high awareness of the issues \n     surrounding risk management,'' Gunter said. ``We want to see \n     the impact on those with high claims frequencies.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will read a portion of it at this time.\n\n       Professional liability premiums for some obstetrician-\n     gynecologists have fallen dramatically in recent years \n     because of greater physician participation in risk \n     management, quality assurance and documentation of care . . .\n       ``Because obstetrics is a high-risk area, we and other \n     insurance companies have concentrated our efforts on it,'' \n     said Julie Pofahl, director of risk management, Physicians \n     Insurance Co. of Wisconsin. ``Physicians are improving the \n     quality of care and their record-keeping in a variety of \n     ways, and as a result, we have seen lower frequency in \n     severity of claims.''\n       Their work is paying off. Over the last four years, \n     premiums charged by physician-owned insurance companies have \n     fallen more for obstetrician-gynecologists than for any other \n     specialists, according to the Medical Liability Monitor, an \n     independent newsletter. In 1992, half the companies did not \n     change their premiums, while 35 percent reduced them an \n     average of 8.3 percent. In 1989, ob/gyns insured by \n     commercial and physician-owned companies also saw rates cut \n     an average of 14.5 percent; in 1990, 16.3 percent; and 1991, \n     10.9 percent.\n       One risk management and quality assurance plan, Prenatal \n     Care, appears to be so successful in reducing obstetrics \n     claims that at least three insurance companies are providing \n     it free to any physician they insure, even though it costs \n     more than $500 per system and about $5.40 per patient for \n     materials.\n\n  Then it continues.\n\n       Only one claim has been filed against Colorado physicians \n     who used the system during the past 6 years, when it was used \n     for more than 70,000 pregnancies and births.\n\n  One claim, one claim, in 70,000. And we have an amendment to try and \nescape from any kind of important liability of malpractice claim in \n``70,000 pregnancies and births, according to Arnold Greensher, MD, a \ncodeveloper of the system. Nationwide, two claims have been filed in \n150,000 cases since the system was developed 14 years ago.''\n\n       In Colorado, the quality assurance system is credited for \n     falling professional liability rates. Premiums fell from \n     $61,000 five years ago to $33,000 for obstetricians.\n\n  This makes the case with regards to obstetricians. And they are \nidentified as being the number one specialty in need. And here we have \nin the American Medical News that spells this out.\n  Now the fact of the matter is obstetrics and gynecology had \nsignificant problems 10 years ago, in 1985, according to the annual \nliability claims for 100 physicians by the Specialty and Census \nDivision. They were clearly the No. 1 in 1985, virtually double from \nanyone else.\n  But since that time, they have had the greatest reduction, some 22.7 \npercent, from all the other specialities.\n  And that just makes the point that we made earlier and that is that \nthe greatest problem that we are facing in terms of malpractice today \nis what is happening to the patients that are being left out in the \ncold and left behind.\n  You know, before we begin to shed a great deal of tears for the \ninsurance companies and for other medical professionals, it is \nimportant to recognize that you, the taxpayer, are picking up about $60 \nbillion a year in unpaid health bills as a result of malpractice. \nSomeone has to pay. Many of these individuals are without any kind of \nhealth insurance or they lose their health insurance. Who do you think \npays? It ends up being a burden on the system.\n  And what we are being asked to do is further immunize the insurance \nindustry that has experienced substantial profits from doing what they \nwere charged to do, and that is to provide insurance in these areas.\n  And second, and importantly, the McConnell amendment fails to take \nthe kind of thoughtful steps that have been supported by Senator \nJeffords, Senator DeWine, and others to take steps to prevent \nmalpractice. We ought to be debating this afternoon what steps are \nbeing taken to prevent malpractice in the first place, to keep people \nhealthy.\n  I know my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, will be offering \nan amendment on that particular issue. We made some progress on it in \nthe consideration of the bill before the committee, but not in this \nbill, not in the McConnell bill. That has all been left out.\n  Why are we not trying to prevent malpractice before it takes place? \nWhy are we not trying to find out through the data bank who the bad \napples are?\n  The data that is collected and sent to the National Practitioner Data \nBank is information about malpractice cases and disciplinary actions \ntaken against doctors. That information is made available to hospitals \nand to HMO's and to professional associations but is not made available \nto the general public. Why are we not making it available to the \ngeneral public? Do you know the answer we heard in our committee? We \ncannot do that in the committee because the data bank is not insured \nenough.\n  I showed in the course of our considerations a book that was 5 inches \ntall that is published by Public Citizen, ``10,000 Questionable \nDoctors.'' This book documents State by State information that is \navailable to the public, about the number of licenses revoked, \nsurrendered, or suspended; fines against doctors; criminal convictions; \nsexual abuse or sexual misconduct with a patient; substandard care; \nmis- prescribing or overprescribing drugs; drug or alcohol \nuse; and other offenses.\n  This is a matter of public record. It is collected in this document \nby Public Citizen and made available so people can find out about it. \nWe want to make sure that it is done in a comprehensive way, updating \ninformation through the data bank. The consumers can find it if they \ncan find this book. If they know the book exists and they know how to \nfind it, they can look up various doctors.\n  Why do we make it so difficult? Why, if we are trying to prevent \nmalpractice, are we not giving information to the public? What are they \nscared of? What are the doctors scared about? What are they frightened \nof? We know. They just do not want to have that information available, \nwhich is understandable for \n[[Page S5788]] their profession, but do not say to us that a prime need \nfor us on the floor of the U.S. Senate in a health care debate is to \ndeny the American consumer the kind of information that is available \nalready and should be made more accessible.\n  The data bank ought to be strengthened. We had CBO studies and GAO \nstudies about how its information can be strengthened. And it should \nbe. That is something that we tried to do under the leadership of \nSenator Jeffords in our committee, which was included in the bill, \nthough not as strongly as I would like to see.\n  So there are some matters that I think are of importance that were \nconsidered in some very important debates and discussions in the \ncommittee; they are the kind of matters that ought to have been \nincluded or addressed in the McConnell bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time just \nto review where we are on the issue of the insurance industry, and I \nrefer to the National Insurance Consumer Organization report, which is \na March 1993 report, because we now evidently are prepared to say that \nMontana does not know best how to treat these problems, or Wyoming does \nnot know best how to deal with this; we need to have these Federal \nstandards on the issue involving a doctor and his patient.\n  I, quite frankly, think this is dramatically different from even the \nunderlying bill, the tort liability bill, where you are talking about \nvarious products that go into a State. We are talking, in this \ncircumstance, about the very sensitive personal relationship between a \ndoctor and a patient. There are not many other relationships which are \nmore important and more personal.\n  We hear so much, we know what we really need locally. But, oh, no, \nthe McConnell amendment is virtually going out to preempt State \nactivities. So we have to know we have a declining need or declining \nburden on the profession, as we mentioned the OB/GYN, what the recent \nstatistics show.\n  Consider the number of gynecologists that are graduating from our \nfine medical schools. That number is not diminishing. The Department of \nHealth and Human Services finds the relationship between needs and \nsupplies in six specialities are far from having a shortage. There is \nactually an oversupply of obstetricians and gynecologists.\n  I am glad to work with our colleagues about how we find out how to \ndeal with underserved areas, but this is not the answer. You have the \nunderserved areas. You have to deal with the burden a young person has \nwhen they graduate from college or from medical school, what their \nfinancial burden is, because they cannot make the sufficient resources, \nif they are going to go into a rural and underserved area, as they do \nin an urban area or in some of these specialities. You have to \nunderstand that they do not get the kind of support they would get if \nthey would practice their medicine in one of the fine medical \ninstitutions. They are denied that.\n  Third, they fall further behind their classmates in terms of \nupgrading their skills. That is troublesome.\n  Fourth, in too many areas that are underserved, they do not have as \ngood an opportunity for education for the children of these young \npeople that want to go to school, and the parents, as dedicated as they \nare, do not want to disadvantage their children.\n  There are a whole series of reasons. But to tie in the fact that we \nhave underserved areas in this country and that the principal reason is \nbecause of the insurance to the OB/GYN just does not hold.\n  Mr. President, I want to just again refer to the studies that were \ndone by the various State organizations, insurance associations and \ntheir review of what is happening on medical malpractice insurance in \ntheir particular States. One of the States that they have reviewed is a \nState that has a number of the features that have been included in the \nMcConnell amendment, and this is what they point out.\n  In 1991--and I will include the appropriate parts of this study in \nthe Record for reference for Members over the weekend --in 1991, \ninsurers writing medical malpractice insurance in the United States \nearned a return of $1.419 billion or 15.9 percent of net worth. This is \nthe profit after dividends to doctors and hospitals of 4.2 percent, \nover $200 million. Investment income amounts to almost 50 percent of \npremium, due to lost reserve. Economists testified in insurance rate \nmatters that returns of 13 to 16 percent on net worth are appropriate \nfor this line of insurance. Here it is for this line of insurance, 13 \nto 16 percent guaranteed. I think most Americans would want to have \nthat kind of investment if they could be assured of that kind of \nprofit.\n  According to studies undertaken by the California Department of \nInsurance, properly capitalized insurers should hold only about a \ndollar of net worth for every dollar of premium for this line of \ninsurance. This is medical malpractice.\n Had insurers not retained so much previous profit, America's medical \nmalpractice insurance return on net worth would have been 29.2 percent. \nMr. President, 29.2 percent--a remarkable high return--which is almost \ndouble the profit required to reward the risk of underwriting medical \nmalpractice. And in the six States that undertook tort reform, studied \nby the GAO office, profits in 1991 averaged 122 percent above the \nnational average, implying possible insurer profiteering in these \nStates.\n\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is those provisions which are basically and \nfundamentally included in the McConnell amendment, at a time when you \nhave 100,000 Americans that are dying, you have no pressure in terms of \nthe increased premium costs, a decline in judgments and in the number \nof cases that are brought. And in the six States which have effectively \nbrought about these kinds of no joint and several--the collateral \ncharges, the limits on the fees for doctors and all the rest, they are \nhaving 122 percent above the national average. Here we are debating a \nhealth matter before the U.S. Senate, with all of the health issues \nthat are affecting working families in this country, for all those \nparents that are going to go home tonight and wonder whether they are \ngoing to still have jobs because of downsizing or cutbacks in defense, \nor because of all the challenges in our economy, wondering whether they \nare going to have it; or whether those families know whether they are \ngoing to get it tomorrow, or the 800,000 new children are not covered \non the basis of last year alone.\n  Here we are taking action that is going to provide that kind of a \nguarantee to the insurance industry. I thought we were here to \nrepresent the working families, working men and women, the children, \nthe older people. We hear the reports that are coming out of our Budget \nCommittee about further cutbacks in Medicare for elderly people. That \nis an enormously important problem. I think we ought to have some \nadjustments if it is part of an overall and comprehensive reform. But \nhere in the first order of business in the Senate we are looking out \nafter these insurance companies. This has to be a matter that must be \nof concern to all Americans.\n  I will include the segments of the most recent report which came out \nin the last 2 days, Mr. President. I will mention just one interesting \nobservation about the most recent reports. Insurance companies have now \nreduced malpractice liability premiums commensurate with a drop in \nmalpractice claims payments in recent years in California and the \nNation. Insurance companies have reaped excessive profits--in 1993, \npaid out 38 cents of every premium dollar.\n  Well, Mr. President, that is what we are addressing here. We will \nhear a great deal about, well, can we not do something about the person \nthat is the victim of malpractice? Yes, we can and we should. That is \nwhy out of our Human Resources Committee last year we came out urging \nthe States to have alternative dispute resolutions, and to build on the \nexisting programs adopted in the States that go for early resolutions, \nto experiment with practice guidelines and enterprise liability, even \nno-fault liability programs, all of those matters to try and look out \nafter the consumer. All of that has passed and gone out. All of that \nexperimentation is out. All of the efforts to try and prevent \nmalpractice, all of those are out. All we are dealing with is bottom-\nline issues. What is going to happen on the bottom line for those \nmedical insurance companies? That is the issue. Let us not fool \nourselves about it.\n  [[Page S5789]] A recent article that gives a characterization of \nmalpractice coverage in a stable condition says this--and this is \nBusiness Insurance, March 28, 1994, 2 months ago:\n\n       Insurers view medical malpractice, hospital professional \n     liability, and related coverage as profitable lines these \n     days, Broker says. In fact, some insurers are looking to \n     increase malpractice accounts in an attempt to offset the \n     meager earnings in the commercial market.\n\n  There is more capacity and there are more players than 3 years ago. \nMore market and capacity than there were 3 years ago. It seems like \nevery month a new insurer wants to underwrite medical liability and \ncoverage for health care organizations.\n  Is this what we are hearing from our colleagues that are crying \ncrocodile tears about all of our specialties that cannot do it and are \nnot able to serve our poor, underserved people in this country? That is \nhogwash. See what the insurance industry says, not what some of us who \nhave serious concerns about this whole kind of approach say. Look at \nwhat Business Insurance says about it. It seems like every month a new \ninsurer wants to underwrite medical liability coverage for health care \norganizations. As long as companies are making profits that exceed the \naverage property casualty profit line, they will want to underwrite \nthis coverage.\n  In other words, boys and girls, you want to get on the gravy train, \nget on the malpractice gravy train, as it is today. We are going to \neven make it better for you with the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, we must have other measures which are of greater \nurgency and importance for us to be addressing than that particular \nmeasure.\n  It seems to me that at the appropriate time--and I see others that \nwant to address the Senate--I will offer the amendment which I offered \nin the committee, which basically was the substitute amendment which \nwas accepted unanimously last year in the Human Resources Committee by \nall Republicans and Democrats.\n  Let me tell you what it is about. It is a reasonable question to say, \nall right, we know what you are against. We have problems. What are you \nfor?\n  Let me briefly summarize what this amendment would do.\n  The amendment that I will offer at an appropriate point is identical \nin content to the malpractice reform subtitle of the health care \nreform, favorably reported by the Labor Committee. It seems to me that \nthis is the appropriate vehicle to report to the full Senate because it \nwas the product of carefully measured bipartisan deliberation. In that \nregard, it stands in sharp contrast to what the measure is that is \nbefore the Senate this evening.\n  Many of the current members of the Labor Committee will remember that \nwe spent the better portion of 2 days thoroughly discussing and \nimproving the malpractice title of the health care bill. For example, \nthere was considerable debate about the preemption issue. We resolved \nthat by accepting a Coats amendment striking preemption language that \nhad been in the original mark.\n  It was a debate in a series of amendments regarding attorneys' fees \nand the result was a deliberative process. We limited those fees from \nthe percentage that originally appeared in the Clinton bill. We \nsharpened the State demonstration programs authorized in the bill, \nadding a proposal by Republicans to explore no-fault liability \nprograms. That said, if you have injury, you are able to collect right \naway; you do not have to prove negligence, and you can be reimbursed \nright away. It will not be as much as if you had gone through a court \nprocedure, but you will get resources quickly in response to medical \ninjury. A few States are doing that. We are encouraging that as a way \nto assist fellow citizens and to see whether it works. Eventually, we \nreached a bipartisan consensus on sensible medical malpractice reform \nprovisions.\n  There are some who wish to go further in the area of damage caps, \nwhich my impression of the language in that subtitle, was broadly \nacceptable to every member of the committee.\n  The reforms the Labor Committee approved last year included mandatory \nalternative dispute resolutions; a limitation on attorney's contingency \nfees, collateral source reduction, periodic payments of awards, a State \noption to require certificates of merit before filing actions, and \nState demonstration projects to determine alternative approaches to \nmalpractice.\n  These are meaningful, major kinds of reforms to the system that we \nhad, and not only with regard to the malpractice. We had important and \nsignificant reforms in the areas of preventive health care, which I \nwill not get into at this time.\n  These are the provisions we all agreed upon. They are sane, rational \nreforms which we crafted ourselves over lengthy bipartisan \ndeliberation.\n  Although I would greatly prefer to see them included in a far more \nreaching health reform bill that would guarantee health security, they \nremain acceptable to me as an alternative to the measure which we are \nconsidering on the floor of the Senate. They will improve the \nmalpractice system without unduly limiting the right of consumers to \ncompensation for injuries sustained as a result of negligent medical \ncare.\n  I submit that it is preferable to adopt these carefully consider \nreforms, rather than rushing to approve a bill that we have not \nsufficient time to address.\n  Now, Mr. President, it seems to me that that is a responsible, \nthoughtful product of give and take by Members, that come here with a \nwide variety of different thinking on the issue of malpractice reform.\n  We saw considerable debate that took place for a day and a half in \nour committee. We were able to make some adjustments. Still, it was not \nreported out in a bipartisan way. Nonetheless, we made some progress. \nThat has effectively been discarded.\n  At an appropriate time I will offer that amendment perhaps as a \nsecond-degree amendment to the McConnell amendment. An additional \namendment, Mr. President, that I intend to offer, would make clear that \nthe reforms in this bill do not preempt State law.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia. I have about 10 more minutes. \nIf the Senator had a statement or intervention to make, I would be glad \nto yield, but otherwise if it is agreeable, it would be about 10 more \nminutes.\n  The preemption amendment would make clear that the reforms in the \nbill do not preempt State law, but apply in situations where there is \nno relevant State law. But where a State legislature has enacted a \nreform or affirmatively chosen not to enact to reform, the State's \nchoice would prevail.\n  We hear much from the new majority in Congress about the States \nrights and the decentralization of power. We see proposals to turn over \nthe administration of Federal entitlement programs to the States in the \nform of block grants, and we are told that there is much wisdom in \nState governments which are closer to the people than the Federal \nGovernment. However, in this bill, the opposite philosophy prevails.\n  Suddenly States cannot be trusted. States cannot even be allowed to \nwrite the laws to govern consideration of tort cases that have been \ntheir responsibility for over 200 years, about 100 years, recognized in \ncourt opinion.\n  Apparently in this area, Congress has all of the answers. It is \nespecially strange that this bill preempts State laws very selectively. \nOnly laws that benefit consumers are preempted, while those that \nbenefit doctors and insurance companies are allowed to stand. \nPreemption of State tort laws is generally disfavored, but this result-\noriented brand of preemption is especially unfair. One sided \npreemption. One sided.\n  We can make the case on the issues of tort that States should be able \nto make their own judgments. That is certainly the conclusion that we \nreached last year. However, in this particular program they say, all \nright, the States can make it as long as they are making what is \nfavorable to the industry and not the consumer. That is the bottom \nline.\n  It is one-way preemption against the consumer, against those working \nfamilies, against those children, against those parents, in favor of \nthose insurance companies that are making the record profits.\n  There is a product liability bill on the floor, and I have serious \nconcerns about many aspects, but at least there \n[[Page S5790]] is a plausible basis for Congress to create Federal \nstandards to govern the liabilities of manufacturers who sell products \nin a nationwide market.\n  Undoubtedly, interstate commerce is at stake in the context of \nproduct liability, but the medical malpractice is typically a legal \ndispute between an individual, between his and her doctor, within the \nboundaries of a single State. Interstate commerce is hardly at the \nheart of the transaction, so there is no justification for imposition \nof Federal standards.\n  When we considered malpractice in last year's health bill, Members of \nboth sides of the aisle were anxious to protect the reforms that their \nlegislatures had enacted. Everyone recognized the need to proceed \nslowly for overturning 200 years of law in 50 States, and by unanimous \nvote we deleted that language that would have preempted inconsistent \nState lawsuits.\n  The amendment basically carries forward that valuable lesson from \nlast year's debate that States that the basic principle, that this bill \ndoes not preempt State law. If a State has taken no action in a \nparticular area, this Federal law will apply; but if a State has found \na better way to address a problem in light of conditions in that State, \nwe should not substitute a Federal solution in a field that States have \noccupied for 200 years of American history.\n  So there would be a preemption amendment. I would hope that this \nwould be successful. There are other approaches that have been \nmentioned, by Senator Abraham and others, who have addressed that.\n  Finally, I would just say that many were absolutely amazed at the \ninclusion of a loser-pays concept, included in the legislation which \nwas included in the bill that was before our committee. I understand it \nhas been changed. I think, wisely so.\n  We could be in the extraordinary case where an individual was able to \nwin their case in the courts, and because they had not accepted a \nprevious kind of offer, effectively would have been required to pay the \nattorney's fees for the other side, even though they got a finding that \nthere had been negligence and they had been endured medical \nmalpractice.\n  Now, the loser-pays system has been a part of English law. There is \nan excellent article from the bar association, recently pointed out, \nand as the Economist magazine, one of the distinguished magazine \ncommentaries both on American and English public affairs has pointed \nout, they are moving in the direction of the United States for well-\ndocumented reasons. And that is because the unfairness and injustice \nthat that creates.\n  We had a proposal before to move in their direction. It was not \nenough to have the punitive damage caps or the repeals of joint and \nseveral, which have been out there for many years which had loser pay. \nWe had one-way preemption and we have no access to the data bank.\n  That was the major flaw--the cap on punitive damages, no matter how \negregious the circumstance was going to be, in spite of the high \nstandard that would have to be reached in order to be able to claim \npunitive damages, the repeal of joint and several so that even in a \ncircumstance we could see the tragic circumstances where that \nindividual in Florida that lost one leg, he was also a diabetic, so he \nwas disabled. Hence, he did not have the loss of much wages and \neconomic damages. Since he is getting disability, the disability was \npaying in, that would be an offset to what the insurance would have to \npay if there was negligence in that particular case. That is absolutely \ncrazy. That is absolutely crazy.\n  Those are the kinds of circumstances. When we have joint and several, \nand we eliminate those, and we eliminate the payment, the legitimate \npayment, to those individuals that ought to be decided on the basis of \nthe jury, someone pays--and it is the American taxpayers--$60 billion. \nThat is who ends up paying, if the insurer that is supposed to provide \nthat kind of coverage, and is obligated to do so, if they are in the \ninsurance business, does not do so.\n  We also know the dangers of adding onto that the collateral \nprovisions, which in many instances diminishes in a dramatic way the \npayments to individuals who otherwise would be entitled to payments in \na court of law. That has been a factor.\n  Then one of the most extraordinary matters we were facing in our bill \nis, even if you got the punitive damages, if you were able to get some \npunitive damages, part of those punitive damages were going to go to \nfund some quality control measures. That made absolutely no sense at \nall.\n  So I hope we will have a chance. We are glad to work with the \nleadership to try to get an orderly way of addressing some of these \nissues. It is not our intention--at least not my intention--to delay \nSenate action. But I do think we just had the measure that came up this \nafternoon when many of us were over on the Judiciary Committee. My \ncolleague, Senator Simon, and other members of our committee were at \nthe Judiciary hearing on terrorism; and we had the mark-up on the \nJudiciary Committee earlier today on regulatory reform, which a number \nof us are involved in. We want to meet our responsibilities. But on \nimportant measures like this, the Senate is entitled to at least give \nsome consideration to matters which are going to have an enormous \nimpact on fairness and on justice and on the quality of health care for \nthe American people.\n  One of the aspects of health challenges that we are faced with--we \nhave the issue of access and the availability of health care. We have \nthe costs of health care, the fact that it continues to rise. From $1 \ntrillion, it will double by the year 2002 to $2 trillion. We have to do \nsomething about getting a handle on those health care costs. We have to \ndo something in terms of making it available, particularly to the \nchildren. Of the 40 million people who have no health care coverage, \nabout 15 million children in our country have no health care coverage. \nWe have to do something about those. But we have to do something about \nquality as well, and this is something that deals with quality and it \nis a step backwards, not a step forward. And it should not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, what is interesting about all of this \nis that the business at hand is something called the Product Liability \nFairness Act. I want to be very frank about my disposition towards the \namendment which is at this moment before us.\n  This is not a unique situation in the Senate. Senators have the right \nto come forward and offer amendments to legislation that are outside \nthe scope of the legislation before the Senate. We have seen that done \never since I came to the Senate, from both sides of the aisle. And sure \nenough, Senators from Kentucky and Connecticut and Wyoming are using \ntheir rights to ask the Senate to decide whether to attach a series of \nprovisions dealing with malpractice to a bill dealing solely and only \nwith product liability.\n  An entire day disappears. Whether there is passage or not, it will \nnot be a part of the final version of this legislation. It will get \nvetoed, it will get taken out one way or other. It is an exercise of \nfolly, which is sad. And I will express my views.\n  I am deeply committed, as committed as anybody in this body, to \nhealth care reform. And I see malpractice reform as an integral part of \nthe solution to the crisis that faces the self-esteem and the condition \nof our physicians, our hospitals, and the American people, and I think \nof those in my own State of West Virginia in particular.\n  Mr. President, I have watched the Senate come very close to the point \nwhere we might enact a product liability bill during the past 6 years. \nWe actually got 60 votes several years ago; 60 was written down on the \ntable here in front of us. The majority leader at that time, under the \nrules, stopped the vote and we spent the next 45 minutes while he found \ntwo Senators who had voted yes to change their votes to no. So we lost.\n  Now that we have 20-minute votes, that is much harder to do. I am \nvery happy for that. But we have come very close. And I take product \nliability reform extremely seriously. I think it is something that \nneeds to happen both for consumers and for businesses in this country. \nI think it is important for America. I think it is important for the \nAmerican people. I take product liability seriously and anything which \ncomes in the way of product liability, \n[[Page S5791]] and a chance--and perhaps the last chance that we ever \nhave--to assemble a coalition that is willing to go for this. Now we \nhave other amendments.\n  You have to understand, as I am sure the President does, that people \nbetter start making a decision around here. Do you want to have the fun \nof making wonderful speeches and putting on what I think is very good \nlegislation, amendments in terms of malpractice reform? Or do you want \nto have product liability? You are probably not going to have both.\n  Today has been interesting. I did not schedule a lot because I \nthought we were going to be dealing with product liability, and all of \na sudden we are dealing with something called malpractice reform that \nhas to do with health care.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about a whole series of \namendments, so I assume this will go on for a long time. There are some \npeople in this body who have not yet quite decided whether this bill, \ncalled product liability reform, is in fact good public policy. That \nmay be more on this Senator's side than the side of the Presiding \nOfficer. But there are some people who have not quite decided whether \nthis bill should be used to enact good public policy on product \nliability.\n  Or are we just making points about other things that we are \ninterested in? Which I might be interested in. But at some point people \nhave to make a choice. Are we going to do product liability or are we \ngoing to do a whole series of things which then end up negating the \nchance to get product liability?\n  I have been working on product liability for 9 years; some have for \n13. I made a variety of tabling motions yesterday to express very \nclearly my view about that. In fact, there was one that was a Heflin-\nRockefeller amendment, which does not comport with the natural \ntendencies that surround product liability. I am trying to make the \npoint that I want this to be a pure product liability bill.\n  The Senator from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton--\nextraordinarily skillful, extraordinarily insightful, extraordinarily \ndisciplined--believes, as I do, that if we are going to get 60 votes to \nstop the filibuster that will surely be there and will come at some \npoint, it is going to be very close. And he agrees that we should \nfocus, as I agree we should focus, on product liability.\n  It is a very complicated subject. It is a very complicated subject to \nexplain, particularly when explained by a nonlawyer such as myself, \nmuch less a skilled lawyer such as my colleague from the State of \nWashington.\n  The majority leader can schedule a separate time, its own special \ntime to take up malpractice reform such as the malpractice reform \nlegislation that, in this case, was adopted just on Tuesday by the \nSenate Labor Committee. But in good conscience I, as manager on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, cannot take the risk when the chances are \ngood of enacting product liability reform, making reforms to a broken, \ndysfunctional product liability system --that these will all be torn \nasunder, weakened, scattered about by a series of other amendments, in \nthis case dealing with a very, very important subject called \nmalpractice reform. I do not have any choice but as to my conclusion, \nand at the appropriate time I will move to table this amendment and the \nunderlying amendment, and other amendments associated with it. I have \nno choice.\n  With cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, with a long history of \nstrong support in this body, Senator Gorton and I have been on this \nfloor all week talking about our rather grave concern about the \nproblems in the current patchwork of unpredictable, unfair matters \nassociated with product liability. This Senate has before it a very \ncarefully constructed bill to improve the system to make it less \ncostly, to make it more predictable, to make it more fair for everyone. \nAnd enacting product liability reform is what I believe the goal should \nbe for the Senate at this moment, as of all of this day, as of all of \nthe moments that remain.\n  Yesterday, as I indicated, we moved to table a number of amendments \nwhich were related to a legal system and lawyers, but were beyond the \nscope of product liability legislation. So I moved to table them. The \nmalpractice reform amendments offered today are analogous to previous \nbroadening amendments which were offered and then tabled.\n  I hope that we can reach an agreement on a course of action that \nprovides for a meaningful debate on the pros and cons of malpractice \nreform, and in the near future. As I have indicated, I think if we \ncould do this before July 4, it would be very, very good. That might be \nan option which would address any concern that there will not be \nanother timely opportunity to deal with malpractice reform.\n  The medical community in my State wants malpractice reform more than \nanything else that exists. They want it desperately. I also do. Given \nanother moment on another day, a bill in the range of what has been \npresented this day would have my vote; that is, the kind of amendment \non malpractice which has been presented by Senator McConnell would have \nmy vote. I would argue for it vociferously. I might disagree with some \nof the points that have been made about it, but not the majority of its \nprovisions. I hear from doctors all the time, I hear from hospitals all \nthe time about the importance of malpractice reform to them as \nessential health care professionals in my State. We have had ongoing \ndialog on this issue, and I know I can say that I understand what they \nwant. I understand the problems of health care.\n  I have done a lot of work on health care over the last 8 years or so. \nI very much want to be able to improve the climate for practicing \nmedicine in West Virginia for all providers. I want to do all I can to \nmake sure that we have an adequate supply of all needed health care \nprofessionals in my State, particularly OB-GYN's and health care \nproviders which are in short supply in almost every county--in some \ncounties in the State of the Presiding Officer; in most counties in my \nState.\n  I also believe good malpractice reform will help improve the quality \nof health care services in my State, malpractice reform can be in the \nbest interests of patients and their health care professionals alike.\n  What is interesting is that malpractice is also a state of mind \npreventing a lot of people from going into medicine. There are a lot of \ndoctors now who have told me they do not want their sons or daughters \nto go into medicine. It is not worth it, they say. Every patient they \nface is a potential litigant. We are a litigious society, sadly and \nshockingly so.\n  Yesterday, I had a long visit with Dr. Jim Todd, executive director \nof the American Medical Association; Dick Davidson, of the American \nHospital Association; and Tom Skully, of the Federation of American \nHealth Systems, another group representing a large number of hospitals \nin this country. They said nationwide the doctors and hospitals whom \nthey represent, and that is a very large collective membership, want \nstrong malpractice reform enacted as soon as possible. I shared with \nthem my strong desire to help toward passage of that end. But let me \nsay that we cannot do both things at the same time.\n  If we pass medical malpractice and it is incorporated into the \nproduct liability bill, some votes from this side will fall off and the \nentire tree will collapse. You put too many decorations on a Christmas \ntree, and at some point the bow simply falls and everything drops off.\n  I do not think it is very complicated. I think this really is a test \nof who wants product liability reform and who does not. I can \nunderstand the opponents of product liability reform adding on all \nkinds of amendments. I can understand that to deter, to generally \nscatter attention, and to dilute. But I cannot understand those who \nfavor product liability doing that.\n  This is not just a question of the House agenda, the Contract With \nAmerica. There is a lot of concern on my side, Mr. President, about \nthis bill--it is very real on my side--that it is going to be loaded up \nwith what came over from the House. I think one of the things that the \nother side is learning now is that, if they were to put forward a \nseries of amendments, they will not get as many votes as they thought \nthey would, and the votes really will not be there to do the job. It \nwill not be there on our side, almost \n[[Page S5792]] for certain, and they will not be there on the other \nside.\n  So here we are. I may not agree with every provision of malpractice \nreform advanced by some. But I want to see it done. I want that clear. \nThis is, in a sense, my issue as much as any issue in this body. I have \nphysicians, hospitals, and others--and patients in West Virginia--who \nneed to have this happen. I just want to be certain that no one \nmisunderstands my position. Despite the concern that other Members have \nexpressed about attaching malpractice reform onto product liability, I \nhave no intention of ducking the issue of the need to deal with \nmalpractice reform. I understand what is going on.\n  I am interested in why the Senator from Kentucky chose to offer his \noriginal malpractice bill as an amendment as opposed to what was marked \nup in the Labor Committee. The majority of the provisions of Senator \nMcConnell's bills are ones which most of us supported in the past on \none piece of legislation or another. I am also interested in hearing \nthe rationale for Senator Thomas' second-degree amendment regarding \nrural care.\n  But, in the end, I just return to Senator McConnell's underlying \nmalpractice reform amendment and I say, do we not have to choose? I \nfeel we do. We cannot have it both ways. I fear that, if this \namendment, as much as I might be interested in it, were to prevail, it \nwould peel off votes from my side of the aisle, and product liability \nwould lose. I do not want that to happen. The Senator from Washington \ndoes not want that to happen. It has been our pledge from the beginning \nthat we are going to try to keep this bill as clean as possible; \nclean--only product liability. Anything outside, we work against.\n  So I hope my views on this are understood. I repeat that at the \nappropriate time, I will move to table the various amendments that deal \nwith this subject.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to comment just briefly on the comments of the \nminority manager of the bill. I wish to assure him that coming from a \nState that suffered as much from the problems of product liability \nreform, having lost much of our machine tool industry and a big cause \nof that being the big differences between the liability of our own \nbusinesses in this country and those of our foreign competitors, I will \nnot do anything in any way to destroy the opportunity to have product \nliability pass, and I think I speak for the Members on my side of the \naisle.\n  However, I feel I must bring to his attention and the attention of my \ncolleagues that there is a very noncontroversial aspect of the \nMcConnell amendment which, if passed, would move us a long way towards \ntwo very important matters in the health care area. First of all, it \nwould assist in preventing medical malpractice, which is probably the \nmost important thing we can do. What we want to do is to provide the \nopportunity to gather the information which would be necessary to be \nable to prevent the occurrence of malpractice by having sufficient \nguidelines and information available to doctors so that the number of \nincidents of malpractice will be decreased.\n  And second is to protect consumers. We are moving into an area right \nnow where we have managed care throughout this country. Health care \nreform is going on. Notwithstanding the fact that we failed to pass \nanything of any substance last year, health care reform is going on. \nBut the managed care concept raises real serious problems for consumers \nas to how they can be protected when they get into situations where \nchoice of the doctor may not be what they intend or even available to \nthem. How can they get information on what is available to see if the \ncare they are going to get or the doctor or physician they have is one \nthat is qualified?\n  So I am referring to a part of the McConnell amendment that is under \nsubtitle B that is called ``Protection of the Health and Safety of \nPatients,'' and most particularly section 32, which is entitled, \n``Quality Assurance, Patient Safety, and Consumer Information.''\n  We are now in the information age, and with all of the computer \ninternets, all the information that is able to flow back and forth, we \nhave an opportunity to give to the health care providers the ability to \nknow what is good care and what is not good care, to have information \non outcomes to be able to determine as to what should be done and what \nis good care and what is not good care.\n  All this bill does is to provide an organized system for obtaining \nthis information in various ways and making it available for those \npurposes. No one disagrees with that.\n  So I would hope, if nothing else, we can include these things which \nare totally noncontroversial to this bill if it should prove the \nmalpractice provisions otherwise might bring the bill down. What it \ndoes is establish an advisory panel to coordinate and evaluate methods, \nprocedures and data to enhance the quality, safety and effectiveness of \nhealth care services provided to patients. No one disagrees with that.\n  In order to do that, the panel that would be set up will assure that \nthe members of the panel include representatives of the public and \nprivate sector, entities having expertise in quality assurance, risk \nassessment, risk management, patient safety and patient satisfaction.\n  What it does, it establishes these objectives, again for which there \nis absolutely no problem with anyone.\n  The survey shall include gathering data with respect to, first, \nperformance measures of quality for health care providers and health \nplans; second, developments in survey methodology, sampling, and audit \nmethods to try to determine what is going on; third, methods of medical \npractice and patterns and patient outcomes; and fourth, methods of \ndisseminating information concerning successful health care quality \nimprovement programs, risk management and patient safety programs, \npractice guidelines, patient satisfaction and practitioner licensing, \nall things we know are essential to be able to give us the kind of \ninformation we must have to protect the consumer and as well to give \nguidance to the medical profession to reduce the opportunity for \nmalpractice.\n  In addition, ``the administrator shall * * * establish health care \nquality assurance, patient safety and consumer information guidelines. \nSuch guidelines shall be modified periodically. Such guidelines shall \nbe advisory in nature and not binding.''\n  So we are not doing anything that anyone can disagree with but will \nbe so important to provide the information that is necessary, made \navailable through internets and whatever else, to ensure that we are \ngetting the best care possible that is available. So I do not think \nanyone can disagree with these provisions which the McConnell \nsubstitute attempts to accomplish.\n  So I would urge my colleagues, be assured that there are many good \nthings that are noncontroversial and very important to the improvement \nof our health care system which are in the McConnell substitute and \nwhich are not things that should give us any concern at all.\n  So I hope, as we go forth here, if the minority manager of the bill \nis correct in that malpractice is going to be so controversial that it \nwill not pass, that something which the sooner we get started the \nsooner we will be able to prevent medical malpractice and the sooner we \ngive protection to consumers ought to go forward in some way along with \nthis bill rather than have to wait, so that we can get to the business \nof providing that kind of information and that kind of assistance to \nboth practitioners and to consumers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask, are there other colleagues \nwho want to speak right now? If not, I wonder if I could suggest the \nabsence a quorum for a moment with the understanding that I would have \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to speak at length, but I \nwould like to take 2 minutes now and then I will sit down and come back \nlater or whatever time is available. Could I do that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that would be fine.\n  [[Page S5793]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, later on I will speak to the overall \nissue of judicial and jury reform as it applies to civil litigation in \nthe United States, but I thought I might just tonight express for the \nSenators at least what my head tells me about this system. I was \nlooking around for some judicial stalwart who might have addressed the \nissue, and I found that Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell described \npunitive damages as follows:\n\n       It invites punishment so arbitrary as to be virtually \n     random.\n\n  Now, the reason I bring that up is because I believe that it is \nabsolutely true, and so what we get in certain advertisements across \nthe country and in statements in the Chamber, is the random damage \naward that was proper or somewhat proper. But we do not hear the \nhundreds that were randomly wrong, wherein the jury was taken advantage \nof by emotions and awarded huge punitive damages when they were not \nwarranted. We also don't hear about the even bigger issue of what this \ndoes overall to our litigation system. Clearly it invites more \nlitigation because the random winner may be a big winner.\n  Now, what does the random nature of the potential for a big win mean \nto our litigation system? Mr. President, it means cases get settled \nthat are not worth anything. That is obvious. A company has to settle \nlawsuits because they cannot take the chance of the random verdict.\n  Now, I am very pleased that Justice Powell said it that way. I have \nsaid it is the worst way to regulate human behavior in America. If you \nare trying to find standards to have people hold their performance to, \nthe worst way is to ask juries to set the standard. For nobody knows \nwhat it will mean and clearly juries have all the latitude in the world \nwhen you add punitive damages to the system. It leaves all kinds of \nimpressions with those who are supposed to be bound in some way, by \nchanging their conduct to a high or better standard.\n  Now, the Justice went on to say the following, which sort of hits my \nlast remarks: Because juries can impose virtually limitless punitive \ndamages, in Justice Powell's words, they act as--And I say this to my \ngood friend from Washington, let me quote it perfectly as he said it--\nthey act as a ``legislator and judge without the training or experience \nor guidance of either.''\n  That is a pretty good way to say it. Who told juries what the \nstandard of conduct is or what a company ought to pay if they violate \nsome kind of standard of the ordinary man or ordinarily prudent man? No \none. So they are told that by words that lawyers express, when they are \nnot trained in the law and they are not trained in what kind of damages \nwe ought to extract from people who do not behave according to a norm.\n  So I come to the floor to laud those who are looking for reform in \nthis system. And I specifically tonight just had a few remarks with \nreference to punitive damages. Clearly, there are cases where punitive \ndamages should lie. On the other hand, there is not going to be a \nperfect solution to the dilemma we find ourselves in. If we conclude \nthat since we cannot come up with a perfect system on punitive damages \nsince there are a few cases that are entitled to extraordinary kinds of \npunitive damages for one reason or another, that we cannot solve that \nproblem, we will never do anything.\n  We will leave in place a system that is so arbitrary as to be \nvirtually random. We will run around this country talking about that as \nif it were a real, bona fide, honest-to-God system when it is nothing \nlike that. It is so arbitrary as to be virtually random. And that is no \nsystem. That is no system of assessing damages.\n  Mr. President, obviously I have not been down here during the past \nweek. Some will probably say, ``You have already said enough.'' But \nobviously, I will say a little more, because I have some pretty strong \nfeelings about it.\n  I close with a parting shot. I wonder if our Founding Fathers and the \ncommon law of England from which we continue to say we derived all \nthese marvelous rights, I wonder if they ever would have had in mind \nthat we would send a malpractice case of the type we are sending the \njuries, or product liability of the type we are sending to the juries. \nI believe if you had asked the Founders, they would have said, ``Of \ncourse not. They ought to be arbitrated by people who know something \nabout it.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak at some length \ntoday, so I will not respond to my colleague from New Mexico. I \nappreciate his remarks. I tell him as a good friend, I should have \nknown when he said it would be 2 minutes, it would be a little more \nthan 2 minutes. But he is eloquent and he is a very, very important \nvoice here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Thomas amendment be \nset aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 605 to Amendment No. 603\n\n(Purpose: To modify provisions regarding reports on medical malpractice \n                data and access to certain information)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 605 to the McConnell amendment No. 603.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section ____32(c)(1) of the amendment, strike \n     subparagraph (B) and all that follows through the end of the \n     section and insert the following:\n       (B) an estimation of the degree of consensus concerning the \n     accuracy and content of the information available under \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       (C) a summary of the best practices used in the public and \n     private sectors for disseminating information to consumers.\n       (2) Interim report.--Not later than 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this title, the Administrator shall prepare \n     and submit to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) a \n     report, based on the results of the advisory panel survey \n     conducted under subsection (a)(3), concerning--\n       (A) the consensus of indicators of patient safety and risk;\n       (B) an assessment of the consumer perspective on health \n     care quality that includes an examination of--\n       (i) the information most often requested by consumers;\n       (ii) the types of technical quality information that \n     consumers find compelling;\n       (iii) the amount of information that consumers consider to \n     be sufficient and the amount of such information considered \n     overwhelming; and\n       (iv) the manner in which such information should be \n     presented;\n     and recommendations for increasing the awareness of consumers \n     concerning such information;\n       (C) proposed methods, building on existing data gathering \n     and dissemination systems, for ensuring that such data is \n     available and accessible to consumers, employers, hospitals, \n     and patients;\n       (D) the existence of legal, regulatory, and practical \n     obstacles to making such data available and accessible to \n     consumers;\n       (E) privacy or proprietary issues involving the \n     dissemination of such data;\n       (F) an assessment of the appropriateness of collecting such \n     data at the Federal or State level; and\n       (G) the reliability and validity of data collected by the \n     State medical boards and recommendations for developing \n     investigation protocols.\n       (3) Annual report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the submission of the report under paragraph (2), and each \n     year thereafter, the Administrator shall prepare and submit \n     to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) a report \n     concerning the progress of the advisory panel in the \n     development of a consensus with respect to the findings of \n     the panel and in the development and modification of the \n     guidelines required under subsection (b).\n       (4) Termination.--The advisory panel shall terminate on the \n     date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this \n     title.\n\n     SEC. ____33.

Mr. President, I really look forward to what will be, \nI believe, broad-based support for this amendment.\n  I say to my colleague from Washington, my understanding is that, \nhopefully, we will be able to submit amendments tonight, there will be \ntime for debate on Monday, and sometime Monday we hope there will be \nvotes on these amendments; is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is correct. \nThat is what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me simply say that this amendment \ndeals with the National Practitioner Data Bank. The data bank contains \nreally important information on adverse actions that are taken against \ndoctors, and in some cases information on actual payments made in \nmalpractice judgements.\n  Mr. President, the problem is not most of the doctors in the country; \nmost of the doctors are very good doctors. The problem is that this \ninformation right now is readily available to managed care plans and \nhospitals and medical societies but not available to consumers.\n  I have talked with a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nI think that this amendment which I have worked on for some time now \nreally is an effort to provide consumers with this kind of information. \nI think it will be well received.\n  We have done some good work on, first of all, strengthening the data \ncollection; good work in responding to some of the concerns that have \nbeen raised by doctors; very good work in terms of responding to \nconcerns raised by consumers across the country and by many consumer \norganizations.\n  Mr. President, the idea, of course, is that we would ask the \nSecretary of HHS [Health and Human Services], within 6 months to \ndevelop essentially a plan to make sure that this information is \navailable to consumers so that they could have some sense about the \nrecord of doctors who are treating them.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes, too many times--and I have some really \nheart-rendering testimony by citizens in the country that have, in a \ntragic way, been on the receiving end of this--you will have a doctor \nwho will move, who will have had an adverse action taken against him by \na State medical society or hospital as a result of whole patterns of \nmalpractice, and then move to another State, and sometimes even change \nhis name. Then the same kind of egregious practice is committed again \nat great harm to consumers. It happens too often.\n  There is just simply no reason why in this, if you will, more highly \nsophisticated data entry and computer age, we cannot make this \ninformation available to consumers.\n  I say to my colleagues, that we are not talking about cases in which \nsomebody has just launched a complaint against a doctor. We are talking \nabout cases where there has actually been an adverse action taken \nagainst a practitioner's license or clinical privileges or where there \nhas actually been a malpractice payment made with the record being \nclear.\n  So I have submitted this amendment tonight, and I look forward to the \ndebate on Monday.\n  In 3 months, the HHS Secretary comes back to the Senate and then 3 \nmonths after that, the Secretary of Health and Human Services then has \nto have promulgated regulations to disclose the information to \nconsumers in a useable way.\n  So we have a real opportunity to do something that I think would be \nextremely important in preventing malpractice from taking place in the \nfirst place, which is really, I think, the goal of any kind of reform \neffort.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Washington for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first of all, I note with interest the \nSenator from Minnesota's liberal interpretation of 2 minutes, as well. \nBut it was well worth it when you listen to him, because I not only \nagree with his approach in this amendment, but his eloquence on the \nfloor today and throughout this piece of legislation is a very \nimportant part of dealing with the amendment and dealing with what this \nbill is all about. So I appreciate his courtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 603\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the underlying \namendment offered by the junior Senator from Kentucky. I do so on the \nsame grounds that I oppose the underlying legislation.\n  This sort of liability reform is not needed, it is not justified, and \nit is certainly not fair to injured consumers and patients.\n  I am very glad I was on the floor a few moments ago to hear the \njunior Senator from West Virginia indicate his intention to move to \ntable this underlying amendment. Even though we may disagree on the \nunderlying legislation as a whole, I am pleased to see his consistent \neffort to make sure that this bill does not get completely out of \ncontrol and try to revamp our entire civil legal system when we are \nsupposedly debating one particular aspect of it.\n  Mr. President, I know that others have already spoken out against the \nunderlying amendment and spoken directly to the question of how \njustified and how needed it is.\n  I would like to add my voice to this particular chorus and make two \npoints about this amendment and the direction it is taking us.\n  First, I have to note with a lot of regret that the first issue \nraised in the new Republican Congress dealing with the tremendous \nhealth care dilemma this Nation is facing has to do with malpractice \nand health care liability reform.\n  We are not talking about providing universal health care coverage to \nall Americans. We are not talking about legislation that says if you \nget sick, you have a right to see a doctor. We are not you talking \nabout providing community-based, long-term care for the elderly and \npeople with disabilities. We are not talking about addressing the \nskyrocketing costs of prescription medicines so the elderly will no \nlonger have to choose between their prescription drugs and their food \nand heating bills.\n  No, Mr. President, we are not talking about any of these issues that \nwere so frequently debated by both parties last year. Everybody said \nthey were important issues that merited our attention, but none of \nthose have come forward in these months that we have been in the 104th \nCongress.\n  We are not talking about these issues because it is the belief of \nsome on the other side that most of our health care problems are based \non the so-called liability crisis faced by doctors and hospitals.\n  Mr. President, that is not to say it is not an important issue. That \nis not to say it does not deserve our attention in the broader context \nof health care reform. But I think that right now the 38 million \nAmericans who do not have health insurance, if they hear this, must be \nsaying, ``Are you kidding me?'' Because there are people who are \nwalking around right now without health insurance at all. It might be \nthe factory worker who has lost his job and his health insurance along \nwith it. It might be the young mother who has a preexisting condition \nand is unable to find an insurer. It might be the young child who was \nparalyzed in an automobile accident and whose health benefits have run \nout because of an arbitrary cap.\n  Instead of addressing true reforms that would actually improve some \nof these situations, we are instead debating an amendment that would \nlimit the judicial remedies of those who have been the victims of \nmalpractice and negligence by a few bad actors in the health care \nprofession. Proponents have compared it to the malpractice reforms \npassed by the State of California several years ago, and there seems to \nbe some disagreement about the actual success of those reforms in terms \nof their effect on liability insurance premiums and also about the \noverall costs to the California health care system.\n  But there is one fact that cannot be disputed: Despite the so-called \nliability reforms in California, there are millions and millions of \nCalifornians \n[[Page S5796]] today who lack affordable and adequate health insurance. \nIn fact, a recent study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research \nshows that there are 6.5 million Californians without health insurance; \n6.5 million people in one State. There are more uninsured children, \nworkers, and families in California than there are residents of my \nState, and my State is one of the top 20 States in population. Almost \n23 percent of the State of California is currently uninsured, well \nabove the national average of over 18 percent.\n  What does this tell us? It tells us that these kinds of liability \nreforms are not that much help to those who are most at risk in our \nhealth care system. And it tells us that suggesting liability reform is \nbeneficial or central to health care consumers is a little bit \nfarfetched.\n  But there is another point I want to make about this amendment. The \nsupporters of this amendment have tried to make the argument that such \nreforms will save many health care dollars and, in the end, will be \nbeneficial to all involved--health care consumers as well as doctors \nand administrators. This is analogous to the arguments put forth by \nsupporters of the underlying legislation, that in the end, the reform \non product liability laws will be of benefit to consumers as well as \nthe manufacturers, who are principally to benefit.\n  But they certainly are not beneficial or fair to the victims of \nnegligence in the health care system. It seems that just about every \nday you pick up a newspaper and there is a story of some horrible \ntragedy that was needlessly caused by negligence, error or even worse. \nOne recent headline in the Washington Post reads: ``Hospital Gave Two \nMen Fatal Overdoses.'' This Associated Press story describes how a \nBoston hospital just recently disclosed an incident in 1991 where two \nskin cancer patients were mistakenly given overdoses of a treatment \ndrug. They were, in fact, given three times the recommended dosages. \nBoth men first lost their hearing, then their livers and kidneys \nfailed. Within weeks, both men were dead.\n  According to this news account, there have been at least 10 \nchemotherapy dosage errors since 1990 in hospitals located in eastern \nMassachusetts. Six of those patients have died.\n  Mr. President, for me, it is the case of Karin Smith that most \nreminds me of the tragedies that often take place in the health care \nsystem and often needlessly.\n  Karin Smith was just 22 years old and an ambitious certified public \naccountant living in my State in Nashotah, WI, when she first went to \nher HMO concerned about some vaginal bleeding she had experienced of \nlate. For 3 years, Karin tried to convince her doctors at her HMO that \nshe was sick. She made 15 office visits and 10 phone calls.\n  At one point, she had bled for 35 straight days before passing out. \nDuring this time, the HMO took three Pap smears and sent them out to a \nclinical laboratory to be analyzed. Unfortunately, the results were \nmisread.\n  How were they misread? It turns out that the director of the \nlaboratory had paid the lab's technician on a piecework basis for \nreading Pap smears. In 1989, the technician had read 31,000 slides for \nthe laboratory in question and another 16,000 slides for a different \nlaboratory. That is a total of 47,000 slides just in 1989. The American \nSociety of Cytology recommends a maximum of 12,000 slides a year for \nthe sake of quality control.\n  So this person had overdone this practice to the detriment, \npotentially, of his or her ability to do the job right four times more \nthan the recommended amount of slides.\n  In 1991, Karin left her HMO and saw a gynecologist outside of that \nplan. Within 2 weeks, her doctor correctly diagnosed Karin as having \nadvanced cervical cancer. Last summer, Karin testified before a Senate \nsubcommittee looking into the health care problems facing our country. \nI would like to read very briefly from the statement Karin gave that \nday, Mr. President. Karin said:\n\n       Although the doctors at my HMO kept telling me I was \n     basically OK, I knew better. My only alternative was to see a \n     gynecologist outside of the plan, who immediately suspected I \n     had cervical cancer. His suspicions were confirmed by a \n     surgeon shortly after our initial visit.\n       Had my cancer been diagnosed at the time the first Pap \n     smear was misread by my HMO, I would have had a 95 percent \n     chance of survival. However, due to their gross incompetence \n     and shameful errors, I am now dying.\n       I am only 28 years old and am told by my doctors that I \n     will probably not live to see my 30th birthday. My cancer has \n     spread through my lymphatic system, from my pelvis to my \n     abdomen, and as of 2 weeks ago to my neck. The fifth \n     vertebrae of my upper spine is so completely infiltrated with \n     cancer that at any moment I may become paralyzed.\n       Since my diagnosis 2\\1/2\\ years ago, my life has been \n     consumed by one horrifying medical procedure after another. I \n     have endured three separate courses of radiation, 6 months of \n     inpatient chemotherapy and seven surgeries. At times, I have \n     laid in a hospital bed, isolated from my family, friends, \n     even my husband, because my immune system was so suppressed \n     that a minor cold could destroy me, or my frail body was \n     riddled with infection, or radioactive materials were \n     implanted into my internal organs and I writhed in pain. . .\n       Although the physical treatment has left me with \n     disfiguring scars from my pelvis to my neck, the emotional \n     scars cut much deeper. I'm so young, yet my career as a CPA \n     is over. . . I'm married to a wonderful man, but I'll never \n     bear his children. . . Our lives have been forever changed by \n     this unnecessary and senseless tragedy.\n       In addition to myself, several other women in the Milwaukee \n     area have been forced to suffer this plight because of the \n     HMO's gross failure to provide safe and competent medical \n     care. One woman died last year, she was only 40. . . Her Pap \n     smear was misread just like mine. Another woman, whose tests \n     were also misread is just waiting to die.\n\n  Those are Karin's remarks. In September 1993, Karin Smith wrote an \nop-ed piece in the Milwaukee Journal on the very issue we are debating \ntoday, tort reform. Karin did some extensive research for this article \nand found that in Wisconsin, between the years 1976 and 1988, just four \nphysicians accounted for nearly 18 percent of losses paid in claims.\n  In short, Karin discovered a trend in Wisconsin that reflected a \nnational pattern, and that pattern is that a few bad actors in the \nhealth care field were causing a plurality of the problems. And instead \nof focusing on appropriate sanctions for these few individuals, we are \ninstead considering limitations on the ability of injured consumers, \nsuch as Karin, to recover damages that will make them whole once again.\n  Mr. President, last year I met Karin Smith in the reception room a \nfew feet from where I am right now. Today, Karin Smith is dead. \nUnfortunately, Karin's fight against her cancer has come to an end. \nKarin Smith passed away in March of this year. She was 29 years old.\n  On April 12, just weeks ago, the district attorney of Milwaukee \nCounty announced that he was filing criminal charges against the \nlaboratory for the deaths of Karin Smith, as well as Dolores Geary, a \n40-year-old mother of three who also was a victim of the laboratory's \nerrors.\n This is believed to be the first time that a medical laboratory as \nopposed to a doctor has been charged with a crime. In this case the \ncrime is reckless homicide.\n\n  Mr. President, I have spoken out today because Karin did everything \nin her power while she was alive to make her story known. She wrote \nletters to the newspaper; she testified before Congress, and she never \nstopped fighting for the rights of victims like herself. Karin Smith \nwas the victim of not mere negligence or error but of reckless behavior \nby a few bad actors in what is otherwise an honorable and very \ndedicated profession.\n  In the Milwaukee Journal Karin wrote:\n\n       It is a common perception that tort reform is strictly a \n     battle between doctors and attorneys. What is painfully \n     ignored is that victims are in the middle of this war. This \n     is ironic, because these are the very people whom the tort \n     system was designed to protect.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not have said it any better. It was designed \nto protect innocent consumers like Karin, the victims of that negligent \nbehavior. Remedies should be available to make injured individuals \nwhole again. It was not designed in order to protect the economic \ninterests of those who are the cause of the injuries.\n  Mr. President, I think it is relevant to briefly comment on how the \nunderlying McConnell amendment would have affected the case of Karin \nSmith. For starters, the McConnell amendment would extend the cap on \npunitive \n[[Page S5797]] damages that is contained in the underlying bill for \nproduct liability cases to cases of medical malpractice. That means \nthat had she not reached a settlement, a Wisconsin State jury would \nhave been prohibited by Federal law from awarding more than $250,000 or \nthree times the economic harm in punitive damages.\n  Mr. President, what are Karin Smith's economic injuries? I am not \nsure, honestly. I do not know what the earnings of a CPA in her early \ntwenties are. I know the parties involved should be punished for their \nactions, and, hopefully, with a strong enough sanction that will send a \nmessage to others in the health care system that such conduct will not \nbe tolerated. In the end, this decision should be made by a jury in \nWisconsin, comprised of everyday Americans, who for over 200 years have \nbeen capable of administering justice in a fair and equitable manner. \nMost importantly, how dare any Member of the U.S. Congress tell a \nWisconsin jury that the appropriate punishment for the taking of Karin \nSmith's life must be no more than $250,000?\n  Where does this Congress get the right to make that decision? That is \nnot all this amendment would do. The extension of the elimination of \njoint liability for noneconomic damages to medical malpractice cases is \nequally mortifying for individuals who find themselves in the same \npredicament Karin Smith found herself in. I cannot even begin to \nimagine, Mr. President, what Karin's noneconomic damages were--her \npain, her suffering. How do you put a price tag or a cap, for that \nmatter, on Karin's inability to bear children and raise a family? How \ndo you quantify the pain and suffering associated with a cancerous \ngrowth that spreads from your pelvis to your neck? I am not sure I \ncould. I do not envy any judge or jury that would be charged with the \nresponsibility of calculating that.\n  But imagine if Karin's case had gone to trial, suppose the lab had \nmisread Karin's test results and the HMO that sent the results to the \nlab were found to be liable in this case; suppose the lab became \ninsolvent and was unable to pay the percentage of noneconomic damages \nthat it was found to be responsible for? What would happen in that case \nunder the underlying amendment? Should we watch out for the best \ninterest of the HMO here and deny Karin her due compensation for the \nincredible degree of pain and suffering she went through? Should we say \nthat the HMO is partly, if not largely, responsible for Karin's injury, \nand they must shoulder the responsibility for making sure that Karin \nand her family are adequately compensated?\n  I think when you ask these questions in terms of the real people \ninvolved, the right answers become quite clear. Karin Smith was right, \nMr. President. This is not really a battle between lawyers and doctors. \nThe medical profession in this country is outstanding and should not be \nmaligned because of the foolish actions of a few in the health care \nsystem. We clearly have a health care crisis in this country. Millions \nand millions are uninsured, costs are skyrocketing, and the health of \nour Nation is being compromised. I strongly urge the supporters of this \namendment to join with those of us who believe that we need \ncomprehensive health care reform, and we need it now. Only that kind of \nreal reform will solve the problems that this amendment claims to \naddress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two items be printed in \nthe Record. The first is a statement that Karin Smith delivered at a \nSenate hearing last year, and the second item is the op-ed piece from \nthe Milwaukee Journal in 1993.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Statement of Karin Smith\n\n       My name is Karin Smith and I am grateful for the \n     opportunity to speak before this subcommittee on an issue \n     that is so crucial to us all. Today, I want to share with you \n     my personal story of how an HMO has cost me my life.\n       I am a member of a staff model HMO called Family Health \n     Plan. It's headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and has \n     105,000 members.\n       I am 28 years old and have advanced cervical cancer, which \n     is the direct result of a three year misdiagnosis by my HMO. \n     For three years, which consisted of 15 office visits and 10 \n     phone calls, I complained about gynecological problems I was \n     experiencing. And even though my medical records were \n     documented with the classic physical characteristics and \n     symptoms of cervical cancer, no doctor at my HMO ever made \n     the correct diagnosis.\n       Because of my continual complaints, the HMO did perform \n     three biopsies and three pap smears. All of which indicated \n     cancer. Yet, all but one were misinterpreted as benign by the \n     lab my HMO had contracted with.\n       During those three years, my symptoms progressed rapidly. . \n     . Minor bleeding became profuse, accompanied by fatigue and \n     passing out. I was frustrated by the medical care I was \n     receiving and I was scared by what appeared to be an obvious \n     deterioration in my condition. Although the doctors at my HMO \n     kept telling me I was basically okay, I knew better. My only \n     alternative was to see a gynecologist outside of the plan, \n     who immediately suspected I had cervical cancer. His \n     suspicions were confirmed by a surgeon shortly after our \n     initial visit.\n       Had my cancer been diagnosed at the time the first pap \n     smear was misread by my HMO, I would have had a 95% chance of \n     survival. However, due to their gross incompetence and \n     shameful errors, I am now dying. I am only 28 years old and \n     am told by my doctors that I will probably not live to see my \n     30th birthday. My cancer has spread, through my lymphatic \n     system, from my pelvis to my abdomen and as of two weeks ago, \n     to my neck. The fifth vertebrae of my upper spine is so \n     completely infiltrated with cancer that at any moment I may \n     become paralyzed.\n       Since my diagnosis two and a half years ago, my life has \n     been consumed by one horrifying medical procedure after \n     another. I have endured three separate courses of radiation, \n     six months of inpatient chemotherapy and seven surgeries. At \n     times I have laid in a hospital bed, isolated from my family, \n     friends, even my husband, because my immune system was so \n     suppressed that a minor cold could destroy me, or my frail \n     body was riddled with infection or radioactive materials were \n     implanted into my internal organs and I writhed in pain.\n       I have spent countless days and nights nauseated and sick \n     from both the radiation and the chemotherapy. The \n     chemotherapy alone, caused me to vomit almost every\n      day for the six months I was in treatment. Every third week \n     I would be admitted into the hospital for six days where \n     drugs that made me so terribly sick would flow through my \n     body. I was bald for nearly a year and all of my \n     activities were severely restricted.\n       Next week, I am scheduled to begin radiation to the left \n     part of my neck and under my left arm. One can only imagine, \n     in fear, what the side effects to this treatment will be . . \n     . And as my last hope, I am currently, awaiting news from my \n     doctors to find out whether or not, I am a candidate for a \n     bone marrow transplant.\n       Although the physical treatment has left me with \n     disfiguring scars from my pelvis to my neck, the emotional \n     scars cut much deeper. I'm so young, yet my career as a CPA \n     is over . . . I'm married to a wonderful man but I'll never \n     bear his children . . . My parents will outlive their \n     youngest child . . . This hasn't only affected me. This has \n     shattered the lives of everyone around me. How does one \n     explain this to my husband, my parents, my sister and \n     brother, my friends . . . All of our lives have been forever \n     changed by this unnecessary and senseless tragedy.\n       At this point, my personal medical future is plagued by \n     this nightmare. Now, I feel I must focus my concern on the \n     medical future of our country. If we allow HMO's to be the \n     foundation of the proposed medical system, we are encouraging \n     one of the most important professions of our country, to put \n     the financial interests of their bottom line before the \n     medical needs of their patients.\n       It was no coincidence that the lab which was contracted by \n     my HMO performed inferior work, the owner was on the HMO's \n     board of directors and in order to retain the HMO's business, \n     he was forced to ``meet or beat'' lab prices from the \n     competition. I think that's what President Clinton now calls \n     ``managed competition . . .'' ALl of the contracts will be \n     negotiated this way.; It's a system that encourages the lab \n     to provide services at artificially low prices, which leads \n     to lack of quality control and excessive work loads.\n       To add insult to injury, the technician who misread all of \n     my pap smears was reading 5 times the federally recommended \n     number of slides. She also worked at, as many as, four other \n     labs in Milwaukee at the same time. And when she was fired \n     from my HMO's contracted lab for falsifying records in 1991, \n     the HMO hired her directly to supervise their new in house \n     gynecological laboratory.\n       In addition to myself, several other women in the Milwaukee \n     area have been forced to suffer this plight because of the \n     HMO's gross failure to provide safe and competent medical \n     care. One woman died last year, she was only 40 . . . her pap \n     smear was misread just like mine. Another woman, who's tests \n     were also misread is just waiting to die.\n       We can't change my future. But I can give you a look into \n     your own. I am an example of what health care in this country \n     will become as proposed by the Clinton administration and it \n     horrifies me. I have experienced, first hand, the \n     overwhelming lack of continuity of care, lack of \n     communication, lack of responsibility, lack of accountability \n     and lack of humanity which are the hallmarks of managed care \n     plans in this country today.\n       We all know that there is a serious health care crisis in \n     this country . . . no one should \n     [[Page S5798]] be denied access to care. We need a realistic, \n     rational health care system that will prevent financially \n     self interested groups from continuing to prey on \n     unsuspecting medical consumers. We need a health care system \n     that allows choice, provides accountability and incorporates \n     a serious medical malpractice prevention program. As a victim \n     of malpractice, I implore you . . . please do not let this \n     administration strip away the rights of victims like me. \n     Please let my HMO experience be your guide . . . Understand \n     that managed care is part of our health care problem . . . It \n     is not the solution.\n                                                                    ____\n\n              [From the Milwaukee Journal, Sept. 15, 1993]\n\n         Tort Reform Isn't Solution To Easing Health Care Woes\n\n                            (By Karin Smith)\n\n       The President's health care proposal is going to be \n     released within the next few weeks. It is well known that \n     tort reform will be included in his package. There is \n     speculation that the proposed plan will limit pain-and-\n     suffering awards for medical malpractice victims to $250,000. \n     This would not only be unconstitutional, but grossly unfair.\n       Let me explain.\n       Five years ago, I was a healthy, 22-year-old woman. Today, \n     I am a victim of both cervical cancer and medical \n     mismanagement. In 1988, I belonged to Family Health Plan \n     (FHP), a Milwaukee-based health maintenance organization. \n     When I began to experience vaginal bleeding, I sought care \n     from FHP.\n       Between June of 1988 and May of 1991, my symptoms gradually \n     progressed from minor bleeding to profuse bleeding, to \n     fatigue and passing out. During this time, I made nearly 20 \n     calls to doctors within my HMO to complain of the problems. \n     Also during this time, three Pap smears and three biopsies \n     were performed.\n       Unfortunately, my cries for help were not heard, and all of \n     my laboratory tests, with the exception of one Pap smear, \n     were misread. When I left FHP in May of 1991 and sought the \n     opinion of a gynecologist outside of that plan, my diagnosis \n     was made within two weeks.\n       Since my diagnosis two years ago, I have undergone five \n     surgeries, three separate two-month courses of radiation and \n     six months of chemotherapy. I was recently informed that \n     unless I have radical surgery this fall to remove a part of \n     my spine and replace it with a piece of my rib, I will \n     probably be paralyzed by spring.\n       Because of the three-year delay in diagnosis, my chance for \n     cure has dropped from 95% to around 10%. Even if I am \n     fortunate enough to survive this tragedy, I will be plagued \n     with chronic health problems and a lifetime of uncertainty.\n       Few would disagree that this is an egregious case that has \n     led to needless emotional and physical pain. Certain \n     legislators and health care specialists believe that my non-\n     economic damages should be limited to $250,000. The state \n     Senate has passed a bill to that effect.\n       According to the Health Care Financing Administration, \n     national health care expenditures total $675 billion. The \n     American Medical Association says doctors pay $5.6 billion in \n     medical insurance premiums. As an accountant, I can easily \n     calculate the cost of malpractice premiums to be less than 1% \n     of all health care expenditures. Even the Congressional \n     Budget Office has said that changing the medical liability \n     system will have little effect on total health spending.\n       Furthermore, several states have already placed caps on \n     pain-and-suffering awards. History has shown this has not \n     reduced malpractice premium expenses. The reality is that \n     very few plaintiffs are awarded high amounts. In Wisconsin, \n     almost 70% of claimants have received no payment at all, and \n     only 85 claims have ever exceeded $200,000.\n       It is important to mention that our country could save an \n     enormous amount of health care dollars by adopting a strict \n     national policy for disciplining doctors.\n       In Wisconsin, between 1976 and 1988, the top 10 physician \n     defendants accounted for 2.4% of the 2,904 claims filed and \n     23% of the total payments made. During this time, four \n     physicians were involved in more than one claim over \n     $400,000. The four physicians accounted for 17.8% of all \n     losses paid in that year. Clearly, a small percentage of \n     doctors is responsible for a large portion of claim dollars.\n       It is common perception that tort reform is strictly a \n     battle between doctors and attorneys. What is painfully \n     ignored is that victims are in the middle of this war. This \n     is ironic, because these are the very people whom the tort \n     system was designed to protect.\n       The issue of capping pain-and-suffering awards comes down \n     to one question: Do we allow all citizens the right to a jury \n     trial at which their peers decide a fair level of \n     compensation for pain and suffering, based on the extent of \n     the individual's damages and the facts?\n       If the answer is no, we are violating the constitutional \n     rights of the most seriously injured victims, while \n     protecting the careers of the most grossly negligent doctors.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

There will be a number of votes starting at 11 o'clock on \nTuesday morning, maybe as many as four or five.\n  So I indicate to my colleagues that I do not believe there will be \nany more votes this evening.

Mr. President, we have reached an agreement on the medical \nmalpractice amendments. It has been cleared by the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle. I will now read the consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all amendments regarding medical \nmalpractice only be in order for the duration of Thursday's session of \nthe Senate and Monday's session of the Senate, except for one amendment \neach, which may be offered by the majority and minority leaders, or \ntheir designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I further ask that any votes ordered on or \nin relation to the pending Thomas amendment, or on or in relation to \nthe Wellstone amendment, and any other second-degree amendments that \nmay be offered to the McConnell amendment occur in sequence at 11 a.m. \non Tuesday, May 2, and that the final vote in sequence be on or in \nrelation to the McConnell amendment No. 603, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. For the information of all Senators, this agreement means \nthat any Senator who wishes to offer an amendment regarding medical \nmalpractice must offer and debate that amendment today and/or Monday, \nand those votes will occur beginning at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, and \nthereafter medical malpractice amendments would no longer be in order \nto the bill except for an amendment that may be offered by each leader \nor their designee. I assume that would be the managers of the bill.\n  So having reached that agreement, I can announce there will be no \nmore votes this evening. The Senate will not be in session tomorrow \nbecause both the Republicans and the Democrats have conferences \ntomorrow.\n  The Senate will come in at noon on Monday, be back on the bill on \nMonday. We may come in at 11 a.m. for morning business. There will be \nno votes on Monday, but we expect a lot of debate on Monday. And then \nrollcall votes will start at 11 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Will the Senate come in on Tuesday and have any time before 11 \no'clock on Tuesday in which Members can speak to their amendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be happy to make that arrangement. In other words, \ncome in at 10:30 and speak for 5 minutes on amendments which we have \nalready discussed. They can offer amendments on Monday.\n  Mr. GORTON. They can offer amendments on Monday. But I suggest to the \nleader that there be at least an hour before 11 o'clock for Members to \nsummarize their amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. We set aside the hour between 10 and 11 to discuss any of \nthe amendments. We try to divide it up so everybody is treated fairly. \nWe may come in at 9:30 for a half hour of morning business.\n  [[Page S5799]] So there will be no more votes tonight. There will be \nno votes tomorrow, and no votes on Monday, except I assume there will \nbe considerable debate on Monday. And then, as suggested by the Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Gorton, there will be an hour set aside before \nthe votes start for discussion of any of the amendments that may be \noffered.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in opposition to \nthe pending product liability reform legislation. I have not been \nvigorous in the debate to this point because there has been so much \nvigor expressed that I thought I would simply wait for a calmer moment.\n  Let me assure all that it gives me no pleasure at all to be in the \nposition of opposition to many of my good Republican colleagues on this \nissue. But I have a number of concerns about this legislation--always \nhave had about this type of legislation--which I will just review \nbriefly which compel me to oppose this measure.\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was a lawyer by trade--\nas was my father, as was my grandfather, his father before him, and my \ntwo sons now; 100 years of Simpsons practicing law in the State of \nWyoming and, in fact, practicing law in the same community in the State \nof Wyoming, Park County and Cody, WY. And so I take great pride in my \nprofession. When I graduated from the University of Wyoming law school, \nI believed that the profession was very reputable, indeed honorable, \nand that it meant something, something ennobling, to be a lawyer.\n  And, indeed, I think there are few professions outside of the law \nwhere one has the opportunity to directly rectify an inequity or \ninjustice. And this is, I feel, the motivation for many of us who \nentered the profession.\n  I remember doing lots of pro bono work. I remember charging 35 bucks \nan hour. I remember doing these things. I was in everything from \nreplevining a one-eyed mule to reorganizing railroads, as the guy said. \nSo I took great pride in the profession.\n  I believe the legislation before us addresses a concern that is very \nreal. There are, indeed--and sadly so--serious abuses and excesses \nwithin the practice of law--the profession I love--as there are in \nevery other profession. And one thing that has clearly worsened the \npublic perceptions of our profession is action by a seemingly ever-\nincreasing number of greedy--and that is the word, greedy, avaricious--\nattorneys who have used the profession solely for their own gain and \nnot for the public gain. Their sole purpose, at least in some that I \nhave observed, is padding their own particular bank accounts.\n  Time and again I hear accounts of attorneys who have charged many \nhundreds of dollars for preparing a simple will when the only thing \nthey did was spend 5 minutes cranking the client's name into a \ncomputer-generated form. And these abuses do indeed occur. And there \nare the attorneys, I am sure, who take the 3-hour lunches and play the \n18 holes of golf every day and still manage to make a million bucks or \nmore during the course of a year.\n  The point I make in citing those examples is to note that one motive \nfor this legislation is to attack irresponsible, costly behavior by \nthose who practice law. But I would argue that this legislation \nspecifically chooses to weed out the results of such ethical \ntransgressions rather than to correct their root causes in the \nirresponsible practice of law. It is for lawyers to clean up their own \nact and to weed from their profession those who soil it and belittle \nit.\n  Assuredly, irresponsibility may lie behind some of the large awards \nthat are given out in product liability suits. But it does not \nnecessarily follow that the solution is to limit punitive damages so as \nto affect even those which may be properly arrived at and properly \ncomputed.\n  Particular concerns I have about such an approach include the \npreemption of State tort law and excluding joint and several liability. \nThe latter measure could conceivably eliminate the only recourse of \nmany citizens against substantial harm to their health, at no real cost \nto the unscrupulous in the legal profession.\n  I believe one of the better results of the November 1994 elections \nhas been to arrest the concentration of power in Washington, and to \nbegin a correction of transferring some of it back to the beleaguered \nStates and localities. And we have done some of that already. Partly \nfor this reason, I oppose any federalizing of the major areas of tort \nlaw. This certainly would expand the scope of Federal Government \nactivity by assuming 10th amendment powers that have been properly \nunder the jurisdiction of the individual States for more than 200 \nyears.\n  We must remember that federalization of tort law would, in my mind, \nseverely limit the local citizenry's ability to influence tort law at \nthe local or State legislative level. Greater proximity to the \nindividual citizen would allow us to make certain that the laws adopted \nare those which best serve the local community's best interest.\n  Federalization also sends the message that we in Congress do not \ntrust the average citizen sitting on a jury to render a fair and \nequitable award. I can assure you I certainly do not agree with every \naward about which I have read and studied. But I just do not believe \nthat the solution lies in taking that power away from the citizenry and \nin having the Federal Government fix the boundaries.\n  I also believe that a statutory limitation on punitive damages will \nremove a very key motivating factor that now forces companies to design \nthe safest products possible. I in no way imply that American companies \nas a rule seek to design unsafe products. That would be absurd. But I \ndo believe it would be very poor policy to fix and to limit the cost of \nsuch irresponsibility right up front in a way that could maybe be \nplanned around.\n  And by that I mean by limiting punitive damages and setting a figure \ncould--could--result in company officials developing liability \nscenarios of what they expect to lose from such suits and to ring it up \non the scorecard. A hypothetical, unscrupulous company could calculate: \n``Well, if we make modification A here in the product, we project only \n500 people a year will be injured, or some killed. That would still \nresult in a 20 percent yearly profit margin, even after paying the \nmaximum punitive damages for every one of these injuries or lost \nlives.''\n  Now, is that a pipe dream? I do not know. Possibly so. I do not know. \nBut it is unseemly to me to facilitate the attachment of dollar values \npotentially to the cost of human lives.\n  As a general principle, I believe it is clear that more often than \nnot prescribing local actions at the Federal level does not work--that \n``one size fits all'' is not a practical approach.\n  Let us not, therefore, repeat the mistakes of other recent \nCongresses, and instead leave alone an area which is traditionally \nunder the purview of the States.\n  So let us address the real root of the problem that is found in the \nlegal profession itself--and there are plenty of them, and, I must say, \nthey are grievous in many cases. But it is not in the legal system's \ninfrastructure. It is in the legal profession itself. And the legal \nprofession evolved as a means of protection for our citizens from its \nbeginning.\n  I hear often the quote from Shakespeare, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' \nWell, there was a reason for that request and that admonition. And that \nwas if they got the lawyers out of the way, they could get on with \ntheir nefarious conduct. You want to reread that one.\n  And that is an interesting part of that remarkable phrase in \nShakespeare: Kill all the lawyers; because they could not get done what \nthey intended to do if the lawyers had been there to protect.\n  So I just wanted to share those things. I am well aware of what is \ngoing to happen to lawyers in this session of the Legislature. I wish \nthere were always the most pristine reasons for that, but one of the \nmost vivid ones in a political body will be simply the fact that the \ntrial lawyers of America \n[[Page S5800]] and affiliates gave $1,626,000 to those of the other \nfaith in the 1994 election and only $101,000 to those of our faith, and \nthey are looking for them, hunting them down.\n  So we have to be a little careful in that atmosphere, I would \nsuggest. Not only did they bet on the wrong horse, they bet everything \nthey had on all of the horses, and they all went backward down the \ntrack. That is a part of this that we want to keep in mind, that in the \nspirit of punishing the trial lawyers who showered forth their worldly \ngoods upon those of the other faith, that we do not react in a way \nwhich is injurious to a profession that has protected us all. We all \nhate lawyers, except we love the one that represents us. Just like \npoliticians, they have a lot of disgust for us, except for those who \nrepresent them.\n  So I want to share those views and indicate my opposition to the \nmeasure, which has been consistent throughout my time here.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 22, insert:\n       In section   15 of the amendment, strike subsection (e) and \n     insert the following new subsection:\n       (e) Limitation on Amount.--\n       (1) In general.--The amount of punitive damages that may be \n     awarded to a claimant in a health care liability action that \n     is subject to this title shall not exceed 2 times the sum \n     of--\n       (A) the amount awarded to the claimant for economic loss; \n     and\n       (B) the amount awarded to the claimant for noneconomic \n     loss.\n       (2) Application by court.--This subsection shall be applied \n     by the court and the application of this subsection shall not \n     be disclosed to the jury.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. This legislation, unlike any \nother we have debated this year, touches each and every one of our \ndaily lives. It touches our society as few bills do. In our homes. In \nour schoolrooms, In our work rooms. And in our hospital rooms.\n  There is a compelling case for product liability reform in this \ncountry, and this bill provides for a positive foundation on which we \ncan build in the future. It may not be the end-all to the liability \nreform debate. And it is not a panacea to the legal labyrinth that \nmillions of Americans have found themselves caught in at some time in \ntheir lives.\n  But it is a critical and long overdue first step in the process.\n  Mr. President, many Americans may ask a very simple question as we \nbegin this debate, and that is this: In this time of downsizing \nGovernment and devolving power back to the States, why do we need \nFederal legislation on product liability?\n  It is a good question that merits a good answer.\n  The problem involves a vast patchwork of product liability laws in 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia that send confusing and often \nconflicting signals to those who make, sell, or use products in the \nUnited States. Moreover, it is the uncertainty of this product \nliability system that creates unnecessary legal costs, impedes \ninterstate commerce, and stifles innovation. And it unnecessarily \nplaces consumers--those we are trying to protect--at risk.\n  Despite recent product liability reforms in various States around the \ncountry, there is still an overriding and strong need for a protective, \nuniform, and all-encompassing Federal product liability law.\n  The problem with State product liability legislation--apart from the \nsimple fact that different States have different rules--is that State \nlegislation cannot capture or control the product liability problem \noutside its own borders.\n  Every suit filed and every judgment rendered has a potential impact \non every other consumer in America by leading to possible changes in \nthe product itself, increasing the item's price, and potentially \naffecting the price and availability of a wide range of other products. \nIn extreme cases, manufacturers may even cease production of some \nproducts.\n  Even States in which product liability lawsuits are infrequent and \njudgments have been deemed appropriate are not immune from the impact \nof disparate State laws. I am proud to say that in my home State of \nMaine, it has been said that our jury verdicts have been reasonable and \nour judges fair. But the effect of the judgment in one State is \nshouldered by the consumers of that product in every other State. \nTherefore, the State of Maine residents pay a premium on every product \nthey buy that has come in from outside the State of Maine--and on every \nproduct they buy from a local company that also distributes outside our \nState's borders.\n  The simple fact is that the residents of Maine are impacted by the \nproduct liability laws of every other State. And just as States cannot \nsingle-handedly address the problems caused by our spiraling national \ndebt, they cannot address the national product liability problem. I \nhave come to the conclusion that a Federal product liability law is the \nonly mechanism to assure that a fair and uniform law will apply evenly \nthroughout the United States.\n  I also recognize the role that uniformity plays in protecting the \ncommon good in certain circumstances. Civil rights laws and many \nenvironmental laws reflect the understanding that serving the common \ngood may be best accomplished by maintaining similar standards across \nState borders. Not every issue affecting both States warrants a Federal \nstandard, but some issues are pervasive enough--significant enough--\nthat we cannot help but recognize the need for some level of agreement.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Commerce Committee, I certainly \nhave stressed the need for balance in this legislation and I offer my \nown personal check-list of the issues this legislation must address so \nthat it is fair and equitable.\n  First, we must allow safe consumer products to be developed to meet \nconsumer needs, and ensure that consumers can seek reasonable \ncompensation when injuries and damages occur.\n  Second, the law must dissuade consumers from filing lawsuits \nfrivolously, without discouraging Americans with substantive complaints \nfrom filing their own suit.\n  Third, a uniform law must encourage companies to police the safety of \ntheir own products, both by offering incentives for excellence in \nsafety and strong punishment when product safety is breached.\n  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, one of our fundamental goals \nmust be to ensure this legislation protects the interests of the \naverage American consumer who makes hefty use of products, but knows \nlittle of their innate safety or risk--much less their rights under the \nlaw.\n  Although I believe the call for product liability reform is \njustified, I certainly understand the concerns of those who testified \nbefore the committee regarding the potential discriminatory impact of \nthis bill--particularly the dual standards created within the cap on \npunitive damages.\n  To understand the issue of a punitive damage cap, I think it is \nvaluable to remember what punitive damages are--and are not. Punitive \ndamages are punishment that serve an invaluable role in deterring \nquasi-criminal behavior by businesses. They have nothing to do with \nproviding compensation to a person who has been harmed and are not \nintended in any way to make the plaintiff whole.\n  That purpose is served by compensatory damages, which provide \nrecovery for both economic damages--which include lost wages and \nmedical expenses--and noneconomic damages, which include pain and \nsuffering and other losses.\n  [[Page S5801]] However, I also understand the concerns of those who \nwould contain runaway juries by capping punitive damages. One of the \noverriding problems in our current system is the absence of any \nconsistent, meaningful standards for determining whether punitive \ndamages should be awarded and--if so--in what amounts.\n  The absence of consistent standards not only leads to widely \ndisparate and runaway punitive awards, but it also affects the \nsettlement process. Individuals and companies that are used often face \na catch-22: pay high legal fees to fight a case through trial, verdict, \nand appeal--or simply settle out of court for any amount less than \nthese anticipated legal fees.\n  Even for the defendant who recognizes the cost of proving innocence \nto be too great, or simply hopes to avoid the lottery nature of a \npossible punitive award--seeking a settlement carries a hidden cost. \nThe lack of a uniform national standard--or simply the existence of \nvague State standards--forces the defendant to include a punitive \npremium in their settlements, even when the likelihood of a punitive \naward is small or even nonexistent.\n  The high reversal rate of punitive damage awards underscores the \nabsence of clear and understandable rules. Moreover, appealing the \ninitial award is extremely costly and unnecessarily wasteful of both \nprivate and judicial resources. Although businesses and related \nentities pay the initial price of punitive awards, the impact of \nrunaway awards is felt by consumers who pay higher prices in goods and \nservices.\n  And health care is not different. Malpractice is an issue that should \nconcern every American because it directly impacts the amount of money \nthey pay for health care and their access to care. A 1993 Lewin-VHI \nstudy estimates that the combined cost of physician and hospital \ndefensive medicine to be as high as $25 billion. And the 1994 Physician \nPayment Review Commission Annual Report to Congress noted a \n``widespread concern that the current functioning of the malpractice \nsystem may promote the practice of defensive medicine and impeded \nefforts to improve the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of \ncare.''\n  Access to quality care was an issue that received a great deal of \nattention--as well it should--over the last 2 years as Congress looked \nat ways to reform our health care system. The cost of malpractice has a \ndirect impact on access to care, especially for women. A 1990 survey \nfound that liability concerns caused 12 percent of doctors to give up \ntheir obstetrical practices, 24 percent to reduce their treatment of \nhigh-risk patients, and 10 percent to reduce their number of \ndeliveries.\n  Concern has been expressed this afternoon during the debate that this \nis a matter that should be left up to the individual States. But the \nAmerican taxpayers from Maine to Oregon have a direct stake in \nmalpractice reform because the U.S. Government--in other words the \nAmerican taxpayer--pays 32 percent of all the health care costs in this \ncountry. They are already paying a heavy price for the patchwork system \nof malpractice laws that currently exist and they deserve our best \neffort to provide a uniform standard that will help bring down the cost \nof health care and help ensure access to providers.\n  As we establish a cap, it is vital that we ensure the measure we \nchoose is fair, uniform, acts as adequate punishment, and serves as an \neffective deterrent. I believe the amendment I have offered \naccomplishes all of these objectives.\n  I should mention that Senator Gorton, the primary sponsor of this \nlegislation, has indicated that he will certainly support my amendment. \nAnd I thank the underlying sponsors, Senator McConnell and Senator \nKassebaum, for their support as well for this amendment.\n  My amendment is fair because it is blind to the socioeconomic \nposition of the plaintiff. The current cap contained in the McConnell \namendment would cap punitive damages at the greater of $250,000 or \nthree times economic damages.\n  Economic damages--again--are the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by \nthe plaintiff, such as their lost wages and medical expenses. Although \nthis measure might serve as adequate punishment and act as an adequate \ndeterrent in many cases, it relies too greatly on the economic position \nof the plaintiff in establishing a sufficient level of punishment.\n  I believe that all plaintiffs--regardless of their income--must be in \na position to levy adequate punishment on those medical providers who \nhave performed a particularly egregious act. We must not allow a \nmedical provider to suffer only a slap on the wrist because his conduct \nharmed an individual of modest means.\n  As a very basic example, assume that two individuals--a truck driver \nwith an annual income of $24,000 and one a corporate executive with an \nannual income of $1.2 million--suffer from similar medical malpractice \ninjuries from two separate defendants and are each hospitalized for 1 \nmonth due to these injuries. Further assume that the medical expenses \nfor these individuals are nearly identical at $100,000--an amount I am \nsure is far too low.\n  Under the three times economic damages formula, the potential \npunitive damage award--or punishment--that could be levied in the suit \ninvolving the millionaire would be up to approximately $600,000. This \nwould be derived by adding the individual's lost income--$100,000--with \nhis or her medical expenses--$100,000--and multiplying by three.\n  Conversely, the defendant in the lawsuit involving the truck driver \ncould only be subjected to punitive damages of up to $306,000--or 51 \npercent that of the millionaire's defendant. This amount is derived by \ntrebling the sum of the plaintiff's lost wages--$2,000--and medical \nexpenses $100,000.\n  Although some would argue that the lower cap imposed in the suit \ninvolving the truck driver may serve as sufficient punishment, I \nbelieve it is fundamentally unfair. If the language of my amendment is \nadopted, the potential punitive award in the suit involving the truck \ndriver will be far more in line with that of the millionaire. By \nincluding noneconomic damages--which are less tangible and include pain \nand suffering and the loss of one's eye, hand, or other faculty--the \ndiscriminatory effect of the cap will also be removed.\n  Continuing with the example already described, let us further assume \nthat the jury award for noneconomic damages caused by the loss of one \nof the plaintiff's eyes is $500,000 for both the millionaire and the \ntruck driver.\n  Using the two times compensatory measure, the possible punitive award \nwould be $1.2 million for the millionaire and $1.004 million for the \ntruck driver. In this way, the possible punitive award that could be \nimposed is nearly identical in both cases as the cap for the truck \ndriver is 84 percent the size of the millionaire's cap.\n  Although hard statistics on this issue are difficult to find, the \n1989 General Accounting Office report on product liability found that \nthere was a strong correlation between the size of punitive awards and \nthe size of compensatory damages. Excluding one extreme case in which \ncompensatory damages far exceeded punitive damages, the punitive \ndamages had a correlation of 0.71 with compensatory damages--which is \njust shy of a one-to-one ratio.\n  Although each of the five States contained in the study had varying \nlevels of correlation, this average demonstrates that a reasonable cap \nbased on compensatory damages can be drafted.\n  The Supreme Court has also expressed its concern with the manner in \nwhich punitive damages have been awarded--and lends credence to the \nargument in favor of a uniform cap. In the case of Pacific Mutual Life \nInsurance Company versus Haslip, the Supreme Court found that a four-\nto-one ratio of compensatory to punitive damages was ``close to the \nline'' of being unconstitutional, and expressed a strong concern that \npunitive damages in the United States have ``run wild.'' Similar \nsentiments were expressed in TXO Production Corp. versus Alliance \nResources Corp., a case involving a commercial land dispute.\n  In both cases, Justices made clear that this was an area for \nreasonable and rational reform. Although no clear standard was \nidentified, I believe the measure of two times compensatory damages \nwould be deemed appropriate by the Supreme Court.\n  [[Page S5802]] Finally, the American College of Trial Lawyers \n[ACTL]--a respected organization of experienced plaintiff and defense \nattorneys--recommended a cap based on a two times compensatory damages \nin their 1989 report on punitive damages.\n  The ACTL report also recommended that the two times compensatory \ndamage cap be combined with a minimum cap of $250,000, but I do not \nbelieve such a measure is advisable or necessary. I believe a single \nmeasure--such as the measure contained in my amendment--is the most \neasily understood and ensures that all relevant cases are subject to \nthe same standard. Multiple measures and standards imply that there is \nan imbalance in the formula being utilized.\n  I believe the measure of two times compensatory damages will work for \neveryone and will subject egregious offenders to strong punishment. \nThis standard is fair and nondiscriminatory. It will apply to all \nlitigants equally--whether you are a man or woman, wealthy or poor, a \nchild or an adult.\n  Mr. President, if we have to include a cap on punitive damages in \nthis legislation, we must ensure it is the best cap possible. So I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to the McConnell \namendment today, and during further consideration of the underlying \nbill next week, because I do intend to offer this very same amendment \nto the underlying legislation as well.\n  I think the legislation, which is named the Product Liability \nFairness Act, must live up to its name and therefore I think that my \namendment will correct this discriminatory impact of punitive damages \nas it is currently drafted in this amendment as well as the underlying \nbill.\n  I believe my amendment is the best alternative available and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the day after the tragic bombing in \nOklahoma City, when it became more evident that the terrorist attack \nwas launched by Americans, President Clinton said he would seek prompt \naction on counterterrorism proposals he had already made, and promised \nto develop additional tools for Federal law enforcement to use.\n  Yesterday evening, the President hosted a meeting of the bipartisan \ncongressional leadership to present his proposals and ask for timely, \nbipartisan consideration and enactment.\n  The President's proposals result from the well-considered experience \nof Federal law enforcement officials. They are designed to provide the \nadditional legal authority Government needs to effectively combat \nterrorism, whether domestic or foreign.\n  These additional authorities will give Federal law enforcement \nagencies tools to combat terrorism more effectively without undermining \nor curtailing the constitutional rights of law-abiding American \ncitizens.\n  Briefly, the proposal would extend the authority the FBI now has in \nnational security cases to access credit reports and financial data for \ncounterterrorism investigations.\n  The same standards as now apply in routine criminal cases would be \nused in counterterrorism cases for the orders that permit the FBI to \nuse pen registers and trap-and-trace devices in investigations. These \ndevices are not wiretaps; they simply capture phone numbers dialed, \nlike a caller ID device that many people use in their own homes.\n  It would require hotel and motel operators and common carriers to \nprovide records to the FBI for national security cases as they now \nroutinely do for State and local law enforcement purposes.\n  It would fully fund the costs of implementing the digital telephony \nlaw, so that the ability of law enforcement to carry out court-\nauthorized electronic surveillance would not be impeded by the shift to \ndigital transmissions.\n  It would add 1,000 additional agents, prosecutors, and other \npersonnel to increase the resources devoted to counterterrorism \ninvestigations, and establish an interagency counterterrorism center \nthat would make sure the information and expertise of all Federal law \nenforcement agencies in this field are properly integrated in \ninvestigations.\n  It includes practical issues such as the requirement that chemical \ntaggants be included in the raw materials from which explosive charges \nare created. This is essential to tracing the sources of such \nexplosions as the one in Oklahoma City in the future.\n  Additionally, the proposal would enhance the penalties for crimes \nrelated to explosives, and directed against Federal employees. The \nproposal has been released by the White House, so all my colleagues \nhave the opportunity to review these proposals in detail.\n  In addition, the President asked that we approve the Omnibus \nCounterterrorism Act of 1995, legislation which is primarily directed \nat foreign terrorists.\n  This package of proposals, along with the existing legislation, are \ncarefully designed to give additional tools to law enforcement without \nweakening in any way the constitutional rights of any American.\n  The President has been particularly clear that we will fight against \nterrorists at home and abroad with all constitutional tools. Anything \nless would give the terrorists the victory over us that they seek: They \nwould have destroyed the fundamental rule of law in our country.\n  As Americans, we all understand that we cannot and must not allow the \ncowardly attack on civilian Federal workers to incite us to such anger \nthat we take shortcuts with American citizens' rights.\n  The President's proposals are sound, moderate, and effective. They \nreflect the advice of practical, hands-on law enforcement agents who \nhave experience in this field. They deserve careful and thorough review \nby the Congress, and they deserve timely enactment.\n  It had been the President's hope, and mine as well, that on this \nmatter, where there is truly broad agreement across partisan lines, the \nCongress could work in a bipartisan fashion to enact this package of \nsecurity enhancements in the not too distant future.\n  I also hoped that we could have a bipartisan, narrowly tailored \npackage of proposals that could be enacted without divisive debates \nover controversial issues of long standing.\n  I believe that the American people expect us to put partisanship and \npolitical advantage aside and respond with unity to the immediate and \nurgent needs of Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  Last night, at the meeting with the President, there was every \nindication that there would be a bipartisan, focused proposal on which \nCongress and the President could agree to move us forward in the effort \nto combat terrorism. Each of us in attendance pledged our support \ntoward that end. Regrettably, today the majority leader introduced a \nbill that threatens to slow our progress and mire the Senate in \ndivisive, partisan, rhetorical debate.\n  Americans know that we can and undoubtedly will debate matters such \nas habeus corpus reform later this year. We have debated the issue in \nvirtually every Congress in the past decade. But that debate involves \npersons who are already incarcerated with no chance for parole and who \nno longer pose a threat to society.\n  I think this is a time when we should instead be concentrating on \nmeasures that will have an effect on those who may be planning an \nattack, and from whom we are not at all safe, as the bombing in \nOklahoma City so dramatically proved last week.\n  I sincerely hope prompt action on these needed law enforcement tools \nwill not be held hostage to political priorities. I believe Americans \nexpect more of us. I know the Federal workers who lost their lives and \ntheir children certainly deserve that and more.\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, Brian Hallen, the Senate Enrolling Clerk, \nwill retire from the Senate effective May 26, 1995, after almost 30 \nyears of Government service. Brian's Government career started in \nJanuary 1966 as a linotype operator at the Government Printing Office. \nHe later became a proofreader and in 1975 was detailed to the Office of \nthe Senate Enrolling Clerk. In December 1981, he became the Senate's \nfirst Assistant Enrolling Clerk, a position he held until March 1986 \nwhen he was promoted to his current position as the Senate Enrolling \nClerk.\n  Brian has dedicated his Senate service to improving the operation of \nthe Enrolling Clerk's office and has gladly and efficiently assisted in \nan ongoing effort to reduce congressional printing costs. During his \ntenure many innovative and cost-saving changes have been implemented. \nAmong his accomplishments was the computerization of the very detailed \nengrossing and enrolling process. This enabled his office to have \ncomplete control over the accuracy and efficiency of the work and a \nsubstantial reduction in the cost and amount of time necessary to \nproduce the printed legislation.\n  Brian is retiring with the satisfaction of knowing that he has done \nhis best. His decisions were made with the best interests of the Senate \nin mind, and because of that mindset the institution itself is a better \nplace.\n  I know all Senators will join me in thanking Brian for his long, \ndedicated, and distinguished service, and extending our best wishes for \na long and healthy retirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today marks the end of the Senate career \nof Brian Hallen, the Senate Enrolling Clerk.\n  Brian began his career of Government service in January 1966 as a \nlinotype operator at the Government Printing Office. Over the years, he \nassumed other positions in the Government and eventually in 1981, \nbecame the Senate's first Assistant Enrolling Clerk.\n  Brian served admirably as Assistant Enrolling Clerk and was promoted \nto the position of Enrolling Clerk in 1986. As the Assistant Enrolling \nClerk and as Enrolling Clerk, Brian has had the Arduous task of \nensuring the accuracy of every provision--sections and titles--of the \nbills enacted by this body.\n  During the appropriations season, I understand that on many \noccasions, prior to the innovations of computerization, Brian could be \nfound in his office burning the midnight oil working diligently on \nappropriations bills--checking and double checking--making sure every \n``t'' was crossed and every ``i'' dotted--to ensure that the product \nthat was delivered to the House or to the White House was an actual \nreflection of the Senate's work.\n  I applaud him for the fine service he has given to this body and to \nhis country. The Senate is a better place because of people such as \nBrian Hallen.\n  As Brian retires after almost 30 years of Government service, I wish \nhim the very best and say ``Thank you'' for your many years of service \nand for your dedication to this institution.\n  I am sure all of my colleagues join with me in saying ``have a long \nand happy retirement,'' and ``Good luck.''\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe considered and agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution appear at the appropriate place \nin the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So, the resolution (S.

Mr. President, by request, for myself and the senior \nSenator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], I introduce, for appropriate \nreference, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe military \npersonnel strength for fiscal year 1996, and for other purposes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of transmittal requesting \nconsideration of the legislation and a section-by-section analysis \nexplaining its purpose be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Department of Defense proposes the \n     enclosed draft of legislation, ``To authorize appropriations \n     for fiscal year 1996 for military activities of the \n     Department of Defense, to prescribe military personnel \n     strengths for fiscal year 1996, and for other purposes.''\n       This legislative proposal is part of the Department of \n     Defense legislative program for the 104th Congress and is \n     needed to carry out \n     [[Page S5806]] the President's budget plans for fiscal year \n     1996. The Office of Management and Budget advises that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this proposal to the \n     Congress and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n       This bill provides management authority for the Department \n     of Defense in fiscal year 1996 and makes several changes to \n     the authorities under which we operate. These changes are \n     designed to permit a more efficient operation of the \n     Department of Defense.\n       Enactment of this legislation is of great importance to the \n     Department of Defense and the Department urges its speedy and \n     favorable consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judith A. Miller.\n                                                                    ____\n\n        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n                          Title I--Procurement\n\n                    Authorization of Appropriations\n\n     Section 101. Army\n     Section 102. Navy and Marine Corps\n     Section 103. Air Force\n     Section 104. Defense-wide activities\n     Section 105. Defense Inspector General\n     Section 106. Chemical demilitarization program\n     Section 107. Defense health program\n       Sections 101 through 107 provide procurement authorization \n     for the Military Departments and for Defense-wide \n     appropriations in amounts equal to the budget authority \n     included in the President's budget for fiscal years 1996 and \n     1997.\n     Section 108. Repeal of requirement for separate budget \n         request for procurement of reserve equipment\n       Section 108 repeals the provisions of section 114(e) of \n     title 10, United States Code, requiring a separate budget \n     request for the procurement of Reserve equipment.\n\n         Title II--Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 provides for the authorization of each of the \n     research, development, test, and evaluation appropriations \n     for the Military Departments and Defense Agencies in amounts \n     equal to the budget authority included in the President's \n     budget for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n\n                  Title III--Operation and Maintenance\n\n              Subtitle A--Authorization of Appropriations\n\n     Section 301. Operation and maintenance funding\n       Section 301 provides for authorization of the operation and \n     maintenance appropriations of the Military Departments and \n     Defense-wide appropriations in amounts equal to the budget \n     authority included in the President's budget for fiscal years \n     1996 and 1997.\n     Section 302. Working capital funds\n       Section 302 authorizes appropriations for the Defense \n     Business Operations Fund and the National Defense Salified \n     Fund in amounts equal to the budget authority included in the \n     President's budget for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n     Section 303. Civilian Marksmanship Program fund\n       Section 303 amends the provisions of section 4308 and 4313 \n     of title 10, United States Code, relating to the Civilian \n     Marksmanship Program, to reflect the President's Budget \n     proposal that the Program be funded exclusively from \n     reimbursements received in the execution of the program.\n     Section 304. Repeal of limitations on activities of Defense \n         Business Operations Fund\n       Section 304 amends section 316(b) of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 to repeal \n     limitations on the activities of the Defense Business \n     Operations Fund\n     Section 305. Amendments relating to the Ready Reserve Force \n         Component of the Ready Reserve Fleet\n       Section 305 amends the provisions of section 2218 of title \n     10, United States Code, relating to the National Defense \n     Sealift Fund, to reflect the funding for the Ready Reserve \n     Component of the Fleet by the Department of Defense as \n     requested in the President's budget.\n\n                     Subtitle B--Reserve Component\n\n     Section 321. Reimbursement of pay and allowances and \n         accountability of Reservists supporting cooperative \n         threat reduction with States of the Former Soviet Union.\n       This section amends section 1206 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, which authorizes \n     funds for the execution of the Cooperative Threat Reduction \n     Act of 1993 (title XII of Public Law 103-160) by adding two \n     new subsections.\n       New subsection (c) would permit funds appropriated to \n     execute programs authorized by the Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction Act to be utilized to reimburse the military \n     personnel appropriations accounts for the pay and allowances \n     paid to reserve component personnel for service while engaged \n     in any program authorized by this Act. The utilization of \n     Reserve component personnel, particularly in expansion of \n     military-to-military and defense contacts, is particularly \n     advantageous.\n       Permitting these funds to be used to reimburse the active \n     military appropriations accounts removes a significant \n     resource impediment to increasing the opportunities for \n     ordering individual reserves to active duty with their \n     consent as specified in section 513 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. A similar provision \n     was passed by the 103rd Congress in section 1316 (a) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 for \n     Military-to-Military Contracts and Comparable Activities.\n       New subsection (d) would exempt members of a reserve \n     component participating in activities or programs specified \n     in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 who served \n     over 180 days from counting against the authorized end \n     strength for members of the armed forces on active duty under \n     section 115(a)(1) of title 10 and against the senior grade \n     strength limitations of sections 517 and 523 of title 10. \n     Approval of this exemption from end strength and senior grade \n     strength limitations removes an impediment to increasing the \n     opportunities for ordering individual reserves to active duty \n     with their consent as specified in section 513 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. A \n     similar provision was passed by the 103rd Congress in section \n     1316 (c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1995 for Military-to-Military Contacts and Comparable \n     Activities.\n       There are no additional costs associated with enacting this \n     legislation.\n     Section 322. Authority for Department of Defense funding for \n         National Guard participation in joint exercises with the \n         Army and Air Force for disaster and emergency assistance\n       This section would authorize the Secretary of the Army and \n     the Secretary of the Air Force to provide for personnel of \n     the National Guard, using funds appropriated for National \n     Guard training exercises, to participate in joint exercises \n     with the Army and Air Force to train for disaster and \n     emergency response, and would thus allow these personnel to \n     participate in such exercises in a Federally paid (title 32) \n     status under state authority.\n       Under current law, Department of Defense funding for the \n     National Guard may not be used for training the National \n     Guard for disaster and emergency response. Funding for this \n     training is the responsibility of the states and FEMA, and \n     such training must be done in a state active duty status. \n     This provision would authorize a limited exception to this \n     allocation of responsibility by permitting use of Department \n     of Defense funds and title 32 status for the Guard when \n     engaged in joint exercises with the Army or Air Force for \n     disaster and emergency response training. Disaster and \n     emergency response training and exercises of the National \n     Guard when not conducted in conjunction with the Army or the \n     Air Force would continue to be a state and FEMA \n     responsibility.\n       This amendment will ensure that National Guard personnel \n     participating in joint exercises with members of the other \n     components of their armed forces are eligible for the same \n     protections and benefits as their counterparts from the Army \n     Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Regular components with whom \n     they are participating. It will also avoid situations where \n     lack of state or FEMA funds preclude participation by Guard \n     units in joint exercises and thereby undermine the efficacy \n     of those exercises.\n\n                       Subtitle C--Other Matters\n     Section 331. Aviation and vessel war risk insurance\n       The purpose of this legislation is to provide a means for \n     rapid payment of claims and the rapid reimbursement of the \n     insurance funds to protect commercial carriers assisting the \n     Executive Branch from catastrophic losses associated with the \n     destruction or damage to aircraft or ships while supporting \n     the national interests of the United States. Allowing the \n     Department of Defense to transfer any and all available funds \n     will allow the United States, in these two vital reinsurance \n     programs, to match standard commercial insurance practice for \n     the timely payment required by financial arrangements common \n     in the transportation industry today. Reporting and the \n     requirements for supplemental appropriations, if any, ensures \n     Congressional oversight at all stages.\n       Subsections (a) and (b) of the proposed legislation set \n     forth the short title and the findings and purposes, \n     respectively.\n       Subsection (c) of the proposed legislation amends section \n     44305 of title 49, United States Code, by adding a new \n     subsection (c).\n       Subsection (c)(1) allows transfer of any funds available to \n     the Department of Defense, regardless of the purpose of those \n     funds. Although other authorities may exist to transfer \n     funds, limitations as to amounts and priorities make these \n     authorities insufficient to rapidly respond to the \n     obligations of the Department of Defense under the current \n     law, especially if contingencies or war-time conditions \n     exist. Proposed language would not distinguish between types \n     of insurance or risk, so long as the Federal Aviation \n     Administration had issued a policy covering the risk. The \n     language would not limit the authority to a specific fiscal \n     year, but would be ongoing without need for reenactment \n     periodically by Congress. Such Congressional oversight is \n     already in place through the reauthorization of the Aviation \n     Insurance Program, next scheduled to take place in 1997.\n       Subsection (c)(2) provides specific time limits with which \n     the Secretary of Defense must pay claims and reimburse the \n     Federal Aviation Administration. Notification to Congress and \n     the 30 day delay before transfer \n     [[Page S5807]] required in other statutes is waived. The most \n     important issue for the air carriers is the replacement of \n     the hull so that they may continue operations, including \n     supporting the requesting agency, without idling crews or \n     having to lay off personnel due to the lack of airframes. A \n     longer time frame is provided for other claims, such as \n     liability to third parties, as normal claims procedures can \n     adequately protect their interests.\n       Subsection (c)(3) requires reports to Congress within 30 \n     days of loss for amounts in excess of one million dollars, \n     with periodic updates to ensure Congress is aware of amounts \n     being transferred and paid out under the chapter 443 program. \n     As supplemental appropriations may be necessary, Congress \n     will have sufficient information on which to base a decision \n     regarding the supplemental appropriations.\n       Subsection (d) of the proposed legislation amends section \n     1205 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, (46 App. U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1285) by adding a new subsection 9c).\n       Subsection (c)(1) authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \n     transfer funds available to the Department to pay claims by \n     contractors, for the damage or loss of vessels and death or \n     injury to personnel, insured pursuant to Title XII of the \n     Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or loss or damage associated \n     therewith. Proposed language would not distinguish between \n     types of insurance or risk, so long as the Maritime \n     Administration had issued a policy covering the risk. The \n     language would not limit the authority to a specific fiscal \n     year, but would be ongoing without need for reenactment \n     periodically by Congress. Such Congressional oversight is \n     already in place through the\n      reauthorization of the Vessel War Risk Insurance Program, \n     next scheduled to take place before the 30 June 1995 \n     expiration (46 App. U.S.C. Sec. 1294).\n       Subsection (c)(2) provides specific time limits within \n     which the Secretary of Defense must reimburse the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       Subsection (c)(3) requires reports to Congress on a \n     periodic basis for claims paid in amounts in excess of one \n     million dollars to ensure Congress is aware of amounts being \n     transferred and paid out under the Title XII program. As \n     supplemental appropriations may be necessary, Congress will \n     have sufficient information on which to base a decision \n     regarding the supplemental appropriations.\n       The addition of subsection (c) to section 44305 of title \n     49, United States Code, and subsection (c) to section 1205 of \n     the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, (46 App. U.S.C. Sec. 1285) \n     would allow the Department of Defense to rapidly pay claims \n     resulting from damages or injuries caused by risks covered by \n     the respective programs as a consequence of providing \n     transportation to the United States when commercial insurance \n     companies refuse to cover such risks on reasonable terms and \n     conditions. The requirement to reimburse the Federal Aviation \n     Administration or the Maritime Administration already exists; \n     however, the only method for payment currently available may \n     involve requesting supplemental appropriations from Congress. \n     Such a process historically has taken six months or longer. \n     Many air carriers have indicated their financial obligations \n     may not allow them to continue to support the United States \n     if rapid payment for losses cannot be made. Commercial \n     aircraft insurance policies and practice require payment in \n     less than 30 days when cause is not an issue, usually within \n     72 hours.\n       If enacted, this legislation would not result in an \n     increase in the budgetary requirements of the Department of \n     Defense.\n     Section 332. Testing of theater missile defense interceptors\n       The purpose of this legislation is to eliminate the \n     requirement to attempt complex, multi-shot-engagement \n     scenarios\n      with relatively immature Engineering Manufacturing \n     Development hardware when these same scenarios must be \n     performed with production-representative hardware during \n     the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT) phase.\n       The requirement to demonstrate interceptor performance \n     under operationally realistic conditions with production-\n     representative hardware already exists. The premature \n     duplication of this testing will only add greater technical \n     complexity, cost, and risk to the program and provide little \n     if any technical value.\n       Theater Missile Defense (TMD) interceptor performance will \n     be performed during the Initial Operational Test and \n     Evaluation (IOT) phase and results reported to Congress \n     prior to the system being allowed to enter production. The \n     Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense, will prepare and submit a Beyond Low-\n     Rate Initial Production Report. This report will confirm that \n     adequate testing, including multi-shot scenarios, has been \n     completed. This testing must be conducted in operational \n     environments and scenarios, consistent with conditions that \n     the interceptor will be expected to operate in when fielded.\n     Section 333. Authority to assign overseas school personnel to \n         domestic schools and vice versa\n       This section would authorize the Secretary of Defense to \n     assign personnel of either the school system established \n     under section 2164 of title 10 or the school system \n     established by the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1968 \n     (title XIV of the Education Amendments of 1978; 20 U.S.C. 921 \n     et seq.) to provide administrative, logistical, personnel, \n     and other support services to the other system, either in \n     addition to, or in place of, their normal duties. Such \n     assignments may be for the period prescribed by the \n     Secretary.\n     Section 334. Authorization for expenditure of O and \n         procurement funds for the accelerated architecture \n         acquisition initiative\n       This section amends title 10 by adding a new section 2395a \n     the purpose of which is to allow the Central Imagery Office \n     (CIO), as a Combat Support Agency, to expend currently-\n     programmed\n      O and Procurement funds to establish, implement, and \n     deploy a worldwide imagery architecture. Having \n     flexibility to use these funds will provide the Central \n     Imagery Office the ability to meet changing imagery \n     requirements, ensure readiness, and provide timely support \n     to military operations.\n       In the past, numerous studies and evaluations have \n     indicated that the United States imagery system was unable to \n     provide required imagery support in a timely manner. The \n     experience of Desert Shield/Desert Storm reinforced those \n     evaluations. The Central Imagery Office was created and \n     assigned responsibility for enhancing the ability of the \n     military departments, Unified Commands, their components, \n     Joint Task Forces, tactical units, and other activities to \n     make use of all imagery assets in a timely manner. The \n     Accelerated Architecture Acquisition Initiative is a key \n     program through which the Central Imagery Office will develop \n     and field systems to provide real-time access to and \n     dissemination from existing and planned imagery collection \n     systems (national and theater) to defend and national users \n     worldwide, real-time access to distributed digital imagery \n     and imagery-product archives, and enhancements to and \n     increases in the capacity of existing Department of Defense \n     data networks to accommodate increased requirements from the \n     imagery assets.\n       Critical to the success of the Accelerated Architecture \n     Acquisition Initiative is centralized management and \n     oversight to balance requirements to ensure successful \n     development, procurement, and development of necessary \n     hardware, software, communications, and services. Central \n     Imagery Office must ensure the standardization, \n     compatibility, and interoperability of equipment and \n     processes to provide a worldwide system for required, timely \n     imagery support. A key element the Accelerated Architecture \n     Acquisition Initiative is the near-term provision to JCS-\n     selected users of that equipment necessary to receive and use \n     digital imagery products.\n       The Central Imagery Office's proposal provides the express \n     language needed in the 1996 Appropriations Act for authority \n     to purchase and deploy hardware, software, and \n     communications, using Central Imagery Office funds, for \n     activities funded in the Department of Defense-funded portion \n     of the NFIP. Without this special provision, 31 U.S.C. \n     section 1301A would prevent the Central Imagery Office from \n     using funds appropriated to it in the\n      defense-wide appropriation in this manner. The Central \n     Imagery Office will be unable to carry out its intended \n     emission to deliver Accelerated Architecture Acquisition \n     Initiative capabilities to the organizations that require \n     them and to establish successfully the Accelerated \n     Architecture Acquisition Initiative architecture \n     worldwide. This legislation will allow for an efficient \n     and highly flexible way for the Central Imagery Office to \n     deploy needed capabilities during crisis and emergencies, \n     to meet changing imagery requirements, ensure readiness, \n     and provide timely support to military operations.\n       Enactment of this proposal will not increase the budgetary \n     requirement of the Department of Defense.\n     Section 335. Establishment of a Department of Defense \n         Laboratory Revitalization Demonstration Program\n       The authority would establish a test program to allow the \n     heads of selected defense laboratories greater flexibility to \n     undertake facilities modernization without the requirement to \n     seek approval from higher levels. The purpose of the program \n     is to reduce the amount of time required to upgrade research \n     and development capabilities at Department of Defense \n     laboratories. The provision would recognize that facilities \n     construction in support of research and development is \n     historically more expensive than similar-sized projects in \n     other construction categories. For test program laboratories, \n     the provision would raise the threshold from $1.5 million to \n     $3.0 million for minor military construction projects that \n     the Secretary of Defense may carry out without specific \n     authorization in law. The provision would also raise the \n     threshold for minor military construction projects requiring \n     prior Secretary of Defense approval from $500,000 to $1.5 \n     million. Finally, the provision would raise for selected \n     laboratories the threshold from $300,000 to $1.0 million for \n     the value of any unspecified military construction project \n     for which operation and maintenance funds may be used.\n       The test authority would expire on September 30, 2000. It \n     would also require the Secretary of Defense to designate \n     participating laboratories before the test may begin and to \n     report to Congress on the lessons learned from the test \n     program one year before it is terminated.\n       Subsection (a). A healthy and responsive defense laboratory \n     system is essential to the \n     [[Page S5808]] national defense and security, and to foster \n     the growth and development of new technologies having both \n     military and civilian applications. A strong and flexible \n     defense laboratory system, staffed by top quality scientists, \n     technicians, and engineers, with state-of-the-art equipment \n     and facilities is critical to meeting new and changing world \n     threats, as well as maintaining America's technological \n     military leadership.\n       The ability of defense laboratories to rapidly introduce \n     technological innovation into military systems, and to \n     respond to technological exigencies has been significantly \n     degraded by requirements that the laboratories conduct their \n     facilities modernization functions under a set of complex and \n     time consuming procedures inappropriate to laboratory \n     operations. The inability of our laboratories and centers to \n     modernize antiquated facilities in a prompt fashion has \n     resulted in an ineffective and inefficient use of tax \n     dollars.\n       The Secretary of Defense has determined that many of the \n     problems in the defense laboratory system stem from the \n     application of procedures and processes to the laboratories \n     that are inappropriate to the research and development \n     community. The Secretary anticipates that the elimination of \n     certain unnecessary and cumbersome restrictions would result \n     in much more efficient and effective laboratories. The \n     Secretary has already selected laboratories from each of the \n     military departments to participate in a demonstration \n     program to substantiate the hypothesis. Currently, internal \n     procedures and regulations are being updated, streamlined, or \n     abolished for the purpose of the demonstration program. This \n     proposal is intended to make those legislative changes \n     identified by the Secretary of Defense as necessary to \n     partially implement the Demonstration Program.\n       In implementing any authorizations in this Act that are \n     waivers or exceptions to existing law or laws, the Secretary \n     will assure that the basic purposes and interests of the \n     original laws will be carried out and protected in a manner \n     most appropriate to the research and development community.\n       The Secretary will review and evaluate the findings of the \n     demonstration program, and make appropriate recommendations \n     as to\n      the applicability of legislative changes to all Department \n     of Defense laboratories.\n       Subsection (b). This section is aimed at improving the \n     research and development facility based by enhancing the \n     process for upgrading the facilities including built-in \n     equipment necessary for performing state-of-the-art research \n     and development.\n       The inherently complex nature of conducting modern research \n     requires facilities, equipment and support infrastructure \n     that are simply more expensive, on a unit basis, than other \n     types of military support activity. For example, \n     representative examples of minor facilities construction \n     obtained from each of the three Services from their fiscal \n     year 1993 minor military construction (MILCON) requests, show \n     laboratory construction, expansion or reconfiguration \n     costing, on a square foot basis, about three times what a \n     similarly sized office building cost.\n       Aside from meeting and responding to military crises such \n     as Desert Storm, the very nature of the experimental process \n     requires a rapid response to a scientific discovery. Often \n     significant new information can be acquired by building on an \n     existing experiment if that ``add on'' experiment can be put \n     in place in a coherent fashion. Time is of the essence if \n     experimental opportunities are to be maximized and \n     efficiently exploited.\n       Operating and maintaining a government owned research and \n     development facility base is in the best interests of the \n     nation for the following reasons;\n       The Department of Defense research and development \n     operations perform research and development activities \n     quickly in response to operational needs. Examples of \n     government scientists involved in the Desert Storm operation \n     attest to the efficacy of the Department of Defense \n     laboratory programs. Having Federal employees dedicated to \n     defense research and development assists in assuring accurate \n     communications and continuity of research and development \n     assistance.\n       The cadre of government scientists with contemporary\n        facilities assures that government managers have \n     knowledgeable unbiased advisors on research and \n     development, i.e., the ``smart buyer'' model. To stay \n     current, scientists must not only continue their academic \n     education, but need to be actively involved in \n     contemporary research and development.\n       There are certain types of research and development that \n     the government needs to maintain, due to their sensitive \n     nature. Specific examples include chemical and biological \n     agents, and nuclear effects.\n       There are some types of research and development that are \n     not accomplished in private institutions, but are necessary \n     for military operations. Specific examples include fuzing, \n     communications network defense, special sensors, special \n     military related medical research, and night vision \n     equipment.\n       There are certain types of generic research in exotic or \n     speculative areas which may have significant future military \n     impact. Our laboratories, at least on a limited and selective \n     basis, must have the ability to promptly pursue such research \n     as opportunity dictates.\n       Subsection (b)(1). Sections 2805 (a) and (b) (1) of title \n     10 were established under Public Law 97-214 and were \n     effective October 1, 1982. This provision is available to the \n     agency to perform minor construction which was not specified \n     in the Military Construction requests. The dollar limitations \n     contained in 2805 (a) and (b) of title 10 were last revised \n     in 1991.\n       The construction of laboratory and supporting facilities in \n     direct support of state-of-the-art research and development \n     historically is more expensive than similar sized projects in \n     other construction categories. Specifically, there are unique \n     safety, security, and operational requirements which \n     inherently increase the cost for laboratory facilities. \n     Increasing the limit of unspecified minor military \n     construction to $3,000,000 for facilities in support of \n     research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT) would \n     allow the head of the laboratory the same relative latitude \n     as the commander of other military programs.\n       Subsection (b)(2). The provisions contained in section \n     2805(b)(2) were intended to insure proper Congressional \n     control and oversight of the minor military construction \n     flexibility granted to the Service Secretaries. While the \n     provisions of this Bill would modify the dollar threshold \n     level at which such notification to the Congress would be \n     required for this demonstration program, an effective \n     evaluation of this demonstration program does require an \n     appropriate reporting function. Consequently the Department \n     of Defense, through already existing internal mechanisms, \n     intends to identify the scope, nature and dollar amount of \n     the use of this authority. The Services will report to the \n     Director of the Defense Research and Engineering at the end \n     of each fiscal year on how this authority was utilized \n     describing dollar amounts, sources of funds and projects \n     undertaken. This data could be made available to the Congress \n     as part of the evaluation of the program.\n       Subsection (b)(3). The current provision found at section \n     2805(c)(1) setting a limit of $300,000 operation and \n     maintenance funds for minor modifications and construction is \n     appropriate for typical government office buildings, such as \n     establishing walls and electrical outlets for an office. \n     However, this dollar amount has been unduly restrictive for \n     accomplishing laboratory modifications. To establish a state-\n     of-the-art research and development environment, there are \n     often special needs such as special ``clean room'' \n     requirements, and special plumbing or ventilation \n     requirements for safety equipment that cannot be met for \n     $300,000. Raising the amount to $1,000,000 would allow the \n     type of minor work available to most Commands but precluded \n     to most Heads of Laboratories.\n       Subsection (c). It is the intention of the legislation to \n     conduct an experiment to determine the effectiveness and \n     benefits of granting this authority. Consequently, some \n     baseline participation must be established for comparative \n     purposes to permit effective evaluation of the program.\n       Subsection (d). The Department intends to document the \n     performance and results of this program in order to \n     effectively recommend to the Congress whether and with what \n     changes this initiative should be made permanent.\n       Subsection (e). This section is included to assure that the\n        language of this Act does not limit any existing authority \n     that may have been granted to one or more of the \n     laboratories under this Program.\n       Subsection (f). This section provides the definitions \n     common to this Act.\n       Subsection (g). This section is included to insure that \n     appropriate recommendations are made to the Congress.\n     Section 336. Repeal of certain depot-level maintenance \n         provisions\n       This section repeals sections 2466 and 2469 of chapter 146, \n     title 10, United States Code. These sections impose \n     limitations on the amount of depot-level maintenance of \n     materiel that can be performed by non-federal government \n     employees and place restrictions on changing the performance \n     of maintenance workloads currently performed in depot level \n     activities of the Department of Defense to other depots and \n     to private industry.\n       Section 2466 provides that not more than 40 percent of the \n     funds made available in a Fiscal Year to a military \n     department or a Defense Agency, for depot-level maintenance \n     and repair workload may be used to contract for performance \n     by non-Federal Government personnel of such workload for the \n     military department or the Defense Agency. Repeal of Section \n     2466 will provide the Department of Defense and the military \n     departments the needed flexibility to accomplish more than 40 \n     percent of their depot maintenance workload by non-Federal \n     Government employees when needed to achieve the best balance \n     between the public and private sectors of the Defense \n     industrial base. The repeal of Section 2466 will not increase \n     the budgetary requirements of the Department of Defense.\n       Section 2469 prohibits the Secretary of Defense or the \n     Secretary of a Military Department from changing the \n     performance of a depot-level maintenance workload that has a \n     value of not less than $3,000,000 and is being performed by a \n     depot-level activity of the Department of Defense unless, \n     prior to any such change, the Secretary uses competitive \n     procedures to make the change. The Department has suspended \n     cost competitions for depot maintenance workloads because the \n     data and cost accounting\n      systems of the Department are not capable of determining \n     actual costs for accomplishing specific depot \n     [[Page S5809]] maintenance workloads in the depots. Repeal of \n     Section 2469 will permit the Department of Defense and the \n     military departments to shift workloads from one depot to \n     another or to private industry as required to resize the \n     depot maintenance infrastructure to support a smaller force \n     structure. The repeal of section 2469 will not increase the \n     budgetary requirements of the Department of Defense.\n       This legislation will enable the Department to structure \n     its organic Defense depot maintenance activities consistent \n     with satisfying core logistics capability requirements that \n     are based on providing effective support for national defense \n     contingency situations and other emergencies.\n       The proposed repeal of sections 2466 and 2469 will permit \n     the Department of Defense to accomplish depot maintenance for \n     weapon systems and equipment in the most cost effective and \n     efficient manner. The Department is establishing core depot \n     maintenance centers of excellence to retain the best quality \n     products and services to support its combat forces. The \n     Department's core depot maintenance concept promotes sharing \n     of workload between Defense depots and private industry to \n     accommodate teaming efforts and supports the best application \n     of modern technology for accomplishing depot maintenance.\n       The repeal of sections 2466 and 2469 will allow the \n     Department to shift workloads from current depots to other \n     Defense depots and to compete workloads in the private sector \n     to achieve the lowest costs and best efficiency in support of \n     the core depot maintenance concept. It will also enable the \n     Department to size its depot maintenance infrastructure to \n     best support emergency and contingency scenarios with the \n     required levels of weapon systems readiness.\n       The enactment of this proposal will not increase the \n     budgetary requirements of the Department of Defense.\n\n              Title IV--Military Personnel Authorizations\n\n                       Subtitle A--Active Forces\n\n     Section 401. End strengths for Active Forces\n       Section 401 prescribes the personnel strengths for the \n     Active Forces in the numbers provided for by the budget \n     authority and appropriations requested for the Department of \n     Defense in the President's budget for fiscal years 1996 and \n     1997.\n\n                       Subtitle B--Reserve Forces\n\n     Section 411. End strengths for Selected Reserve\n       Section 411 prescribes the strengths for the selected \n     Reserve of each reserve component of the Armed Forces in the \n     numbers provided for by the budget authority and \n     appropriations requested for the Department of Defense in the \n     President's budget for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n     Section 412. End strengths for Reserves on active duty in \n         support of the Reserves\n       Section 412 prescribes the end strengths for reserve \n     component members on full-time active duty or full-time \n     National Guard duty for the purpose of administering the \n     reserve forces.\n\n              Subtitle C--Military Training Student Loads\n\n     Section 421. Authorization of training student loads\n       Section 421 provides for the average military training \n     student loads in the numbers provided for this purpose in the \n     President's amended budget for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n\n                   Title V--Military Personnel Policy\n\n                  Subtitle A--Officer Personnel Policy\n\n     Section 501. Equalization of accrual of service credit for \n         officers and enlisted members of the Armed Forces\n       Subsection (a) amends section 972 of title 10 by combining \n     and redrafting paragraphs (3) and (4) and by replacing \n     ``liable'' with ``required''. These changes are intended to \n     clarify the provision and do not make substantive change to \n     the current law. Section 972 states that enlisted members \n     must make up lost\n      under certain circumstances before that time can be counted \n     toward service for retirement.\n       Subsection (b) amends title 10 by adding a new section \n     972a. The purpose of this new section is to prevent accrual \n     of service credit to an officer of the armed forces under the \n     following circumstances: (1) while in a deserter status; (2) \n     while absent from duty, station, or organization for more \n     than one day without proper authority; (3) while confined by \n     military or civilian authorities for more than one day \n     before, during or after trial; or (4) while unable for more \n     than one day to perform duties because of intemperate use of \n     drugs or alcoholic liquor, or because of disease or injury \n     resulting from an officer's misconduct. These circumstances \n     are the same as those under which an enlisted member is \n     required to make up time lost under section 972 of title 10. \n     Such time would not count in computing the officer's length \n     of service for any purpose except the computation of basic \n     pay under section 205 of title 37, including, but not limited \n     to, voluntary retirement for length of service under chapters \n     367, 571, or 867 of title 10.\n       Sections 3925 and 8925 of title 10 address computation of \n     years of service for voluntary retirement by regular enlisted \n     members of the Army and the Air Force, subject to the \n     provisions of section 972. As noted above, section 972 states \n     that enlisted members must make up time lost under certain \n     circumstances before that time can be counted toward service \n     for retirement. This made-up time ensures that the Army and \n     the Air Force receive a full commitment based on an \n     enlistment or induction contract. Comparable provisions \n     relating to the Navy in chapter 571 of title 10, do not \n     reference section 972 and do not have a provision comparable \n     to sections 3925 and 8925.\n       Sections 3929 and 8926 of title 10 address computation of \n     years of service for voluntary retirement by regular and \n     reserve commissioned officers of the Army and the Air Force. \n     Comparable provisions relating to the Navy in chapter 571 of \n     title 10, do not have a provision comparable to sections 3929 \n     and 8926. Presently, there are no limitations placed on \n     officers for actions similar to those in section 972. \n     Officers continue to receive service credit towards \n     retirement eligibility, higher longevity pay, and increased \n     multiplier for retired pay purposes.\n      At the same time, highly-qualified officers selected for \n     early retirement cannot be extended past their mandatory \n     retirement date to reach a pay increase point. This \n     proposal will rectify these inequities.\n       Subsections (c) and (e) amend sections 3926 and 8926 of \n     title 10 to make reference to new section 972a in the same \n     fashion that section 972 is referenced in sections 3925 and \n     8925 of title 10. Subsection (d) amends title 10 by adding a \n     new section 6328 in chapter 571 to make reference to both \n     sections 972 and 972a.\n       The enactment of this proposal will not increase the \n     budgetary requirements of the Department of Defense.\n     Section 502. Changes in general officer billet titles \n         resulting from the reorganization of headquarters, Marine \n         Corps\n       The purpose of this legislation is to replace the current \n     Sections 5041(b), 5044 and 5045 of Chapter 506 of title 10, \n     United States Code, with language to reflect reorganization \n     of Headquarters Marine Corps to more efficiently support the \n     Commandant in his two roles as a member of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff and as a Service Chief.\n       Based on a Headquarters Marine Corps Reorganization Study, \n     proposed changes were recommended to establish a viable \n     organization that incorporates coherent, timely and forceful \n     resource management and advocacy; General Officer \n     efficiencies; and the ability to respond rapidly to emerging \n     issues in a coordinated and comprehensive method.\n       The following changes in general officer billet titles were \n     proposed to more efficiently accomplish support to the \n     Commandant:\n       The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps to Vice \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps;\n       Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Marine Corps to Deputy \n     Commandants of the Marine Corps;\n       Assistant Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Marine Corps to \n     Assistant Deputy Commandants of the Marine Corps;\n       Assistant Chiefs of Staff of the Marine Corps to Assistant \n     Commandants of the Marine Corps.\n       This proposal will be effected at no cost to the Department \n     of Defense or the Department of the Navy\n     Section 503. Increase in the transition period for officers \n         selected for early retirement\n       Paragraphs (1) of subsections (a) and (b) would amend \n     sections 581 and 638 of title 10, United States Code, to \n     extend the transition period for officers selected for early \n     retirement by three months. Under subsections 581(b) and \n     638(b)(1)(A) of title 10, an officer must be retired ``not \n     later than the first day of the seventh calendar month \n     beginning after the month in which the Secretary concerned \n     approves the report of the board which recommended the \n     officer for early retirement.'' Subsections (a) and (b) of \n     this proposal would require officers selected for early \n     retirement to be retired not later than the first day of the \n     tenth calendar month beginning after the month in which the \n     Secretary concerned approves the report of the board which \n     recommended the officer for early retirement.\n       Paragraphs (2) of subsections (a) and (b) would authorize \n     the Secretary concerned to defer the retirement of an officer \n     otherwise approved for early retirement under section 581, \n     638 or 638a of title 10 for not more than 90 days, in order \n     to prevent a personal hardship for the officer or for other \n     humanitarian reasons.\n       Subsection (c) would exclude from counting for the purpose \n     of determining authorized end strength under section 115 of \n     title 10, those officers selected for early retirement whose \n     mandatory retirement date has been deferred, for up to 90 \n     days, by the Service Secretary for reason of personal \n     hardship or other humanitarian reasons.\n       Under current law, officers selected for early retirement \n     have six months and some fraction of a seventh month to \n     prepare for an involuntary transition to civilian life. In \n     most cases,\n      these officers have career expectations which are limited \n     only by statutory restrictions on years of commissioned \n     service and, therefore, are not prepared to make this \n     sudden, unwanted transition. Many of the officers selected \n     for early retirement must seek and attain post-military \n     service employment, move families to retirement locations, \n     meet current financial obligations such as mortgage \n     payments and college tuition costs for older children and \n     work around secondary and elementary education school \n     schedules for younger children.\n       Compressing these major events into a six month period is \n     difficult, particularly if the officer is deployed or \n     stationed overseas. Extending the transition period by three \n     months would not only permit officers selected for early \n     retirement to plan a more \n     [[Page S5810]] orderly transition to civilian life while \n     still performing in their military positions, but would also \n     provide the Services more time in which to identify and \n     detail reliefs for these officers while still meeting fiscal \n     year officer end strength requirements.\n       This proposal to increase the transition period for \n     officers selected for early retirement by three months is a \n     modest, but necessary change which will positively affect one \n     of the military's most negative personnel reduction \n     processes. While this change will not eliminate an officer's \n     shock of being forcibly retired early from a Service, it will \n     soften the impact for affected officers and their families \n     who have dedicated 20 or more years of faithful and \n     professional military service to the United States.\n       There is no cost associated with this proposal. Selective \n     Early Retirement Boards could be convened three months \n     earlier to offset any net increase in total pay and \n     allowances expended as a result of the three month extension \n     in the transition period.\n     Section 504. Revision in the authorized strength limitations \n         for Air Force commissioned officers on active duty in the \n         grade of major\n       This section would authorize the Secretary of the Air Force \n     to raise temporarily the ceiling on the number of majors on \n     active duty in the Air Force by 1,100. Such statutory \n     authority\n      would allow the Air Force to accelerate promotion timing to \n     meet congressional intent as expressed through the Defense \n     Officer Personnel Management Act. This proposal will not \n     increase the total number of commissioned officers \n     authorized by the Air Force and will not impede planned \n     reductions in the officer force.\n     Section 505. Revision in the authorized strength limitations \n         for Navy commissioned officers on active duty in grades \n         of lieutenant commander, commander, and captain\n       This section temporarily and uniformly raises the ceilings \n     on the numbers of lieutenant commanders, commanders and \n     captains on active duty in Navy by 910, 722 and 300, \n     respectively. This temporary increase in ceilings is \n     necessary to provide sufficient grade authorizations to \n     maintain Unrestricted and Nurse promotion flow and \n     opportunity within Defense Officer Personnel Management Act \n     (DOPMA) guidelines. This temporary authority would expire on \n     the 30th of September, 1997, by which time Navy post-draw \n     down officer requirements and end strength will have \n     stabilized, and a more precise determination of permanent \n     grade table relief requirements can be made. For the long \n     term, Navy requires permanent grade table relief to maintain \n     officer career progression within Defense Officer Personnel \n     Management Act guidelines. Navy will pursue this permanent \n     relief as part of a joint Service effort coordinated by the \n     Department of Defense.\n       Navy's Unrestricted Line O-4 flow point will exceed the \n     Defense Officer Personnel Management Act guideline of 11 \n     years in fiscal year 1999, and peak at 13 years and 6 months \n     in fiscal year 2003, despite the use of forced attrition \n     programs to control this increase. As the significant career \n     milestone of promotion to O-4 slips further off into the \n     future, Navy will find it increasingly more difficult to \n     attract high-caliber officers and retain its best junior \n     officers, particularly in the current climate of declining \n     strength, increased forced attrition and reduced retirement \n     benefits.\n       To provide Nurse Corps officers with comparable promotion \n     opportunity and, Navy has had to provide substantial internal \n     compensation to the Nurse Corps. Without this \n     ``compensation'' Nurse Corps promotion opportunity and timing \n     would remain outside of the Defense Officer Personnel \n     Management Act promotion system\n      guidelines indefinitely at the grades of commander and \n     captain. In the current environment of declining strength \n     this compensation is becoming increasingly more difficult \n     to provide.\n       The proposed temporary change to the grade table will \n     provide sufficient grade relief to maintain Unrestricted Line \n     and Nurse Corps promotion opportunity and timing within \n     Defense Officer Personnel Management Act guidelines and \n     ensure Navy's ability to attract and retain the high-caliber \n     officers it requires.\n       The approximate cost to implement this initiative is \n     estimated as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year 1996: 00.00; \n     Fiscal Year 1997: 10.00.\n       These amounts have not been included in any estimates for \n     appropriations submitted through budget channels by the \n     Department of Defense.\n     Section 506. Authorization of general or flag officer \n         promotion zones\n       This section amends section 645 of title 10 to clarify the \n     definitions of promotion zones which are applicable to \n     Chapter 36 of title 10. The modified definitions will not \n     require executive level officers (grades 0-6 and above) to be \n     placed in a promotion eligibility category (above the zone) \n     for officers who have failed of selection for promotion. \n     Executive level officers become eligible to be selected for \n     promotion when they have one year service in grade, and \n     remain eligible unless selected for promotion or retired.\n       In part, the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act \n     (DOPMA) was enacted to make uniform the provisions of law \n     relating to promotion of regular commissioned officers of the \n     Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The Defense Officer \n     Personnel Management Act was, however, enacted primarily for \n     the purpose of field grade officer management.\n       At the time of the Defense Officer Personnel Management \n     Act's enactment, it was apparent that executive level \n     officers\n      were not intended to be subject to all of the provisions of \n     the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. The House of \n     Representatives Report of the Committee on Armed Services \n     which accompanied Senate bill 1918 states ``this category \n     of executives is in many ways unique and can and should be \n     managed accordingly. The small numbers involved permit \n     this, and the importance of the resource demands this.'' \n     The House report further states that ``the concept of \n     failing selection for promotion does not apply when \n     officers are not selected for promotion to the flag and \n     general officer grades.''\n       Given that executive level officers do not fail selection \n     for promotion and, therefore, should not be placed in an \n     ``above the promotion zone'' category, it is proposed that \n     the definition of ``promotion zone'' be modified to include \n     executive level officers considered previously for promotion. \n     The proposed amendment would, therefore, clarify that such \n     officers are not above the zone, and thereby eliminate any \n     stigma of failing of selection, bringing the statute squarely \n     within the apparent intent of Congress. There are no other \n     provisions of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act \n     which are affected by the proposed modifications.\n       There are no costs associated with this legislation.\n\n                 Subtitle B--Reserve Component Matters\n\n     Section 511. Repeal of requirement for physical examination \n         on calling militia into Federal service\n       This section repeals section 12408 of title 10, United \n     States Code, which requires that each member of the National \n     Guard receive a physical examination when called into, and \n     again when mustered out of, Federal service as militia. For \n     short periods of such service, this requires two complete \n     physical examinations during a period of days or weeks. In \n     view of other statutory and regulatory requirements for \n     periodic medical examinations and physical condition \n     certifications for members of the National Guard, this \n     additional examination requirement is unnecessary, \n     administratively burdensome, and expensive, and could impede \n     the rapid and efficient mobilization of the National Guard \n     for civil emergencies.\n       There is no corresponding statutory requirement for \n     physical examinations when members of the National Guard or \n     other reserve components are ordered to active duty as \n     reserves.\n     Section 512. Military leave for public safety duty performed \n         by members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces\n       This section amends section 6323(b) of title 5 by \n     permitting employees to elect, when performing duties \n     described in that section, either military leave under that \n     subsection or annual leave or compensatory time to which they \n     are otherwise entitled. This amendment would not permit use \n     of sick leave for the performance of military duty described \n     in section 6323(b).\n     Section 513. Change to Reserve Officers' Training Corps \n         advanced course admission requirements\n       This section amends section 2104(b)(6)(A)(ii) of title 10 \n     to permit the Secretary of the military department to \n     prescribe the length of the field training or practice cruise \n     that persons who have not participated in the first two years \n     of Reserve Officers' Training Corps must complete to be \n     enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps Advanced \n     Course. Currently, the preliminary training must last at \n     least six weeks.\n       This proposal authorizes the Secretary concerned to \n     prescribe the length of the field training or practice cruise \n     required for admission to the Reserve Officers' Training \n     Corps Advanced Course.\n     Section 514. Clarifying use of military morale, welfare, and \n         recreation facilities by Retired Reservists\n       This section amends section 1065(a) of title 10, United \n     States Code, to give members of the Retired Reserve who would \n     be eligible for retired pay but for the fact that they are \n     under 60 years of age (gray area reservists) the same \n     priority for use of morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) \n     facilities of the military services as members who retired \n     after active-duty careers.\n       Currently, section 1065(a), enacted in 1990, gives the \n     retired reservists the same priority as active-duty members.\n      They, therefore, have preference over retirees from active \n     duty. This section amends the current section 1065(a) by \n     revising the last sentence to correct this inequity.\n       Enactment of this section will not result in an increase in \n     the budgetary requirements of the Department of Defense.\n     Section 515. Objective to increase percentage of prior active \n         duty personnel in the Selected Reserve\n       Section 1111(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1993 provides that the Secretary of the Army \n     shall have an objective of increasing the percentage of prior \n     active duty personnel in the Army National Guard to 65 \n     percent in the case of officers and 50 percent in the case of \n     enlisted members. This change would amend section 1111 and \n     eliminate from the law what may be seen as essentially an \n     arbitrary percentage as a target. It will also facilitate \n     increasing \n     [[Page S5811]] the active duty percentage of the career \n     officer and enlisted leadership under Department objectives \n     established by the Army's Section 1111 Congressional Plan \n     submitted to Congress in January, 1994. The plan, developed \n     after months of extensive modeling and analysis by the Deputy \n     Chief of Staff for Personnel, supports objectives of 65 \n     percent for warrant officers and commissioned officers in the \n     grades above first lieutenant and below brigadier general. It \n     also limited the grades for enlisted members to sergeants and \n     above and increased the objective from 50 to 60 percent.\n     Section 516. Wear of military uniform by National Guard \n         technicians\n       This section would amend section 709 of title 32, United \n     States Code to provide that National Guard technicians who \n     are required as a condition of such civilian employment to be \n     members of the National Guard are also required to wear \n     military uniforms in the course of performing their duties as \n     technicians. These technicians are currently required to wear \n     uniforms in their civilian jobs, and this requirement has \n     been upheld by the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the \n     courts. Recent decisions by the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority and the FSIP have required state National Guard \n     organizations to negotiate with employee unions on the \n     civilian clothing allowance under 5 U.S.C. 5901. These \n     decisions may result in state Guard\n      organizations being required to provide monetary civilian \n     clothing allowances to compensate technicians that have \n     already been furnished the required military uniforms \n     under the military wear and tear replacement provisions of \n     37 U.S.C. 418.\n       Subsection (b) would allow a period of service as a \n     technician by a person who is an officer in the National \n     Guard to be considered active duty for the purposes of \n     uniform allowances for officers under title 37. This would \n     place technician officers on the same footing as AGRs as to \n     eligibility for uniform allowances. This subsection would \n     also provide that these allowances are exclusive of civilian \n     uniform allowances authorized under titles 5 and 10.\n       Subsection (c) would authorize more frequent issuance of \n     military uniforms to members of the National Guard who are \n     technicians, as a result of wear and tear from wear during \n     the course of their civilian employment. It would also \n     provide that the issuance of uniforms or provision of a \n     uniform allowance to these technicians under 37 U.S.C. 418 \n     would be exclusive of authority to provide civilian uniforms \n     or allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5901 or 10 U.S.C. 1593.\n     Section 517. Active duty retirement sanctuary for reservists\n       This section amends sections 1163(d) of title 10 to provide \n     for an exception to the active duty retirement sanctuary \n     provision for a member of a reserve component, who is on \n     active duty (other than for training) and is within two years \n     of becoming eligible for retired pay or retainer pay under a \n     purely military retirement system. This proposal would \n     provide authority for the Secretaries of the military \n     departments to issue regulations requiring that the length of \n     active duty be at least 180 days before members of a reserve \n     component could request retention on active duty until they \n     become eligible for active duty retired pay. Such regulations \n     would require reservists with 18 or more years of qualifying \n     service for active duty retired pay to serve on active duty \n     for special work for a period of 180 consecutive days or \n     longer in order to request active duty retirement sanctuary. \n     Certain reservists involuntarily recalled to active duty \n     would be exempt from the 180-day requirement. There are no \n     costs associated with the provision.\n     Section 518. Involuntarily separated military reserve \n         technicians\n       This section amends section 3329 of title 5 which requires \n     that certain eligible Department of Defense military reserve \n     technicians who were involuntarily separated from their \n     positions are given competitive service job offers in the \n     Department of Defense within 6 months of application. \n     Eligibility consisted of those who:\n       Separated on or after October 23, 1992, with 15 years \n     technician and 20 years of service creditable for non-regular \n     retirement under title 10, United States Code, section 1332;\n       Lost military membership not due to misconduct or \n     delinquency;\n       Are not eligible for immediate or early retirement; and\n       Apply within one year of separation.\n       This would eliminate the requirement that separated \n     technicians receive a job offer giving them placement rights \n     above other separated Department of Defense civilian \n     employees (including veterans). It also eliminates the \n     requirement that a vacancy be artificially created. The \n     proposed amendment would accord eligible technicians the same \n     priority placement consideration as other displaced \n     Department of Defense employees.\n\n     Subtitle C--Amendments to the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n\n       The legislative proposals in this subtitle are the result \n     of an annual review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n     by the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice. The Joint \n     Service Committee on Military Justice was established in \n     response to Executive Order 12473, as amended by Executive \n     Orders 12484, 12550, and 12708, and consists of \n     representatives from each of the five services and from The \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The \n     purpose of the Joint Service Committee is to assist the \n     President in his responsibilities under article 36 of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 836) to ensure \n     that the principles of law and the rules of evidence \n     generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the \n     United States District Courts are applied, so far as \n     practicable, to cases triable by court-martial. The enactment \n     of this proposed\n      legislation would result in no additional cost to the \n     Government.\n     Section 551. Definitions\n       This section amends article 1 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 801) by providing definitions of \n     the terms ``classified information'' and ``national \n     security''. These definitions are identical to those used in \n     the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 App. U.S.C. 1). \n     The section also provides a definition of the term ``armed \n     conflict''. This definition is similar to the definition of \n     ``contingency operation'' found in section 101(a)(13) of \n     title 10, United States Code.\n     Section 552. Jurisdiction over civilians accompanying the \n         forces in the field of time of armed conflict\n       This section amends article 2(a)(10) of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 802(a)(10)) by extending \n     jurisdiction over civilians accompanying the forces in the \n     field to situations of armed conflict. This amendment \n     recognizes that armed conflict may exist without a \n     declaration of war and overturns United States v. Averette, \n     41 C.M.R. 363 (C.M.A. 1970). Determining whether an armed \n     conflict exists in the absence of a formal declaration of war \n     is a factual determination based on the totality of the \n     circumstances, including: the nature of the conflict (whether \n     it involves armed hostilities against an organized enemy); \n     the movement to and the numbers of United States forces in \n     the combat area; the casualties involved and the sacrifices \n     required; the maintenance of large numbers of active duty \n     personnel; legislation by Congress recognizing or providing \n     for the hostilities; executive orders and proclamations \n     concerning the hostilities; and expenditures in the war \n     effort.\n     Section 553. Investigations\n       This section amends article 32 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 832) by adding a new subsection \n     which authorizes an article 32 investigating officer to \n     investigate uncharged offenses when, during the course of a \n     hearing under this article, the evidence indicates that the \n     accused may have committed such offenses. An article 32 \n     proceeding frequently\n      eliminates weak or baseless charges saving the government \n     the time and expense of having to address them at trial. \n     It also serves the defense as a valuable discovery tool \n     permitting it to cross-examine government witnesses under \n     oath before trial. The investigation's swift completion \n     saves the accused from the anxiety and uncertainty of what \n     charges, if any, he will have to defend against and \n     assures his right to a speedy resolution of the issues. \n     Authorizing an investigating officer to broaden the scope \n     of the investigation beyond those offenses charged \n     benefits both the government and the accused. Under \n     current procedure, the investigating officer would at a \n     minimum, have to delay the proceeding in order to allow \n     the Government time to prepare and serve additional \n     charges should a basis for such charges arise during the \n     investigation. Such delays are contrary to the interests \n     of both the accused and the government in ensuring the \n     swift and efficient administration of justice.\n       The proposed legislation should allow the investigating \n     officer to investigate the uncharged allegation of \n     allegations without having to delay the proceeding, but still \n     insure that the accused's due process rights were protected. \n     The investigating officer would be required to advise the \n     accused of the nature of the uncharged offense or offenses \n     and that the offense or offenses will be investigated during \n     the current investigation. The accused would retain the same \n     rights with regard to the uncharged offenses as existed with \n     regard to the charged offenses, i.e., the right to be present \n     and represented by counsel, to confront and cross-examine \n     available witnesses, to examine real and documentary \n     evidence, to examine statements of unavailable witnesses, to \n     request that the investigating officer call witnesses, and to \n     present evidence in defense or remain silent. After hearing \n     all the evidence, the investigating officer may then \n     recommend the preferral and referral of additional charges in \n     the formal report on finding that a sufficient factual basis \n     for doing so exists.\n     Section 554. Refusal to testify before court-martial\n       This section amends article 47(b) of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 847(b)) by removing the \n     limitations on punishment which may be imposed by a Federal \n     District Court for a civilian witness's refusal, after being \n     subpoenaed, to appear or testify before a court-martial. \n     Under the present\n      statute, the Federal District Court may only impose ``a fine \n     of not more than $500.00, or imprisonment for not more \n     than six months, or both'' on a recalcitrant witness. This \n     proposal leaves the amount of confinement or fine to the \n     discretion of the Federal Court having jurisdiction over \n     the case and is based on 18 U.S.C. 401-402. This approach \n     provides the court greater flexibility in determining a \n     punishment more appropriately designed to elicit \n     cooperation from a recalcitrant witness.\n     [[Page S5812]] Section 555. Records of trial\n       This section amends article 54(c)(1)(A) of the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 854(c)(1)(A)) by changing the \n     triggering factors which require a verbatim record of trial \n     in general courts-martial. It eliminates verbatim records of \n     trial in general courts-martial where the adjudged sentence \n     does not require mandatory review by a Court of Criminal \n     Appeals under article 66(b)(1) of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice, i.e., a sentence which does not extend to \n     death, dismissal, discharge, or confinement for one year or \n     more. As a result, staff judge advocates would have the \n     option of preparing the records for such cases in either \n     summarized or verbatim format, as their available resources \n     dictate. Courts-martial affected by this legislation are \n     examined under article 69(a) of the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice (10 U.S.C. 869(a)) in the Service office of The Judge \n     Advocate General and can be fairly and efficiently examined \n     through use of a summarized record of trial, as is currently \n     the case with records of special courts-marital in which no \n     punitive discharge is adjudged.\n     Section 556. Effective date of punishments\n       This section amends article 57(a) of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 857(a)) by making forfeitures of \n     pay and allowances and reductions in grade effective \n     immediately upon being adjudged by a court-martial. It \n     discontinues the current practice of allowing a convicted \n     member to retain the privileges of his rank until the record \n     of trial has been prepared, the accused presents matters for \n     the convening authority's consideration (up to ten days from \n     service of the record upon the accused), and the convening \n     authority reviews the record and takes action on the \n     sentence. This situation can last from several weeks to \n     months depending upon the length and complexity\n      of the trial. The immediate application of forfeitures and \n     reduction in grade would not only have the desired \n     punitive and rehabilitative impact upon the accused, but \n     would also impress upon other members the costs of \n     misconduct, thus engendering an enhanced deterrence to \n     future criminal behavior by military members.\n     Section 557. Deferment of confinement\n       This section adds a new article 57a of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 857a) which combines the existing \n     provision authorizing deferment of confinement, i.e., article \n     57(d) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, with two new \n     provisions describing additional circumstances under which \n     such action is authorized.\n       The first of the new provisions, article 57a(b), permits \n     the Secretary concerned, or his designee, to defer the \n     service of an accused's confinement when a Judge Advocate \n     General orders a case reversed by a Court of Military Review \n     to be sent to the United States Court of Military Appeals for \n     further review under article 67(a)(2). The latter court has \n     directed that, when the government appeals a court of \n     military review's reversal of the findings or sentence to \n     confinement, the accused must be released from confinement \n     pending the government's appeal unless it can be shown that \n     the accused is a flight risk or a potential threat to the \n     community should release be granted. See Moore v. Adkins, 30 \n     M.J. 249 (C.M.A. 1990). Since current law only allows \n     deferment prior to ordering the execution of the sentence to \n     confinement, this legislation is necessary for the purpose of \n     establishing procedures to satisfy the mandate of the court.\n       The second of the new provisions, article 57a(c) allows the \n     convening authority to defer the running of a sentence to \n     confinement when a state or foreign country has temporarily \n     released the accused from its custody to allow the military \n     to try the accused before a court-martial and the military is \n     then obligated by agreement such as the Interstate Agreement \n     on Detainers Act, 18 App. U.S.C., or a treaty to return the \n     accused to the sender state's custody after the court-martial \n     is completed. Since article 57(b) provides that an accused's \n     sentence to confinement begins to run upon the date it is \n     adjudged, any sentence of confinement imposed by the court-\n     martial would have\n      to run concurrently with the accused's confinement by the \n     sender state in the absence of this legislation. This \n     would be the case regardless of the fact that the court-\n     martial conviction was based on different crimes than \n     those prosecuted by the sender state. The military courts \n     have been determined to be federal courts for the purpose \n     of complying with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers \n     Act. See United States v. Greer, 21 M.J. 338 (C.M.A. \n     1986).\n     Section 558. Submission of matters to the convening authority \n         for consideration\n       This section amends article 60(b)(1) of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 860(b)(1)) by inserting the word \n     ``written'' in the first sentence. The amendment requires \n     matters submitted by an accused for consideration by a \n     convening authority with respect to the findings and sentence \n     of a court-martial to be limited to written matters.\n     Section 559. Proceedings in revision\n       This section amends article 60 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 860) by adding a new paragraph \n     (3) to subsection (e). It provides that a proceeding in \n     revision may be ordered, prior to authentication of the \n     record of trial by the Military Judge, to correct an \n     erroneously announced sentence. The sentence may be corrected \n     even if, in doing so, the severity of the sentence is \n     increased. The amendment applies only to correction of an \n     erroneously announced sentence and does not authorize \n     reconsideration. The amendment overrules United States v. \n     Baker, 32 M.J. 290 (C.M.A. 1991). The previously designated \n     subsection (e)(3) is redesignated as subsection (e)(4).\n     Section 560. Post-trial review of courts-martial\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends article 61(c) of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 861(c)) by adding \n     the phrase ``or an application for relief under section \n     869(b) of this title (article 69(b))''. Subsection (b) amends \n     article 69(b) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 \n     U.S.C. 969(b)) by adding the phrase ``Unless the accused has \n     waived or withdrawn the right to appellate review under \n     section 861 of this title (article 61)''. These amendments \n     address a statutory loophole which\n      permits an accused to formally waive or withdraw appellate \n     review under the provisions of article 66 or 69(a) and up \n     to two years later submit an Application for Relief under \n     the provisions of article 69(b). The proposed change \n     limits an accused to a single avenue of post-trial review.\n       When an accused formally waives or withdraws appellate \n     review, he or she knowingly waives the right to bring issues \n     to the attention of a Court of Criminal Appeals or the Office \n     of The Judge Advocate General. Most legal issues are best \n     resolved through the normal appellate review process. \n     Permitting an accused who has waived or withdrawn appellate \n     review much later to submit an Application for Relief to The \n     Judge Advocate General allows that accused to equivocate at \n     the expense of judicial efficiency and economy and in effect \n     to ``shop'' for the most effective forum.\n     Section 561. Appeal by the United States\n       This section amends article 62 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 862) by allowing the Government \n     to file an interlocutory appeal of rulings or orders issued \n     by the military judge which direct the government to disclose \n     classified information, impose sanctions for nondisclosure of \n     classified information, or refuse a protective order sought \n     to prevent the disclosure of classified information. It makes \n     applicable to courts-martial the same protections with regard \n     to classified information as apply to orders or rulings \n     issued on Federal District Courts under the Classified \n     Information Procedures Act (18 App. U.S.C. 7).\n     Section 562. Flight from apprehension\n       This section amends article 95 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 895.) to proscribe fleeing from \n     apprehension without regard to whether the accused otherwise \n     resisted apprehension.\n       The proposed change responds to the United States Court of \n     Military Appeals decisions in United States v. Harris, 29 \n     M.J. 169 (C.M.A. 1989), and United States v. Burgess, 32 M.J. \n     446 (C.M.A. 1991). In both cases, the Court held that \n     resisting apprehension does not include fleeing from \n     apprehension, despite\n      the explanation in Part IV, paragraph 19c(1), MCM, 1984, of \n     the nature of the resistance required for resisting \n     apprehension: ``The resistance must be active, such as \n     assaulting the person attempting to apprehend or flight'' \n     (emphasis added). The 1951 and 1969 Manuals for Courts-\n     Martial also explained that flight could constitute \n     resisting apprehension under article 95, an interpretation \n     affirmed in the only early military case on point, United \n     States v. Mercer,11 C.M.R. 812 (A.F.B.R. 1953).\n       Flight from apprehension should be expressly deterred and \n     punished under military law. Contrary to civilian \n     jurisdictions, military personnel are specially trained and \n     routinely expected to submit to lawful authority. Rather than \n     being a merely incidental or reflexive action, flight from \n     apprehension in the context of the armed forces may have a \n     distinct and cognizable impact on military discipline. The \n     present alternatives for reaching and punishing flight from \n     apprehension are unsatisfactory, in that they lack uniformity \n     and are potentially unfair. Reliance on local regulations \n     (e.g., installation traffic regulations requiring drivers to \n     stop for a police vehicle with its lights and siren on), or \n     assimilation of state statutes makes prosecution dependent \n     upon the vagaries of inconsistent and sometimes nonexistent \n     law. Punishing a fleeing suspect for disobedience of a law \n     enforcement officer's order is both problematic (it requires \n     that the suspect receive an order, which is often not the \n     case or is impossible to prove) and unfair to the accused \n     (the maximum punishment for disobedience far exceeds the \n     misdemeanor-type nature of fleeing apprehension). Finally, \n     proceeding under article 134 as the Court suggested in \n     Harris, typically would raise several difficult legal issues, \n     including preemption and notice.\n       The Uniform Code of Military Justice must be amended in \n     order to uniformly proscribe fleeing apprehension under \n     military law; the Harris and Burgess decisions are premised \n     upon statutory interpretation, not Manual provisions. The \n     proposed Manual changes will be included in the Joint Service \n     Committee's 1994 Annual Review after the legislation passes.\n     Section 563. Carnal knowledge\n       Subsection (a) of this section amends article 120(b) of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 920(b)) by making\n      the crime of carnal knowledge gender neutral, \n     [[Page S5813]] bringing article 120 of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice into conformity with the spirit of the \n     Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 2241-2245).\n       Subsection (b) of this section amends article 120 of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 920) by adding a \n     new subsection (d) permitting an affirmative defense of \n     mistake of fact for alleged carnal knowledge, regarding the \n     age of the person with whom the accused committed the act of \n     sexual intercourse. It allows the accused to defend against a \n     charge of carnal knowledge on the basis that he or she lacked \n     a criminal intent while protecting children under 12 years of \n     age from sexual abuse and, thus causes the military offense \n     of carnal knowledge to more closely conform to its federal \n     civilian counterpart (18 U.S.C. 2243).\n     Section 564. Instruction in the Uniform Code of Military \n         Justice\n       This section amends article 137(a)(1) of the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 937(a)(1)) by lengthening the \n     period of time in which training in certain provisions of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice is provided to new enlistees \n     from six to fourteen days.\n\n                       Subtitle D--Other Matters\n\n     Section 571. Indefinite reenlistments for career enlisted \n         members\n       Currently, section 505(d) of title 10, United States Code, \n     authorizes the Secretaries of the military departments to \n     accept reenlistments in regular components for a period of at \n     least two but not more than six years. Accordingly, even \n     senior enlisted members of the armed forces who have made \n     military service a career must periodically reenlist. This \n     proposal would eliminate the administrative efforts and \n     associated costs that occur as a consequence of the \n     requirement to reenlist continually senior enlisted members.\n       Under this section, the Secretaries of the military \n     departments could accept indefinite reenlistments from \n     enlisted members who have at least ten years of service on \n     active duty and\n      who are serving in the pay grade of E-6 or above. The vast \n     majority of enlisted members with these characteristics \n     will make military service a career. Thus, an enlisted \n     member who serves 30 years would avoid the necessity of \n     continually reenlisting over a 20-year period. The \n     paperwork for reenlistment and its processing is not \n     burdensome, but it is not insignificant. Savings should \n     result. The proposal would also increase the prestige of \n     the noncommissioned officer corps.\n     Section 572. Chief Warrant Officer promotions\n       This section amends sections 574(e) and 575(b) of title 10 \n     to reduce the minimum time in grade necessary for promotion \n     to two years rather than three, and to authorize the below-\n     zone selection for promotion to the grade of chief warrant \n     officer, W-3.\n       Reduction of the minimum time in grade required for \n     promotion would result in actual promotion after three years \n     in grade. It is not now possible for below zone \n     consideration, even to chief warrant officer, W-4. This \n     legislation would also authorize chief warrant officer, W-3, \n     below-zone selection opportunity. This change will permit \n     recognition of the small number of chief warrant officers, W-\n     3, deserving of promotion ahead of their peers. The average \n     chief warrant officer, W-2, has almost eighteen years \n     enlisted service when commissioned in that grade.\n       Prior to 1 February 1992 when the Warrant Officer \n     Management Act became effective, temporary warrant officer \n     promotions were made under such regulations as the service \n     secretary prescribed, as authorized by section 602 of title \n     10. Under this section, repealed by the Warrant Officer \n     Management Act, warrant officers were temporarily promoted \n     well ahead of the criteria for permanent regular warrant \n     officer promotions under section 559 of title 10, also \n     repealed, and it was also possible for a limited number of \n     outstanding individuals to be selected early from among \n     below-zone candidates for the grade of chief warrant officer, \n     W-3.\n       Under section 574(e) of title 10, a chief warrant officer \n     is not eligible to be considered for promotion to the next \n     higher\n      grade until he or she has completed three years of service \n     in current grade.\n       Additionally, section 575(b)(1) of title 10 limits below-\n     zone selection opportunity to those being considered for \n     promotion to chief warrant officer, W-4, and chief warrant \n     officer, W-5.\n       This legislation is intended to improve the management of \n     the Services' chief warrant officer communities by reducing \n     the minimum time in grade required for chief warrant officers \n     to be considered for promotion to the next higher grade from \n     three years to two years, thereby allowing the opportunity \n     for early selection, and to authorize below-zone selection \n     opportunity for promotion to the grade of chief warrant \n     officer, W-3, similar to that currently authorized for \n     promotion to the grades of chief warrant officer, W-4, and \n     chief warrant officer, W-5.\n       With due-course promotions occurring after four years' time \n     in grade, as they now occur in the Department of the Navy, \n     the requirement for chief warrant officers to have three \n     years in grade to be considered for promotion has the effect \n     of not permitting any early selections. Reducing the minimum \n     time in grade for promotion consideration to two years would \n     allow for a small number of individuals to be selected from \n     among below-zone candidates, and to be promoted one year \n     early after actually serving three years in grade. \n     Additionally, authorizing early selection to chief warrant \n     officer, W-3, would permit recognition as appropriate of the \n     experience and competence of these individuals. For example, \n     the average Navy chief warrant officer, W-2, has almost 18 \n     years enlisted service when commissioned in that grade.\n       Chief warrant officers provide the services with \n     commissioned officers who possess invaluable technical \n     expertise, leadership and managerial skills developed during \n     enlisted service and through formal education. This \n     legislation is needed to identify and reward the small number \n     of exceptionally talented chief warrant officers whose \n     demonstrated performance and strong leadership are deserving \n     of special recognition by being selected for promotion ahead \n     of their peers, thereby enhancing morale and maintaining the \n     vitality of the entire community.\n       This proposal would not result in any increased cost to the \n     Department of the Navy, other services, or the Department of \n     Defense.\n     Section 573. Retirement of Director of Admissions, United \n         States Military Academy, for years of service\n       This section would amend section 3920 of title 10 to \n     authorize the Secretary of the Army to retire the Director of \n     Admissions, United States Military Academy, after 30 years of \n     service as a commissioned officer. Currently, under section \n     1251(a) of title 10, the permanent professors at the Academy \n     and the Director of Admissions can serve until the age of 64. \n     Under section 3920, however, the Secretary of the Army may \n     direct the retirement of a permanent professor after 30 years \n     of service. This section would provide the Secretary of the \n     Army with the same retirement authority over the Director of \n     Admissions.\n\n          Title VI--Compensation and Other Personnel Benefits\n\n                     Subtitle A--Pay and Allowances\n\n     Section 601. Military pay raise for fiscal year 1995\n       The purpose of this section is to obtain one-time relief \n     from the provisions of 37 U.S.C. 1009 and, thereby, permit an \n     adjustment to monthly Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) \n     rates that exceeds the overall average percentage increase \n     permitted in subsection (b)(3) without recourse to \n     Presidential action authorized in subsection (c). With regard \n     to January 1, 1996, the annualization of the General Schedule \n     rates by statute would result in a basic allowance for \n     quarters average rate increase of 2.4 percent to those rates \n     in force on January 1, 1995. As the result of the recent \n     Department of Defense study addressing military quality-of-\n     life issues, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with \n     the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed to the programming \n     and budgeting of an additional $43 Million in Fiscal Year \n     1996 and equivalent out-year Basic Allowance for Quarters \n     funding through Fiscal Year 2001 to improve service member \n     reimbursement and living accommodations. Execution of the \n     Fiscal Year 1996 program at this funding level, as an augment \n     to annualization of the General Schedule rates, will result \n     in an\n      overall Basic Allowance for Quarters rate increase of 3.4 \n     percent to those rates in force on January 1, 1995.\n       As noted by the joint House-Senate Conference Committee \n     that considered the 1988/1989 Defense Authorization Act, ``in \n     1985 the basic allowance for quarters rates [were] \n     restructured so that they would cover 65 percent of national \n     median housing costs in each pay grade.'' Since the 1985 \n     restructuring, BAQ rates have declined to under 59 percent of \n     the national housing median. Combined with funding caps to \n     the variable housing allowance program, service members now \n     absorb over 21 percent of their housing costs instead of the \n     congressional intent of 15 percent. Support for the use of \n     this additional funding and establishment of the 3.4 percent \n     increase in basic allowance for quarters for Fiscal Year 1996 \n     is executed to reduce the percent of out-of-pocket housing \n     costs service members pay by one percent through Fiscal Year \n     2001.\n       This improvement of quality-of-life initiative will help \n     defray the cost of off-base housing for military members, \n     improve the adequacy of these quarters and, as result, \n     contribute to force readiness via improved morale, individual \n     readiness and retention of personnel.\n       The following amounts are included in the President's \n     Fiscal Year 1996 budget submission to reflect enactment of \n     this legislation:\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nFiscal year 1996...................................................43.0\nFiscal year 1997...................................................43.8\nFiscal year 1998...................................................44.6\nFiscal year 1999...................................................45.6\nFiscal year 2000...................................................46.9\nFiscal year 2001...................................................48.2\n\n     Section 602. Evacuation allowances that permits equal \n         treatment of military dependents to civilians and their \n         dependents\n       Subsection (a) amends section 405a(a) of title 37 by \n     changing ``ordered'' each place it appears to ``officially \n     authorized or ordered'' in each instance. The purpose for \n     this change is to equalize evacuation allowances to ensure \n     that treatment of dependents of military personnel is equal \n     to that of civilian dependents.\n       The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-465) \n     broadened section 5522 of title 5 to allow advance pay along \n     with travel and transportation allowances to civilians and \n     [[Page S5814]] their dependents whenever they are officially \n     authorized or ordered to leave an overseas area due to \n     unsettled conditions. Congress believed this change was in \n     the best interest of the Government and the individual by \n     providing flexible requirements in this area and by allowing \n     the Government to more easily order departures of dependents \n     and nonessential personnel without ordering a full scale \n     evacuation. Similar treatment for military dependents is \n     required as a matter of equity since military dependents are \n     evacuated from an overseas location along with civilian \n     employees and their dependents. This small change will allow \n     the Chief of Diplomatic Mission authority to treat military \n     dependents identical to civilians and their dependents by \n     ``authorizing'' as well as ``ordering'' military dependents \n     to evacuate and ensure our policies are consistent with the \n     Department of State's evacuation procedures.\n       Enactment of this legislative proposal will not cause an \n     increase in the budgetary requirements of the Department of \n     Defense.\n     Section 603. Continuous entitlement to career sea pay for \n         crewmembers of ships designated as tenders\n       The purpose of this section is to modify current law by \n     specifying duty on board submarine and destroyer tenders as \n     qualifying for career sea pay, removing the requirement for \n     the tender to be away from homeport in order to support \n     career sea pay eligibility.\n       Title 37 distinguishes between ships with a primary mission \n     accomplished underway (continuous career sea pay entitlement) \n     and ships with a primary mission accomplished in port (non-\n     continuous career sea pay entitlement).\n       In 1980, when the Secretary of the Navy Hidalgo presented \n     to Congress the proposal that led to the current career sea \n     pay legislation, he explained that tenders were the most \n     representative class of ships that met non-continuous career \n     sea criteria because their primary mission, at that time, was \n     accomplished in port.\n       In 1988, the fact that assignment to tender duty involved \n     the same intensive, arduous operational environment as other \n     shipboard duty (with accompanying continuous career sea pay \n     entitlement) was recognized by Congress when section \n     305a(d)(2) of title 37 was amended by Public Law 100-456 to \n     credit tender crewmembers with all time performed (both \n     underway and in port) aboard those ships as cumulative day-\n     for-day longevity for sea service time. Before that time, \n     both sea service time (longevity) and the actual entitlement \n     to career sea pay for non-continuous entitlement ships \n     accrued only after the ship was underway for more than 30 \n     consecutive days.\n       Navy's drawdown in recent years has added to the demands on \n     tender crews, making them unquestionably deserving of \n     continuous career sea pay entitlement. This considerable \n     increase in operational tempo has resulted from continuing \n     demands preparing deploying units for overseas duty, as well \n     as being required to assist in the numerous decommissioning \n     as a result of Navy's ship drawdown.\n       These demands on the crews of our tenders are further \n     exacerbated by the drawdown of the tenders themselves. By \n     October 1, 1995, the tender fleet will have been reduced from \n     17 to 4 ships (two homeported overseas (La Maddalena, \n     Sardinia and Guam) and the remaining two in the United States \n     (one per coast)).\n       Today, tender crews, on fewer ships, are experiencing more \n     underway time and, when in port, are facing the same or more \n     rigorous demands and working hours as the crews of the \n     continuous career sea pay ships they support. The proposed \n     legislation would remove the significant pay inequity that \n     currently exists for crewmembers assigned to those submarine \n     and destroyer tenders.\n       Enactment of this proposed legislation would result in the \n     following expenditures by the Department of Defense (Dollars \n     in Millions):\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Fiscal   Fiscal   Fiscal   Fiscal   Fiscal\n                               year     year     year     year     year \n                               1996     1997     1998     1999     2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy N/A...................  .......  .......  .......  .......  .......\nAir Force..................

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--The civil \n     justice system of the United States is a costly and \n     inefficient mechanism for resolving claims of health care \n     liability and compensating injured patients and the problems \n     associated with the current \n     [[Page S5844]] system are having an adverse impact on the \n     availability of, and access to, health care services and the \n     cost of health care in the United States.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--The health care and \n     insurance industries are industries affecting interstate \n     commerce and the health care liability litigation systems \n     existing throughout the United States affect interstate \n     commerce by contributing to the high cost of health care and \n     premiums for health care liability insurance purchased by \n     participants in the health care system.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--The health care liability \n     litigation systems existing throughout the United States have \n     a significant effect on the amount, distribution, and use of \n     Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide such individuals with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reform that is designed to--\n       (1) ensure that individuals with meritorious health care \n     injury claims receive fair and adequate compensation;\n       (2) improve the availability of health care service in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services; and\n       (3) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of the \n     current health care liability system of the United States to \n     resolve disputes over, and provide compensation for, health \n     care liability by reducing uncertainty and unpredictability \n     in the amount of compensation provided to injured \n     individuals.\n\n     SEC. ____12.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.\n\n       A health care liability action that is subject to this \n     title may not be initiated unless \n     [[Page S5845]] a complaint with respect to such action is \n     filed within the 2-year period beginning on the date on which \n     the claimant discovered or, in the exercise of reasonable \n     care, should have discovered the injury and its cause, except \n     that such an action relating to a claimant under legal \n     disability may be filed within 2 years after the date on \n     which the disability ceases. If the commencement of a health \n     care liability action is stayed or enjoined, the running of \n     the statute of limitations under this section shall be \n     suspended for the period of the stay or injunction.\n\n     SEC. ____15. REFORM OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, an award for punitive damages may only be made, if \n     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if it is proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence that the defendant--\n       (1) intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated \n     to the provision of health care services;\n       (2) understood the claimant was substantially certain to \n     suffer unnecessary injury, and in providing or failing to \n     provide health care services, the defendant deliberately \n     failed to avoid such injury; or\n       (3) acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a \n     substantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury \n     which the defendant failed to avoid in a manner which \n     constitutes a gross deviation from the normal standard of \n     conduct in such circumstances.\n       (b) Punitive Damages Not Permitted.--Notwithstanding the \n     provisions of subsection (a), punitive damages may not be \n     awarded against a defendant with respect to any health care \n     liability action if no judgment for compensatory damages, \n     including nominal damages (under $500), is rendered against \n     the defendant.\n       (c) Separate Proceeding.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of any defendant in a \n     health care liability action, the trier of fact shall \n     consider in a separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; or\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n       (2) Only relevant evidence admissible.--If a defendant \n     requests a separate proceeding under paragraph (1), evidence \n     relevant only to the claim of punitive damages in a health \n     care liability action, as determined by applicable State law, \n     shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether \n     compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (d) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--In determining \n     the amount of punitive damages in a health care liability \n     action, the trier of fact shall consider only the following:\n       (1) The severity of the harm caused by the conduct of the \n     defendant.\n       (2) The duration of the conduct or any concealment of such \n     conduct by the defendant.\n       (3) The profitability of the conduct of the defendant.\n       (4) The number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by the \n     defendant of the kind causing the harm complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (5) Evidence with respect to awards of punitive or \n     exemplary damages to persons similarly situated to the \n     claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (6) Prospective awards of compensatory damages to persons \n     similarly situated to the claimant.\n       (7) Evidence with respect to any criminal or administrative \n     penalties imposed on the defendant as a result of the conduct \n     complained of by the claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (8) Evidence with respect to the amount of any civil fines \n     assessed against the defendant as a result of the conduct \n     complained of by the claimant, when offered by the defendant.\n       (e) Limitation Amount.--The amount of damages that may be \n     awarded as punitive damages in any health care liability \n     action shall not exceed 3 times the amount awarded to the \n     claimant for the economic injury on which such claim is \n     based, or $250,000, whichever is greater. This subsection \n     shall be applied by the court and shall not be disclosed to \n     the jury.\n       (f) Restrictions Permitted.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed to imply a right to seek punitive damages where \n     none exists under Federal or State law.\n\n     SEC. ____16. PERIODIC PAYMENTS.\n\n       With respect to a health care liability action, if the \n     award of future damages exceeds $100,000, the adjudicating \n     body shall, at the request of either party, enter a judgment \n     ordering that future damages be paid on a periodic basis in \n     accordance with the guidelines contained in the Uniform \n     Periodic Payments of Judgments Act, as promulgated by the \n     National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in \n     July of 1990. The adjudicating body may waive the \n     requirements of this section if such body determines that \n     such a waiver is in the interests of justice.\n\n     SEC. ____17. SCOPE OF LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to punitive and noneconomic \n     damages, the liability of each defendant in a health care \n     liability action shall be several only and may not be joint. \n     Such a defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     punitive or noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to such defendant's percentage of fault or \n     responsibility for the injury suffered by the claimant.\n       (b) Determination of Percentage of Liability.--With respect \n     to punitive or noneconomic damages, the trier of fact in a \n     health care liability action shall determine the extent of \n     each party's fault or responsibility for injury suffered by \n     the claimant, and shall assign a percentage of responsibility \n     for such injury to each such party.\n\n     SEC. ____18. MANDATORY OFFSETS FOR DAMAGES PAID BY A \n                   COLLATERAL SOURCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--With respect to a health care liability \n     action, the total amount of damages received by an individual \n     under such action shall be reduced, in accordance with \n     subsection (b), by any other payment that has been, or will \n     be, made to an individual to compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of such action.\n       (b) Amount of Reduction.--The amount by which an award of \n     damages to an individual for an injury shall be reduced under \n     subsection (a) shall be--\n       (1) the total amount of any payments (other than such \n     award) that have been made or that will be made to such \n     individual to pay costs of or compensate such individual for \n     the injury that was the subject of the action; minus\n       (2) the amount paid by such individual (or by the spouse, \n     parent, or legal guardian of such individual) to secure the \n     payments described in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Determination of Amounts From Collateral Services.--The \n     reductions required under subsection (b) shall be determined \n     by the court in a pretrial proceeding. At the subsequent \n     trial--\n       (1) no evidence shall be admitted as to the amount of any \n     charge, payments, or damage for which a claimant--\n       (A) has received payment from a collateral source or the \n     obligation for which has been assured by a third party; or\n       (B) is, or with reasonable certainty, will be eligible to \n     receive payment from a collateral source of the obligation \n     which will, with reasonable certainty be assumed by a third \n     party; and\n       (2) the jury, if any, shall be advised that--\n       (A) except for damages as to which the court permits the \n     introduction of evidence, the claimant's medical expenses and \n     lost income have been or will be paid by a collateral source \n     or third party; and\n       (B) the claimant shall receive no award for any damages \n     that have been or will be paid by a collateral source or \n     third party.\n\n     SEC. ____19. TREATMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Amount of Contingency Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--An attorney who represents, on a \n     contingency fee basis, a claimant in a health care liability \n     action may not charge, demand, receive, or collect for \n     services rendered in connection with such action in excess of \n     the following amount recovered by judgment or settlement \n     under such action:\n       (A) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 (or portion \n     thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery, plus\n       (B) 25 percent of any amount in excess of $150,000 \n     recovered, based on after-tax recovery.\n       (2) Calculation of periodic payments.--In the event that a \n     judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments \n     of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of computing \n     the limitation on the contingency fee under paragraph (1) \n     shall be based on the cost of the annuity or trust \n     established to make the payments. In any case in which an \n     annuity or trust is not established to make such payments, \n     such amount shall be based on the present value of the \n     payments.\n       (b) Contingency Fee Defined.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``contingency fee'' means any fee for professional legal \n     services which is, in whole or in part, contingent upon the \n     recovery of any amount of damages, whether through judgment \n     or settlement.\n\n     SEC. ____20.

It shall be a rebuttable presumption \n     that an ethical and reasonable attorney's fee in such an \n     action is 25 percent of such award for punitive damages.\n       (c) Contingency Fee Defined.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``contingency fee'' means any fee for professional legal \n     services which is, in whole or in part, contingent upon the \n     recovery of any amount of losses or damages, whether through \n     judgment or settlement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5843-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5850-S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COLORADO RIVER BASIN SALINITY CONTROL AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 610\n\n  Mr. KYL (for Mr. Domenici) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 523) \nto amend the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act to authorize \nadditional measures to carry out the control of salinity upstream of \nImperial Dam in a cost-effective manner, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 7, strike ``such paragraph'' on line 1, and insert \n     the following: ``such paragraph. \n     [[Page S5851]] Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Secretary \n     may implement the program under paragraph 202(a)(6) only to \n     the extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in \n     appropriations Acts.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5850-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                permanent subcommittee on investigations\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

About $330 billion was legally bet last year, \n     reports NBC's Roger O'Neil, which is more than the defense \n     budget and about what Social Security costs. Thirty-seven \n     states and the District of Columbia have legalized lotteries; \n     20 states have casinos that are owned by Native Americans; \n     and 10 states have licensed either casinos or riverboats. In \n     Iowa, every man, women, and child is within a two-hour drive \n     of a casino. Here in the District of Columbia, the lottery is \n     pushed by hard-sell television commercials designed to \n     encourage gambling. This is crazy. It's also evil. Why not \n     have state-sponsored opium dens with TV commercials promoting \n     blissful oblivion? There is a reasonable argument for the \n     state to offer gambling and dope to those who are determined \n     to partake of those dubious pleasures, but it is outrageous \n     to advertise them in a way that could tempt those who might \n     otherwise choose to say no. . . .\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5851-4", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ADM. STANLEY ARTHUR\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndedication, public service and patriotism of Adm. Stanley Arthur, USN, \nvice chief of naval operations, who has served our Nation so well over \nthe 37-year career. Admiral Arthur will retire from the Navy on June 1, \n1995.\n  A native of San Diego, CA, Admiral Arthur entered the U.S. Navy \nthrough the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps Program from Miami \nUniversity and was commissioned in June of 1957. Designated a naval \naviator in 1958, he reported to VS-21 and later was a plank owner of \nVS-29. Admiral Arthur attended the Naval Postgraduate School where he \nearned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was assigned as weapons \nproject officer with VX-1.\n  Following a tour on U.S.S. Bennington (CVS-20), he reported to VA-55 \naboard U.S.S. Hancock (CVA-19). Following that tour, he reported to VA-\n122 as an A-7 Corsair instructor pilot and maintenance officer.\n  In 1971, Admiral Arthur reported to VA-164 as executive officer and \nassumed command a year later while deployed on the U.S.S. Hancock. \nDuring this tour, he completed over 500 combat missions over Vietnam in \nthe A-4 Skyhawk. Following assignments at the Bureau of Naval \nPersonnel, Admiral Arthur reported aboard U.S.S. SAN JOSE (AFS-7) as \ncommanding officer in July 1976. In June of 1978, he assumed command of \naircraft carrier U.S.S. CORAL SEA (CV-43).\n  Other significant assignments have included Assistant Chief of Staff \nfor Plans and Policy; Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet staff; \ncommander, Carrier Group Seven; director, Aviation Plans and \nRequirements Division; and director, General Planning and Programming \nDivision in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In February \n1988, he was promoted to vice admiral and assumed duties as deputy \nchief of naval operations for logistics.\n  In December 1990, Admiral Arthur assumed duties as commander, U.S. \nSeventh Fleet and commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command for \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He directed the operations \nand tactical movements of more than 96,000 Navy and Marine Corps \npersonnel and 130 U.S. Navy and allied ships, including six aircraft \ncarrier battle groups. This\n represented the largest U.S. naval armada amassed since World War II. \nIn July 1992, Admiral Arthur assumed his current duties as Vice Chief \nof Naval Operations during a period marked by major personnel, \nbudgetary, ship and shore infrastructure reductions.\n\n  Immediately recognizing the challenges posed by these reductions, \nAdmiral Arthur initiated a comprehensive and in-depth review of warfare \nrequirements, procurements planning, and programming procedures.\n  Through his personal efforts on the joint requirements oversight \ncouncil, he was directly responsible for the continued development of a \nmore capable naval force fully interoperable with the Army, Air Force, \nand allied navies.\n  Admiral Arthur played a key role in the formulation and \nimplementation of the Navy's support to national policies involving \noperations restore hope in Somalia, southern watch in the Persian Gulf, \nand deny flight in the Adriatic. He played a significant role in the \nChief of Naval Operations' initiatives to fully integrate women in \ncombat ships and aviation squadrons and has been a strong leader in the \nNavy's efforts to eradicate sexual harassment from its ranks.\n  Admiral Arthur's decorations include the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal, Navy Distinguished Service Medal (4 awards), the Legion \nof Merit (4 awards, one with combat V), the Distinguished Flying Cross \n(11 awards), the Navy Meritorious Service Medal, individual Air Medal \n(4 awards), Strike/Flight Air Medal (47 awards), the Navy Commendation \nMedal (2 awards, 1 with combat V), various foreign personal decorations \nand individual United States and foreign service and campaign awards.\n  Admiral Arthur is a true American patriot and a superb naval officer \nwho, throughout his naval career, has lead with courage and integrity. \nHis leadership and performance throughout an intense and demanding \nperiod in naval and military history were instrumental in the \nsuccessful administration of the Navy and outstanding support for naval \nforces throughout the world. Thanks to his inspirational leadership and \nselfless dedication to duty, our Navy has remained second to none. \nWhile his honorable service will be genuinely missed in the Department \nof Defense, it gives me great pleasure to recognize Admiral Arthur \nbefore my colleagues and wish him and his lovely wife Jennie fair winds \nand following seas as he concludes a most honorable and distinguished \ncareer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5852-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5852-S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        CBO ESTIMATE ON H.R. 694\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on April 18, 1995, the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources filed the report to accompany H.R. 694, \nthe Minor Boundary Adjustments Act of 1995.\n  At the time this report was filed, the Congressional Budget Office \nhad not submitted its budget estimate regarding this measure. The \ncommittee has since received this communication from the Congressional \nBudget Office, and I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The estimate follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed H.R. 694, the Minor Boundary Adjustments and \n     Miscellaneous Park Amendments Act of 1995, as ordered \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources on March 29, 1995.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary sums, CBO estimates \n     that implementing H.R. 694 would result in one-time federal \n     costs totaling between $31 million and $32 million, most of \n     which would be spent over the next five years, plus annual \n     costs of between $0.1 million and $0.2 million during that \n     period and about $1.5 million thereafter. Enactment of H.R. \n     694 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       H.R. 694 would provide for boundary adjustments at several \n     national parks. The bill also would make a number of changes \n     to National Park Service (NPS) programs. Included are \n     provisions to: extend the life of two advisory commissions; \n     amend the Museum Properties Act of July 1, 1955, to \n     facilitate the disposal of unneeded museum properties; and \n     authorize research and education projects carried out with \n     nonfederal partners through cooperative agreements.\n       Land Acquisition Costs. CBO estimates that the federal \n     government would spend between $4 million and $5 million over \n     the next two or three fiscal years to acquire lands added to \n     the park system by this bill, including incidental expenses \n     associated with property donations and exchanges.\n       Development Costs. Lands acquired at three parks (the Yucca \n     House, Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument, and Shiloh \n     National Military Park) would be used for visitor centers or \n     other facilities. CBO estimates that total planning and \n     construction costs for the three projects would be about $23 \n     million. The bill also would authorize construction of a \n     visitor center near or within the boundaries of the New River \n     Gorge or Gauley River park units. We estimate that \n     development of this facility would cost about $2 million.\n       Other Costs. Section 204 of the bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of a total of $2 million over an eight-year \n     period beginning on October 1, 1993. These funds would be \n     used to maintain facilities of the William O. Douglas Outdoor \n     Classroom and to finance programs carried out by that entity. \n     Assuming appropriation of the necessary sums, CBO estimates \n     that about $0.3 million would \n     [[Page S5853]] be spent for these activities during each of \n     the six remaining years of the authorization period. In \n     addition, we estimate that annual support for the two \n     advisory commissions extended by Title II would cost the \n     federal government a total of about $20,000 annually \n     beginning in fiscal year 1996.\n       Finally, costs to operate and maintain all of the new \n     facilities authorized by the bill would be between $0.1 \n     million and $0.2 million annually over the next five years, \n     and would grow to about $1.5 million annually once all \n     development has been completed.\n       Other provisions of the bill would have no significant \n     impact on federal spending.\n       For purposes of the above estimates, CBO assumed that H.R. \n     694 would be enacted by the end of fiscal year 1995 and that \n     funding for all projects or activities would be appropriated \n     as needed. All estimates are based on information provided by \n     the NPS.\n       Enactment of this legislation would have no impact on the \n     budgets of state of local governments.\n       Previous CBO Estimate. On February 23, 1995, CBO prepared a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 694 as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Resources on February 15, 1995. The estimated \n     costs for provisions that are common to both bills are \n     identical. The Senate version of the legislation, however, \n     contains additional provisions that add $13 million to $14 \n     million to one-time costs and up to $0.5 million to annual \n     expenses.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.

Mr. President, Sunday, April 23, marked the \ncommemoration of the 80th anniversary of the 1915-1923 genocide of the \nArmenian people.\n  In a world that seems to have gone mad with violent acts of maniacal \nindividuals, from Oklahoma City to Tokyo, we must remember the victims \nof a government organized terror, the genocide perpetrated by the \nTurkish Ottoman Empire against the Armenian people.\n  Eighty years ago this week, the 8-year-long savagery against the \nArmenian people began.\n  Each year we remember and honor, the victims, and pay respects to the \nsurvivors we still are blessed to have in our midst.\n  We vow to remember, to always remember the attempt to eliminate the \nArmenian people from the face of the earth, not for what they had done \nas individuals, but because of who they were.\n  History records that the world stood by, although it knew. It knew.\n  Our Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, telegraphed \nthe following message to the American Secretary of State on July 16, \n1915:\n\n       Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is \n     increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it \n     appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress \n     under the pretext of reprisal against rebellion.\n\n  Later, when Ambassador Morgenthau wrote a book about his experiences, \nhe wrote:\n\n       When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these \n     deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a \n     whole race: they understood this well and in their \n     conversations with me they made no particular attempt to \n     conceal the fact.\n       I am confident that the whole history of the human race \n     contains no such horrible episode as this. The great \n     massacres and persecutions of the past seems almost \n     insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \n     race in 1915.\n\n  Oh, there were a few voices, there were a few leaders like Winston \nChurchill who tried to warn us. Churchill wrote the following in 1929:\n\n       In 1915, the Turkish Government began and carried out the \n     infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in \n     Asia Minor . . . the clearance of the race from Asia Minor \n     was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, \n     could be. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was \n     planned and executed for political reasons.\n\n  But, for the most part, nations did not learn from history--the world \nlooked away and genocidal horrors revisited the planet.\n  As Elie Weisel said, the Armenians ``felt expelled from history.''\n  Hitler counted on the world forgetting the Armenian genocide when he \nundertook the extermination of the Jewish people.\n  So the genocide we remember each April, the century's first \ngenocide--is the genocide the world forgot, to its shame and for which \nit paid dearly.\n  Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people will still somehow not be in vain.\n  We make this solemn vow because we believe that it is within our \npower to confront evil in the world, and to prevent genocidal attacks \non people because of who they are.\n  That is surely the highest tribute we can pay to the Armenian victims \nand how the horror and brutality of their deaths can be given redeeming \nmeaning.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5853-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Saturday April 21, 1995 marked the \n25th anniversary of Earth Day. Created in 1970 by former Wisconsin \nSenator Gaylord Nelson, Earth Day has played a major role in \nheightening the awareness of environmental problems in the United \nStates. In the past 25 years, much progress has been made to protect \nthe environment. Congress passed vital laws to clean up our air and \nwater, and to prevent and reduce pollution. We also enacted the \nEndangered Species Act, which has helped to protect vital plant and \nanimal species in danger of extinction. In addition, Americans have \nbecome dedicated recyclers--now collecting upward of 22 percent of our \ntrash in over 6,600 communities. But much work remains to be done--\nparticularly in the field of energy conservation.\n  The United States is in desperate need of a plan to conserve our \nenergy supply. We are currently more dependent on foreign oil than we \nwere in the 1973 crisis. Nearly one-half of the oil used in the United \nStates is imported, and this has a significant adverse impact on the \nU.S. balance of trade. Alternative forms of fuel, such as solar energy, \nneed to continue to be explored.\n  About 10 years ago, former Senator Charles ``Mac'' Mathias and I \nvisited refugee housing in Nicosia, Cyprus, built 55 percent with \nAmerican funds. Each house had a solar heating unit on it for hot \nwater. If American taxpayers can help provide solar heating in Cyprus, \nwhy not in Carbondale, IL, and Bakersfield, CA. In 1981 my wife and I \nbuilt a house and made it passive solar. In below-zero weather, we have \nthe experience of a warm house during the daytime, with the furnace \nkicking on when the sun goes down. Clearly, we could do much more to \nencourage widespread use of solar energy.\n  For some years I have also been trying to promote greater research \nand use of electric cars. Automobile ownership is expected to increase \nworldwide by up to 50 percent in the next 20 years. If we do not take \naction, the environmental and energy problems that will result from the \nuse of gasoline-powered cars will be monumental. The resulting air \npollution and oil consumption will create problems that simply will be \nintractable. Widespread use of electric cars would go a long way toward \nresolving this problem.\n  I am pleased to report that we are making progress toward widespread \nuse of electric cars. New rules have been adopted in California, New \nYork, and Massachusetts that require 2 percent of the cars sold to be \nelectric starting in 1998.\n  There is great interest in the electric car abroad. Japan wants to \nhave 200,000 electric cars in use by the year 2000, and Europe will not \nbe far behind. We must encourage U.S. auto companies in every way we \ncan to produce electric cars so that the United States is on the \ncutting-edge of this technology. This type of conservation effort will \nbe an investment that saves both dollars and energy resources for the \nfuture.\n  The question we need to face is whether we are doing what we should \nfor future generations in environmental matters. Focusing on renewable \nand alternative energy sources is a good place to start.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5853-2", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5853-S5854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        HONORING HARRY WEINROTH\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Harry \nWeinroth on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his liberation from \nconcentration camp, April 30, 1995. Mr. Weinroth was born in Sosnowiec, \nPoland. At the age of 13 he voluntarily entered a concentration camp so \nthat his father \n[[Page S5854]] would not have to. Throughout the war he was held in \nseveral different camps including Buchenwald, Gross Rosen, and Dachau.\n  Mr. Weinroth lost both parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, three \nbrothers, and one sister in the camps. Only he and one sister survived, \nwhom he found after the war in Germany. Mr. Weinroth along with his \nsister came to Stamford, CT, in June 1949. He came to this country with \nnothing but his trade, watchmaking, and promptly started a small \nbusiness repairing watches. Over the years Bedford Jewelers has grown \ninto a family retail jewelry store--he works there today with his wife, \ndaughter, and son.\n  He still resides in Stamford, and is an active member in the \ncommunity and his synagogue, Congregation Agudath Sholom. He married \nhis wife, Luba, in 1952, whom he met at a displaced persons camp in \nGermany in 1948. They have two sons and a daughter, and three grandsons \nto carry on the family name. A 50th anniversary is worth celebrating, \nyet an anniversary that represents as much as this one should not and \nwill not go unrecognized. I salute Mr. Weinroth for his courage and \nperseverance in the face of extreme hardship.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5853-3", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5854-S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 609 to Amendment No. 603\n (Purpose: To provide for full compensation for noneconomic losses in \n                             civil actions)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of \nthe Senator from Maine, No. 608, be set aside so that I may offer an \namendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 609 to amendment No. 603:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . FAIR COMPENSATION FOR NONECONOMIC LOSSES AND \n                   PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Full Compensation for Noneconomic Losses. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an attorney \n     who represents, on a contingency fee basis, a claimant in a \n     civil action in a Federal or State court may not charge, \n     demand, receive, or collect for services rendered in \n     connection with such action on any amount recovered by \n     judgment or settlement under such action for noneconomic \n     losses in excess of 25 percent of the first $250,000 (or \n     portion thereof) recovered, based on after-tax recovery.\n       (b) Attorney Fees for Punitive Damages.--With respect to \n     any award or settlement for punitive damages, an attorney's \n     fee, if any, received by an attorney who represents, on a \n     contingency fee basis, a claimant in a civil action in a \n     Federal or State court shall be established by the court \n     based on the work performed by the attorney, and shall be \n     ethical and reasonable. It shall be a rebuttable presumption \n     that an ethical and reasonable attorney's fee in such an \n     action is 25 percent of such award for punitive damages.\n       (c) Contingency Fee Defined.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``contingency fee'' means any fee for professional legal \n     services which is, in whole or in part, contingent upon the \n     recovery of any amount of losses or damages, whether through \n     judgment or settlement.\n\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to address the question of medical \nmalpractice concerns, and I believe I speak for many Senators in \nexpressing the strong hope that those States that have addressed this \nquestion will not have their limitations and their efforts to address \nthis question overruled or overturned.\n  In 1986, Colorado enacted, or expanded, the following general tort \nreforms:\n  Certificate of merit--Requiring a certificate of merit to be filed at \nbeginning of case that the plaintiff's attorney has consulted with a \nqualified expert who based on review of the facts find that the claim \nhas merit or ``does not lack substantial justification.''\n  Noneconomic damages limit--Limiting noneconomic damages, for pain and \nsuffering, loss of consortium, and so forth, to $250,000. Colorado does \nallow a court to find ``clear and convincing evidence'' to justify an \nincrease from $250,000 to a maximum of $500,000.\n  Collateral source--Reducing any damage award by the amount of payment \nby any collateral source which partially or wholly indemnifies or \ncompensates the injured party for their injury. If the injured party \npurchased the coverage, the reduction is not made, for example personal \ndisability insurance.\n  Punitive damage limit--Limiting punitive damages to equal actual \ndamages--1 to 1 ratio between compensatory damages and punitive \ndamages--but allowing the court to increase this to 3 times the \ncompensatory damages for continued egregious behavior during pendency \nof the action. Evidence of the income or net worth of the defendant is \nnot admissable.\n  Elimination of joint liability--Generally, Colorado eliminated joint \nliability for tort damages and further enhanced Colorado's comparative \nnegligence system by which defendants are liable only for their pro-\nrata share of damages if the defendant's share is more than that due to \nthe plaintiff's contributory negligence.\n  Good samaritan liability--Licensed physicians who render emergency \nassistance are not liable to a person injured unless they were grossly \nnegligent or their conduct was willful and wanton.\n  Volunteer and nonprofit liability--Generally exempting volunteers and \nnonprofit organizations from liability, except for willful and wanton \nmisconduct or from liability in an automobile accident to the extent of \ninsurance coverage under the Colorado No-Fault law.\n  In 1988, Colorado expanded upon these reform with the Health Care \nAvailability Act. Colorado enacted these reforms to ensure the \ncontinued availability of health care, particularly prenatal and \nobstetrical care, in Colorado. In 1988, facing rapidly escalating \nmalpractice premiums, many doctors were quitting or limiting their \npractices and Coloradoans, particularly in our rural areas, were facing \nreduced choice and availability in health care.\n  Under the Colorado Health Care Availability Act, these additional \ntort reforms were enacted for medical malpractice actions:\n  Periodic payment of judgments--Requires payment of future damages in \nexcess of $150,000 by periodic payment.\n  A cap of $1 million on damages--Generally, Colorado now limits \ndamages in a medical malpractice action to a present value of $1 \nmillion, inclusive of the $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages. In \nimposing the cap, the Colorado legislature made sure that money would \nbe available to injured persons by imposing mandatory malpractice \ninsurance coverage on doctors and hospitals.\n  Voluntary pre-treatment arbitration agreements--Allows a provider and \npatient to enter an agreement to arbitrate any dispute over the care \nbefore the care is rendered. The Health Care Availability Act sets \nforth several patient protections in regard to such agreements.\n  Qualifications of expert witnesses--Generally, the act requires that \nexpert witnesses in a medical malpractice action be licensed in the \nsame medical specialty as the defendant and familiar with the \napplicable standards of care at the time of the injury.\n  Punitive damages--Punitive damages against a health care provider \ncannot be claimed until after the substantial completion of discovery \nand the plaintiff can establish prima facie proof of fraud, malice or \nwillful and wanton conduct.\n  Statutes of limitation--The general statute of limitations in \nColorado for medical malpractice actions is 2 years from the date of \ninjury, or the date the injury and its cause should reasonably have \nbeen known. The Health Care Availability Act reinstituted a ``statute \nof repose'' which bars any action for medical malpractice being brought \nmore than 3 years after the date of treatment.\n  In 1991, the Colorado Supreme Court reviewed and upheld the \nconstitutionality of these reforms in 1991.\n  The reforms have had their intended effect. Malpractice insurance \npremiums for most Colorado physicians have been reduced substantially, \nby 53 percent. For the average Colorado physician, their malpractice \npremiums \n[[Page S5855]] were $18,609 in 1986. In 1994, the premiums were reduced \nto $8,816. For obstetricians in Colorado, the tort reforms reduced \nmalpractice premiums by over $30,000. In 1986, their premiums were an \nastronomical $62,584, last year they were $31,029. This is $30,000 of \noverhead that the Colorado OB/GYN's now don't have to cover and it \nallows them to continue providing health care, and delivering babies, \nin Colorado.\n  Colorado is only one of several States that have enacted health care \nliability reforms. California was the first, or one of the first, with \nthe Medical Injury Compensation Act of 1975. Indiana adopted some other \ndifferent reforms including a patient-victim compensation fund. \nColorado followed the California model in 1988.\n  Overall: 22 States have enacted limits for damages for pain and \nsuffering; 28 States have either mandatory or discretionary collateral \nsource rules; at least 14 States require periodic payment of large \ndamage awards and 16 States give the option to the court; 15 or so \nStates have adopted medical malpractice arbitration provisions; some 30 \nStates restrict punitive damages, and around 33 have revised or \nabolished joint and several liability.\n  It is most important to Colorado, and other States which have enacted \nthem, to get to keep their tort reforms. We can establish a Federal \nstandard in these areas, but States which have enacted more stringent \nreforms should not be pre-empted by Federal law.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment allows States to keep their reforms. \nMost importantly, the McConnell amendment would allow Colorado to keep \nits $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages and $1 million cap on health \ncare liability damages and numerous of the procedural reforms. However, \nthe McConnell amendment would impose new requirements in Colorado in \nthe area of limitations on attorneys fees, and may impose additional \nlimitations on punitive damages. Where Colorado has acted to impose \ngreater limitations they are allowed to keep them, but where Colorado \nlaws are not as stringent they must follow Federal law.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank you and I want to thank the other \nMembers of the body.\n  But I want to make this message clear. What we are talking about is \nnot simply an arbitrary or theoretical exercise in trying to address \nthe medical malpractice question. What we are talking about is an \neffort that can lead to significant drops in medical malpractice \ninsurance. We are talking about something that will dramatically reduce \nthe overhead of health care providers. We are talking about something \nthat can have a very significant change in what consumers pay.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would now like to discuss the amendment \nwhich I have just a moment ago offered, an amendment which will \ncomplement what the Senator from Colorado has just spoken of by helping \nto get health care costs under control, but, more importantly, to put a \nbetter balance into the awards that are received in cases where today \nthe attorney is taking too much of that award and the victim is \nreceiving too little of it.\n  My amendment is an amendment which provides some very modest \nlimitations on attorneys' fees in the kinds of cases in which very \nlarge awards have sometimes been granted and where, by virtue of the \nfact that the attorneys are awarded a contingent fee or have arranged \nfor a contingent fee contract, they receive a percentage of that award.\n  It is common in cases of this kind for the percentage to be at least \none-third and frequently 50 percent, sometimes even more, of the \nrecovery. That means that if a plaintiff in a case receives $100,000 in \nan award, the attorney is likely to receive somewhere between $30,000, \n$40,000, $50,000, leaving the plaintiff with frequently about half of \nwhat is recovered.\n  There are some statistics in this regard which I would like to refer \nto which indicate that actually the percentage that the attorneys' fees \nare taking is even greater. When you add the other administrative fees \nof the court and so on, you end up with a situation in which the \nvictims frequently get less than half the award the jury thinks they \nare receiving.\n  This bill will, I hope, reform a situation that the Wall Street \nJournal wrote of in an article recently--March 12, specifically--noting \nthat the result is that fees paid to plaintiffs' lawyers can range from \n$1,000 to $25,000 per hour--Mr. President, per hour. Twenty-five \nthousand dollars is more than a lot of Americans make in an entire year \nand yet, as the article notes, some lawyers have made that much per \nhour spent on a case. That is what we are trying to avoid with this \namendment.\n  A recent Department of Commerce report stated that 40 cents of each \ndollar expended in litigation is paid in attorneys' fees. A 1994 study \nby the Hudson Institute found that 50 cents out of each litigation \ndollar went to attorneys' fees.\n  So you see, Mr. President, the notion that these attorneys' fees, \ncontingency contracts, or agreements result in almost half, sometimes \nmore than half, of the award going to the attorney are borne out by the \nstudies that have been performed professionally on this matter. And \nthat is what we are trying to change here.\n  I think, really, Mr. President, for our tort system to retain, or to \nregain, really, credibility as a fair and equitable dispute-resolution \nsystem, it has to be more efficient, less litigious, and we have to \nensure that a larger portion of the judgment awards actually goes to \nthe claimants rather than to the attorneys.\n  Now, some will say when I describe this amendment in just a moment \nthat this is not really much of a limit on attorneys' fees. Those who \nlike to bash lawyers will say you really have not limited them.\n  My effort here is not to punish lawyers, but it is to try to ensure \nthat more of the money that the jury awards goes into the pocket of the \nclaimant. As I said, today the typical fee is at least a third, \nfrequently at least 50 percent.\n  I would like now to describe the three different kinds of awards that \nmight be granted in a case and indicate what the percentage in each \ncase would be under the underlying bill and under my amendment.\n  Under the McConnell amendment, which is essentially pending before us \nhere, the award is limited in a health care liability case, typical \nmedical malpractice case, to one-third of the first $150,000, and 25 \npercent of any amount in excess of $150,000. So on the first $150,000 \nyou get a third and on anything greater than that you get 25 percent.\n  Now this guarantees, Mr. President, that there is an adequate \nincentive for an attorney to take a small case, because for the \neconomic damages--these are damages that repay the doctor, the \nhospital, and so on and also provides for compensation for any economic \nlosses, time loss from work, inability to perform work in the future \nand so on--it guarantees that the attorney is going to get a third of \nthe first $150,000 and 25 percent of everything thereafter. So there is \nadequate compensation for a lawyer to take even a relatively small \ncase.\n  But cases usually involve another element of damages called \nnoneconomic damages. And these are the so-called pain and suffering \ndamages. So that after a person has been compensated for the out-of-\npocket expenses to the hospitals and to the physicians and so on and \nfor any lost wages and future lost economic earning power, juries also \nfrequently--in serious cases virtually always--award the claimant a sum \nof money representing the pain and suffering that that claimant \nsuffered; the hurt, the anguish, the pain.\n  That award is frequently a multiple of the economic damages. So in \nmany case, most cases, it exceeds the economic damages.\n  What my amendment says is that the attorneys' fees should be limited \nto 25 percent of that award up to $250,000. So, in the case of the \nMcConnell amendment, added onto the Kyl amendment on attorneys' fees, \nyou would have essentially either 25 percent or 33 percent as the \nlimitation.\n  Now, as I say, compared to 50 percent, some people will say, ``Well, \nyou haven't really gone down all that much.'' But since some of the \nvery high awards are in excess of $250,000, we \n[[Page S5856]] have denied the attorneys their windfall, their lottery \naward. They are going to get plenty up to the $250,000, but what they \nwill not get is that big bonanza, the jackpot, where they convince the \njury that there is such an egregious situation here that the claimant \ngets, let us say $1 million, and the lawyer then is going to get at \nleast a half a million. No. The claimant in this case would get the \nbulk of that $1 million, if that is the amount that is awarded.\n  So what we are saying here is that the lawyer is going to be limited \nbut guaranteed, in effect, a percentage of both the economic damages \nand noneconomic damages, if they are otherwise awardable. They just \ncannot exceed either 33 percent or 25 percent.\n  In the case of the noneconomic damages, the pain and suffering \ndamages, they cannot exceed 25 percent of the first $250,000, or in \nother words, $62,500.\n  Now in some cases, Mr. President, there is a third kind of award and \nit is punitive damages. There have been several statements made about \npunitive damages and ways to limit punitive damages. These are the \ndamages not intended to compensate the victim but rather to punish the \ndefendant for wrong conduct, conduct that is very wrong, that is \nwillful or malicious, is in great disregard of the rights of the public \nand intended to cause a defendant never to do it again or, in the case \nof a defective product, for example, to fix that product and never \nallow a defective product again to hit the market.\n  In those cases, there are limits in the underlying bill on the amount \nof punitive damages that can be collected. Under the McConnell \namendment, the total award for punitive damages in the medical \nmalpractice kind of case is either $250,000 or three times the economic \ndamages, whichever is greater. The Snowe amendment, which has been \npresented just before my comments, would limit the total award for \npunitive damages in these cases to two times compensatory damages, \nwhich is the sum of the economic and noneconomic damages. In either \ncase, there is some limit on the amount of punitive damages.\n  The question is, should attorneys receive any percentage of that as \nwell? And what my amendment says is that if the attorney believes that \nhe or she is entitled to a percentage of the punitive damages awards in \naddition to the other two kinds of awards, that attorney may petition \nthe court and the court may grant reasonable and ethical attorneys' \nfees based upon the amount of time that the attorney has put into the \ncase.\n  There is a presumption that 25 percent is reasonable. So, here again, \nthe attorney can petition the court, can get at least 25 percent. A \ncourt may even deem that a larger amount would be warranted. But, in \nany event, it has to be reasonable and ethical and based upon the \namount of work that the attorney put in.\n  So, as I say, Mr. President, some people will say, ``Well, this is \nnot much of a limitation. You haven't whacked the attorneys. You \nhaven't cut them out of all of their awards,'' and so on. And we have \nnot.\n  The reason we are offering the amendment this way is to guarantee \nthat people who have a good case can get a lawyer to take their case, \nand with these limitations they can clearly get the lawyers to take \ntheir case.\n  But what it prevents is the situation where the lawyer gets the bulk \nof the recovery and, in the case of the very large award, hits the \njackpot, gets the big bonanza, in effect.\n  The objectives of the overall legislation, Mr. President, are, first \nof all, to ensure that people can be compensated in our tort system. \nThis bill helps to guarantee that result.\n  We need incentives for lawyers to take these kinds of cases which \nfrequently the plaintiff cannot pay for by the hourly rate or money up \nfront to the lawyer, so there has to be a contingency fee. We provide \nfor that.\n  We need to ensure that in the case of the economic damages, the \nlawyer is limited in how much of those economic damages can be \nrecovered as attorney's fees. That is limited in the underlying bill.\n  We are saying that with respect to the pain and suffering damages, \nmost of that ought to go to the victim. Seventy-five percent of it \nought to go to the victim, the claimant, the plaintiff. But, again, we \nallow up to $250,000 of noneconomic damages, the recovery of 25 percent \nof that amount by the attorney and, as I said, in punitive damages, the \nopportunity to collect fees there, as well.\n  So the real question is whether lawyers should be getting 50 percent, \nor somewhere between 25 and 33 percent. And I think, Mr. President, \nthat this body will agree that placing some cap, some limit, is \ndesirable and that it will help us to avoid the situation that causes a \ngreat deal of public anger, frankly, with our litigation process.\n  Ironically, I think we might even help the legal profession, which is \nbeing greatly criticized by the public in public opinion surveys these \ndays primarily because of their fees. There is a Hudson Institute study \nwhich notes that there has been a doubling of negative attitudes toward \nlawyers since 1986 and that exorbitant attorney's fees are a major \nfactor in this increase in the public's ill will for lawyers.\n  Ironically, we may even be helping the legal profession, and that is \nnot all bad, either. We will be debating this amendment, and others, on \nMonday next, and I hope very much that all of the Members of the Senate \nwill reflect on how this amendment, narrow that it is, will improve the \nbill, will improve the McConnell amendment, and will improve the \npending amendment before the body and, as I said, allow the victims to \nrecover more of what the juries award to them.\n  Mr. President, I will debate and present further arguments with \nrespect to this matter on Monday. At this time, I would like to make a \nclosing statement on behalf of the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/04/27/senate-section/article/S5854-1", "month": "04", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 1, 1995\n\n  Mr. KYL.
